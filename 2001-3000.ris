AB  - Pain is a universal, multidimensional experience with sensory, emotional, cognitive, and social components, which is fundamental to our environmental learning when functioning typically. Understanding pain processing in psychiatric conditions could provide unique insight into the underlying pathophysiology or psychiatric disease, especially given the psychobiological overlap with pain processing pathways. Studying pain in psychiatric conditions is likely to provide important insights, yet, there is a limited understanding beyond the work in depression and anxiety. This is a missed opportunity to describe psychiatric conditions in terms of neurobiological alterations. To examine the research into the pain experiences of these groups and the extent to which a-typicality is present, a systematic review was conducted. An electronic search strategy was developed and conducted in several databases. The current systematic review included 46 studies covering five Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) disorders: autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, personality disorder, and eating disorders, confirming tentative evidence of altered pain and touch processing. Specifically, hyposensitivity is reported in schizophrenia, personality disorder and eating disorder, hypersensitivity in ADHD, and mixed results for autism. Review of the research highlights a degree of methodological inconsistency in the utilization of comprehensive protocols, the lack of which fails to allow us to understand whether a-typicality is systemic or modality specific.

AB  - Aim The first episode of psychosis is a challenging time for both patients and those who care for them. Although literature on treatment is plentiful, literature on how to best support caregivers is more scarce. This review was undertaken to better understand the caregiver experience, determine which interventions most effectively alleviate their burden and examine which other factors may affect outcomes. Methods Articles were retrieved from PubMed and OVID using the following search terms: first episode psychosis (FEP), schizophrenia, caregiver, intervention and burden in various combinations. Only peer-reviewed articles germane to FEP caregiver experience and interventions written in English were included. Results Caregivers can experience grief, guilt and anxiety during this time. While concerned for their loved one, their own lives take a back seat and their mental and physical health are adversely affected. Some are better prepared to cope and are typically warm, decisive, confident and optimistic. Their families are organized and flexible. Others are less prepared and are more likely to have poor self-esteem, use avoidant coping strategies and be overly critical. Their families are controlling and have difficulty with communication and balance. These caregivers stand to benefit most from interventions. Conclusions Effective interventions incorporate psychoeducation, problem solving strategies, peer support and clinician guidance. A higher level of interaction with facilitators and peers is associated with better results. Benefits include decreases in caregiver burden, depressive and anxious symptoms and feelings of shame and isolation. Although the literature has yet to isolate the key factors of a successful intervention, this review provides practical suggestions for clinicians and further illustrates the need for more research.

KW  - Nepal
KW  - PREVALENCE
AB  - Introduction: Globally, 10-20% of children and adolescents suffer from mental disorders, with half of all them starting by the age of 14 and three-quarters before the age of 25. In Nepal, 40% of the population is younger than 18 years of age, and as such there is a large proportion of the population that is at risk of developing a mental disorder. There has been a recent recognition of child and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal, although prior to this it had remained almost invisible on the health agenda. In response to growing concern, there is a need to conduct a review on children and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal.
   Objective: To review the existing studies on child and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal.
   Methodology: A scoping review approach was used to identify studies on child and adolescent mental problems in Nepal. A search of Medline and PubMed databases for articles published from the database inception to August 2018 was conducted.
   Results: Ten papers were identified, and they all together included 7876 participants. Two studies reported on Post traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) and described a prevalence of 10.7% to 51% of earthquake-affected children and adolescents in the Kathmandu district of Nepal. Another study reported that 53.2% of former child soldiers met the cut-off score for PTSS. Two school surveys found that the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems in school children ranged between 12.9 and 17.03%, whereas a study on emotional and behavioural disorders in homeless children reported a prevalence of 28.6%. The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was estimated to be as high as three in every 1000 persons in Nepal by one study. The clinical prevalence of anxiety disorders was reported ranging from 18.8% to 24.4% while that of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was 10-11.7% in various clinical samples of children and adolescents.
   Conclusion: Only a few studies on the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health in Nepal have been conducted. Clearly, there is a need for better study design and larger studies to understand more fully the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health disorders in Nepal, in order to adequately plan public health services accordingly.

AB  - Objective: Adult research investigating the link between alexithymia and medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) has found a significant relationship between increased alexithymia and MUS. This difficulty in expressing emotions is likely to begin in childhood so the objective of this paper is to present a quantitative review of studies focussing on the association between MUS and alexithymia in children.
   Methods: Databases were searched with predefined terms relating to alexithymia and MUS in children (0-17 years). Two reviewers independently assessed abstracts, extracted data and undertook quality analyses. Systematic review methods were used in accordance with Cochrane guidelines.
   Results: Ten studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Seven of the eight studies which focused on a comparison between children with MUS and healthy controls, found higher levels of self-reported alexithymia in the children with MUS. However, in the two studies where children were asked to complete tasks that objectively measure alexithymia, significant differences were not found. Results of studies comparing alexithymia in children with MUS and children with medical/psychiatric controls were inconsistent; there was some evidence of increased anxiety and depression in young people with alexithymia and MUS but inconsistency of measures across studies makes drawing conclusions difficult.
   Conclusion: There is preliminary evidence that children with MUS have significantly higher levels of alexithymia than controls based on self-report measures; however, this finding was not replicated in objective tasks of alexithymia. Future studies should include validated tasks that objectively measure emotion recognition abilities and focus on possible mediating factors such as neurodevelopmental and mental health difficulties.

AB  - BackgroundMeta-analyses of youth mass trauma intervention studies have focused primarily on posttraumatic stress even though depression and anxiety are common maladaptive outcomes that require intervention.ObjectiveThis meta-analysis examined youth mass trauma intervention effects on depression and anxiety relative to natural recovery and characteristics of the event, context, population, intervention, and intervention delivery that may have moderated these effects.MethodA literature search identified 21 studies investigating the effectiveness of 24 randomized controlled trials with inactive controls (21 trials examined depression and 8 examined anxiety; 5 examined both). Intervention effects were computed as Hedge's g estimates and combined using random effects models. Moderator analysis computed intervention effect sizes across selected covariates.ResultsThe summary intervention effect was not significant for either depression or anxiety. There were statistically significant effects for depression with interventions delivered following a natural disaster (g=0.40; p=0.0192) or in a high income country (g=0.30; p=0.0253) and with non-trauma-focused interventions (g=0.29; p=0.0155) and those delivered in more than eight sessions (g=0.23; p=0.0416). The effect for anxiety symptoms was significant only with non-trauma-focused interventions (g=0.83; p=0.0428).ConclusionsGiven the prevalence of depression and anxiety post event, greater attention is warranted to develop and maximize the benefit of interventions for these outcomes. The findings suggest that trauma-focused interventions may need to be augmented with specific components directed at depression and/or anxiety.

AB  - Anxiety, although as common and arguably as debilitating as depression, has garnered less attention, and is often undetected and undertreated in the general population. Similarly, anxiety among medical students warrants greater attention due to its significant implications. We aimed to study the global prevalence of anxiety among medical students and the associated factors predisposing medical students to anxiety. In February 2019, we carried out a systematic search for cross-sectional studies that examined the prevalence of anxiety among medical students. We computed the aggregate prevalence and pooled odds ratio (OR) using the random-effects model and used meta-regression analyses to explore the sources of heterogeneity. We pooled and analyzed data from sixty-nine studies comprising 40,348 medical students. The global prevalence rate of anxiety among medical students was 33.8% (95% Confidence Interval: 29.2-38.7%). Anxiety was most prevalent among medical students from the Middle East and Asia. Subgroup analyses by gender and year of study found no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of anxiety. About one in three medical students globally have anxiety-a prevalence rate which is substantially higher than the general population. Administrators and leaders of medical schools should take the lead in destigmatizing mental illnesses and promoting help-seeking behaviors when students are stressed and anxious. Further research is needed to identify risk factors of anxiety unique to medical students.

AB  - Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) aims to elucidate mechanisms by which the immune system can influence behavior. Given the complexity of the brain, studies using inbred rodents have shed critical insight into the presumed vagaries of the human condition. This is particularly true for stress modeling where adverse stimuli, conditions and/or interactions elicit patterned behavioral reactions that can translate across species. As example, sickness behaviors are as easily recognized in mice as they are in humans, and a family pet. Recently, nutrition has gained prominence as a regulator of brain function. Once perceived as mostly a peripheral player, except when manifest at extremes such as starvation or gluttony, nutritional and/or metabolic stress is now recognized as a worrisome contributor to poor mental health especially in those who suffer from food insecurity or overnutrition. In this review, we will explore emerging areas of rodent research that demonstrate the impact of nutritional status on the stressed brain. Our overall goal is to implicate inflammasome activation as a critical convergence point for stress and nutritional dysregulation. In doing so, we will present results from studies focused on macronutrient, micronutrient and dietary bioactives so as to encourage innovative investigation into the emerging field of nutritional PNI.

AB  - Aims. In the past few years, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of forcibly displaced migrants worldwide, of which a substantial proportion is refugees and asylum seekers. Refugees and asylum seekers may experience high levels of psychological distress, and show high rates of mental health conditions. It is therefore timely and particularly relevant to assess whether current evidence supports the provision of psychosocial interventions for this population. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and acceptability of psychosocial interventions compared with control conditions (treatment as usual/no treatment, waiting list, psychological placebo) aimed at reducing mental health problems in distressed refugees and asylum seekers.
   Methods. We used Cochrane procedures for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs. We searched for published and unpublished RCTs assessing the efficacy and acceptability of psychosocial interventions in adults and children asylum seekers and refugees with psychological distress. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive and anxiety symptoms at post-intervention were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include: PTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms at follow-up, functioning, quality of life and dropouts due to any reason.
   Results. We included 26 studies with 1959 participants. Meta-analysis of RCTs revealed that psychosocial interventions have a clinically significant beneficial effect on PTSD (standardised mean difference [SMD] = -0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.01 to -0.41; I-2 = 83%; 95% CI 78-88; 20 studies, 1370 participants; moderate quality evidence), depression (SMD = -1.02; 95% CI -1.52 to -0.51; I-2 = 89%; 95% CI 82-93; 12 studies, 844 participants; moderate quality evidence) and anxiety outcomes (SMD = -1.05; 95% CI - 1.55 to -0.56; I-2 = 87%; 95% CI 79-92; 11 studies, 815 participants; moderate quality evidence). This beneficial effect was maintained at 1 month or longer follow-up, which is extremely important for populations exposed to ongoing post-migration stressors. For the other secondary outcomes, we identified a non-significant trend in favour of psychosocial interventions. Most evidence supported interventions based on cognitive behavioural therapies with a trauma-focused component. Limitations of this review include the limited number of studies collected, with a relatively low total number of participants, and the limited available data for positive outcomes like functioning and quality of life.
   Conclusions. Considering the epidemiological relevance of psychological distress and mental health conditions in refugees and asylum seekers, and in view of the existing data on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions, these interventions should be routinely made available as part of the health care of distressed refugees and asylum seekers. Evidence-based guidelines and implementation packages should be developed accordingly.

AB  - Civilian war trauma and torture rank among the most traumatic life experiences; exposure to such experiences is pervasive in nations experiencing both internal and external conflict. This has led to a high volume of refugees resettling throughout the world with mental health needs that primary care physicians may not be screening for and prepared to effectively address. In this article, we review the literature on demographics, predictors, mental health outcomes of torture, and integrated care for the mental health needs of refugees. We searched PubMed and PSYCINFO databases for original research articles on refugees and mental health published in the English language between 2010 and present. Nine percent of 720 adults in conflict areas in Nepal, with predominance of literate married males, met the threshold for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), 27.5% for depression, and 22.9% for anxiety. While, PTSD rate has been documented as high as 88.3% among torture survivors from Middle East (ME), Central Africa (CA), South Asia (SA), Southeast Europe (SE). Depression was recorded as high as 94.7% among 131 African torture survivors and anxiety as high as 91% among 55 South African torture survivors. Torture severity, post-migration difficulties, and wait time to receive clinical services were significantly associated with higher rate of mental health symptoms. Mental health screening is not a standard component of initial physical exams for refugees, yet these individuals have had high trauma exposure that should inform clinical care. Integrated care models are lacking but would greatly benefit this community to prevent progression to greater severity of mental health symptoms.

AB  - Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) has existed for 20 years and there are now several controlled trials for a range of problems. In this paper, we focused on recent meta-analytic reviews of the literature and found moderate to large effects reported for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depression. In total, we reviewed 9 recent meta-analytic reviews out of a total of 618 meta-analytic reviews identified using our search terms. In these selected reviews, 166 studies were included, including overlap in reviews on similar conditions. We also covered a recent review on transdiagnostic treatments and 2 reviews on face-to-face v. internet treatment. The growing number of meta-analytic reviews of studies now suggests that ICBT works and can be as effective as face-to-face therapy.

AB  - Background The employment of clinical databases in the study of mental disorders is essential to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with mental illness. While text corpora obtain merely limited information of content, speech corpora capture tones, emotions, rhythms and many other signals beyond content. Hence, the design and development of speech corpora for patients with mental disorders is increasingly important. Aim This review aims to extract the existing speech corpora for mental disorders from online databases and peer-reviewed journals in order to demonstrate both achievements and challenges in this area. Methods The review first covers publications or resources worldwide, and then leads to the reports from China, followed by a comparison between Chinese and non-Chinese regions. Results Most of the speech databases were recorded in Europe or the United States by audio or video. Some were even supplemented by brain images and Event-Related Potential (ERP) statistics. The corpora were mostly developed for patients with neurocognitive disorders like stutter and aphasia, and mental illness like dementia, while other types of mental illness such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression and autism were scarce in number in database development. Strengths and limitations The results demonstrated that database development of neurocognitive disorders in China is much scarcer than that in some European countries, but the existing databases pave an instructive road for psychiatric problems. Also, the methods and applications of databases from the leading countries are inspiring for Chinese scholars, who are searching methods for developing a comprehensive resource for clinical studies.

AB  - Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is an internationally used, evidence-based psychosocial intervention for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. The present review thus aimed specifically to examine the reliability of the findings and the strength of the evidence obtained in studies on the CST protocol concerning any benefit in terms of cognitive functioning, perceived quality of life, psychological, behavioral, and everyday life functioning of people with dementia, and their family caregivers' health status, quality of life, and burden of care. A systematic literature search on studies specifically adopting the CST protocol in patients with mild-to-moderate DSM-IV dementia - eventually involving their family members - was performed. A total of 238 papers were screened and 12 finally included in the qualitative analysis after inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied. The Jadad Scale and the Stroke Prevention and Educational Awareness Diffusion (SPREAD) method were used to appraise the studies' methodological quality. Moderate levels of evidence emerged for general cognitive functioning, language comprehension and production, and quality of life. The levels of evidence were weaker for short-term memory, orientation, praxis, depression, social and emotional loneliness, behavior, and communication in people with dementia, and for their caregivers' health status and anxiety symptoms. Albeit with the limited quality of reviewed evidence, and the need for more studies on CST, the present review highlights the value of this program as part of dementia care services to sustain the cognitive functioning and quality of life of people with dementia.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this review was to explore the current evidence for conversational agents or chatbots in the field of psychiatry and their role in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses. Methods: A systematic literature search in June 2018 was conducted in PubMed, EmBase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included that involved a chatbot in a mental health setting focusing on populations with or at high risk of developing depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, and substance abuse disorders. Results: From the selected databases, 1466 records were retrieved and 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were included from reference list screening for a total of 10 included studies. Overall, potential for conversational agents in psychiatric use was reported to be high across all studies. In particular, conversational agents showed potential for benefit in psychoeducation and self-adherence. In addition, satisfaction rating of chatbots was high across all studies, suggesting that they would be an effective and enjoyable tool in psychiatric treatment. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence for psychiatric use of chatbots is favourable. However, given the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies, further research with standardized outcomes reporting is required to more thoroughly examine the effectiveness of conversational agents. Regardless, early evidence shows that with the proper approach and research, the mental health field could use conversational agents in psychiatric treatment.

AB  - Background: Moral injury (MI) involves distress over having transgressed or violated core moral boundaries, accompanied by feelings of guilt, shame, self-condemnation, loss of trust, loss of meaning, and spiritual struggles. MI is often found in Veterans and Active Duty Military personnel with posttraumatic stress disorder (1-9 SD). MI is widespread among those with PTSD symptoms adversely affects mental health, and may increase risk of suicide; however, MI is often ignored and neglected by mental health professionals who focus their attention on PTSD only.
   Methods: A review of the literature between 1980 and 2018 conducted in 2018 is presented here to identify scales used to assess MI. Databases used in this review were Psychlnfo, PubMed (Medline), and Google Scholar. Search terms were "moral injury," "measuring," "screening," "Veterans," and "Active Duty Military." Inclusion criteria were quantitative measurement of MI and health outcomes, Veteran or Active Duty Military status, and peer-review publication. Excluded were literature reviews, dissertations, book chapters, case reports, and qualitative studies.
   Results: Of the 730 studies identified, most did not meet eligibility criteria, leaving 118 full text articles that were reviewed, of which 42 did not meet eligibility criteria. Of the remaining 76 studies, 34 were duplicates leaving 42 studies, most published in 2013 or later. Of 22 studies that assessed MI, five used scales assessing multiple dimensions, and 17 assessed only one or two aspects (e.g., guilt, shame, or forgiveness). The remaining 20 studies used one of the scales reported in the first 22. Of the five scales assessing multiple dimensions of MI, two assess both morally injurious events and symptoms and the remaining three assess symptoms only. All studies were cross-sectional, except three that tested interventions.
   Conclusions: MI in the military setting is widespread and associated with PTSD symptom severity, anxiety, depression, and risk of suicide in current or former military personnel. Numerous measures exist to assess various dimensions of MI, including five multidimensional scales, although future research is needed to identify cutoff scores and clinically significant change scores. Three multidimensional measures assess MI symptoms alone (not events) and may be useful for determining if treatments directed at MI may both reduce symptoms and impact other mental health outcomes including PTSD.

AB  - Background: The psychological well-being of parents and children is compromised in families characterized by greater parenting stress. As parental mindfulness is associated with lower parenting stress, a growing number of studies have investigated whether mindfulness interventions can improve outcomes for families. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions for parents, in reducing parenting stress and improving youth psychological outcomes.
   Methods: A literature search for peer-reviewed articles and dissertations was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines in the PsycInfo, Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses databases. Studies were included if they reported on a mindfulness-based intervention delivered in person to parents with the primary aim of reducing parenting stress or improving youth psychological outcomes.
   Results: Twenty-five independent studies were included in the review. Eighteen studies used a single group design and six were randomized controlled trials. Within-groups, meta-analysis indicated a small, post-intervention reduction in parenting stress (g = 0.34), growing to a moderate reduction at 2 month follow-up (g = 0.53). Overall, there was a small improvement in youth outcomes (g = 0.27). Neither youth age or clinical status, nor time in mindfulness training, moderated parenting stress or overall youth outcome effects. Youth outcomes were not moderated by intervention group attendees. Change in parenting stress predicted change in youth externalizing and cognitive effects, but not internalizing effects. In controlled studies, parenting stress reduced more in mindfulness groups than control groups (g = 0.44). Overall, risk of bias was assessed as serious.
   Conclusions: Mindfulness interventions for parents may reduce parenting stress and improve youth psychological functioning. While improvements in youth externalizing and cognitive outcomes may be explained by reductions in parenting stress, it appears that other parenting factors may contribute to improvements in youth internalizing outcomes. Methodological weaknesses in the reviewed literature prevent firm conclusions from being drawn regarding effectiveness. Future research should address these methodological issues before mindfulness interventions for parents are recommended as an effective treatment option for parents or their children.

AB  - Objectives Mental health disorders are highly prevalent among university students. Universities could be an optimal setting to provide evidence-based care through the Internet. As part of the World Mental Health International College Student initiative, this systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data on the efficacy of Internet-based interventions for university students' mental health. Method A systematic literature search of bibliographical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) for randomized trials examining psychological interventions for the mental health (depression, anxiety, stress, sleep problems, and eating disorder symptoms), well-being, and functioning of university students was performed through April 30, 2018. Results Forty-eight studies were included. Twenty-three studies (48%) were rated to have low risk of bias. Small intervention effects were found on depression (g = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.08, 0.27]), anxiety (g = 0.27, 95% CI [0.13, 0.40]), and stress (g = 0.20, 95% CI [0.02, 0.38]). Moderate effects were found on eating disorder symptoms (g = 0.52, 95% CI [0.22-0.83]) and role functioning (g = 0.41, 95% CI [0.26, 0.56]). Effects on well-being were non-significant (g = 0.15, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.50]). Heterogeneity was moderate to substantial in many analyses. After adjusting for publication bias, effects on anxiety were not significant anymore. Discussion Internet interventions for university students' mental health can have significant small-to-moderate effects on a range of conditions. However, more research is needed to determine student subsets for which Internet-based interventions are most effective and to explore ways to increase treatment effectiveness.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewThe aim of this review was to focus solely on youths' behavioral responses to natural disasters and political conflicts in order to fully understand their impact and scope.Recent FindingsRecent studies in the field of trauma have shown that theoretical conceptions have moved away from a narrow focus on the individual and towards wider ecological perspectives and from a narrow focus on negative responses to trauma exposure towards positive prosocial responses. Although there is a distinction between youths' behavioral responses towards natural disasters vs. towards political conflicts, in both of these adverse situations, behavioral responses exist alongside emotional responses.SummaryAdolescents exposed to either type of adverse scenario are often able to turn their negative experiences into positive ones, take greater responsibility for themselves and others, contribute to recovery processes, and engage in prosocial behaviors. These responses must be investigated in the context of the trauma field's recent understandings regarding psychological, biological, environmental, and cultural factors.

AB  - Background Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) affects 5%-6% of children. There is growing evidence that DCD is associated with greater levels of internalising symptoms (i.e. depression and anxiety). This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the magnitude of this effect, the quality of the evidence and potential moderators. Methods A systematic search was conducted to identify studies reporting a comparison between individuals with DCD/probable DCD and typically developing (TD) individuals on measures of internalising symptoms. A pooled effect size (Hedges g) was calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Study quality, publication bias and potential moderators of the effect were explored. Results Twenty studies, including a total of 23 subsamples, met the inclusion criteria, of which 22 subsamples were included in the meta-analysis (DCD: n = 1123; TD: n = 7346). A significant, moderate effect of DCD on internalising symptoms was found (g = 0.61). This effect remained robust after accounting for publication bias and excluding lower quality studies. The effect was significantly larger in studies utilising a cross-sectional design (vs. longitudinal), convenience sampling (vs. population screening) and a majority male sample. Conclusions The findings demonstrate that individuals with DCD experience greater levels of internalising symptoms than their peers. This highlights the importance of routine screening for emotional difficulties in DCD, raising awareness of the condition in mental health services and developing psychosocial interventions that extend beyond a focus on motor impairments. However, there is a need for higher quality, longitudinal studies to better understand the causal relationship between DCD and internalising symptoms.

AB  - Purpose Anxiety disorders are common. Prevalence is likely to be raised in people with hearing impairment, who experience higher rates of associated risk factors. We conducted, to our knowledge, the first systematic review of the prevalence and correlates of anxiety in people with hearing impairment.
   Methods We searched electronic databases and references of included studies, using predetermined criteria to retrieve original research reporting prevalence of anxiety disorders or symptoms in adult, hearing impaired populations. We assessed risk of bias using the adapted Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
   Results We included 25 studies evaluating 17,135 people with hearing impairment. Community studies of higher quality reported a lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorder of 11.1% (one study) and point prevalences of 15.4-31.3% for clinically significant anxiety symptoms (five studies) in people who predominantly had acquired hearing impairment. Anxiety prevalence was higher in hearing impaired people in 8/10 studies with a comparator non-hearing impaired group. Anxiety symptoms decreased after surgical intervention for hearing in all studies investigating this. Correlates consistently associated with anxiety were tinnitus and hearing impairment severity.
   Conclusions Prevalence of anxiety is higher among people with hearing impairment than the general population; our findings indicate that this excess morbidity may be related to the hearing impairment itself, as it was associated with the severity of impairment, and reduced after surgical treatment. Clinicians should be aware of the potential impact of hearing on mental health, and that where hearing ability can be improved, this may reduce anxiety.

AB  - Background Anxiety symptoms are common in mental diseases and a variety of physical disorders, especially in disorders related to stress. More and more basic studies have indicated that gut microbiota can regulate brain function through the gut-brain axis, and dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota was related to anxiety. However, there is no specific evidence to support treatment of anxiety by regulating intestinal microbiota.
   Aims To find evidence supporting improvement of anxiety symptoms by regulation of intestinal microbiota.
   Methods This systematic review of randomised controlled trials was searched based on the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, OVID, Web of Knowledge, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, VIP databases and SinoMed. The retrieval time dated back to 25 July 2018. Then we screened research literatures based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality evaluation for each included study was done using the Cochrane risk of bias and the Jadad scale.
   Results A total of 3334 articles were retrieved and 21 studies were included which contained 1503 subjects. In the 21 studies, 14 chose probiotics as interventions to regulate intestinal microbiota and six chose non-probiotic ways such as adjusting daily diets. Probiotic supplements in seven studies contained only one kind of probiotic, two studies used a product that contained two kinds of probiotics and the supplements used in the other five studies included at least three kinds of probiotics. In the studies that used treatment as usual plus interventions regulating intestinal flora (IRIF) as interventions (five studies), only non-probiotic ways were effective (two studies), which means 40% of studies were effective; in the studies that used IRIF alone (16 studies, 11 studies used probiotic ways and 5 studies used non-probiotic ways), 56% of studies could improve anxiety symptoms, and 80% of studies that conducted the non-probiotic interventions were effective, while 45% of studies that used probiotic supplementations had positive effects on anxiety symptoms. Overall, 11 studies showed a positive effect on anxiety symptoms by regulating intestinal microbiota, which indicated 52% of the 21 studies were effective, and there were five studies that used probiotic supplements as interventions and six used non-probiotic interventions. In addition, it should be noted that six of seven studies showed that regulation of intestinal microbiota could treat anxiety symptoms, the rate of efficacy was 86%.
   Conclusions We find that more than half of the studies included showed it was positive to treat anxiety symptoms by regulation of intestinal microbiota. There are two kinds of interventions (probiotic and non-probiotic interventions) to regulate intestinal microbiota, and it should be highlighted that the non-probiotic interventions were more effective than the probiotic interventions. More studies are needed to clarify this conclusion since we still cannot run meta-analysis so far.

AB  - Background: Perinatal mental health is a concern for women, families, communities and maternity care providers internationally. However, there is little understanding of poor perinatal maternal mental health and association with women's experiences of childbirth. Further understanding of psychosocial-spiritual experiences in childbirth and subsequent perinatal mental health is required. Aim: Systematically identify and synthesise the range of evidence available on psychosocial-spiritual experiences around childbirth and foreground possible associations with subsequent perinatal mental health outcomes. Method: Integrated analysis of a range of literature types was undertaken. A comprehensive search strategy was created, and nine databases were searched from 2000 to 2018. Defined inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied independently by two reviewers. Critical appraisal was carried out independently by two reviewers and a third reviewer to resolve differences. The Ecology of Childbirth conceptual framework guided the review. Findings: Six articles were included and four synthesised themes were developed: relationships and kinship matter; significance of childbirth and spiritual experiences; honouring spiritual growth and well-being; and physical manifestations and embodiment. Discussion of the themes using the Ecology of Childbirth framework highlight new perspectives and reveal phenomena lying within and beyond childbirth experiences that may influence perinatal mental health. A new conceptual model is proposed. Conclusions: New insights highlight a paucity of research in the area of perinatal mental health and psychosocial-spiritual childbirth experiences. Further research needs to include postnatal mood disorders and the possible associations with psychosocial-spiritual experiences.

AB  - Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been associated with poor mental and somatic health. Accumulating evidence indicates that accelerated biological aging-indexed by altered telomere-related markers-may contribute to associations between ACEs and negative long-term health outcomes. Telomeres are repeated, non-coding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences at the end of chromosomes. Telomeres shorten during repeated cell divisions over time and are being used as a marker of biological aging.
   Objectives: The aim of the current paper is to review the literature on the relationship between ACEs and telomere length (TL), with a specific focus on how the heterogeneity of sample and ACEs characteristics lead to varying associations between ACEs and TL.
   Methods: Multiple databases were searched for relevant English peer-reviewed articles. Thirty-eight papers were found to be eligible for inclusion in the current review.
   Results: Overall, the studies indicated a negative association between ACEs and TL, although many papers presented mixed findings and about a quarter of eligible studies found no association. Studies with smaller sample sizes more often reported significant associations than studies with larger samples. Also, studies reporting on non-clinical and younger samples more often found associations between ACEs and TL compared to studies with clinical and older samples. Reviewing the included studies based on the "Stressor Exposure Characteristics" recently proposed by Epel et al. (2018) revealed a lack of detailed information regarding ACEs characteristics in many studies.
   Conclusion: Overall, it is difficult to achieve firmconclusions about associations of ACEs with TL due to the heterogeneity of study and ACE characteristics and the heterogeneity in reported findings. The field would benefit from more detailed descriptions of study samples and measurement of ACEs.

AB  - Background: Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) is an affect- and relationally focused, time-limited treatment supported by research spanning >4 decades. IPT focuses on stressful interpersonal experiences of loss, life changes, disputes, and social isolation. It emphasizes the role of relationships in recovery. This scoping review describes, within a historical perspective, IPT's evolution as an evidence-supported treatment of psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: English-language publications (n = 1119) identified via EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases (1974-2017), augmented with manual reference searches, were coded for clinical focus, population demographics, format, setting, publication type, and research type. Quantitative and qualitative analyses identified IPT publications' characteristics and trends over four epochs of psychotherapy research.
   Results: IPT literature primarily focused on depression (n = 772 articles; 69%), eating disorders (n = 135; 12%), anxiety disorders (n = 68; 6%), and bipolar disorder (n = 44; 4%), with rising publication rates and numbers of well-conducted randomized, controlled trials over time, justifying inclusion in consensus treatment guidelines. Research trends shifted from efficacy trials to effectiveness studies and population-based dissemination initiatives. Process research examined correlates of improvement and efficacy moderators. Innovations included global initiatives, prevention trials, and digital, web-based training and treatment.
   Conclusion: Sparked by clinical innovations and scientific advances, IPT has evolved as an effective treatment of psychiatric disorders across the lifespan for diverse patients, including underserved clinical populations. Future research to elucidate mechanisms of change, improve access, and adapt to changing frameworks of psychopathology and treatment planning is needed. IPT addresses the universal centrality of relationships to mental health, which is as relevant today as it was over 40 years ago.

AB  - Background: The construct of alexithymia includes a deficit in identifying and describing feelings. It has been proposed that alexithymia plays a role in the etiology of PNES but patients with epilepsy have also scored high on measures of alexithymia. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of alexithymia in patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) and to compare it with patients with epilepsy and healthy controls. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Studies using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) to measure alexithymia in adult patients with PNES, were compared with a control group (epilepsy or healthy controls). Results: Six studies were included in this review. A total of 364 patients with PNES, 234 patients with epilepsy, and 129 healthy controls participated in these studies. Prevalence of alexithymia in PNES (30 - 90%) was higher than those in the healthy population (5 - 14%), but not significantly different from those with epilepsy (26 - 76%). In 3 studies the results were controlled for depression and anxiety. One study found a small correlation between alexithymia and a history of abuse (r = 0.15). Alexithymia appears to mediate perceived quality of life. Conclusions: This review suggests that the prevalence of alexithymia in patients with PNES is similar to that in patients with epilepsy, both significantly higher than those in the healthy population. This finding can point to shared psychiatric and psychosocial factors between these patients. Therapies aimed at increasing emotional awareness may be important in improving quality of life.

AB  - Question A growing body of work suggests that medical students may be particularly at risk of mental ill health, suicidal ideation and behaviour, resulting in recent calls to develop interventions to prevent these outcomes. However, few reviews have synthesised the current evidence base regarding the effectiveness of these interventions and provided guidance to improve future intervention efforts.
   Study selection and analysis The authors conducted a systematic review to identify studies of any design reporting the effectiveness of any universal intervention to address these outcomes in medical students. Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched from their respective start dates until 1 December 2017.
   Findings Data from 39 studies were included. Most investigated the effectiveness of relatively brief interventions designed to reduce stress; most commonly using mindfulness-based or guided meditation approaches. Only one implemented an intervention specifically designed to address suicidal ideation; none investigated the effectiveness of an intervention specifically designed to address suicidal behaviour. Five investigated the effects of curriculum-level changes. Overall, there was limited evidence of an effect for these programmes at both the postintervention and longest follow-up assessment on depression, anxiety and stress.
   Conclusions Relatively brief, individually focused, mindfulness-based interventions may be effective in reducing levels of anxiety, depression and stress in medical students in the short term. Effects on suicidal ideation and behaviour, however, remain to be determined. There has been a significant lack of attention on organisational-level stressors associated with medical education and training.

AB  - Background: Meditation, yoga, and mindfulness are popular interventions at universities and tertiary education institutes to improve mental health. However, the effects on depression, anxiety, and stress are unclear. This study assessed the effectiveness of meditation, yoga, and mindfulness on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in tertiary education students.
   Methods: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, PsycINFO and identified 11,936 articles. After retrieving 181 papers for full-text screening, 24 randomized controlled trials were included in the qualitative analysis. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis amongst 23 studies with 1,373 participants.
   Results: At post-test, after exclusion of outliers, effect sizes for depression, g = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.16-0.69), anxiety g = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.34-0.59), stress g = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.27-0.57) were moderate. Heterogeneity was low (I-2 = 6%). When compared to active control, the effect decreased to g = 0.13 (95% CI: -0.18-0.43). No RCT reported on safety, only two studies reported on academic achievement, most studies had a high risk of bias.
   Conclusions: Most studies were of poor quality and results should be interpreted with caution. Overall moderate effects were found which decreased substantially when interventions were compared to active control. It is unclear whether meditation, yoga or mindfulness affect academic achievement or affect have any negative side effects.

AB  - Objective: Poor diet can be detrimental to mental health. However, the overall evidence for the effects of dietary interventions on mood and mental well-being has yet to be assessed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining effects of dietary interventions on symptoms of depression and anxiety.
   Methods: Major electronic databases were searched through March 2018 for all randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions reporting changes in symptoms of depression and/or anxiety in clinical and nonclinical populations. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to determine effect sizes (Hedges' g with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for dietary interventions compared with control conditions. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored using subgroups and meta-regression analyses.
   Results: Sixteen eligible randomized controlled trials (published in English) with outcome data for 45,826 participants were included; the majority of which examined samples with nonclinical depression (n = 15 studies). Nonetheless, dietary interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms (g = 0.275, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.45, p =.002). Similar effects were observed among high-quality trials (g = 0.321, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.53, p =.002) and when compared with both inactive (g = 0.308, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.60, p =.038) and active controls (g = 0.174, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.34, p =.035). No effect of dietary interventions was observed for anxiety (k = 11, n = 2270, g = 0.100, 95% CI = -0.04 to 0.24, p =.148). Studies with female samples observed significantly greater benefits from dietary interventions, for symptoms of both depression and anxiety.
   Conclusions: Dietary interventions hold promise as a novel intervention for reducing symptoms of depression across the population. Future research is required to determine the specific components of dietary interventions that improve mental health, explore underlying mechanisms, and establish effective schemes for delivering these interventions in clinical and public health settings.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Cannabis is the most commonly used drug of abuse by adolescents in the world. While the impact of adolescent cannabis use on the development of psychosis has been investigated in depth, little is known about the impact of cannabis use on mood and suicidality in young adulthood.
   OBJECTIVE To provide a summary estimate of the extent to which cannabis use during adolescence is associated with the risk of developing subsequent major depression, anxiety, and suicidal behavior.
   DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Proquest Dissertations and Theses were searched from inception to January 2017.
   STUDY SELECTION Longitudinal and prospective studies, assessing cannabis use in adolescents younger than 18 years (at least 1 assessment point) and then ascertaining development of depression in young adulthood (age 18 to 32 years) were selected, and odds ratios (OR) adjusted for the presence of baseline depression and/or anxiety and/or suicidality were extracted.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Study quality was assessed using the Research Triangle Institute item bank on risk of bias and precision of observational studies. Two reviewers conducted all review stages independently. Selected data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The studies assessing cannabis use and depression at different points from adolescence to young adulthood and reporting the corresponding OR were included. In the studies selected, depression was diagnosed according to the third or fourth editions of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or by using scales with predetermined cutoff points.
   RESULTS After screening 3142 articles, 269 articles were selected for full-text review, 35 were selected for further review, and 11 studies comprising 23 317 individuals were included in the quantitative analysis. The OR of developing depression for cannabis users in young adulthood compared with nonusers was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.16-1.62; I-2 = 0%). The pooled OR for anxiety was not statistically significant: 1.18 (95% CI, 0.84-1.67; I-2 = 42%). The pooled OR for suicidal ideation was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.11-2.03; I-2 = 0%), and for suicidal attempt was 3.46 (95% CI, 1.53-7.84, I-2 = 61.3%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although individual-level risk remains moderate to low and results from this study should be confirmed in future adequately powered prospective studies, the high prevalence of adolescents consuming cannabis generates a large number of young people who could develop depression and suicidality attributable to cannabis. This is an important public health problem and concern, which should be properly addressed by health care policy.

AB  - Purpose Evidence on implementing effective adolescent mental health promotion and prevention interventions in the European context is underdeveloped. The purpose of this paper is to identify evidence-based mental health promotion and prevention interventions for adolescents that have been developed and/or implemented across the school, community and digital settings in Europe. This review also sought to identify the relevant implementation processes in relation to what works, for whom and under what circumstances. Design/methodology/approach A narrative synthesis of the evidence was conducted which included two stages: a systematic search of studies assessing adolescent mental health promotion and prevention interventions; and a selection of interventions with the most robust evidence base, using pre-defined criteria, that have been either developed and/or implemented in Europe. Findings A total of 16 interventions met the inclusion criteria. The majority of interventions were school-based programmes. The review findings support the delivery of interventions aimed at enhancing young people's social and emotional learning (SEL) and preventing behavioural problems. Results indicate that the effective delivery of SEL interventions on a school-wide basis could provide an important platform on which other universal interventions such as anxiety and bullying prevention, and targeted depression prevention could be developed in a multi-tiered fashion. There were a limited number of studies providing robust evidence on the effectiveness of suicide prevention, digital and community-based interventions. Originality/value This review identifies a number of robust evidence-based promotion and prevention interventions for promoting adolescent mental health. While the interventions have been implemented in Europe, the majority has not been evaluated rigorously and few included detailed information on the quality of programme implementation. Evidence of the effective cross-cultural transferability of these interventions needs to be strengthened, including more systematic research on their implementation across diverse country contexts.

AB  - Background: Fear of Public Speaking (FoPS) or public speaking anxiety is a type of social anxiety and the single most commonly feared situation in the population. FoPS is disabling with negative occupational, academic, and social consequences, reported by up to one third of the population. FoPS in adolescence and adulthood is associated with an increased risk of developing generalized social anxiety disorder with further impairments. Since the last review on FoPS, a significant number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted assessing the effects of novel interventions with innovative modes of delivery.
   Objectives: The objectives of the presentmeta-analysis are to (1) examine the short and long-term effects of psychological interventions aimed at FoPS on FoPS and generalized social anxiety; (2) assess whether differences exist between technology-assisted modes of delivery (e.g., Internet-delivered therapies) and more traditional modes of delivering treatment (e.g., face-to-face therapies); (3) investigate whether differences in effect exist between theoretical frameworks; (4) inspect the differences in effect size between self-report measures and other measures (i.e., physiological and behavioral); (5) examine the effects of psychological interventions aimed at FoPS on secondary outcome measures (e.g., depression); and (6) investigate whether a "sleeper effect" is present for psychological interventions for FoPS and generalized social anxiety.
   Methods: The study investigates the effects of psychological interventions for FoPS through a quantitative meta-analysis of RCTs, using a random-effects model.
   Results: A total of 30 RCTs with 1,355 participants were included through systematic searches of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The majority of the studies investigated the effects of cognitive or behavioral interventions. Nearly half of the studies used active control groups (e.g., attention placebo), whereas the other half used passive (e.g., waitlist) controls. The overall effect of psychological interventions for FoPS across 62 interventions was 0.74 (Hedges g; 95% CI: 0.61-0.87) with low to moderate heterogeneity. No difference in effect was found across theoretical frameworks. The effects based on self-report measures were larger compared to physiological and behavioral outcomes. Effects were robust against both active and passive control groups. Furthermore, psychological interventions for FoPS had a small to moderate effect on generalized social anxiety disorder (g = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.22-0.48). The effect of psychological interventions aimed at FoPS at follow-up was large (g = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.90-1.31) and moderate to large for generalized social anxiety (g = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.59-0.80). A sleeper effect was found for cognitive and behavioral interventions, indicating that patients continued to improve after treatment termination. There were some indications of publication bias.
   Conclusions: Psychological interventions are effective in reducing FoPS. Interventions using technology-assisted modes of delivery are equally effective as traditional face-to-face interventions in reducing FoPS. This finding highlights an opportunity to increase access to evidence-based treatments through technology-delivered interventions, which can be implemented at schools, in primary care and specialist mental health care. Moreover, psychological interventions aimed at FoPS have an effect on generalized social anxiety. Further implications are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a common and often disabling consequence of stroke, considered to be a complex multidimensional phenomenon. The present review sought to identify studies examining associations between PSF and at least one factor, with the objective of identifying factors that should be investigated in patients with PSF. Method: A search for research investigating PSF was conducted through PubMed, CINAHL and Psychinfo databases (19 October 2017), and included studies in English published during the last 15 years, with more than 10 stroke participants (>18 years old), fatigue assessed with quantitative measurements, and reported relationship with one or more associated factor/-s. Results: Overall, 281 papers were identified of which 34 were included in the final review. Demographics (gender, age), emotional health (depression, anxiety, coping strategy, and locus of control), clinical factors (sleep, pain, stroke characteristics, biological and immunological factors), social factors (social support, disabilities and functionality in daily life) and cognitive functions were found to be associated with PSF. A new framework is discussed, incorporating modifiability of PSF-related factors to heighten the clinical utility. Conclusions: Post-stroke fatigue is multidimensional phenomena with complex aetiology. Further studies are needed to investigate whether treating associated modifiable factors also can decrease PSF.

AB  - Background: Performing artists are exposed to a range of occupational demands from organisational, interpersonal and intrapersonal sources, which may impact their well-being. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate and synthesise the literature where researchers have considered the relationship between occupational demands and well-being in performing artists.
   Methods: A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted including professional and student performing artists. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods study designs were eligible for inclusion in the review. A total of 14 databases were searched from their inception through to October 2017, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus. Critical appraisal was conducted using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool and results presented as a narrative synthesis.
   Results: A total of 20 studies were included in the review, comprising of quantitative (n = 7), qualitative (n = 9) and mixed-methods (n = 4) study designs. Several frameworks of occupational stress and well-being were explored in relation to the results. Organisational, social and emotional demands were associated with lower well-being. Conversely, music-making, performance activities and social support were reported to be resources and were related to higher well-being.
   Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the need for researchers in this field to adopt methodologically robust study designs, which are informed by appropriate theoretical frameworks. The paucity of high quality and theoretically informed research in this area is a hindrance to the development of evidence-based interventions for this population.

AB  - Objective: Chronic pain in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequent symptom and a complicating factor in the treatment of patients. The study' purpose is to systematically review the scientific literature on patients' characteristics and the effects of specific interventions implemented for the treatment of chronic pain in traumatized refugees.
   Method: A systematic search of the current literature was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science, from 1996 to 2017. A structured screening process in accordance with the PRISMA-statement was used with eligibility criteria based on the modified PICOS-criteria including refugees with chronic pain and diagnosed PTSD to investigate sample size, gender, country of origin, residential status, pain locations, predictors and correlations and type and efficacy of specific interventions.
   Results: The initial search resulted in a total of 2169 references, leading to 15 included studies. Most frequently, patients reported headaches, backaches, and pain in the arms and legs. Pain symptoms were associated with higher age, female gender, general living difficulties and PTSD symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and, Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) with biofeedback, manualized trauma psychotherapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Emotional Freedom Techniques were evaluated as specific interventions, resulting in positive outcomes for both pain severity and PTSD symptoms.
   Conclusions: To date, the existing literature shows scarce evidence evaluating specific interventions that address the needs of traumatized refugees with chronic pain. However, the current reported evidence allows for a preliminary evaluation of the characterizations of patient dimensions as well as promising results found in intervention studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the past five years, researchers have increasingly turned to the study of mental health outcomes in LGBT populations. The present paper summarizes recent literature on the relationship between minority stress experienced by sexual minorities and mental health.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PsycINFO, PubMed, and the EBSCO Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection were searched for papers concerning minority stress and mental health disparities in LGBT populations, published between 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2018. All collected papers were screened using the following criteria: study involving >50 individuals; written in English; focusing on clinical outcomes of depression, suicidality, and substance use in relation to experienced minority stress.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Sixty-two papers were included in this review. Findings are reported under three main headings: studies primarily focused on depression, studies concerning suicidality and suicide attempts, and papers analyzing the correlation between substance use and minority stress in LGBT populations. The included studies supported the minority stress model as a framework to better explain disparities in mental health outcomes in sexual minority populations. Higher rates of depression, suicidality, and substance use are reported in LGBT populations, as are the related minority stressors analyzed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sexual minorities still face numerous mental health disparities. Research indicates that the levels of minority stressors positively predict mental health outcomes. Specific policies designed to support the civil rights of sexual minorities may help to overcome such inequalities.

AB  - BackgroundClinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) should follow an adequate methodology using an evidence-based approach in order to provide reliable recommendations. However, little is known regarding the quality of CPGs for Depression, which precludes its adequate use by stakeholders and mental health professionals. Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review to describe the characteristics and quality of CPGs for Depression in adults.MethodsWe searched CPGs for Depression in adults in eighteen databases. We included those that were published in English or Spanish between January2014 and May 2018 and were based on systematic reviews of the evidence. Two independent authors extracted the characteristics, type and number of recommendations, and quality (using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II [AGREE-II]) of each included CPG.ResultsWe included eleven CPGs, of which 9/11 did not include the participation of patients in the development of the CPG, 4/11 CPGs had a score70% in the overall evaluation of AGREE-II, and 3/11 CPGs had a score70% in its third domain (rigor of development). In addition, only 5/11 CPGs shared their search strategy, while only 4/11 listed the selected studies they used to reach recommendations, and 7/11 CPGs did not clearly state which methodology they used to translate evidence into a recommendation.ConclusionsMost of evaluated CPGs did not take into account the patient's viewpoints, achieved a low score in the rigor of development domain, and did not clearly state the process used to reach the recommendations. Stakeholders, CPCGs developers, and CPGs users should take this into account when choosing CPGs, and interpreting and putting into practice their issued recommendations.

AB  - This meta-analytic review responds to promises in the research literature and public domain about the benefits of workplace mindfulness training. It synthesizes randomized controlled trial evidence from workplace-delivered training for changes in mindfulness, stress, mental health, well-being, and work performance outcomes. Going beyond extant reviews, this article explores the influence of variability in workforce and intervention characteristics for reducing perceived stress. Meta-effect estimates (Hedge's g) were computed using data from 23 studies. Results indicate beneficial effects following training for mindfulness (g = 0.45, p < .001) and stress (g = 0.56, p < .001), anxiety (g = 0.62, p < .001) and psychological distress (g = 0.69, p < .001), and for well-being (g = 0.46, p < .002) and sleep (g = 0.26, p < .003). No conclusions could be drawn from pooled data for burnout due to ambivalence in results, for depression due to publication bias, or for work performance due to insufficient data. The potential for integrating the construct of mindfulness within job demands-resources, coping, and prevention theories of work stress is considered in relation to the results. Limitations to study designs and reporting are addressed, and recommendations to advance research in this field are made.

AB  - Background: Antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) including anxiety, depressive, adjustment, and somatoform disorders are prevalent worldwide. There is emerging evidence that experiencing a natural disaster might increase the risk of antenatal CMDs. This study aimed to synthesise the evidence about the prevalence and determinants of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMDs among women who had recently experienced an earthquake.
   Methods: This systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The search included both electronic and manual components. Five major databases were searched. A data extraction table was used to summarise study characteristics and findings. Two authors examined the quality of studies independently using a quality assessment tool. A narrative synthesis of the findings reported.
   Results: In total seven articles met inclusion criteria. Quality scores ranged from six to seven out of ten. All the studies were cross-sectional surveys and were conducted in high and middle-income countries. Sample sizes varied among studies. The prevalence of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMD ranged from 4. 6% (95% CI, 3.2; 6.5) experiencing 'psychological stress' in Japan to 40.8% (95% CI, 35.5; 46.4) 'depression' in China. While all studies were conducted in an earthquake context, only four examined some aspect of earthquake experiences as a risk factor for antenatal CMDs. In multivariable analyses, higher marital conflict, poor social support, multiparity, stresses of pregnancy and the personality characteristic of a negative coping style were identified as risks and a positive coping style as protective against antenatal CMDs.
   Conclusions: This systematic review found that women who have recently experienced an earthquake are at heightened risk of antenatal mental health problems. It indicates that in addition to the establishment of services for safe birth which is recognised in post-disaster management strategies, pregnancy mental health should be a priority. The review also revealed that there is no evidence available from the world's low-income nations where natural disasters might have more profound impacts because local infrastructure is more fragile and where it is already established that women experience a higher burden of antenatal CMDs.

AB  - Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection involves changes not only from the point of view of physical health, but also emotional, and social that have a significant impact on the quality of life of these patients. According to the literature review, it seems that there is an important association between psychosocial factors, in particular on a cognitive level and disease progression. The aim of this mini-review is to summarize recent literature looking at the associations between psychosocial and neurocognitive factors and HCV.
   Methods: PubMed/ Medline was systematically searched for psychosocial and neurocognitive factors associated with hepatitis C, treatment adherence, and patient wellbeing.
   Results: Patients present with a range of extrahepatic symptoms including fatigue, anxiety, depression, and neurocognitive dysfunction. HCV's impact on quality of life and wellbeing has serious clinical and social implications.
   Conclusion: Hepatitis C and its management continue to have a profound impact on health and psychologic wellbeing. Considering the serious extrahepatic implications for individuals, it is imperative that healthcare professionals pay close attention to psychosocial and neurocognitive factors. The focus on combined clinical approaches could enhance understanding about the health and social impacts of hepatitis C along the life course.

AB  - A significant proportion of the electroencephalography (EEG) literature focuses on differences in historically pre-defined frequency bands in the power spectrum that are typically referred to as alpha, beta, gamma, theta and delta waves. Here, we review 184 EEG studies that report differences in frequency bands in the resting state condition (eyes open and closed) across a spectrum of psychiatric disorders including depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, addiction, bipolar disorder, anxiety, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia to determine patterns across disorders. Aggregating across all reported results we demonstrate that characteristic patterns of power change within specific frequency bands are not necessarily unique to any one disorder but show substantial overlap across disorders as well as variability within disorders. In particular, we show that the most dominant pattern of change, across several disorder types including ADHD, schizophrenia and OCD, is power increases across lower frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases across higher frequencies (alpha, beta and gamma). However, a considerable number of disorders, such as PTSD, addiction and autism show no dominant trend for spectral change in any direction. We report consistency and validation scores across the disorders and conditions showing that the dominant result across all disorders is typically only 2.2 times as likely to occur in the literature as alternate results, and typically with less than 250 study participants when summed across all studies reporting this result. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the results were infrequently reported and were typically small at between 20% and 30% and correlated weakly with symptom severity scores. Finally, we discuss the many methodological challenges and limitations relating to such frequency band analysis across the literature. These results caution any interpretation of results from studies that consider only one disorder in isolation, and for the overall potential of this approach for delivering valuable insights in the field of mental health.

AB  - Shame is a self-conscious emotion marked by an intensely negative self-evaluation. It is exhibited by an individual upon realizing that she/he has violated an important (usually social) norm. Shame can be a source of emotional distress leading to social withdrawal and depression, with a significant negative impact on quality of life. In Parkinson's disease (PD), shame is rarely addressed. Based on reports of persons affected with Parkinson's disease (PwP) as well as a literature review, this article describes PD-related shame. PD-related shame may emerge from motor and non-motor symptoms, from self-perception of inadequacy due to loss of autonomy and need for help, or from perceived deterioration of body image. The neurobiology of shame delineates neuronal networks involved in cognitive and emotions regulation, self-representation and representation of the others mental states. Although this hypothesis remains to be demonstrated, these substrates could be modulated, at least partially, by dopaminergic depletion related to PD, which may open a window for pharmacotherapy. Owing to the negative impact that shame can produce, shame should be actively explored and addressed in the individual PwP. Teaching PwP how to develop resilience to shame may be a useful strategy in preventing the vicious circle of shame. The paucity of existing data on prevalence and management of PD-specific shame contrasts with the manifold reported situations inducing suffering from shame. There is a crucial need for further investigations of shame in PD and the development of interventions to reduce its impact on PwP's quality of life.

AB  - Background: Applying the concept of burnout to medical students before residency is relatively recent. Its estimated prevalence varies significantly between studies. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of burnout in medical students worldwide.
   Methods: We systematically searched Medline for English-language articles published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2017. We selected all the original studies about the prevalence of burnout in medical students before residency, using validated questionnaires for burnout. Statistical analyses were conducted using the OpenMetaAnalyst software.
   Results: Prevalence of current burnout was extracted from 24 studies encompassing 17,431 medical students. Among them, 8060 suffered from burnout and we estimated the prevalence to be 44.2% [33.4%55.0%]. The information about the prevalence of each subset of burnout dimensions was given in nine studies including 7588 students. Current prevalence was estimated to be 40.8% for ` emotional exhaustion' [32.8%-48.9%], 35.1% [27.2%-43.0%] for ` depersonalization' and 27.4% [20.5%-34.3%] for ` personal accomplishment'. There is no significant gender difference in burnout. The prevalence of burnout is slightly different across countries with a higher prevalence in Oceania and the Middle East than in other continents.
   Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that one student out of two is suffering from burnout, even before residency. Again, our findings highlight the high level of distress in the medical population. These results should encourage the development of preventive strategies. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness interventions aim to foster greater attention and awareness of present moment experiences. Uptake of mindfulness programs in the workplace has grown as organizations look to support employee health, wellbeing, and performance.
   OBJECTIVE: In support of evidence-based decision making in workplace contexts, we created an evidence map summarizing physical and mental health, cognitive, affective, and interpersonal outcomes from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mindfulness interventions.
   METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases to July 2017, dually-screened all reviews, and consulted topic experts to identify systematic reviews on mindfulness interventions. The distribution of evidence is presented as an evidence map in a bubble plot.
   RESULTS: In total, 175 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. Reviews included a variety of mindfulness-based interventions. The largest review included 109 randomized controlled trials. The majority of these addressed general health, psychological conditions, chronic illness, pain, and substance use. Twenty-six systematic reviews assessed studies conducted in workplace settings and with healthcare professionals, educators, and caregivers. The evidence map shows the prevalence of research by the primary area of focus. An outline of promising applications of mindfulness interventions is included.
   CONCLUSIONS: The evidence map provides an overview of existing mindfulness research. It shows the body of available evidence to inform policy and organizational decision-making supporting employee wellbeing in work contexts.

AB  - The interest in the use of non-invasive brain stimulation for enhancing neural functions and reducing symptoms in anxiety disorders is growing. Based on the DSM-V classification for anxiety disorders, we examined all available research using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for the treatment of specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. A systematic literature search conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar databases provided 26 results: 12 sham-controlled studies and 15 not sham-controlled studies. With regard to the latter sub-group of studies, 9 were case reports, and 6 open label studies. Overall, our work provides preliminary evidence that both, excitatory stimulation of the left prefrontal cortex and inhibitory stimulation of the right prefrontal cortex can reduce symptom severity in anxiety disorders. The current results are discussed in the light of a model for the treatment for anxiety disorders via non-invasive brain stimulation, which is based on up-/downregulation mechanisms and might serve as guide for future systematic investigations in the field.

AB  - BackgroundThe number of asylum seekers, refugees and internally displaced people worldwide has increased dramatically over the past 5 years. Many countries are continuing to resort to detaining asylum seekers and other migrants, despite concerns that this may be harmful. In light of the considerable body of recent research, this review aims to update and expand on a 2009 systematic review on the mental health consequences of detention on adult, adolescent and child immigration detainees, which found (on the basis on 9 studies) that there was consistent evidence that immigration detention had adverse effects on mental health.MethodsThree databases were searched using key terms relating to immigration detention and mental health. Electronic searches were supplemented by reference screening. Studies were included if they were quantitative, included individuals detained for immigration purposes, reported on mental health problems and were published in peer-reviewed journals. Two reviewers independently screened papers for eligibility, and a further two reviewers completed quality appraisals for included studies.ResultsTwenty- six studies (21 of which were not included in the 2009 review) reporting on a total of 2099 participants were included in the review. Overall, these studies indicated that adults, adolescents and children experienced high levels of mental health problems. Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were most commonly reported both during and following detention. Higher symptom scores were found in detained compared to non-detained refugees. In addition (and more clearly than was evident in 2009), detention duration was positively associated with severity of mental symptoms. Greater trauma exposure prior to detention was also associated with symptom severity.ConclusionsThe literature base reviewed in this paper consistently demonstrated severe mental health consequences amongst detainees across a wide range of settings and jurisdictions. There is a pressing need for the proper consideration of mental health and consequent risk of detention-related harm in decisions surrounding detention as well as for improved care for individuals within detention facilities. Recommendations based on these findings are presented, including increased focus on the identification of vulnerability and on minimising the duration of detention.

AB  - Background
   Natural disasters are increasing in frequency and severity. They cause widespread hardship and are associated with detrimental effects on mental health.
   Aims
   Our aim is to provide the best estimate of the effects of natural disasters on mental health through a systematic review and meta-analysis of the rates of psychological distress and psychiatric disorder after natural disasters.
   Method
   This systematic review and meta-analysis is limited to studies that met predetermined quality criteria. We required included studies to make comparisons with pre-disaster or non-disaster exposed controls, and sample representative populations. Key studies were identified through a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO from 1980 to 3 March 2017. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for studies that reported key outcomes with appropriate statistics.
   Results
   Forty-one studies were identified by the literature search, of which 27 contributed to the meta-analyses. Continuous measures of psychological distress were increased after natural disasters (combined standardised mean difference 0.63, 95% CI 0.27-0.98, P = 0.005). Psychiatric disorders were also increased (combined odds ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.43-2.38, P < 0.001). Rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression were significantly increased after disasters. Findings for anxiety and alcohol misuse/dependence were not significant. High rates of heterogeneity suggest that disaster-specific factors and, to a lesser degree, methodological factors contribute to the variance between studies.
   Conclusions
   Increased rates of psychological distress and psychiatric disorders follow natural disasters. High levels of heterogeneity between studies suggest that disaster variables and postdisaster response have the potential to mitigate adverse effects.

AB  - Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is one of the most common forms of chronic orthostatic intolerance. In addition to orthostatic symptoms, many POTS patients report incapacitating cognitive dysfunction or "brain fog" even while lying down or seated. Consistent with these subjective reports, there is accruing objective evidence of specific cognitive difficulties in POTS, with studies showing mild to moderate cognitive impairment using standardized neuropsychological assessment batteries. The precise profile of cognitive dysfunction in POTS patients has been shown to vary among these studies potentially due to the neuropsychological tests used, postural position, comorbidities and length of illness, inclusion of adolescent versus adult patients, and sites of recruitment. The extent of the impact that this cognitive challenge has in patients justifies ongoing investigation and research into lifestyle and pharmacological treatments. Psychologically, patients face challenges congruent with many chronic illnesses, perhaps especially early in adjusting to the condition. POTS patients often exhibit mild to moderate depression symptoms as well as symptoms of anxiety disorders. Since even low levels of anxiety can exacerbate symptoms, and a high number of patients experience sub-clinical low mood and sleep disturbances, there is a likely role for psychotherapy in helping control adjustment-related issues, and possibly aberrant physiology, in POTS.

AB  - Background: There are a growing number of mobile apps available for monitoring and management of mental health symptoms or disorders. However, clinically validated evidence for most of them is unclear; their benefits to patients on long term use are thus debatable.
   Objective: This updated review aimed to systematically appraise the available research evidence of the efficacy and acceptability of mobile apps for mental health in all ages.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search (May 2013 to December 2017) in PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was conducted. Abstracts were included if they described mental health apps (targeting depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), substance use disorders, sleep disorders, and suicidal behaviors) delivered on mobile devices for all ages.
   Results: In total, 1501 abstracts were identified. Of these, 17 publications describing 16 apps targeting anxiety/stress, alcohol disorder, sleep disorder, depression, suicidal behaviors, and PTSD met the inclusion criteria. Five studies randomized individuals to trial conditions, and 14 apps were proven to have clinically validated evidence in reducing mental health symptoms or disorder.
   Conclusions: Mental health apps have potentials in improving the monitoring and management of mental health symptoms or disorders. However, majority of the apps that are currently available lack clinically validated evidence of their efficacy. Given the number and pace at which mobile Health (mHealth) apps are being released, further robust research is warranted to develop and test evidence-based programs.

AB  - Background: Low and middle income countries (LMICs) not only have the majority of the world's population but also the largest proportion of youth. Poverty, civil conflict and environmental stressors tend to be endemic in these countries and contribute to significant psychiatric morbidity, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, mental health data from LMICs is scarce, particularly data on youth. Evaluation of such information is crucial for planning services and reducing the burden of disability. This paper reviews the published data on the prevalence and randomized trials of interventions for depression, anxiety and PTSD in youth in LMICs.
   Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for articles published in English up to January 2017, using the keywords: Low/middle income country, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, child, youth, adolescent, prevalence, treatment, intervention, and outcomes.
   Results: The few prevalence studies in LMICs reported rates of up to 28% for significant symptoms of depression or anxiety among youth, and up to 87% for symptoms of PTSD among youth exposed to traumatic experienences, though these rates varied widely depending on several factors, including the assessments tools used. Most rigorous interventions employed some form or variation of CBT, with mixed results. Studies using other forms of psychosocial interventions appear to be heterogeneous and less rigorous.
   Conclusions: The mental health burden due to depression and anxiety disorders in youth is substantial in LMICs, with high needs but inadequate services. Youth specific services for early detection and cost-effective interventions are needed.

AB  - Background: Metacognitive therapy (MCT) continues to gain increased ground as a treatment for psychological complaints. During the last years, several clinical trials on the efficacy of MCT have been published. The aim of the current study was to provide an updated meta-analytic review of the effect of MCT for psychological complaints.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search of trials on MCT for young and adult patients with psychological complaints published until January 2018, using PsycINFO, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Trials with a minimum of 10 participants in the MCT condition were included.
   Results: A total of 25 studies that examined a variety of psychological complaints met our inclusion criteria, of which 15 were randomized controlled trials. We identified only one trial that was conducted with children and adolescents. In trials with adult patients, large uncontrolled effect size estimates from pre-to post-treatment and follow-up suggest that MCT is effective at reducing symptoms of the targeted primary complaints, anxiety, depression, and dysfunctional metacognitions. The comparison with waitlist control conditions also resulted in a large effect (Hedges' g = 2.06). The comparison of MCT to cognitive and behavioral interventions at post-treatment and at follow-up showed pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) of 0.69 and 0.37 at post-treatment (k = 8) and follow-up (k = 7), respectively.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MCT is an effective treatment for a range of psychological complaints. To date, strongest evidence exists for anxiety and depression. Current results suggest that MCT may be superior to other psychotherapies, including cognitive behavioral interventions. However, more trials with larger number of participants are needed in order to draw firm conclusions.

AB  - Purpose: Burnout has been shown to develop due to chronic stress or distress, which has negative implications for both physical and mental health and well-being. Burnout research originated in the "caring-professions." However, there is a paucity of research which has focused specifically on how job demands, resources and personal characteristics affect burnout among practitioner psychologists.
   Methods: This PRISMA review (Moher et al., 2009) involved searches of key databases (i.e., Web of Knowledge, SCOPUS and Google Scholar) for articles published prior to 1st January, 2017. Articles concerning the prevalence and cause(s) of burnout in applied psychologists, that were published in the English language were included. Both quantitative and qualitative investigative studies were included in the review. The Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT; Crowe, 2013) was used to appraise the quality of each paper included in this review. An inductive content analysis approach (Thomas, 2006) was subsequently conducted in order to identify the developing themes from the data.
   Results: The systematic review comprised 29 papers. The most commonly cited dimension of burnout by applied psychologists was emotional exhaustion (34.48% of papers). Atheoretical approaches were common among the published articles on burnout among applied psychologists. Workload and work setting are the most common job demands and factors that contribute to burnout among applied psychologists, with the resources and personal characteristics of research are age and experience, and sex the most commonly focused upon within the literature.
   Conclusions: The results of the current review offers evidence that burnout is a concern for those working in the delivery of psychological interventions. Emotional exhaustion is the most commonly reported dimension of burnout, with job and personal characteristics and resources also playing important roles in the development of burnout in the mental health care profession. Finally, tentative recommendations for those within the field of applied psychology.

AB  - Introduction: Mental Health Disorders (MHDs) affect 20% of children and youth. To improve long-term physiological and psychological health outcomes for children with MHDs, regular physical activity (PA) participation is essential. Physical literacy, comprising physical competence, PA-related knowledge and understanding, and perceptions of motivation and confidence, may aid understanding of the PA behaviours of children with MHDs. The purpose of this scoping review was to establish the physical literacy levels of children with MHDs.
   Method: Scoping Review. Database searches of Medline, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO and Sportdiscus were conducted for publications from 1985 to 2018. Broad search terms included: diagnosis; physical literacy; PA; physical competence; confidence; motivation; knowledge and understanding. All studies that examined the individual components of physical literacy of children aged 6-12 with behavioural and emotional disorders (F90-97, ICD-10), or depression were included.
   Results: 26,940 articles were identified. Following title, abstract and full text review, 68 articles were included. Physical competence was addressed in 62 articles, indicating children with MHDs display poor motor proficiency but comparable body composition to children without MHDs. Twelve articles focused on daily PA behaviour, with lower PA levels evident in children with MHDs. Limited evidence indicated motivation and confidence (n = 2 articles), and knowledge and understanding (n = 1 article), are lower in children with MHDs. The majority of studies (n = 52) were conducted on children with ADHD.
   Conclusion: Broadly, children with MHDs have lower physical literacy than children without MHDs so may require greater levels of support and tailored evidence based-interventions to become physically literate.

AB  - Objective: Amantadine blocks N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and has dopaminergic and noradrenergic action, a neurochemical profile that suggests its potential as an antidepressant drug. We conducted a systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies addressing the effects of amantadine in animal models of depression and in patients with depression.
   Methods: PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science were searched up to September 1, 2017 to identify clinical and preclinical studies. The following search terms were used: "amantadine AND depress*''; "amantadine AND mood''; "amantadine AND animal models AND antidepres*''; and "amantadine AND (forced swim, learned helplessness, reserpine, chronic mild stress, anhedonia, sucrose preference).''
   Results: Amantadine had antidepressant-like effects in animal models and appeared to potentiate the antidepressant effects of other antidepressants. These preclinical findings have received some support from the results of small open-label clinical trials, suggesting that amantadine can reduce depressive symptomatology and potentiate the antidepressant effects of monoaminergic drugs. In addition to its glutamatergic and dopaminergic effects, the potential antidepressant-like effects of amantadine have been linked to molecular and cellular actions, such as increased expression of neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor), activation of sigma(1) receptors, decreased corticosterone levels, and decreased inflammatory response to stress.
   Conclusion: Amantadine is an interesting candidate as new antidepressant drug for the treatment of depression.

AB  - Background: It remains unclear whether psychotic features increase the risk of completed suicides in unipolar depression. The present systematic review coupled with a meta-analysis attempts to elucidate whether unipolar psychotic major depression (PMD) compared to non-PMD presents higher rates of suicides.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Scopus, PubMed, and "gray literature" for all studies providing data on completed suicides in PMD compared to non-PMD, and the findings were then subjected to meta-analysis. All articles were independently extracted by two authors using predefined data fields.
   Results: Nine studies with 33,873 patients, among them 828 suicides, met our inclusion criteria. PMD compared to non-PMD presented a higher lifetime risk of completed suicides with fixed-effect pooled OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.04-1.40). In a sub-analysis excluding a very large study (weight = 86.62%), and comparing 681 PMD to 2106 non-PMD patients, an even higher pooled OR was found [fixed-effect OR 1.69 (95% CI 1.16-2.45)]. Our meta-analysis may provide evidence that the presence of psychosis increases the risk of suicide in patients suffering from severe depression. The data are inconclusive on the contribution of age, mood congruence, comorbidity, and suicide method on PMD's suicide risk. The lack of accurate diagnosis at the time of suicide, PMD's diagnostic instability, and the use of ICD-10 criteria constitute the main study limitations.
   Conclusions: The presence of psychosis in major depression should alert clinicians for the increased risk of completed suicide. Thus, the implementation of an effective treatment both for psychotic depression and patients' suicidality constitutes a supreme priority.

AB  - Background: The psycho-physiological changes in brain-body interaction observed in most of meditative and relaxing practices rely on voluntary slowing down of breath frequency. However, the identification of mechanisms linking breath control to its psychophysiological effects is still under debate. This systematic review is aimed at unveiling psychophysiological mechanisms underlying slow breathing techniques (< 10 breaths/minute) and their effects on healthy subjects.
   Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, using keywords related to both breathing techniques and to their psychophysiological outcomes, focusing on cardio-respiratory and central nervous system, has been conducted. From a pool of 2,461 abstracts only 15 articles met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The present systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
   Results: The main effects of slow breathing techniques cover autonomic and central nervous systems activities as well as the psychological status. Slow breathing techniques promote autonomic changes increasing Heart Rate Variability and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia paralleled by Central Nervous System (CNS) activity modifications. EEG studies show an increase in alpha and a decrease in theta power. Anatomically, the only available fMRI study highlights increased activity in cortical (e.g., prefrontal, motor, and parietal cortices) and subcortical (e.g., pons, thalamus, sub-parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal gray, and hypothalamus) structures. Psychological/behavioral outputs related to the abovementioned changes are increased comfort, relaxation, pleasantness, vigor and alertness, and reduced symptoms of arousal, anxiety, depression, anger, and confusion.
   Conclusions: Slow breathing techniques act enhancing autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility in a scenario of mutual interactions: we found evidence of links between parasympathetic activity (increased HRV and LF power), CNS activities (increased EEG alpha power and decreased EEG theta power) related to emotional control and psychological well-being in healthy subjects. Our hypothesis considers two different mechanisms for explaining psychophysiological changes induced by voluntary control of slow breathing: one is related to a voluntary regulation of internal bodily states (enteroception), the other is associated to the role of mechanoceptors within the nasal vault in translating slow breathing in a modulation of olfactory bulb activity, which in turn tunes the activity of the entire cortical mantle.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the relationship between acute posttraumatic stress symptoms (< 1 month) and subsequent physical and mental health outcomes other than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science) was conducted to identify longitudinal studies examining the link between acute posttraumatic stress and physical and mental health. Inclusion criteria required assessment of acute posttraumatic stress (< 1 month post-event) and at least one follow-up assessment of a physical or mental health outcome (not PTSD).
   Results: 1,051 articles were screened; 22 met inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies examined physical health outcomes and 12 examined non-PTSD mental health outcomes. Early psychological responses to trauma were associated with a variety of short- (< 1 year) and long- (1 year) term physical and mental health outcomes. Physical health outcomes included poor general physical health, increased pain and disability, lower quality of life, and higher risk of all-cause mortality. Significant psychological outcomes included more cumulative psychiatric disorders, depression, and anxiety. Significant psychosocial outcomes included increased family conflict.
   Conclusions: Methodologically rigorous longitudinal studies support the utility of measuring acute psychological responses to traumatic events as they may be an important marker of preventable trauma-related morbidity and mortality that warrants long-term monitoring and/or early intervention.

AB  - In the past 20 years, the role of disgust in anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been investigated with increasing precision. In this review, we examine recent evidence implicating disgust in anxiety and OCD, highlighting recent measurement and methodological improvements. Specific emphasis is placed on understanding the mechanisms that may account for the role of disgust in OCD and related disorders.
   Recent developments include clarification of the role of distinct disgust-relevant vulnerabilities in the etiology of anxiety and OCD, an improved understanding of the neurobiology of disgust processing in OCD, and an increased focus on disgust-related mechanisms that contribute to psychopathology, such as disgust-based learning and emotion regulation.
   Disgust proneness is increasingly linked with symptoms of anxiety and OCD. However, further examination of the mechanisms that account for the roles of distinct disgust-relevant vulnerabilities is needed, and studies that directly examine disgust during the course of treatment are limited. Increasingly, the field has moved toward experimental investigation of specific disgust-relevant mechanisms that influence the etiology and treatment of OCD and related anxiety disorders.

AB  - Purpose There is increasing concern regarding the mental health impact of first responder work, with some reports suggesting ambulance personnel may be at particularly high risk. Through this systematic review and meta-analysis we aimed to determine the prevalence of mental health conditions among ambulance personnel worldwide.
   Methods A systematic search and screening process was conducted to identify studies for inclusion in the review. To be eligible, studies had to report original quantitative data on the prevalence of at least one of the following mental health outcome(s) of interest (PTSD, depression, anxiety, general psychological distress) for ambulance personnel samples. Quality of the studies was assessed using a validated methodological rating tool. Random effects modelling was used to estimate pooled prevalence, as well as subgroup analyses and meta-regressions for five variables implicated in heterogeneity.
   Results In total, 941 articles were identified across all sources, with 95 full-text articles screened to confirm eligibility. Of these, 27 studies were included in the systematic review, reporting on a total of 30,878 ambulance personnel. A total of 18 studies provided necessary quantitative information and were retained for entry in the meta-analysis. The results demonstrated estimated prevalence rates of 11% for PTSD, 15% for depression, 15% for anxiety, and 27% for general psychological distress amongst ambulance personnel, with date of data collection a significant influence upon observed heterogeneity.
   Conclusion Ambulance personnel worldwide have a prevalence of PTSD considerably higher than rates seen in the general population, although there is some evidence that rates of PTSD may have decreased over recent decades.

AB  - Background: Procrastination can be stressful and frustrating, but it seldom causes any major distress. However, for some people, it can become problematic, resulting in anxiety, lowered mood, physical complaints, and decreased well-being. Still, few studies have investigated the benefits of targeting procrastination. In addition, no attempt has previously been made to determine the overall efficacy of providing psychological treatments.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching for eligible records in Scopus, Proquest, and Google Scholar. Only randomized controlled trials comparing psychological treatments for procrastination to an inactive comparator and assessing the outcomes by a self-report measure were included. A random effects model was used to determine the standardized mean difference Hedge's g at post-treatment. Furthermore, test for heterogeneity was performed, fail-safe N was calculated, and the risk of bias was explored. The study was pre-registered at Prospero: CRD42017069981.
   Results: A total of 1,639 records were identified, with 12 studies (21 comparisons, N = 718) being included in the quantitative synthesis. Overall effect size g when comparing treatment to control was 0.34, 95% Confidence Interval [0.11, 0.56], but revealing significant heterogeneity, Q(20) = 46.99, p < 0.00, and I-2 = 61.14%, 95% CI [32.83, 84.24]. Conducting a subgroup analysis of three out of four studies using cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) found an effect size g of 0.55, 95% CI [0.32, 0.77], and no longer showing any heterogeneity, Q(4) = 3.92, p = 0.42, I-2 = 0.00%, 95% CI [0.00, 91.02] (N = 236). Risk of publication bias, as assessed by the Egger's test was not significant, z = -1.05, p = 0.30, fail-safe N was 370 studies, and there was some risk of bias as rated by two independent researchers. In terms of secondary outcomes, the self-report measures were too varied to present an aggregated estimate.
   Conclusions: Psychological treatments seem to have small benefits on procrastination, but the studies displayed significant between-study variation. Meanwhile, CBT was associated with a moderate benefit, but consisted of only three studies. Recommendations for future research are provided, including the use of more valid and reliable outcomes and a screening interview at intake.

AB  - Background: The perinatal period provides an opportune time for health care providers to screen for and proffer interventions for women suffering from depression. However, routine screening for depression is not done in primary care settings in Zimbabwe.
   Aim: This narrative review discusses opportunities and obstacles surrounding screening for perinatal depression in primary care settings in Zimbabwe, with a view to stress the importance of routine screening to policy-makers.
   Methods: Both electronic and manual searches were done on PubMed, PubMed Central, African Journals Online, Google Scholar and the University of Zimbabwe Institutional Repository (UZIR) using the following key terms: 'women and antenatal depression', 'prenatal depression', 'postnatal depression', 'postpartum depression', 'depressive disorder', or 'common mental disorder' and 'screening and Zimbabwe'.
   Results: Although opportunities for depression screening are possible because of the high antenatal and postnatal service coverage, the potential for universal screening is fraught with human and financial resource constraints, lack of training in mental health care among primary health care providers and lack of locally validated screening tools for depression.
   Conclusion: There is a need to channel resources into the training of midwives and other primary health care providers on mental health issues affecting women perinatally.

AB  - Purpose of Review Evening chronotype is increasingly recognized as a correlate of, and perhaps a contributor to, mental illness. The current review evaluates recent evidence for the association between chronotype and mental illness and putative mechanisms underlying the association, while highlighting methodological advances and areas of research that are relatively under-examined in the literature.
   Recent Findings While evening chronotype is most consistently associated with severity of mood disorder symptoms, emerging evidence implicates evening chronotype as a transdiagnostic correlate of substance use severity, anxiety symptoms, attentional difficulties, and maladaptive behaviors such as aggression. Longitudinal studies point to the possibility that evening chronotype precedes problematic substance use, depression, and anxiety. Neural processes related to reward and affective regulation may underlie associations between evening chronotype and illness.
   Summary The literature on chronotype and mental illness has evolved to (1) include associations with a broader range of psychiatric symptom profiles; (2) explore underlying mechanisms; and (3) expand on earlier research using objective measures and more sophisticated study designs. In addition to further mechanistic research, additional work is needed to examine the stability and key subcomponents of the chronotype construct, as well as more attention to pediatric and special populations. This research is needed to clarify the chronotype-mental health relationship, and to identify how, when, and what aspects of chronotype can be targeted via therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Background: Despite renewed interest in studying the safety and efficacy of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of psychological disorders, the enrollment of racially diverse participants and the unique presentation of psychopathology in this population has not been a focus of this potentially ground-breaking area of research. In 1993, the United States National Institutes of Health issued a mandate that funded research must include participants of color and proposals must include methods for achieving diverse samples.
   Methods: A methodological search of psychedelic studies from 1993 to 2017 was conducted to evaluate ethnoracial differences in inclusion and effective methods of recruiting peopple of color.
   Results: Of the 18 studies that met full criteria (n = 282 participants), 82.3% of the participants were non-Hispanic White, 2.5% were African-American, 2.1% were of Latino origin, 1.8% were of Asian origin, 4.6% were of indigenous origin, 4.6% were of mixed race, 1.8% identified their race as "other," and the ethnicity of 8.2% of participants was unknown. There were no significant differences in recruitment methodologies between those studies that had higher (> 20%) rates of inclusion. Conclusions: As minorities are greatly underrepresented in psychedelic medicine studies, reported treatment outcomes may not generalize to all ethnic and cultural groups. Inclusion of minorities in futures studies and improved recruitment strategies are necessary to better understand the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy in people of color and provide all with equal opportunities for involvement in this potentially promising treatment paradigm.

AB  - Suicide is a worldwide phenomenon. This review is based on a literature search of the World Health Organization (WHO) databases and PubMed. According to the WHO, in 2015, about 800,000 suicides were documented worldwide, and globally 78% of all completed suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries. Overall, suicides account for 1.4% of premature deaths worldwide. Differences arise between regions and countries with respect to the age, gender, and socioeconomic status of the individual and the respective country, method of suicide, and access to health care. During the second and third decades of life, suicide is the second leading cause of death. Completed suicides are three times more common in males than females; for suicide attempts, an inverse ratio can be found. Suicide attempts are up to 30 times more common compared to suicides; they are however important predictors of repeated attempts as well as completed suicides. Overall, suicide rates vary among the sexes and across lifetimes, whereas methods differ according to countries. The most commonly used methods are hanging, self-poisoning with pesticides, and use of firearms. The majority of suicides worldwide are related to psychiatric diseases. Among those, depression, substance use, and psychosis constitute the most relevant risk factors, but also anxiety, personality-, eating- and trauma-related disorders as well as organic mental disorders significantly add to unnatural causes of death compared to the general population. Overall, the matter at hand is relatively complex and a significant amount of underreporting is likely to be present. Nevertheless, suicides can, at least partially, be prevented by restricting access to means of suicide, by training primary care physicians and health workers to identify people at risk as well as to assess and manage respective crises, provide adequate follow-up care and address the way this is reported by the media. Suicidality represents a major societal and health care problem; it thus should be given a high priority in many realms.

AB  - Introduction: Caregivers of people with Alzheimer disease (PwAD) report significant stress, burden and depression compared to caregivers of people with other dementias, especially when neuropsychiatric symptoms are prominent. Adequate coping strategies can modify the impact of stressful situations and increase the caregivers' quality of life.
   Objective: To systematically review the different coping strategies used by caregivers of PwAD to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms.
   Method: We carried out electronic searches using MEDLINE (PubMed), SciELO, Web of Knowledge Cross Search (Thomson Scientific/ISI Web Services) and PsycINFO databases to select studies on coping in PwAD caregivers published from January 2005 to July 2017. The search terms were coping, caregivers, strategy, onset, adaptation, family, behavior, dementia and Alzheimer. The studies were organized in three categories: problem-focused, emotion-focused and dysfunctional coping strategies.
   Results: We found 2,277 articles. After application of exclusion criteria and exclusion of redundant references, 24 articles were analyzed. Emotion-focused coping was the most commonly used strategy among PwAD caregivers. The use of this strategy associated with religion and spirituality may help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Problem-focused coping strategies were mostly used with active coping interventions. Problem-solving coping may have buffered the impact of acute psychological stressors on procoagulant activity. Dysfunctional coping strategies were associated with increase of caregiver burden.
   Conclusion: The evaluated studies showed that the use and development of coping strategies may have ameliorated the depressive symptoms, anxiety and burden of caregivers. However, longitudinal studies are still needed that clearly describe the type of coping strategy used in relation to the presented results.

AB  - BackgroundResearch suggests that self-compassion may improve mental health by promoting emotion regulation (Berking & Whitley, ). This review aimed to identify studies which investigated the relationship between self-compassion, emotion regulation, and mental health in order to examine the role of emotional regulation as a mechanism of change.
   MethodsSearches were conducted in PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline complete, Web of Science and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria required publications to be: peer reviewed, published in English, contain validated measures of self-compassion and emotion regulation, and report a direct analysis on the relationship between these constructs.
   ResultsThe search yielded five studies which met inclusion criteria. Emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between self-compassion and mental health. This pattern was consistent across community and clinical samples, for a range of mental health symptoms including stress, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. A critical limitation of the review was that all included studies used cross-sectional data, limiting interpretations regarding causation.
   ConclusionsResults provide preliminary evidence that emotion regulation may be a mechanism of change in the relationship between self-compassion and mental health. Self-compassion may be a pertinent preliminary treatment target for individuals who avoid experiences of emotions.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched. Each database was searched using the following terms: 'Child,' 'Adolescent,' 'Youth,' 'Disaster,' 'Posttraumatic,' 'Psychosocial,' 'Assessment,' 'Evaluation,' and 'Screening.' The identified studies were subjected to data extraction and appraisal.
   Results: The database search identified 713 articles. Based on the titles and abstracts, the full texts of 118 articles were obtained. The findings of this review can be used as a basis for the design of a psychosocial evaluation tool for disaster preparedness.
   Conclusion: Given the paramount importance of post-disaster evaluation and the weaknesses of current disaster evaluation tools, the need to develop valid and reliable tools and psychometric evaluations cannot be overstated. Our findings provide current evidence supporting various assessments in children, who are very vulnerable psychologically following disasters.

AB  - Food insecurity is a persistent concern in high-income countries, and has been associated with poor mental health, particularly among females. We conducted a scoping review to characterize the state of the evidence on food insecurity and mental health among women in high-income countries. The research databases PubMed, EMBASE, and psycINFO were searched using keywords capturing food insecurity, mental health, and women. Thirty-nine articles (representing 31 unique studies/surveys) were identified. Three-quarters of the articles drew upon data from a version of the United States Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey Module. A range of mental health measures were used, most commonly to measure depression and depressive symptoms, but also anxiety and stress. Most research was cross-sectional and showed associations between depression and food insecurity; longitudinal analyses suggested bidirectional relationships (with food insecurity increasing the risk of depressive symptoms or diagnosis, or depression predicting food insecurity). Several articles focused on vulnerable subgroups, such as pregnant women and mothers, women at risk of homelessness, refugees, and those who had been exposed to violence or substance abuse. Overall, this review supports a link between food insecurity and mental health (and other factors, such as housing circumstances and exposure to violence) among women in high-income countries and underscores the need for comprehensive policies and programs that recognize complex links among public health challenges.

AB  - Objective: Over the past decade, cognitive behavioral therapy has been applied to an increasingly wider range of disorders and problems in Chinese societies. However, no meta-analysis has been conducted to synthesize the studies on cognitive behavioral therapy for Chinese clients. The purpose of this meta-analytic study was to examine the overall efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for Chinese people.
   Method: A literature search was conducted using electronic databases, including Web of Science, PsycINFO and PubMed. Pooled mean effect sizes were calculated using the random-effects model.
   Results: The literature search identified 55 studies with 6763 Chinese participants. The overall short-term effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on the primary outcome was medium in size. Effect sizes were medium for anxiety, depression/well-being and caregiving stress and small for psychotic symptoms and addictive behaviors. The effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on process variables, dysfunctional thoughts and coping, were in the small range. The overall longer-term effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on the primary outcome was medium in size. Moderator analyses showed that the short-term effect was stronger for culturally adapted cognitive behavioral therapy than for unadapted cognitive behavioral therapy. Type of primary outcome, type of control group, recruitment method, study design, the format of delivery and region were found to moderate the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy.
   Conclusion: The findings of this study provide evidence for the overall efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for Chinese people and the benefit of cultural adaptation of cognitive behavioral therapy to Chinese culture.

AB  - Background: Although positive psychology interventions (PPIs) show beneficial effects on mental health in non-clinical populations, the current literature is inconclusive regarding its effectiveness in clinical settings. We aimed to examine the effects of PPIs on well-being (primary outcome), depression, anxiety, and stress (secondary outcomes) in clinical samples with psychiatric or somatic disorders.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for controlled studies of PPIs in clinical samples between Jan 1, 1998 and May 31, 2017. Methodological quality of each study was rated. We used Hedges' adjusted g to calculate effect sizes and pooled results using random-effect models.
   Results: Thirty studies were included, representing 1864 patients with clinical disorders. At post-intervention, PPIs showed significant, small effect sizes for well-being (Hedges' g = 0.24) and depression (g = 0.23) compared to control conditions when omitting outliers. Significant moderate improvements were observed for anxiety (g = 0.36). Effect sizes for stress were not significant. Follow-up effects (8-12 weeks), when available, yielded similar effect sizes. Quality of the studies was low to moderate.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that PPIs, wherein the focus is on eliciting positive feelings, cognitions or behaviors, not only have the potential to improve well-being, but can also reduce distress in populations with clinical disorders. Given the growing interest for PPIs in clinical settings, more high quality research is warranted as to determine the effectiveness of PPIs in clinical samples.

AB  - Introduction Although the antidepressant efficacy of ECT is well documented, patient-reported outcomes after this treatment are less well characterized. The aims of the current meta-analysis are to quantify the impact of an acute course of ECT on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and to identify related moderators, specifically post-ECT depressive symptom remission and patient age.
   Methods We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases for randomized and nonrandomized studies that report on changes in HRQoL measures after an acute course of ECT. Only studies that used the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) instrument were included. A random effects model using the Hedges' g effect size was used in calculating the pre-post ECT outcomes on all 8 SF-36 subscales and the SF-36 total scores including the physical and mental composite scores. Subgroup analyses were conducted using remission status and age as moderators.
   Results Four studies contributed to this analysis. Significant improvements across all subscales of the SF-36 were observed. Large and very large effect sizes were present for both the SF-36 physical component score (PCS) and mental health component score (MCS), with the change in MCS being statistically superior to the PCS (MCS, Hedges' g = 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.42; PCS, Hedges' g = 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.07). Medium, large, and very large effect sizes were observed for SF-36 subscales scores. Post-ECT depression remission status was related to HRQoL improvement, with statistically significant differences present between remitters and nonremitters for PCS, MCS, and most SF-36 subscale scores. No significant differences were observed in improvement in HRQoL with ECT based on patient age.
   Conclusions An acute course of ECT for depressive symptoms produces medium to very large effect size improvements in HRQoL across multiple components and subscales measured by the SF-36. The magnitude of the effects reported by ECT patients is greater than those that have been reported in other open-label studies of brain stimulation techniques. This study confirms that ECT plays a vital role in the treatment of the most severely ill patients with depressive disorders.

AB  - The association between poor mental health and factors related to HIV acquisition and disease progression (also referred to as HIV-related factors) may be stronger among conflict-affected populations given elevated rates of mental health disorders. We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify evidence-based associations between mental health (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and factors related to HIV acquisition and progression in conflict-affected populations. Five electronic databases were searched on October 10, 2014 and updated on March 7, 2017 to identify peer-reviewed publications presenting primary data from January 1, 1994 to March 7, 2017. Articles were included if: 1) depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD was assessed using a validated scale, 2) HIV or HIV-related factors were a primary focus, 3) quantitative associations between depression/anxiety/PTSD and HIV or HIV-related factors were assessed, and 4) the study population was conflict-affected and from a conflict-affected setting. Of 714 citations identified, 33 articles covering 110,818 participants were included. Most were from sub-Saharan Africa (n = 25), five were from the USA, and one each was from the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America. There were 23 cross-sectional, 3 time-series, and 7 cohort studies. The search identified that mental health has been quantitatively associated with the following categories of HIV-related factors in conflict-affected populations: markers of HIV risk, HIV-related health status, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV risk exposures (i.e. sexual violence). Further, findings suggest that symptoms of poor mental health are associated with sexual risk behaviors and HIV markers, while HIV risk exposures and health status are associated with symptoms of poor mental health. Results suggest a role for greater integration and referrals across HIV and mental health programs for conflict-affected populations.

Data were collected using a modified Cochrane Data Extraction Form. Study quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project critical appraisal tool. Heterogeneity of studies permitted only a qualitative synthesis.
   Results Nine quantitative studies comprising the results from analyses of 11 cohorts met our criteria and were rated as strong (n=5), moderate (n=2) or weak (n=2). Three cohorts found a statistically significant association between teenage pregnancy and poor long-term mental health after adjustment, three found a statistically significant association before but not after adjustment and five did not find a statistically significant association. Studies observed varying degrees of attenuation after considering social context. Studies with statistically significant findings tended to comprise earlier cohorts, with outcomes measured at older ages.
   Conclusions The association between teenage pregnancy and mental health beyond the postpartum period remains unclear. Future studies should employ age-period-cohort frameworks to disentangle effects of normative patterns and stress accumulation. Social factors are important in determining long-term mental health of teenage mothers and should be prioritised in prevention and intervention strategies.

AB  - Background: Flooding has caused significant and wide ranging long-term health impacts for affected populations. However, until now, the long-term health outcomes, epidemiological trends and specific impact factors of flooding had not been identified. In this study, the relevant literature was systematically mapped to create the first synthesis of the evidence of the long-term health impacts of flooding.
   Methods: The systematic mapping method was used to collect and categorize all the relevant literature. A study was included if it had a description or measurement of health impacts over six months after flooding. The search was limited to peer reviewed articles and grey literature written in English, published from 1996 to 2016.
   Results: A total of 56 critical articles were extracted for the final map, including 5 qualitative and 51 quantitative studies. Most long-term studies investigated the psychological impacts of flooding, including PTSD, depression, anxiety, psychiatric disorders, sleep disorder and suicide. Others investigated the physiological impacts, including health-related quality of life, acute myocardial infarction, chronic diseases, and malnutrition. Social support was proved to be protective factors that can improve health outcomes in the long-term after flooding. To date, there have been relatively few reviews had focused on the long-term health impacts of flooding. This study coded and catalogued the existing evidence across a wide range of variables and described the long-term health consequences within a conceptual map.
   Discussion and conclusions: Although there was no boundary between the short-term and the long-term impacts of flooding, the identified health outcomes in this systematic mapping could be used to define long-term health impacts. The studies showed that the prevalence of psychological diseases had a reversed increasing trend occurred even in the long-term in relatively poor post-flooding environments. Further cohort or longitudinal research focused on disability, chronic diseases, relocation population, and social interventions after flooding, are urgently required. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To provide an overview of resilience and protective factors associated with a better life following child maltreatment exposure, to compare protective factors across specific subtypes of maltreatment, and to explore existing issues in the current state of the literature.
   Electronic databases and grey literature up to October 2017 were systematically searched for English language with observational study designs for the research on resilience and childhood maltreatment. Systematic review and qualitative approaches were used to synthesize the results. Study quality and heterogeneity were also examined.
   Initial screening of titles and abstracts resulted in 247 papers being reviewed. A total of 85 articles met eligibility criteria of this review. Most of these studies had low or middle study quality. There were two subgroups of studies reviewed: (1) 11 studies examined whether resilience protected against the negative consequence of childhood maltreatment, and, (2) 75 studies explored what protective factor was associated with a kind of adaptive functioning. Although the conceptualization of resilience significantly varied from study to study, protective factors associated with resilience at individual, familial, and societal levels reduced the likelihood of negative consequences of childhood maltreatment. Negative consequences following childhood maltreatment can be prevented or moderated if protective factors are provided in time. Future research needs to address the conceptualization issue of resilience.
   Public and population mental health preventions should focus on early childhood and apply preventive strategies as early as possible. Cost-effective studies should be considered in the evaluation of resilience prevention program.

AB  - Background: This paper aimed to review the literature on the factors associated with parenting stress and resilience among parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the South East Asia (SEA) region.
   Methods: An extensive search of articles in multiple online databases (PsycNET, ProQuest, PudMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) resulted in 28 papers that met the inclusion criteria (i.e., conducted in the SEA region, specific to ASD only, published in a peer-reviewed journal, full text in English). Studies found were conducted in the following countries: Brunei, n = 1; Indonesia, n = 2; Malaysia, n = 12; Philippines, n = 5; Singapore, n = 5, Thailand, n = 2; and Vietnam, n = 1, but none from Cambodia, East Timor, Laos, and Myanmar were identified.
   Results: Across the studies, six main factors were found to be associated with parenting stress: social support, severity of autism symptoms, financial difficulty, parents' perception and understanding toward ASD, parents' anxiety and worries about their child's future, and religious beliefs. These six factors could also be categorized as either a source of parenting stress or a coping strategy/resilience mechanism that may attenuate parenting stress.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that greater support services in Western countries may underlie the cultural differences observed in the SEA region. Limitations in the current review were identified. The limited number of studies yielded from the search suggests a need for expanded research on ASD and parenting stress, coping, and resilience in the SEA region especially in Cambodia, East Timor, Laos, and Myanmar. The identified stress and resilience factors may serve as sociocultural markers for clinicians, psychologists, and other professionals to consider when supporting parents of children with ASD.

AB  - Despite a growing number of studies on the role of the multidimensional construct of trait emotional intelligence (EI) in health, most have focused on global EI, without examining the role of the sub-dimensions. The present systematic review aimed to highlight the current knowledge about self-reported health associated with trait-EI sub-dimensions in general and clinical populations. We searched for the articles including valid self-report scales of trait-EI and health (mental or physical or general) in general and clinical samples. Based on 42 studies, the majority of studies was based on mental health with cross-sectional designs and the TMMS scale, in the general population. Few studies have been focused on physical health and clinical population. The description of studies results revealed that trait-EI sub-dimensions are associated to a greater extent with better mental health, rather than with physical and general health. Furthermore, intrapersonal dimensions, and especially emotion regulation, have stronger effects on health than interpersonal dimensions. Finally, patients with a clinical disorder present lower trait-EI sub-dimensions than the general population. This review supports the importance of focusing on the sub-dimensions of trait-EI to understand better the role of EI in health. The use of scales exclusively based on emotional competences in health contexts is recommended. Developing interventions targeting emotional competences according to the emotional profiles and contexts of individuals could be beneficial to improve health and disease adjustment.

AB  - Background Results from studies evaluating the effectiveness of focused psychosocial support interventions in children exposed to traumatic events in humanitarian settings in low-income and middle-income countries have been inconsistent, showing varying results by setting and subgroup (eg, age or gender). We aimed to assess the effectiveness of these interventions, and to explore which children are likely to benefit most.
   Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) from 3143 children recruited to 11 randomised controlled trials of focused psychosocial support interventions versus waiting list. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycArticles, Web of Science, and the main local low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) databases according to the list of databases relevant to LMIC developed collaboratively by Cochrane and WHO Library, up to November, 2016. We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of focused psychosocial support interventions in children exposed to traumatic events in LMICs, compared with waiting lists (eg, inactive controls). We excluded quasi-randomised trials, studies that did not focus on psychosocial support interventions, and studies that compared two active interventions without control conditions. We requested anonymised data from each trial for each of the prespecified variables for each child who was randomly assigned. The main outcomes considered were continuous scores in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms assessed with rating scales administered immediately (0-4 weeks) after the intervention. We harmonised all individual items from rating scales using item response theory methods. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42013006960.
   Findings We identified a beneficial effect of focused psychosocial support interventions on PTSD symptoms (standardised mean difference [SMD]-0 . 33, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.14) that was maintained at follow-up (-0.21, -0.42 to -0.01). We also identified benefits at the endpoint for functional impairment (-0.29, -0.3 to -0.15) and for strengths: coping (-0.22, -0.43 to -0.02), hope (-0.29, -0.48 to -0.09), and social support (-0.27, -0.52 to -0.02). In IPD meta-analyses focused on age, gender, displacement status, region, and household size we found a stronger improvement in PTSD symptoms in children aged 15-18 years (-0.43, -0.63 to -0.23), in non-displaced children (-0.0, -0.52 to -0.27), and in children living in smaller households (< 6 members; -0.27, -0.42 to -0.11).
   Interpretation Overall, focused psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing PTSD and functional impairment, and in increasing hope, coping, and social support. Future studies should focus on strengthening interventions for younger children, displaced children, and children living in larger households.

AB  - Childbirth can trigger a variety of psychiatric disorders; however, no disorder is as profoundly affected by childbirth as bipolar disorder. Rates of psychiatric comorbidity especially anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and substance use disorders are quite high in individuals with bipolar disorder. The purpose of this scoping review is to ascertain the effect of childbirth on the relationship between the onset of bipolar disorder and comorbid psychiatric disorders. On June 27, 2017, a search of the Medline, PsycINFO, CINHAL, EMBASE, SCOPUS, COCHRANE, and ISI-Web of Science (WOS) databases was performed using the terms mental disorders, mental disease, major depressive disorder, major depression, depression, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, comorbidity, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, reactive attachment disorder, childbirth, parturition, puerperium, postpartum, postpartum period and postnatal period. Reference lists of identified papers were manually searched, and all relevant papers published in English were included. A total of eight relevant articles were identified and included in the review. There is some evidence to suggest that occurrence of certain psychiatric disorders in the postpartum period may predict later onset of bipolar disorder. It is unknown whether childbirth raises the risk of postpartum recurrence of comorbid disorders. Whether patients who have past histories of psychiatric disorders are at increased risk for onset of bipolar disorder in the postpartum period also remains unclear. Additional research is needed to increase our understanding of the impact of childbirth on bipolar disorder and comorbid psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of this issue could lead to more accurate and timely detection, improved treatment planning, and optimal delivery of care for these disorders.

AB  - Pregnancy and postpartum are periods of high susceptibility to major depression (MD) and other mood disorders. The peripartum period is also a time of considerable changes in the levels of hormones, including cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, gonadotropins, and gonadal steroids. To investigate the relationship between mood and hormonal changes during and after pregnancy, we reviewed published reports of hormonal measures during this time frame, searched via PubMed and Web of Science. Studies were included if women in the antepartum or postpartum periods were clinically diagnosed with MD, and if there were repeated measures of cortisol, TSH, or prolactin. For these three hormones, the numbers of human studies that met these criteria were 15, 7, and 3, respectively. Convergent findings suggest that morning cortisol is reduced in pregnant and postpartum women with MD. Evidence did not support changes in TSH as a marker of MD during the peripartum period, and evidence for changes in prolactin in peripartum MD was equivocal. Aside from reduced morning cortisol in peripartum women with MD, definitive evidence for an association between specific hormonal fluctuations and mood disorders in the peripartum period remains elusive.

AB  - The purpose of this review was to synthesize evidence on the associations of physical activity, sedentary time, and fitness with stress, depression, and anxiety in post-secondary students. We conducted a systematic review of the literature and searched four databases from 2000 to 2016. In total, 1942 articles were screened, 22 were critically appraised, and five had low or moderate risk of bias; all were crosssectional studies. Articles were critically appraised using the modified Hoy tool to assess risk of bias criteria for cross-sectional studies. Only studies with low or moderate risk of bias were included for analysis. We synthesized evidence from studies with low or moderate risk of bias using best-evidence synthesis. Based on the two low risk of bias studies, there is inconsistent evidence regarding the association between self-reported physical activity levels and depressive symptoms. Among American university students using tobacco, the odds of depressive symptoms was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.92) for every 1-unit (log transformed) increase in exercise level. However, the second study found no statistically significant correlations between measures of physical activity and either depression or anxiety scores. Among the moderate risk of bias studies, meeting vigorous intensity physical activity guidelines was associated with lower odds of reporting poor mental health (OR: 0.80; 95% CI 0.72, 0.96) and perceived stress (OR: 0.77; 95% CI 0.69, 0.87), lower odds of having higher depressive symptoms (OR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.42, 0.82), and had higher odds of reporting depressive symptoms "some" (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.17-1.54), and "more than a good bit of the time" (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.47-2.01). Importantly, this review highlights a lack of strong evidence available in post-secondary students. Longitudinal research is needed to better understand the temporal association between sedentary time, physical activity, and fitness with stress, depression and anxiety in this population.

AB  - Pain is essential for avoidance of tissue damage and for promotion of healing. Notwithstanding the survival value, pain brings about emotional suffering reflected in fear and anxiety, which in turn augment pain thus giving rise to a self-sustaining feedforward loop. Given such reciprocal relationships, the present article uses neuro-scientific conceptualizations of fear and anxiety as a theoretical framework for hitherto insufficiently understood pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic pain. To that end, searches of PubMed-indexed journals were performed using the following Medical Subject Headings' terms: pain and nociception plus amygdala, anxiety, cognitive, fear, sensory, and unconscious. Recursive sets of scientific and clinical evidence extracted from this literature review were summarized within the following key areas: (1) parallelism between acute pain and fear and between chronic pain and anxiety; (2) all are related to the evasion of sensory-perceived threats and are subserved by subcortical circuits mediating automatic threat-induced physiologic responses and defensive actions in conjunction with higher order corticolimbic networks (e.g., thalamocortical, thalamo-striato-cortical and amygdalo-cortical) generating conscious representations and valuation-based adaptive behaviors; (3) some instances of chronic pain and anxiety conditions are driven by the failure to diminish or block respective nociceptive information or unconscious treats from reaching conscious awareness; and (4) the neural correlates of pain-related conscious states and cognitions may become autonomous (i.e., dissociated) from the subcortical activity/function leading to the eventual chronicity. Identifying relative contributions of the diverse neuroanatomical sources, thus, offers prospects for the development of novel preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies in chronic pain patients.

AB  - Social neuroscience offers a wide range of techniques that may be applied to study the social cognitive deficits that may underlie reduced social functioning-a common feature across many psychiatric disorders. At the same time, a significant proportion of research in this area has been conducted using paradigms that utilize static displays of faces or eyes. The use of point-light displays (PLDs) offers a viable alternative for studying recognition of emotion or intention inference while minimizing the amount of information presented to participants. This mini-review aims to summarize studies that have used PLD to study emotion and intention processing in schizophrenia (SCZ), affective disorders, anxiety and personality disorders, eating disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the reviewed studies: first, the social cognitive problems found in most of the psychiatric samples using PLD were of smaller magnitude than those found in studies presenting social information using faces or voices. Second, even though the information presented in PLDs is extremely limited, presentation of these types of stimuli is sufficient to elicit the disorder-specific, social cognitive biases (e.g., mood-congruent bias in depression, increased threat perception in anxious individuals, aberrant body size perception in eating disorders) documented using other methodologies. Taken together, these findings suggest that point-light stimuli may be a useful method of studying social information processing in psychiatry. At the same time, some limitations of using this methodology are also outlined.

AB  - Parent carers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often report increased levels of stress, depression, and anxiety. Unmet parent carer mental health needs pose a significant risk to the psychological, physical, and social well-being of the parents of the child affected by ASD and jeopardize the adaptive functioning of the family as well as the potential of the child affected by ASD. This systematic review identifies key qualities of interventions supporting the mental health of parent carers and proposes practitioner-parent carer support guidelines. A search of four databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Social Science Data) was conducted to identify studies that met the following criteria: (1) an intervention was delivered to parent carers of a child with ASD under the age of 18 years; (2) the research design allowed for a comparison on outcomes across groups; and (3) outcome measures of the parent carers' mental health were used. A total of 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. A critical interpretive synthesis approach was used to produce an integrated conceptualization of the evidence. Findings suggest practitioner guidelines to support the mental health and wellbeing of parent carers should include addressing the parent's self-perspective taking and skill for real time problem-solving.

AB  - Question Network meta-analyses (NMAs) of treatment efficacy across different pharmacological treatments help inform clinical decision-making, but their methodological quality may vary a lot depending also on the quality of the included primary studies. We therefore conducted a systematic review of NMAs of pharmacological treatment for common mental disorders in order to assess the methodological quality of these NMAs, and to relate study characteristics to the rankings of efficacy and tolerability.
   Study selection and analysis We searched three databases for NMAs of pharmacological treatment used in major depression, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and specific phobia. Studies were appraised using the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research checklist of good research practices for indirect-treatment-comparison and network-meta-analysis studies.
   Findings Twenty NMAs were eligible for inclusion. The number of randomised controlled trials per NMA ranged from 11 to 234, and included between 801 to more than 26 000 participants. Overall, antidepressants were found to be efficacious and tolerable agents for several disorders based on rankings (45%) or statistical significance (55%). The majority of NMAs in this review adhered to guidelines by including a network diagram (70%), assessing consistency (75%), making use of a random effects model (75%), providing information on the model used to fit the data (75%) and adjusting for covariates (75%).
   Conclusions The 20 NMAs of depression and anxiety disorders, PTSD and/or OCD included in this review demonstrate some methodological strengths in comparison with the larger body of published NMAs for medical disorders, support current treatment guidelines and help inform clinical decision-making.

AB  - Endometriosis is a disabling and long-term medical condition affecting quality of life and mental health. Behavioral, cognitive, and emotional coping strategies, emotional intelligence, and metacognition could in part explain the link between the disease and impaired psychological and life functioning. This critical narrative review aimed at examining the state of the art of the relationships between endometriosis and these factors. According to PRISMA principles, we performed a systematic search for quantitative and qualitative studies on multiple electronic databases as regards coping strategies, emotional intelligence, and metacognition in women with endometriosis. Studies were subjected to interpretative and critical narrative synthesis. A total of 9 papers were included in the review. Three main categories were identified in thematic analysis and resumed in the manuscript. Findings suggested that (a) pain is considered the major stressor; (b) they usually use both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies; (c) women with endometriosis and related chronic pain seem to repress emotions more likely than healthy ones; (d) suppressing own emotions, pain catastrophizing, and having a passive coping style are related to higher self-reported pain; and (e) emotional and avoidance coping styles are associated to poor mental status, while positive coping strategies focusing on the problem or on emotions, detached and rational styles are associated to better mental health. Few studies with mixed results and some methodological flaws have focused on coping strategies in women with endometriosis. No studies focusing on metacognition or emotional intelligence were found. Methodological biases, suggestions for future research, and implications for clinical practice were discussed.

Additionally, we determined if the number of total Baduanjin training sessions is associated with decreased anxiety and depression levels. Methods: both English and Chinese databases were searched for potential studies published between January 1982 and October 2017. The eligible randomized controlled trials were considered for meta-analysis. Effect size (Hedge's g) was computed for the pooled effects while the random-effect model was set. For moderator analysis; Subgroup meta-analysis for categorical variables and meta-regression for continuous variables were performed. Results: the aggregated result has shown a significant benefit in favour of Baduanjin on anxiety (Hedge's g = 0.99; CI 1.63 to 0.74) and depression (Hedge's g = 1.07; CI 1.3 to 0.83). For continuous potential moderators; meta-regression indicated a significant effect for total hours in Baduanjin practice (b = 0.0053; 95% CI 0.009 to 0.0014; p = 0.008). With regard to depression; meta-regression indicated a significant effect for total sessions of Baduanjin practice (b = 0.0023; 95% CI 0.006 to 0.0004; p = 0.028). Conclusions: the encouraging findings indicate the efficacy of Baduanjin exercise in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in people with physical or mental illnesses. However; the results should be interpreted with caution because of existing methodological limitations (e. g., high risk of bias; Baduanjin combined with other behavioral interventions; and heterogeneity of control groups).

AB  - Dyspnea or breathlessness is a term primarily used in respiratory medicine. Nevertheless, in the last fifteen years, studies from other fields focus on the affective component of this complex phenomenon due to the frequent observation that psychological states can cause or be caused by dyspnea. Research so far shows that besides the biological component, dyspnea has a strong emotional and psychosocial determinant. This means that apart from its biological factors, dyspnea and its intensity are affected by emotions, personality, anxiety and depression, etc. Individuals with psychiatric disorders, in the same conditions, will evaluate their dyspnea as more intense and disturbing compared to individuals without psychiatric comorbidity. Emotional states in healthy individuals can amplify the sense of dyspnea which is of extreme importance for clinical practice in order to consider the whole person and not just the symptom which is being presented. Also, dyspnea seems to be frequent complaint in some groups of patients with psychiatric disorders (e.g. panic disorder), where the fear of suffocation is presented as clinical symptom. Futher research of dyspnea as a complex, multicomponent phenomenon, can contribute to better treatment options and better differential diagnosis concerning possible psychiatric background of physical symptoms.

AB  - Background: This review focused on evaluation of United Kingdom social prescribing schemes published in peer-reviewed journals and reports. Schemes, including arts, books, education and exercise "on prescription" refer patients to community sources of non-clinical intervention.
   Method: A systematised review protocol appraised primary research material evaluating social prescribing schemes published 2000-2015. Searches were performed in electronic databases using keywords, and articles were screened for evaluation of patient data, referral process, assessment method and outcomes; non-evaluated articles were excluded.
   Results: Of 86 schemes located including pilots, 40 evaluated primary research materials: 17 used quantitative methods including 6 randomised controlled trials; 16 qualitative methods, and 7 mixed methods; 9 exclusively involved arts on prescription.
   Conclusions: Outcomes included increase in self-esteem and confidence; improvement in mental well-being and positive mood; and reduction in anxiety, depression and negative mood. Despite positive findings, the review identifies a number of gaps in the evidence base and makes recommendations for future evaluation and implementation of referral pathways.

AB  - Aims: The role of arts and music in supporting subjective wellbeing (SWB) is increasingly recognised. Robust evidence is needed to support policy and practice. This article reports on the first of four reviews of Culture, Sport and Wellbeing (CSW) commissioned by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)-funded What Works Centre for Wellbeing (https://whatworkswellbeing.org/).
   Objective: To identify SWB outcomes for music and singing in adults.
   Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in PsychInfo, Medline, ERIC, Arts and Humanities, Social Science and Science Citation Indexes, Scopus, PILOTS and CINAHL databases. From 5,397 records identified, 61 relevant records were assessed using GRADE and CERQual schema.
   Results: A wide range of wellbeing measures was used, with no consistency in how SWB was measured across the studies. A wide range of activities was reported, most commonly music listening and regular group singing. Music has been associated with reduced anxiety in young adults, enhanced mood and purpose in adults and mental wellbeing, quality of life, self-awareness and coping in people with diagnosed health conditions. Music and singing have been shown to be effective in enhancing morale and reducing risk of depression in older people. Few studies address SWB in people with dementia. While there are a few studies of music with marginalised communities, participants in community choirs tend to be female, white and relatively well educated. Research challenges include recruiting participants with baseline wellbeing scores that are low enough to record any significant or noteworthy change following a music or singing intervention.
   Conclusions: There is reliable evidence for positive effects of music and singing on wellbeing in adults. There remains a need for research with sub-groups who are at greater risk of lower levels of wellbeing, and on the processes by which wellbeing outcomes are, or are not, achieved.

AB  - The ICD-11 chapter on mental disorders is going to be approved by the World Health Assembly in 2018. An effort has been made to harmonize the two main diagnostic systems existing in psychiatry (the ICD and the DSM), and indeed the metastructure of the two systems will be the same. There will be, however, several differences between the two systems. There will be some diagnostic categories in the ICD-11, which do not appear in the DSM-5, such as complex post-traumatic stress disorder and prolonged grief disorder, and there will be some diagnostic categories that appear in the DSM-5 but will not be included in the ICD-11, such as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Conditions related to sexual health and sleep-wake disorders will appear in chapters of the ICD-11 diagnostic system different from that on mental disorders. The new diagnostic system has been tested through four sets of field studies: international surveys of views of psychiatrists and psychologists on the classification of mental disorders; formative field studies (aimed to guide decisions on the basic structure of the classification), Internet-based field studies (using vignette methodology to examine decision making in relation to ICD-11 categories), and clinic-based field studies (assessing the reliability and clinical utility of the diagnostic guidelines with real patients).

AB  - Objective: This review aimed to identify the impact of childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or symptoms (PTSS) on a couple's relationship.Background: Childbirth can be psychologically traumatic and can lead to PTSD. There is emerging evidence that experiencing a traumatic birth can affect the quality of the couple's relationship. This is an important issue because poor-quality relationships can impact on the well-being of partners, their parenting and the welfare of the infant.Methods: A systematic search was conducted of Amed, CENTRAL, Cinahl, Embase, Maternity and Infant Care, Medline, MITCognet, POPLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycBITE, PsycINFO, Pubmed and Science Direct. Additionally, grey literature, citation and reference searches were conducted. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they reported qualitative data about parents who had experienced childbirth and measures of PTSD or PTSS and the relationship were taken. Analysis was conducted using meta-ethnography.Results: Seven studies were included in the meta-synthesis. Results showed that childbirth-related PTSD or PTSS can have a perceived impact on the couple's relationship and five themes were identified: negative emotions; lack of understanding and support; loss of intimacy; strain on the relationship; and strengthened relationships. A model of proposed interaction between these themes is presented.Conclusions: The impact of childbirth-related PTSD or PTSS on the couple's relationships is complex. As the quality of the couple relationship is important to family well-being, it is important that healthcare professionals are aware of the impact of experiencing psychologically traumatic childbirth as impetus for prevention and support.

AB  - Background: The bidirectional relationship between psychiatric disorders and immune dysregulation has been increasingly documented. Moreover, most major mental diseases are notoriously associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) emerged as a crucial biomarker in the stratification of cardiovascular risk.
   Objectives: Reviewing the recent literature upon: neuroinflammation in mood and schizophrenic disorders, the potential use of HSCRP as an inflammatory biomarker in psychiatric disorders and its possible use for the stratification of risk.
   Method: The authors conducted a MedLine/PubMed search of all articles up to January 2017 using five keywords. The search was supplemented with a manual review of relevant references. Evidences assessing the relationship between CRP plasma levels and psychiatric disorders have been reviewed.
   Result: Elevated High-Sensitivity CRP (HSCRP) plasma levels have been reported specially in mood disorders, mainly in mania and in a subset of patients with Depression. Childhood trauma and suicidal behaviour represent factors that increase illness vulnerability and influence immune responses. The complex interaction amongst immune and endocrine systems, metabolic parameters and psychopharmacological effects enhance difficulty in understanding the directionality of this relationship.
   Conclusion: The heterogeneity of findings provided by research could suggest the presence of genetically determined or epigenetic factors in a subgroup of individuals who react to stress factors with an inflammatory hyperactivation. HSCRP could represent a useful biomarker to identify patients with greater risk to develop medical comorbidities that could benefit from anti-inflammatory treatments.

AB  - Purpose In recent years, the number of refugees and migrants entering Europe has increased dramatically. Such trauma may affect not only refugees themselves, but also care givers and rescue workers. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the intensity and psychological impact of the refugee crisis, with a view to suggesting ways of moving forward.
   Design/methodology/approach Based on recent literature, this paper briefly looks at the importance of attention to health and social issues, before discussing the psychological trauma of refugees and potential emotional trauma of those involved in rescue operations.
   Findings The provision of psychological support which is both compassionate and culturally competent should be viewed as essential. Furthermore, the development of resources and tools to assist with the current refugee crisis could enable care givers, rescue workers, and healthcare professionals to provide psychological support to migrants and refugees. Such resources could also encourage, and support, frontline responders in caring for their own personal psychological well-being.
   Originality/value The content of this paper could help to encourage further research in this field, including research into the emotional trauma of rescue workers. Furthermore, it is intended that this paper could contribute to an on-line knowledge base when considering the development of tools and resources to assist with the current refugee crisis.

AB  - Background: Adjustment disorder has been reconceptualized as a trauma- and stressor-related condition, and there is a growing understanding of the psychobiology of stress responses. Against this context it is timely to review of the pharmacotherapy of adjustment disorder.Methods: A comprehensive electronic database (Pubmed) was searched for randomised controlled trials of the pharmacotherapy of adjustment disorder. Data from each trial were extracted and collated.Results: To date there have been relatively few controlled trials in this area. Comparator trials provide limited support for a number of antidepressant agents, and a series of studies indicate that etifoxine is superior to buspirone and benzodiazepines for adjustment disorder with anxiety.Conclusions: The work done has been useful insofar as it provides clinicians with some insights into the advantages and disadvantages of a number of pharmacotherapy options. Additional rigorously designed trials are needed to further advance the field.

AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions are increasingly used in the treatment and prevention of mental health conditions. Despite this, the mechanisms of change for such interventions are only beginning to be understood, with a number of recent studies assessing changes in brain activity. The aim of this systematic review was to assess changes in brain functioning associated with manualised 8-session mindfulness interventions. Searches of PubMed and Scopus databases resulted in 39 papers, 7 of which were eligible for inclusion. The most consistent longitudinal effect observed was increased insular cortex activity following mindfulness-based interventions. In contrast to previous reviews, we did not find robust evidence for increased activity in specific prefrontal cortex sub-regions. These findings suggest that mindfulness interventions are associated with changes in functioning of the insula, plausibly impacting awareness of internal reactions 'in-the-moment'. The studies reviewed here demonstrated a variety of effects across populations and tasks, pointing to the need for greater consistency in future study design.

AB  - For a number of years now, banks have been going through enormous changes in organization and structure. New technology and new ways of structuring the operation have left their mark on the working conditions and daily lives of employees. Deregulation of labor markets, emerging technologies and new types of jobs have significantly reshaping working lives by continuous changes on employment and working conditions. Such a scenario has a relevant impact not only on companies' organization but also on working population's health. The banking sector is particularly well-deserved of a specific and thorough analysis, in view of the recent increase in psycho-social disorders of employees. This may be related to the major organizational changes affecting this sector and, in particular, to the restructuring processes resulting from the global economic crisis. Our aim is to assess the scale of the phenomenon and how far it relates specifically to the processes of bank organization. With this in mind, through a review of the literature, we selected the main studies dealing with work-related stress in banking, so that we could reach a better understanding of the phenomenon as it relates specifically to this set of workers. The search took place on the MEDLINE (R) database; in total 20 articles were chosen. There was uniform agreement among the studies that stress in the banking workplace is now at critical levels, and that it can have deleterious psychological effects on workers, and on their physical health, and that organizations, too, are affected. Most studies showed that mental health problems had increased in the banking sector, and that they were stress-related. Examples began with anxiety and depression, carried on through maladaptive behaviors, and ended in job burnout. The reviewed studies' limitations were then discussed, and possible ways forward considered.

AB  - The importance of the gutebrain axis in regulating stress-related responses has long been appreciated. More recently, the microbiota has emerged as a key player in the control of this axis, especially during conditions of stress provoked by real or perceived homeostatic challenge. Diet is one of the most important modifying factors of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The routes of communication between the microbiota and brain are slowly being unravelled, and include the vagus nerve, gut hormone signaling, the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, and microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids. The importance of the early life gut microbiota in shaping later health outcomes also is emerging. Results from preclinical studies indicate that alterations of the early microbial composition by way of antibiotic exposure, lack of breastfeeding, birth by Caesarean section, infection, stress exposure, and other environmental influences - coupled with the influence of host genetics - can result in long-term modulation of stress-related physiology and behaviour. The gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of stressrelated conditions including anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome, although this is largely based on animal studies or correlative analysis in patient populations. Additional research in humans is sorely needed to reveal the relative impact and causal contribution of the microbiome to stress-related disorders. In this regard, the concept of psychobiotics is being developed and refined to encompass methods of targeting the microbiota in order to positively impact mental health outcomes. At the 2016 Neurobiology of Stress Workshop in Newport Beach, CA, a group of experts presented the symposium "The Microbiome: Development, Stress, and Disease". This report summarizes and builds upon some of the key concepts in that symposium within the context of how microbiota might influence the neurobiology of stress. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - There is an unprecedented opportunity for psychologists and behavioral scientists to merge prior theory and research with big data to develop profound insights into the way people use and are affected by music. There are now streaming services that store data from millions of people on their day-to-day musical listening habits; song-level data that tags sonic and emotion attributes for millions of songs; wearable devices (e.g. watches and earbuds) that capture physiological metrics including heartrate and galvanic skin response; mobile technologies that track a person's moment-to-moment activity, location, mood, and sociability; and survey instruments and digital footprints that capture personality and other biopsychosocial metrics in just under a minute. We propose that merging these technologies can create a new age in music psychology that exponentially expands the present knowledge and scope of the field. The new data will advance general areas of music psychology, but will also provide an important opportunity to establish new knowledge about health and well-being that can have a direct impact on the public. By scientifically mapping how music changes behavior and health in the short-term and long-term, Big Music Data can lead to future health initiatives including the development of new evidence-based treatment modalities to be utilized by medical physicians and mental health practitioners. Importantly, industry and streaming services can use these new insights to optimize their technologies and develop music-based health and wellness platforms aimed at improving the well-being of its users, ultimately impacting the way music is used by millions of people globally.

AB  - Do psychotherapies work primarily through the specific factors described in treatment manuals, or do they work through common factors? In attempting to unpack this ongoing debate between specific and common factors, we highlight limitations in the existing evidence base and the power battles and competing paradigms that influence the literature. The dichotomy is much less than it might first appear. Most specific factor theorists now concede that common factors have importance, whereas the common factor theorists produce increasingly tight definitions of bona fide therapy. Although specific factors might have been overplayed in psychotherapy research, some are effective for particular conditions. We argue that continuing to espouse common factors with little evidence or endless head-to-head comparative studies of different psychotherapies will not move the field forward. Rather than continuing the debate, research needs to encompass new psychotherapies such as e-therapies, transdiagnostic treatments, psychotherapy component studies, and findings from neurobiology to elucidate the effective process components of psychotherapy.

AB  - Meditation is a popular form of stress management, argued to mediate stress reactivity. However, many studies in this field commonly fail to include an active control group. Given the frequency with which people are selecting meditation as a form of self-management, it is important to validate if the practice is effective in mediating stress-reactivity using well-controlled studies. Thus, we aimed to conduct a meta analysis investigating the neurobiological effects of meditation, including focused attention, open monitoring and automatic self-transcending subtypes, compared to an active control, on markers of stress. In the current meta-analysis and systematic review, we included randomised controlled trials comparing meditation interventions compared to an active control on physiological markers of stress. Studied outcomes include cortisol, blood pressure, heart-rate, lipids and peripheral cytokine expression. Forty-five studies were included. All meditation subtypes reduced systolic blood pressure. Focused attention meditations also reduced cortisol and open monitoring meditations also reduced heart rate. When all meditation forms were analysed together, meditation reduced cortisol, C - reactive protein, blood pressure, heart rate, triglycerides and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Overall, meditation practice leads to decreased physiological markers of stress in a range of populations. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Social isolation and related concepts have been discussed increasingly in the field of mental health. Despite this, there is a lack of conceptual clarity and consistency in the definition and operationalisation of these terms. This review aimed to provide a clear framework for social isolation and related concepts, and to identify well-established measures in the field of mental health for each conceptual domain discussed.
   We used an iterative strategy of expert consultation and literature searching. A multi-disciplinary group of senior academics was consulted both before and after the literature searching to identify relevant terms, conceptual papers, or recommended measures. Our conceptual framework was also validated through expert consultation. We searched the Web of Science database using terms suggested by experts and subsequently identified further relevant studies through review articles and by reading full texts and reference lists of included studies. A narrative synthesis was conducted.
   We developed a model with five domains incorporating all the concepts relevant to social isolation in regular use in the mental health research literature. These five domains are: social network-quantity; social network-structure; social network-quality; appraisal of relationships-emotional; and appraisal of relationships-resources. We also identified well-developed measures suitable for assessing each of the five conceptual domains or covering multi-domains.
   Our review proposes a conceptual model to encompass and differentiate all terms relating to social isolation. Potential uses are in allowing researchers and intervention developers to identify precisely the intended outcomes of interventions, and to choose the most appropriate measures to use in mental health settings.

AB  - Objective: A sedentary lifestyle has been associated with mental health disorders. Many medical conditions result in the cessation of exercise, which may increase the risk of developing mental health problems. The purpose of this article is to systematically review the literature examining the effects of exercise withdrawal on mental health.
   Method: Literature was searched using PubMed, PsycINFO, and SPORTdiscus for studies that experimentally manipulated the withdrawal of exercise and included mental health as outcome measure.
   Results: A total of 19 studies met inclusion criteria (total N = 689 with 385 individuals participating in an exercise withdrawal condition). Exercise withdrawal consistently resulted in increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety. Other mental health outcomes were investigated infrequently. Severe mental health issues requiring clinical intervention after experimentally controlled exercise withdrawal was rare. Heterogeneity in methods and outcomes was observed, especially in terms of the duration of exercise withdrawal (range 1 to 42 days, median = 7 days), with stronger effects if exercise withdrawal exceeded 2 weeks.
   Conclusion: Experimentally controlled exercise withdrawal has adverse consequences for mental health. These observations in healthy individuals may help to understand the onset of mental health problems in response to acute and chronic medical conditions associated with reduced physical activity. Future research is needed to investigate potential mechanisms explaining the adverse mental health consequences of cessation of exercise that will provide new targets for clinical interventions.

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can occur in both adults and children/adolescents. Untreated PTSD can lead to negative long-term mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, low self-concept, disruptive behaviors, and/or substance use disorders. To prevent these adverse effects, treatment of PTSD is essential, especially in young population due to their greater vulnerability. The principal aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy for PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents. Secondary objectives were to assess whether EMDR therapy was effective to improve depressive or anxious comorbid symptoms.
   Methods: We conducted a thorough systematic search of studies published until January 2017, using PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and ScienceDirect as databases. All randomized controlled trials with an EMDR group condition compared to a control group, such as treatment as usual or another psychological treatment, were included. Meta-analysis was conducted with MetaNSUE to avoid biases related to missing information.
   Results: Eight studies (n = 295) met our inclusion criteria. EMDR therapy was superior to waitlist/placebo conditions and showed comparable efficacy to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in reducing post-traumatic and anxiety symptoms. A similar but non-statistically significant trend was observed for depressive symptoms. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed that effects might be smaller in studies that included more males and in more recent studies.
   Conclusion: Despite the small number of publications, the obtained results suggest that EMDR therapy could be a promising psychotherapeutic approach for the treatment of PTSD and comorbid symptoms in young individuals. However, further research with larger samples is needed to confirm these preliminary results as well as to analyze differences in the efficacy of EMDR therapy versus CBT.

AB  - Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for childbearing women. Current treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated modest success in addressing perinatal psychiatric symptoms; however, additional treatment options are needed to address the limitations of current approaches, particularly for women experiencing moderate to severe perinatal mental illness during pregnancy or postpartum. We discuss the use of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as a promising treatment approach that may be uniquely suited for perinatal women due to its emphasis of values, mindfulness, and acceptance; these psychological constructs notably address the significant psychiatric and behavioral health condition comorbidity, somatic symptoms, and stigma associated with perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. In addition, we describe the development of a four-session ACT-based group intervention at the Perinatal Psychiatry Inpatient Unit at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Sessions focus on core ACT processes of acceptance, cognitive defusion, present-moment awareness, value identification, and goal setting, and we describe how each of these processes is relevant to the perinatal population. Implications for future clinical applications and research investigations are discussed.

AB  - Background: Exercise is now recommended as a treatment for depression in Canada. What remains less clear is how best to encourage exercise uptake by individuals with mood disorders. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify barriers and facilitators to exercise and physical activity participation among individuals with depression.
   Method: A scoping review with systematic searches was conducted. Eligible studies required samples >50% diagnosed with depression or a mood disorder, and reported empirical data on barriers and/or facilitators to physical activity using quantitative and/or qualitative methods. Extracted barriers and facilitators were classified into the fourteen domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF).
   Results: Thirteen studies were included (seven quantitative, six qualitative). The most common barriers were classified under the TDF domains of Emotion, Environmental Context & Resources, Beliefs about Capabilities, and Intentions. The most common facilitators were classified under the domains of Beliefs about Consequences, Social Influences, Emotion and Behavioural Regulation.
   Conclusions: Most identified domains are all common determinants of health behaviours in various models and theories applied to physical activity participation. However, the Emotion domain appears to be particularly important to individuals with depression, and yet is not covered by these traditional theories of behaviour change, and may be overlooked when trying to promote physical activity among this population. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of behaviour change interventions that specifically target the Emotion domain, and clearly report the behaviour change techniques employed to do so.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this research is to identify and analyze the measures for the assessment of stressful life events created/adapted for its use in Spanish adult population, published in national and international literature, with a focus on psychometric properties and its association with health measures. Methods: A systematic review was carried out to identify all instruments identified through searches of MEDLINE; ProQuest Health and Medical Complete; ProQuest Psychology Journals; PsycARTICLES; PsycINFO; Psicodoc; OpenSIGLE from inception until 31 January 2016. Two independent researchers assessed the eligibility criteria of all articles, subtracted data and assessed its psychometric properties. Results: Twelve measures, which satisfied the inclusion criteria, were selected. The measures showed a large heterogeneity. Most of them did not include any information on its psychometric properties or needed to provide further data, since a few of them assessed its test-retest stability and/or internal structure. The questionnaires created or adapted by Gonzalez de Rivera y Morena (1983), Sandin y Chorot (1987), Fernandez y Mielgo (1992), Gracia y Herrero (2004), and Motrico et al. (2013) showed significant associations with health variables. Discussion: Further research is needed to clarify the association of these instruments with mental and physical health measures, which would facilitate its clinical application. These results are very useful in order to select a measure for the assessment of stressful life events in clinical practice and research in Spain.

AB  - Many investigations of the associations of self-presentation on Facebook with mental health and personality variables exist, but their findings have not yet been synthetized. We therefore carried out a narrative synthesis of 21 observational studies (combined N=7,573) obtained from a systematic search of four academic databases. Significant self-presentation associations were yielded for self-esteem, perceived social support, social anxiety, well-being, depression, bipolar/mania, stress, self-consciousness, and insecure attachment. Significant associations were also yielded for all of the big five personality variables and narcissism. The clearest trendsbased on the number of times significant associations were yielded across included studieswere as follows: (1) inauthentic self-presentation was consistently associated with low self-esteem and elevated levels of social anxiety; (2) inauthentic self-presentation was consistently more likely to occur in people high in neuroticism and narcissism; and (3) authentic/positive self-presentation was consistently associated with increased levels of self-esteem and perceived social support. The assessment of online self-presentation may offer clinicians important insights into how clients are functioning in relation to various domains of mental health and personality. For example, clients who present inauthentic versions of themselves on Facebook could be experiencing social anxiety or have maladaptive personality traits such as neuroticism and narcissism, all of which could be targeted in intervention.

AB  - Background: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapeutic approach that has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) through several randomized controlled trials (ROT). Solid evidence shows that traumatic events can contribute to the onset of severe mental disorders and can worsen their prognosis. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the most important findings from RCT conducted in the treatment of comorbid traumatic events in psychosis, bipolar disorder, unipolar depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and chronic back pain.
   Methods: Using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, we conducted a systematic literature search of RCT studies published up to December 2016 that used EMDR therapy in the mentioned psychiatric conditions.
   Results: RCT are still scarce in these comorbid conditions but the available evidence suggests that EMDR therapy improves trauma-associated symptoms and has a minor effect on the primary disorders by reaching partial symptomatic improvement.
   Conclusions: EMDR therapy could be a useful psychotherapy to treat trauma -associated symptoms in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Preliminary evidence also suggests that EMDR therapy might be useful to improve psychotic or affective symptoms and could be an add-on treatment in chronic pain conditions.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders represent a great medical and social challenge and people suffering from these conditions face many impairments regarding personal and professional life. In addition, a mental disorder will manifest itself in approximately one quarter of the world's population at some period of their life. Dysfunction in energy metabolism is one of the most consistent scientific findings associated with these disorders. With this is mind, this review compiled data on disturbances in energy metabolism found by proteomic analyses of postmortem brains collected from patients affected by the most prevalent psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). We searched in the PubMed database to gather the studies and compiled all the differentially expressed proteins reported in each work. SCZ studies revealed 92 differentially expressed proteins related to energy metabolism, while 95 proteins were discovered in BPD, and 41 proteins in MDD. With the compiled data, it was possible to determine which proteins related to energy metabolism were found to be altered in all the disorders as well as which ones were altered exclusively in one of them. In conclusion, the information gathered in this work could contribute to a better understanding of the impaired metabolic mechanisms and hopefully bring insights into the underlying neuropathology of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The Indigenous populations of Australia and New Zealand are considered at higher risk of mood and anxiety disorders but many studies do not include direct comparisons with similar non-Indigenous controls. We conducted a systematic search of relevant electronic databases, as well as snowballing and targeted searches of the grey literature. Studies were included for meta-analysis if they compared rates of mood and anxiety disorders between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians or Maori. Seven Australian and 10 NZ studies were included. Overall, Indigenous people in both countries did not have significantly higher rates of disorder. However, in terms of specific disorders, there were differences in risk by gender, country (Australia or NZ), disorder type, and prevalence (current, 12-month or lifetime). For instance, Indigenous Australians and Maori both had significantly lower rates of simple phobias (current prevalence) and Maori participants had significantly lower rates of both lifetime simple phobia and generalised anxiety disorders. By contrast, Indigenous Australians had significantly higher rates of bipolar affective disorder and social phobia (current prevalence). Generalisations regarding the risk of psychiatric disorders in Indigenous people cannot therefore be made as this varies by several factors. These include disorder type, sociodemographic factors, Indigenous origin and study method.

AB  - Purpose of reviewAccording to the WHO reports, around 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Despite its high prevalence, the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms underlying depression still needs to be elucidated.Recent findingsOver the course of the last few years, several neurobiological alterations have been linked to the development and maintenance of depression. One basic process that seems to link many of these findings is inflammation. Chronic inflammation has been associated with both biological factors such as excessive neurotransmitter concentrations as well as psychological processes such as adult stress reactivity and a history of childhood trauma. As a balanced microbial community, modulated by diet, is a key regulator of the host physiology, it seems likely that gut microbiota plays a role in depression.SummaryThe review summarizes the existent literature on this emerging research field and provides a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted links between the microbiota, diet, and depression. Several pathways linking early life trauma, pharmacological treatment effects, and nutrition to the microbiome in depression are described aiming to foster the psychotherapeutic treatment of depressed patients by interventions targeting the microbiota.

AB  - Background: Limited evidence exists regarding fitness-to-drive for people with the mental health conditions of schizophrenia, stress/anxiety disorder, depression, personality disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (herein simply referred to as ` mental health conditions'). The aim of this paper was to systematically search and classify all published studies regarding driving for this population, and then critically appraise papers addressing assessment of fitness-to-drive where the focus was not on the impact of medication on driving.
   Methods: A systematic search of three databases (CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE) was completed from inception to May 2016 to identify all articles on driving and mental health conditions. Papers meeting the eligibility criteria of including data relating to assessment of fitness-to-drive were critically appraised using the American Academy of Neurology and Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine protocols.
   Results: A total of 58 articles met the inclusion criteria of driving among people with mental health conditions studied, and of these, 16 contained data and an explicit focus on assessment of fitness-to-drive. Assessment of fitness-to-drive was reported in three ways: 1) factors impacting on the ability to drive safely among people with mental health conditions, 2) capability and perception of health professionals assessing fitness-to-drive of people with mental health conditions, and 3) crash rates. The level of evidence of the published studies was low due to the absence of controls, and the inability to pool data from different diagnostic groups. Evidence supporting fitness-to-drive is conflicting.
   Conclusions: There is a relatively small literature in the area of driving with mental health conditions, and the overall quality of studies examining fitness-to-drive is low. Large-scale longitudinal studies with age-matched controls are urgently needed in order to determine the effects of different conditions on fitness-to-drive.

AB  - Although psychological interventions might have a tremendous potential for the prevention of mental health disorders (MHD), their current impact on the reduction of disease burden is questionable. Possible reasons include that it is not practical to deliver those interventions to the community en masse due to limited health care resources and the limited availability of evidence-based interventions and clinicians in routine practice, especially in rural areas. Therefore, new approaches are needed to maximize the impact of psychological preventive interventions. Limitations of traditional prevention programs could potentially be overcome by providing Internet-and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This relatively new medium for promoting mental health and preventing MHD introduces a fresh array of possibilities, including the provision of evidence-based psychological interventions that are free from the restraints of travel and time and allow reaching participants for whom traditional opportunities are not an option. This article provides an introduction to the subject and narratively reviews the available evidence for the effectiveness of IMIs with regard to the prevention of MHD onsets. The number of randomized controlled trials that have been conducted to date is very limited and so far it is not possible to draw definite conclusions about the potential of IMIs for the prevention of MHD for specific disorders. Only for the indicated prevention of depression there is consistent evidence across four different randomized trial trials. The only trial on the prevention of general anxiety did not result in positive findings in terms of eating disorders (EDs), effects were only found in post hoc subgroup analyses, indicating that it might be possible to prevent ED onset for subpopulations of people at risk of developing EDs. Future studies need to identify those subpopulations likely to profit from preventive. Disorders not examined so far include substance use disorders, bipolar disorders, stress-related disorders, phobic disorders and panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, impulse-control disorders, somatic symptom disorder, and insomnia. In summary, there is a need for more rigorously conducted large scale randomized controlled trials using standard clinical diagnostic instruments for the selection of participants without MHD at baseline and the assessment of MHD onset. Subsequently, we discuss future directions for the field in order to fully exploit the potential of IMI for the prevention of MHD.

AB  - Objective: To assess the associations between depression and incident cancer risk. Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases were searched to identify studies. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Risk ratios (RRs) were used to measure effect size. A random effects model was applied to synthesize the associations between depression and cancer risk. A forest plot was produced to visually assess RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I-squared statistic. A funnel plot was generated to assess potential publication bias, and Egger's regression was applied to test the symmetry of the funnel plot.
   Results: In total, 1,469,179 participants and 89,716 incident cases of cancer from 25 studies were included. Depression was significantly associated with overall cancer risk (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.09-1.22) and with liver cancer (RR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01-1.43) and lung cancer (RR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.72). Subgroup analysis of studies in North America resulted in a significant summary relative risk (RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.15-1.48). No significant associations were found for breast, prostate, or colorectal/colon cancer. The average Newcastle Ottawa score was 7.56 for all included studies.
   Conclusion: Our findings showed a small and positive association between depression and the overall occurrence risk of cancer, as well as liver cancer and lung cancer risks. However, multinational and larger sample studies are required to further research and support these associations. Moreover, confounding factors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol use/abuse should be considered in future studies. (C) 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Recent Findings A literature yielded 1859 unique articles meeting search criteria were identified; 16 articles met all selection criteria and reviewed with some studies reporting on more than one mental health outcome. Overall, the review supports the hypothesis that insomnia is a predictor of subsequent mental illness.
   Summary The evidence is strongest for an insomnia-depression relationship. The new studies identified and reviewed add to a modest number of publications supporting a prospective role of insomnia in new onset mental illness in three areas: anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and suicide. The few selected new studies focused on SUD were mixed, and no studies focused on PTSD were identified that met the selection criteria. Treatment of insomnia may also be a preventive mental health strategy.

AB  - Objective The aim of this review was to determine whether employees exposed to effort reward imbalance (ERI) at work have a higher risk of depressive disorders than non-exposed employees.
   Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published prospective cohort studies examining the association of ERI at baseline with onset of depressive disorders at follow-up. The work was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and a detailed study protocol was registered before literature search commenced (Registration number: CRD42016047581). We obtained a summary estimate for the association of ERI with risk of depressive disorders by pooling the study-specific estimates in a meta-analysis. We further conducted pre-defined sensitivity analyses.
   Results We identified eight eligible cohort studies, encompassing 84 963 employees and 2897(3.4%) new cases of depressive disorders. Seven of the eight studies suggested an increased risk of depressive disorders among employees exposed to ERIE. The pooled random-effects estimate was 1.49 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.23-1.80, P<0.001], indicating that ERI predicts risk of depressive disorders. The estimate was robust in sensitivity analyses stratified by study quality, type of ERI ascertainment and type depressive disorder ascertainment, respectively.
   Conclusions Employees exposed to ERI were at increased risk of depressive disorder. Future studies on ERE and depressive disorders should examine if this association is stronger or weaker when ERI is measured repeatedly during follow-up and with other methods than self-report or when depressive disorders are ascertained with clinical diagnostic interviews.

   Objective: Determine the prevalence of clinician-diagnosed PTSD and questionnaire-ascertained PTSD symptoms in primary care patients.
   Methods: A systematic review of the literature using the PRISMA method, searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Database, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and relevant book chapter bibliographies. Studies that reported on the prevalence, including point or lifetime prevalence, of PTSD ascertained using diagnostic interviews or self-report questionnaires, or from administrative data, among patients seen in primary care were deemed eligible for inclusion. We abstracted data on the PTSD assessment tool, the mean questionnaire scores/cutoff scores, the time period of PTSD symptoms, and PTSD prevalence reported.
   Results: Of 10,614 titles screened, 41 studies were eligible for inclusion. The included studies assessed PTSD in a total of 7,256,826 primary care patients. The median point prevalence of PTSD across studies was 12.5%. The median point prevalence in the civilian population was 11.1%; in the special-risk population, 12.5%; and in veterans, 24.5%. The point prevalence of diagnostic interview-ascertained PTSD ranged from 2% to 32.5%, and the point prevalence of questionnaire-based substantial PTSD symptoms ranged from 2.9% to 39.1%. Lifetime prevalence of diagnostic interview-ascertained PTSD ranged from 14.5% to 48.8%. The prevalence of PTSD in administrative data-based studies ranged from 3.5% to 29.2%.
   Conclusions: PTSD is common in primary care settings. Additional research on effective and generalizable interventions for PTSD in primary care is needed.

Its adverse physical and mental health consequences have been reported to affect women of all ages and backgrounds. Although Indigenous women seem to experience higher rates of partner abuse than non-Indigenous women, mental health consequences of IPV among this population are not yet clearly established in the literature. This study systematically reviewed the global literature on mental health outcomes and risk factors for mental ill health among Indigenous women who experienced IPV.
   Primary quantitative and mixed methods studies that reported about mental health and IPV among Indigenous women (aged 14+) were included. 21 bibliographic databases were searched until January 2017. Quality of included studies was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Findings are reported according to PRISMA-P 2015.
   13 studies were identified. The majority of studies reported very high rates of IPV and high prevalence of mental disorders. The most frequently identified types of IPV were physical and/or sexual violence, verbal aggression, and emotional abuse. The strongest predictor of poor mental health was physical violence. The most commonly reported mental health outcomes were depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.
   Despite the small number of studies identified, the available evidence suggests that experiences of IPV and mental disorders among Indigenous women are linked and exacerbated by poverty, discrimination, and substance abuse. More research is needed to better understand distributions and presentations of IPV-related mental illness in this population.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common and debilitating mental disorders; however, its etiology remains unclear. This paper aims to summarize the major neurobiological underpinnings of depression, synthesizing the findings into a comprehensive integrated view. A literature review was conducted using Pubmed. Search terms included "depression" or "MDD" AND "biology", "neurobiology", "inflammation", "neurogenesis", "monoamine", and "stress". Articles from 1995 to 2016 were reviewed with a focus on the connection between different biological and psychological models. Some possible pathophysiological mechanisms of depression include altered neurotransmission, HPA axis abnormalities involved in chronic stress, inflammation, reduced neuroplasticity, and network dysfunction. All of these proposed mechanisms are integrally related and interact bidirectionally. In addition, psychological factors have been shown to have a direct effect on neurodevelopment, causing a biological predisposition to depression, while biological factors can lead to psychological pathology as well. The authors suggest that while it is possible that there are several different endophenotypes of depression with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, it may be helpful to think of depression as one united syndrome, in which these mechanisms interact as nodes in a matrix. Depressive disorders are considered in the context of the RDoC paradigm, identifying the pathological mechanisms at every translational level, with a focus on how these mechanisms interact. Finally, future directions of research are identified. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Affective disorders are prevalent in different somatic conditions and influence somatic symptom bother and quality of life. Mood and anxiety disorders impact patients' compliance and adherence to treatment. This systematic review summarizes published studies on affective complaints in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) in order to determine the quality of studies concerning any association of OD with symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.
   Methods: A literature search was carried out using electronic databases Embase, Medline, Web-of-science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Google scholar. Two reviewers made the preselecting cut by screening all articles on title and abstract and independently screened the full texts of this initial set of articles. Methodological quality of the studies that met the inclusion criteria was assessed independently.
   Results: Twenty-six articles were included in the analysis after full-text screening and by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies concluded that symptoms of depression were associated with impaired swallowing function, and 9 out of 12 studies concluded that symptoms of anxiety were associated with functional impairment of swallowing. The reviewers found heterogeneous outcomes and methodological limitations, which prevented data from pooling.
   Conclusion: Although no meta-analytic conclusions can be drawn, it appears that symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in OD. Caregivers have to be aware of this in order to detect affective comorbidity. Given that affective conditions influence patients' treatment adherence and compliance, integrated care approaches should be advocated in case of comorbidity. Studies on treatment effect are lacking and well-designed prospective research is needed.

AB  - There is evidence that development and maintenance of neural connections are disrupted in major mental disorders, which indicates that neurotrophic factors could play a critical role in their pathogenesis. Stress is a well-established risk factor for psychopathology and recent research suggests that disrupted signaling via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be involved in mediating the negative effects of stress on the brain. Social isolation of rats elicits chronic stress and is widely used as an animal model of mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. We carried out a systematic search of published studies to review current evidence for an altered expression of BDNF in the brain of rats reared or housed in social isolation. Across all age groups (post-weaning, adolescent, adult), majority of the identified studies (16/21) reported a decreased expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. There are far less published data on BDNF expression in other brain regions. Data are also scarce to assess the behavioral changes as a function of BDNF expression, but the downregulation of BDNF seems to be associated with increased anxiety-like symptoms. The reviewed data generally support the putative involvement of BDNF in the pathogenesis of stress-related mental illness. However, the mechanisms linking chronic social isolation, BDNF expression and the elicited behavioral alterations are currently unknown.

AB  - Background: Research has consistently found that favourable exchange with one's proximal social environment has positive effects on both mental health and wellbeing. Adults with physical disabilities may have fewer opportunities of favourable exchange, and therefore the effects on mental health and wellbeing may be less advantageous. The aim of this study is to systematically review quantitative studies exploring associations of social relationships with mental health and wellbeing in persons with physical disabilities.
   Methods: The databases PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published between 1995 and 2016. Data was extracted on study and participants' characteristics, independent and dependent variables, used measures and effects sizes of associations between social relationships and mental health or wellbeing. A narrative review was performed to synthesize findings along the constructs social support, social networks, negative social interactions, family functioning and relationship quality.
   Results: Of the 63 included studies, 47 were cross-sectional and 16 longitudinal. Most studies included a measure of social support (n = 58), while other concepts were less often studied (social networks n = 6; negative social interaction n = 3; family functioning n = 2; relationship quality n = 1). Over half of studies included depression as outcome (n = 33), followed by wellbeing (n = 14), composite mental health measures (n = 10), anxiety (n = 8), psychological distress (n = 7), posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 3), and hopelessness (n = 1). Although trends for associations of social support with mental health and wellbeing were consistent, around a quarter of studies failed to report significant associations. Social networks were related to depression, but not to other mental health or wellbeing measures. Family functioning, negative social interactions and relationship quality showed consistent associations with mental health and wellbeing, however, only few studies were available.
   Conclusions: This review indicates that social relationships play an important role in mental health and wellbeing in persons with disabilities, although findings are less consistent than in general populations and strength of associations vary between constructs. Integrating persons with disabilities into social networks seems not sufficient and rehabilitation professionals together with affected persons and their peers should ensure that high quality relationships and tailored support are available.

AB  - Background
   Maternal anxiety negatively influences child outcomes. Reliable estimates have not been established because of varying published prevalence rates.
   Aims
   To establish summary estimates for the prevalence of maternal anxiety in the antenatal and postnatal periods.
   Method
   We searched multiple databases including MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to identify studies published up to January 2016 with data on the prevalence of antenatal or postnatal anxiety. Data were extracted from published reports and any missing information was requested from investigators. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses.
   Results
   We reviewed 23 468 abstracts, retrieved 783 articles and included 102 studies incorporating 221 974 women from 34 countries. The prevalence for self-reported anxiety symptoms was 18.2% (95% CI 13.6-22.8) in the first trimester, 19.1% 95% CI 15.9-22.4) in the second trimester and 24.6% (95% CI 21.2-28.0) in the third trimester. The overall prevalence for a clinical diagnosis of any anxiety disorder was 15.2% (95% CI 9.0-21.4) and 4.1% (95% CI 1.9-6.2) for a generalised anxiety disorder. Postnatally, the prevalence for anxiety symptoms overall at 1-24 weeks was 15.0% (95% CI 13.7-16.4). The prevalence for any anxiety disorder over the same period was 9.9% (95% CI 6.1-13.8), and 5.7% (95% CI 2.3-9.2) for a generalised anxiety disorder. Rates were higher in low-to middle-income countries.
   Conclusions
   Results suggest perinatal anxiety is highly prevalent and merits clinical attention. Research is warranted to develop evidence-based interventions.

AB  - Background: Globally, one in 10 children live in regions affected by armed conflict. Children exposed to armed conflict are vulnerable to social and emotional difficulties, along with disrupted educational and occupational opportunities. Most armed conflicts occur in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), where mental health systems are limited and can be further weakened by the context of war. Research is needed to determine feasible and cost-effective psychosocial interventions that can be delivered safely by available mental health workforces (including nonspecialists). A vital first step toward achieving this is to examine evidence-based psychosocial interventions and identify the common therapeutic techniques being used across these treatments. Methods: A systematic review of psychosocial interventions for conflict-affected children and youth living in LMICs was performed. Studies were identified through database searches (PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PILOTS and Web of Science Core Collection), hand-searching of reference lists, and contacting expert researchers. The PracticeWise coding system was used to distill the practice elements within clinical protocols. Results: Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials and controlled trials conducted in conflict-affected settings, and 25 efficacious treatments were identified. Several practice elements were found across more than 50% of the intervention protocols of these treatments. These were access promotion, psychoeducation for children and parents, insight building, rapport building techniques, cognitive strategies, use of narratives, exposure techniques, and relapse prevention. Conclusions: Identification of the common practice elements of effective interventions for conflict-affected children and youth can inform essential future treatment development, implementation, and evaluation for this vulnerable population. To further advance the field, research should focus on identifying which of these elements are the active ingredients for clinical change, along with attention to costs of delivery, training, supervision and how to sustain quality implementation over time.

AB  - Objective: The objective was to estimate the age of onset (AOO) for all anxiety disorders and for specific subtypes. Gender differences in the AOO of anxiety disorders were examined, as were the influence of study characteristics on reported AOOs.
   Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched up to October 2014, with keywords representing anxiety disorder subtypes, AOO, and study design. The inclusion criteria were studies using a general population sample that provided data on the AOO for all anxiety disorders, or specific anxiety disorders, according to DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, or ICD-10 criteria.
   Results: There were 1028 titles examined, which yielded 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Eight studies reported the AOO and gender. Meta-analysis found a mean AOO of all anxiety disorders of 21.3 years (95% CI 17.46 to 25.07). Separation anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and social phobia had their mean onset before the age of 15 years, whereas the AOO of agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder began, on average, between 21.1 and 34.9 years. Meta-analysis revealed no difference in the AOO between genders. A prospective study design and higher developmental level of the study country were associated with an earlier AOO.
   Conclusions: Results from this meta-analysis indicate that anxiety disorder subtypes differ in the mean AOO, with onsets ranging from early adolescence to young adulthood. These findings suggest that prevention strategies of anxiety disorders should be directed towards factors associated with the development of anxiety disorder subtypes in the age groups with the greatest vulnerability for developing those disorders.

AB  - Objectives: Earthquakes are unpredictable and devastating natural disasters. They can cause massive destruction and loss of life and survivors may suffer psychological symptoms of severe intensity. Our goal in this article is to review studies published in the last 20 years to compile what is known about posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurring after earthquakes. The review also describes other psychiatric complications that can be associated with earthquakes, to provide readers with better overall understanding, and discusses several sociodemographic factors that can be associated with post-earthquake PTSD
   Method: A search for literature was conducted on major databases such as MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO and in neurology and psychiatry journals, and many other medical journals. Terms used for electronic searches included, but were not limited to, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), posttraumatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, major depressive disorder, earthquake, and natural disaster. The relevant information was then utilized to determine the relationships between earthquakes and posttraumatic stress symptoms.
   Results: It was found that PTSD is the most commonly occurring mental health condition among earthquake survivors. Major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, and specific phobias were also listed.
   Conclusion: The PTSD prevalence rate varied widely. It was dependent on multiple risk factors in target populations and also on the interval of time that had elapsed between the exposure to the deadly incident and measurement. Females seemed to be the most widely-affected group, while elderly people and young children exhibit considerable psychosocial impact.

AB  - An individual's own experiences of childhood and being parented are likely to be key determinants of their later parenting experiences. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is arguably the most toxic experience to occur in childhood and therefore may be particularly likely to impact on parenting stress in the context of parenting one's own children. This paper aims to review studies investigating associations between earlier CSA and later parenting to determine the size and consistency of the effects, identify any mediators and moderators of the relationship, and assess the quality of the evidence base. PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PubMed and PILOTS were searched from date of inception until 4th March 2016 and 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies indicated a degree of direct association between experiencing CSA and later parenting stress, two studies found no association and five studies suggest that other variables such as locus of control and current stressors may affect the relationship between CSA and parenting stress. Additionally, 10 studies suggest an indirect relationship between CSA and parenting stress through current level of depression. Results suggest the existence of a relationship between CSA and parenting stress though this association is mostly mediated by other variables, including depression and other stressors. Clearer definitions of CSA and use of validated questionnaires are essential to progress this field of research.

AB  - Background: Anxiety and depression occurring during childhood and adolescence are common and costly. While early-emerging anxiety and depression can arise through a complex interplay of 'distal' factors such as genetic and environmental influences, temperamental characteristics and brain circuitry, the more proximal mechanisms that transfer risks on symptoms are poorly delineated. Information-processing biases, which differentiate youth with and without anxiety and/or depression, could act as proximal mechanisms that mediate more distal risks on symptoms. This article reviews the literature on information-processing biases, their associations with anxiety and depression symptoms in youth and with other distal risk factors, to provide direction for further research. Methods: Based on strategic searches of the literature, we consider how youth with and without anxiety and/or depression vary in how they deploy attention to social-affective stimuli, discriminate between threat and safety cues, retain memories of negative events and appraise ambiguous information. We discuss how these information-processing biases are similarly or differentially expressed on anxiety and depression and whether these biases are linked to genetic and environmental factors, temperamental characteristics and patterns of brain circuitry functioning implicated in anxiety and depression. Findings: Biases in attention and appraisal characterise both youth anxiety and depression but with some differences in how these are expressed for each symptom type. Difficulties in threat-safety cue discrimination characterise anxiety and are understudied in depression, while biases in the retrieval of negative and overgeneral memories have been observed in depression but are understudied in anxiety. Information-processing biases have been studied in relation to some distal factors but not systematically, so relationships remain inconclusive. Conclusions: Biases in attention, threat-safety cue discrimination, memory and appraisal may characterise anxiety and/or depression risk. We discuss future research directions that can more systematically test whether these biases act as proximal mechanisms that mediate other distal risk factors.

AB  - Emotion regulation is assumed to play an important role in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. However, the role of core components of emotion regulation, such as emotional awareness, is not well understood so far. Thus this meta-analysis aimed to examine the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms with emotional awareness in youth. A systematic literature search (PsycINFO, Medline, Google Scholar) identified 21 studies, from which 34 effect sizes were extracted. Results from random effects models showed that difficulties in emotional awareness were significantly correlated with a medium effect size for each, depressive and anxiety symptoms separately, and for their combined effects (overall outcome). Additionally, further analyses revealed that age was a significant moderator of the relationship between emotional awareness with depressive and anxiety symptoms, with younger samples (mean age <= 12 years) showing a stronger association between difficulties in emotional awareness and depressive and anxiety symptoms as compared to older samples (mean age > 12 years). The results suggest that emotional awareness may be of relevance for depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. Future work is required to examine longitudinal developments, moderators, and mediators in multi-method approaches. Moreover, children and adolescents may benefit from interventions that aim to enhance emotional awareness.

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problem worldwide. However, the evidence on the association between anxiety disorders and risk of stroke is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis presents a critical appraisal and summary of the available evidence on the association between anxiety disorders and risk of stroke.
   Methods: Cohort studies reporting risk of stroke among patients with anxiety disorders were searched in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and the Web of Science, from database inception to June 2016. The quality of the studies was assessed using standard criteria. A meta-analysis was undertaken to obtain pooled estimates of the risk of stroke among patients with anxiety disorders.
   Results: Eight studies, including 950,759 patients, from the 11,764 references initially identified, were included in this review. A significantly increased risk of stroke for patients with anxiety disorders was observed, with an overall hazard ratio: 1.24 (1.09-1.41), P = 0.001. No significant heterogeneity between studies was detected and the funnel plot suggested that publication bias was unlikely. Limited evidence suggests that the risk of stroke is increased shortly after the diagnosis of anxiety and that risk of stroke may be higher for patients with severe anxiety.
   Conclusions: Anxiety disorders are a very prevalent modifiable condition associated with risk of stroke increased by 24%. This evidence could inform the development of interventions for the management of anxiety and the prevention of stroke. Further studies on the risk of stroke in patients with anxiety, and the explanatory factors for this association, are required. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Childhood and adolescence are important developmental phases which influence health and well-being across the life span. Social relationships are fundamental to child and adolescent development; yet studies have been limited to children's relationships with other humans. This paper provides an evidence review for the potential associations between pet ownership and emotional; behavioural; cognitive; educational and social developmental outcomes. As the field is in the early stages; a broad set of inclusion criteria was applied. A systematic search of databases and grey literature sources found twenty-two studies meeting selection criteria. The review found evidence for an association between pet ownership and a wide range of emotional health benefits from childhood pet ownership; particularly for self-esteem and loneliness. The findings regarding childhood anxiety and depression were inconclusive. Studies also showed evidence of an association between pet ownership and educational and cognitive benefits; for example, in perspective-taking abilities and intellectual development. Evidence on behavioural development was unclear due to a lack of high quality research. Studies on pet ownership and social development provided evidence for an association with increased social competence; social networks; social interaction and social play behaviour. Overall, pet ownership and the significance of children's bonds with companion animals have been underexplored; there is a shortage of high quality and longitudinal studies in all outcomes. Prospective studies that control for a wide range of confounders are required.

AB  - The phenomenology and underlying pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) are heterogeneous. The identification of putative endophenotypes for BD can aid in the investigation of unique patho-etiological pathways, which may lead to the development of personalised preventative and therapeutic approaches for this multi-faceted disorder. We included original studies involving unaffected first-degree relatives of BD patients (URs) and a healthy control (HC) comparison group with no first-degree family history of mental disorders, investigating: 'cold' and 'hot' cognition and functional and structural neuroimaging. Seventy-seven cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria. The present review revealed that URs in comparison with HCs showed: (i) widespread deficits in verbal memory, sustained attention, and executive function; (ii) abnormalities in the reactivity to and regulation of emotional information along with aberrant reward processing, and heightened attentional interference by emotional stimuli; and (iii) less consistency in the findings regarding structural and resting state neuroimaging, and electrophysiological measures.

AB  - Background: Healthcare costs are skyrocketing, with mental health treatment amongst the most expensive, especially when hospitalization is involved. According to the Mental Health Commission of Canada, one in five Canadians is living with a mental disorder in any given year, at an annual cost of $50 billion. In light of this societal burden, alternative approaches are being evaluated, such as brief psychotherapy by phone, peer support, and, as part of the emerging field of nutritional mental health, treatment with micronutrients (minerals and vitamins). Effectiveness of micronutrients has been demonstrated for many types of psychiatric symptoms, in about 45 studies of formulas that are either multinutrient (e.g., several B vitamins) or broad-spectrum (usually over 20 minerals and vitamins). Although this literature demonstrates therapeutic benefits, the potential economic impact of micronutrient treatment has been evaluated in only one case study of childhood psychosis.
   Methods: The current case study was initiated to evaluate mental health-related hospitalization costs from 1997 to 2003 for a female adult diagnosed with various mood and psychotic symptoms. She was treated for the first 5 years with conventional methods and then subsequently with a broad-spectrum micronutrient formula.
   Results: The patient's annual mental health hospitalization costs during conventional treatment averaged $59,864 across 5 years (1997-2001), with a peak annual cost of about $140,000. Since transitioning to broad-spectrum micronutrients, she has incurred no provincial hospitalization costs for mental health care, though her self-funded costs are currently $720/year for the micronutrients.
   Conclusion: Further exploration of the treatment of mental health problems with broad-spectrum micronutrient formulas has the potential to make two significant contributions: improved mental health, and decreased costs for governments.

AB  - Introduction: The development and use of serious games for mental health disorders are on the rise. Yet, little is known about the impact of these games on clinical mental health symptoms. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of serious games on symptoms of mental disorder.
   Method: We conducted a systematic search in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases, using mental health and serious games-related keywords. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review, and nine studies were included in the meta-analysis.
   Results: All of the serious games were provided via personal computer, mostly on CD-ROM without the need for an internet connection. The studies targeted age groups ranging from 7 to 80 years old. The serious games focused on symptoms of depression (n = 2), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 2), autism spectrum disorder (n = 2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 1), cognitive functioning (n = 2), and alcohol use disorder (n = 1). The studies used goal-oriented (n = 4) and cognitive training games (n = 6). A total of 674 participants were included in the meta-analysis (380 in experimental and 294 in control groups). A meta-analysis of 9 studies comprising 10 comparisons, using a random effects model, showed a moderate effect on improvement of symptoms [g = 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.28-0.83); P < 0.001], favoring serious games over no intervention controls.
   Discussion/conclusion: Though the number of comparisons in the meta-analysis was small, these findings suggest that serious gaming interventions may be effective for reducing disorder-related symptoms. More studies are needed in order to attain deeper knowledge of the efficacy for specific mental disorders and the longer term effects of this new type of treatment for mental disorders.

AB  - Background: The boundary between Dermatology and Psychiatry has increasing recognition. Psoriasis is a common psychophysiological skin disease with a major impact on patient's quality of life and a paradigmatic example of a pathology in that boundary. Studies are needed to exactly point out the prevalence of specific psychopathology and mental disorders associated with psoriasis. This work intends to analyse the prevalence of psychopathology and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with psoriasis.
   Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the "5S" model proposed by Haynes. From all the papers retrieved by this search, a total of 34 papers met the inclusion criteria and were then deeply analysed.
   Results: The most prevalent mental disorders in these patients are sleep disorders (average prevalence: 62.0%), sexual dysfunction (45.6%), personality (35.0%), anxiety (30.4%), adjustment (29.0%), depressive (27.6%) and substance-related and addictive disorders (24.8%). Other mental disorders have been less described, namely somatic symptoms and related disorders, schizophrenia and other psychoses, bipolar disorder and eating disorders.
   Conclusions: This updated research shows that the prevalence of psychiatric conditions in psoriasis may range from 24% to 90%. The study of the mind-skin connection in psoriasis may improve the knowledge about psoriasis and its psychiatric comorbidities. The link between psoriasis and associated mental disorders is frequently forgotten or not considered in the clinical practice. Psychiatric disorders in patients with psoriasis may be underdiagnosed. These patients would really benefit from psychiatric assessment, with therapeutic relevance.

AB  - Given the ubiquity of traumatic events, it is not surprising that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-a common diagnosis following one of these experiences-is characterized as conferring a large burden for individuals and society. Although there is recognition of the importance of PTSD diagnoses throughout psychiatry, the literature on other diagnoses one may receive following a stressful or traumatic event is scant. This review summarizes the literature on stress disorders (classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition [ICD-10]), including acute stress reaction, PTSD, adjustment disorder and unspecified stress reactions. This review focuses on the literature related to common psychiatric and somatic consequences of these disorders. The prevalence and incidence of each disorder are described. A review of epidemiologic studies on comorbid mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety and substance abuse, is included, as well as a review of epidemiologic studies on somatic outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal disorders. Finally, the current literature on all-cause mortality and suicide following stress disorder diagnoses is reviewed. Stress disorders are a critical public health issue with potentially deleterious outcomes that have a significant impact on those living with these disorders, the health care system and society. It is only through an awareness of the impact of stress disorders that appropriate resources can be allocated to prevention and treatment. Future research should expand the work done to date beyond the examination of PTSD, so that the field may obtain a more complete picture of the impact all stress disorders have on the many people living with these diagnoses.

AB  - Background: The collaborative care model has been found to be effective for depression management in various primary care populations; however, no review has synthesized trials tailored to treat women. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the current evidence for collaborative depression care for women. Methodology: We searched for English language articles via MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and reference lists of key articles. Published English language studies were included if they described collaborative care models that targeted women, regardless of study design. Studies were excluded if components of collaborative care were absent (based on criteria described by the Advancing Integrated Mental Health Solutions Center at the University of Washington), if the focus of the intervention was not women, if the studies were not conducted in primary care or gynecological settings, or if there were no outcome data. Results: This review resulted in 7 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Included studies were 6 randomized controlled trials and 1 observational study. Among those, 4 studies focused on pregnant or postpartum women. In general, collaborative care interventions focusing on women were more effective than usual care for the management of depressive disorders in women with 5 of the 6 randomized studies showing positive depression outcomes. Conclusions: There is evidence that collaborative care interventions are effective for treating depressed women in nonmental health settings. Future studies should examine differences in implementation of collaborative care in "real world" settings and define modcations needed based on a woman's reproductive life stage.

AB  - Social cognitive skills are indispensable for successful communication with others. Substantial research has determined deficits in these abilities in patients with mental disorders. In neurobiological development and continuing into adulthood, cross-cultural differences in social cognition have been demonstrated. Moreover, symptomatic patterns in mental disorders may vary according to the cultural background of an individual. Cross-cultural studies can thus help in understanding underlying (biological) mechanisms and factors that influence behavior in health and disease. In addition, studies that apply novel paradigms assessing the impact of culture on cognition may benefit and advance neuroscience research. In this review, the authors give an overview of cross-cultural research in the field of social cognition in health and in mental disorders and provide an outlook on future research directions, taking a neuroscience perspective.

AB  - Background: Having investigated the decision making of world class elite and subelite athletes (see Parkin and Walsh, 2017; Parkin et al., 2017), here the abilities of those at the earliest stage of entry to elite sport are examined. Junior elite athletes have undergone initial national selection and are younger than athletes examined previously (mean age 13 years). Decision making under mental pressure is explored in this sample. During performance an athlete encounters a wide array of mental pressures; these include the psychological impact of errors, negative feedback, and requirements for sustained attention in a dynamic environment (Anshel and Wells, 2000; Mellalieu et al., 2009). Such factors increase the cognitive demands of the athletes, inducing distracting anxiety-related thoughts known as rumination (Beilock and Gray, 2007). Mental pressure has been shown to reduce performance of decision-making tasks where reward and loss contingencies are explicit, with a shift toward increased risk taking (Pabst et al., 2013; Starcke et al., 2011). Mental pressure has been shown to be detrimental to decision-making speed in comparison to physical stress, highlighting the importance of considering a range of different pressures encountered by athletes (Hepler, 2015).
   Objective: To investigate the influence of mental pressure on key indicators of decision making in junior elite athletes. This chapter concludes a wider project examining decision making across developmental stages in elite sport. The work further explores how psychological insights can be applied in an elite sporting environment and in particular tailored to the requirements of junior athletes.
   Methods: Seventeen junior elite athletes (10 males, mean age: 13.80 years) enrolled on a national youth athletic development program participated in the study. Performance across three categories of decision making was assessed under conditions of low and high mental pressure. Decision making under risk was measured via the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT; Rogers et al., 1999), decision making under uncertainty via the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002), and fast reactive responses to perceptual stimuli via the Visual Search Task (Treisman, 1982). Mental pressure was induced with the addition of a concurrent verbal memory task, used to increase cognitive load and mimic the distracting effects of anxiety-related rumination.
   Results: In junior elite athletes, fast reactive responses to perceptual stimuli (on the Visual Search Task) were slower under conditions of mental pressure. For decision making under risk there was an interaction of mental pressure and gender on the amount of points gambled, under pressure there was a higher level of risk taking in male athletes compared to females. There was no influence of mental pressure on decision making under uncertainity. There were no significant correlations in the degree to which individual's responses changed under pressure across the three measures of decision making. When assessing the applicability of results based on group averages there were no junior elite athletes who showed an "average" response (within 1SD of the mean) to mental pressure across all the three decision-making tasks.
   Conclusion: Mental pressure affects decision making in a sample of junior elite athletes, with a slowing of response times, and modulations to performance of decision making under risk that have a high requirement for working memory. In relation to sport, these findings suggest that novel situations that place high cognitive demands on the athlete may be particularly influenced by mental pressure. The application of this work in junior elite athletes included the feedback of individual results and the implementation of a decision-making taxonomy.

AB  - Circadian rhythm disturbances are a common symptom among individuals with mood disorders. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), in the ventral part of the anterior hypothalamus, orchestrates physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms. The SCN consists of self-sustaining oscillators and receives photic and nonphotic cues, which entrain the SCN to the external environment. In turn, through synaptic and hormonal mechanisms, the SCN can drive and synchronize circadian rhythms in extra-SCN brain regions and peripheral tissues. Thus, genetic or environmental perturbations of SCN rhythms could disrupt brain regions more closely related to mood regulation and cause mood disturbances. Here, we review clinical and preclinical studies that provide evidence both for and against a causal role for the SCN in mood disorders.

AB  - Background: Studies show that the Internet has become an influential source of information for people experiencing serious psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders or other psychotic disorders, among which the rate of Internet users is growing, with rates ranging from 33.3% to 79.5% given the country. Between 20.5% and 56.4% of these Internet users seek mental health information.
   Objective: Focusing on this population's Web searches about their mental health, this paper examines what type of content they look for and what could be the benefits and disadvantages of this navigation.
   Methods: We conducted a literature review through medical and psychological databases between 2000 and 2015 using the keywords "Internet," "Web," " virtual," "health information," " schizophrenia," "psychosis," "e-mental health," " e-support," and "telepsychiatry."
   Results: People experiencing schizophrenia spectrum disorders or other psychotic disorders wish to find on the Internet trustful, nonstigmatizing information about their disease, flexibility, security standards, and positive peer-to-peer exchanges. E-mental health also appears to be desired by a substantial proportion of them. In this field, the current developments towards intervention and early prevention in the areas of depression and bipolar and anxiety disorders become more and more operational for schizophrenia spectrum disorders and other psychotic disorders as well. The many benefits of the Internet as a source of information and support, such as empowerment, enhancement of self-esteem, relief from peer information, better social interactions, and more available care, seem to outbalance the difficulties.
   Conclusions: In this paper, after discussing the challenges related to the various aspects of the emergence of the Internet into the life of people experiencing schizophrenia spectrum disorders or other psychotic disorders, we will suggest areas of future research and practical recommendations for this major transition.

   The relationship between childhood adversity and bipolar affective disorder remains unclear.
   Aims
   To understand the size and significance of this effect through a statistical synthesis of reported research.
   Method
   Search terms relating to childhood adversity and bipolar disorder were entered into Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Eligible studies included a sample diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a comparison sample and a quantitative measure of childhood adversity.
   Results
   In 19 eligible studies childhood adversity was 2.63 times (95% CI 2.00-3.47) more likely to have occurred in bipolar disorder compared with non-clinical' controls. The effect of emotional abuse was particularly robust (OR=4.04, 95% CI 3.12-5.22), but rates of adversity were similar to those in psychiatric controls.
   Conclusions
   Childhood adversity is associated with bipolar disorder, which has implications for the treatment of this clinical group. Further prospective research could clarify temporal causality and explanatory mechanisms. Copyright and usage (C) The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2016.

AB  - The strategic or deliberate adoption of a cognitively distanced, third-person perspective is proposed to adaptively regulate emotions. However, studies of psychological disorders suggest spontaneous adoption of a third-person perspective reflects counter-productive avoidance. Here, we review studies that investigate the deliberate adoption of a third- or first-person vantage perspective and its impact on affect in healthy people, "sub-clinical" populations and those with psychological disorders. A systematic search was conducted across four databases. After exclusion criteria were applied, 38 studies were identified that investigated the impact of both imagery and verbal instructions designed to encourage adoption of a third-person perspective on self-reported affect. The identified studies examined a variety of outcomes related to recalling memories, imagining scenarios and mood induction. These were associated with specific negative emotions or mood states (dysphoria/sadness, anxiety, anger), mixed or neutral affect autobiographical memories, and self-conscious affect (e.g., guilt). Engaging a third-person perspective was generally associated with a reduction in the intensity of positive and negative affect. Studies that included measures of semantic change, suggested that this is a key mediator in reduction of affect following perspective change. Strategically adopting a "distanced," third-person perspective is linked to a reduction in affect intensity across valence, but in addition has the potential to introduce new information that regulates emotion via semantic change. Such reappraisal distinguishes deliberate adoption of a distanced perspective from the habitual and/or spontaneous shift in perspective that occurs in psychopathology.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies that examined the relationship between anxiety disorders, or clinically significant anxiety symptoms, at baseline and all-cause mortality at follow-up relative to control participants without clinically significant anxiety.
   PubMed, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and CINAHL were searched through July 2015, along with manual searches of published reviews and forward and backward snowball searches of included studies. Studies were excluded if anxiety was not defined with a standardized instrument, or if participants were followed-up for 1 year or less. The initial search yielded 7901 articles after the removal of duplicates, of which 328 underwent full-text screening.
   Forty-two estimates from 36 articles were included in the meta-analysis with a total sample of 127,552 participants and over 11,573 deaths. The overall hazard ratio (HR) estimate of mortality in clinically anxious participants relative to controls was 1.09 (95 % CI 1.01-1.16); however, this was reduced after adjusting for publication bias (1.03; 95 % CI 0.95-1.13). There was no evidence of increased mortality risk among anxious participants derived from community samples (0.99; 95 % CI 0.96-1.02) and in studies that adjusted for a diagnosis of depression (1.01; 95 % CI 0.96-1.06).
   These findings suggest that positive associations in the literature are attributable to studies in smaller samples, comorbid depression (or other psychiatric conditions) among participants, and possible confounding in medical patient samples followed-up for short durations.

AB  - Background Common mental disorders (CMD-burnout, stress, depression and anxiety disorders) are prevalent in physicians.
   Aims To investigate the relationship between CMD and medical incidents and/or unprofessional behaviour in hospital physicians.
   Methods PubMed was searched for all articles published between 2003 and 2013 that study a relationship between CMD and medical incidents and/or unprofessional behaviour in hospital physicians. The strength of evidence was assessed through five levels of evidence.
   Results We included 15 studies. We found strong evidence for a significant association between burnout and the occurrence of medical incidents, based on two longitudinal and seven cross-sectional studies with a positive association [odds ratio (OR) 1.07-5.5]; one longitudinal study found a non-significant association (strong evidence). For the association between depression and medical incidents, four longitudinal studies and three cross-sectional studies found a significant positive association (strong evidence; OR 2.21-3.29). For the association between fatigue and medical incidents, one longitudinal study and one cross-sectional study showed a significant positive association, but one cross-sectional study showed a non-significant association (strong evidence; OR 1.37). For the association between sleepiness and medical incidents, one longitudinal study and two cross-sectional studies showed a significant positive association (strong evidence; OR 1.10-1.37). No significant association was found between burnout and unprofessional behaviour (inconsistent evidence). Nor was any evidence found for the association between unprofessional behaviour and depression, fatigue or sleepiness.
   Conclusions CMD in hospital physicians were associated with the occurrence of self-reported medical incidents, but there was inconsistent evidence for unprofessional behaviour.

AB  - There is growing evidence of a relationship between inflammation and psychiatric illness. In particular, the cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been linked to stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety. Here we discuss evidence from preclinical and clinical studies examining the role of IL-6 in mood disorders. We focus on the functional role of peripheral and central release of IL-6 on the development of stress susceptibility and depression-associated behavior. By examining the contribution of both peripheral and central IL-6 to manifestations of stress-related symptomatology, we hope to broaden the way the field thinks about diagnosing and treating mood disorders.

This systematic review examines whether 8-week standardised and manualised mindfulness training programs such as Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) enhances attention, memory and executive function abilities measured by objective neuropsychological tests. Seven databases were searched resulting in 18 studies meeting inclusion criteria for review. Overall studies did not support attention or executive function improvements. We found preliminary evidence for improvements in working memory and autobiographical memory as well as cognitive flexibility and meta-awareness. Short-term mindfulness meditation training did not enhance theorised attentional pathways. Results call into question the theoretical underpinnings of mindfulness, further highlighting the need for a comprehensive theoretical framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electric current has been used for quite some time in the treatment of mental illness; however, less-invasive usercontrolled transcranial electrical neurostimulation (TEN) devices have begun to enter the market. Developers claim significant positive effects across a variety of physical and mental illnesses, as well as more mundane issues of stress and fatigue. However, the field is young and progressing rapidly, and no review of these claims has been conducted to date. This article summarizes the available evidence for user-controlled TEN devices, divided into three domains: efficacy/effectiveness, usability/safety, and mechanics. Limitations in the existing research base are noted and suggestions for future investigation are provided.

AB  - We completed a systematic review of the literature to characterize the impact of text messaging interventions on medication adherence or mental health related outcomes in people with mental health disorders including substance use. Four electronic databases were searched from January 1999 to October 2015. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria: three studies evaluated text messaging in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnosis, two studies evaluated text messaging in patients with chronic alcohol dependence, and two studies reviewed text messaging in patients with mood disorders. Six studies were randomized controlled trials and one was a prospective pilot study with pre-post intervention design. Text messaging frequency ranged from once weekly to twelve per day. The effect of text messaging on medication adherence was measured in five studies; one study reporting significant improvements in the text messaging intervention group. The effect of text messaging on mental health related outcomes was measured in all seven studies, with five studies showing significant improvements in a variety of psychiatric and social functioning assessments. Collectively, these studies suggest text messaging is a promising tool to support management of patients with mental illness. Further research examining theory-based text messaging interventions in larger samples of patients is required. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This meta-analysis aimed at gathering and summarising the findings on nonlinear biomarkers in the field of emotional disorders under the hypothesis that diseased systems show lowered complexity and hence less flexibility to adjust daily contexts. Scientific manuscripts from 1970 to 2014 were reviewed, 58 articles were analysed, and independent meta-analyses on anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, and depressive disorders were conducted. Results revealed that anxious patients exhibited lower complexity than controls (p < 0.05) despite panic patients showed more irregular respiratory activity. Inconclusive results were found for bipolar patients but pointed to higher randomness when suffering manic episodes. Finally, depressed patients showed a loss of complexity in the cardiac system and a loss of orderliness (despite a higher complexity) in brain and stress-related hormonal systems. As a conclusion, our findings highlight that either a loss of complexity or a loss of ordered complexity characterise the physiological systems of patients with emotional disorders. Several considerations for complexity, its related measurements, and suggestions for further research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) conducted a revision of the 2009 guidelines by updating the evidence and recommendations. The scope of the 2016 guidelines remains the management of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults, with a target audience of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.
   Methods: Using the question-answer format, we conducted a systematic literature search focusing on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Evidence was graded using CANMAT-defined criteria for level of evidence. Recommendations for lines of treatment were based on the quality of evidence and clinical expert consensus. This section on Special Populations is the sixth of six guidelines articles.
   Results: Recent studies inform the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, women in perimenopause or menopause, and the elderly. Evidence for efficacy of treatments in these populations is more limited than for the general adult population, however, and risks of treatment in these groups are often poorly studied and reported.
   Conclusions: Despite the limited evidence base, extant data and clinical experience suggest that each of these special populations can benefit from the systematic application of treatment guidelines for treatment of MDD.

AB  - Objective: The neurotransmitter serotonin is understood to control mood and drug response. Carrying a genetic variant in the serotonin transporter gene (5HTT) may increase the risk of major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence. Previous estimates of the association of the S allele of 5HTTLPR polymorphism with major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence have been inconsistent.
   Methods: For the systematic review, we used PubMed MEDLINE and Discovery of The University of Melbourne to search for all relevant case-control studies investigating the associations of 5HTTLPR polymorphism with major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence. Summary odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. To investigate whether year of publication, study population or diagnostic criteria used were potential sources of heterogeneity, we performed meta-regression analyses. Publication bias was assessed using Funnel plots and Egger's statistical tests.
   Results: We included 23 studies of major depressive disorder without alcohol dependence containing 3392 cases and 5093 controls, and 11 studies of alcohol dependence without major depressive disorder containing 2079 cases and 2273 controls. The summary OR for homozygote carriers of the S allele of 5HTTLPR polymorphism compared with heterozygote and non-carriers combined (SS vs SL+LL genotype) was 1.33 (95% CI=[1.19, 1.48]) for major depressive disorder and 1.18 (95% CI=[1.01, 1.38]) for alcohol dependence. The summary OR per S allele of 5HTTLPR polymorphism was 1.16 (95% CI=[1.08, 1.23]) for major depressive disorder and 1.12 (95% CI=[1.01, 1.23]) for alcohol dependence. Meta-regression models showed that the associations did not substantially change after adjusting for year of publication, study population and diagnostic criteria used. There was no evidence for publication bias of the studies included in our meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis confirms that individuals with the homozygous S allele of 5HTTLPR polymorphism are at increased risks of major depressive disorder as well as alcohol dependence. Further studies are required to investigate the association between 5HTTLPR polymorphism and the comorbidity of major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence as well as genexenvironmental interactions.

AB  - Background: First generation migrants are reportedly at higher risk of mental ill-health compared to the settled population. This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes all reviews on the mental health of first generation migrants in order to appraise the risk factors for, and explain differences in, the mental health of this population.
   Methods: Scientific databases were searched for systematic reviews (inception-November 2015) which provided quantitative data on the mental ill-health of first generation migrants and associated risk factors. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full text papers for their suitability against pre-specified criteria, methodological quality was assessed.
   Results: One thousand eight hundred twenty articles were identified, eight met inclusion criteria, which were all moderate or low quality. Depression was mostly higher in first generation migrants in general, and in refugees/asylum seekers when analysed separately. However, for both groups there was wide variation in prevalence rates, from 5 to 44 % compared with prevalence rates of 8-12 % in the general population. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder prevalence was higher for both first generation migrants in general and for refugees/asylum seekers compared with the settled majority. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder prevalence in first generation migrants in general and refugees/asylum seekers ranged from 9 to 36 % compared with reported prevalence rates of 1-2 % in the general population. Few studies presented anxiety prevalence rates in first generation migrants and there was wide variation in those that did. Prevalence ranged from 4 to 40 % compared with reported prevalence of 5 % in the general population. Two reviews assessed the psychotic disorder risk, reporting this was two to three times more likely in adult first generation migrants. However, one review on the risk of schizophrenia in refugees reported similar prevalence rates (2 %) to estimates of prevalence among the settled majority (3 %). Risk factors for mental ill-health included low Gross National Product in the host country, downward social mobility, country of origin, and host country.
   Conclusion: First generation migrants may be at increased risk of mental illness and public health policy must account for this and influencing factors. High quality research in the area is urgently needed as is the use of culturally specific validated measurement tools for assessing migrant mental health.

AB  - The uses of technology-delivered mental health treatment options, such as interventions delivered via computer, smart phone, or other communication or information devices, as opposed to primarily face-to-face interventions, are proliferating. However, the literature is unclear about their effectiveness as preventive interventions for higher education students, a population for whom technology-delivered interventions (TDIs) might be particularly fitting and beneficial. This meta-analytic review examines technological mental health prevention programs targeting higher education students either without any presenting problems (universal prevention) or with mild to moderate subclinical problems (indicated prevention). A systematic literature search identified 22 universal and 26 indicated controlled interventions, both published and unpublished, involving 4763 college, graduate, or professional students. As hypothesized, the overall mean effect sizes (ESs) for both universal (0.19) and indicated interventions (0.37) were statistically significant and differed significantly from each other favoring indicated interventions. Skill-training interventions, both universal (0.21) and indicated (0.31), were significant, whereas non-skill-training interventions were only significant among indicated (0.25) programs. For indicated interventions, better outcomes were obtained in those cases in which participants had access to support during the course of the intervention, either in person or through technology (e.g., email, online contact). The positive findings for both universal and indicated prevention are qualified by limitations of the current literature. To improve experimental rigor, future research should provide detailed information on the level of achieved implementation, describe participant characteristics and intervention content, explore the impact of potential moderators and mechanisms of success, collect post-intervention and follow-up data regardless of intervention completion, and use analysis strategies that allow for inclusion of cases with partially missing data.

AB  - Major depression is a serious disorder of impaired emotion regulation. Emotion hyperactivity leads to excessive negative ruminations that daily hijack the patients mental life, impacting their mood. Evidence from past researches suggest that depressive patients present several cognitive impairments in attention and working memory, leading to a more acute selective attention for negative stimuli and a greater accessibility of negative memories. Recently, is has been proposed that impaired inhibitory functioning with regard to emotional information processing might be one of the mechanisms of ruminations linking memory, attention and depression. It seems that inhibition deficit is present at both the input level (i.e., the ability to reduce the interference from emotional distracters) and the higher level (i.e., the ability to direct the attention away from emotional material that has already been processed) of emotional information processing. Event-related potentials (ERP) have widely been used to study inhibition in adults suffering from various psychopathological states. In particular, depressive disorder has been linked to ERPs modulations, at early as well as at latter stages of the information-processing stream, when processing affective material. For instance, deficits in inhibiting negative information have been indexed by changes in the parameters (amplitudes and latencies) of early P2, P1 and N1 components while other ERP studies have shown an ability to differentiate depressed patients from normal controls based upon response inhibition difficulties in go-nogo tasks, indexed by later NoGo P3 differences. In this review, we will focus on results of ERP studies investigating inhibition and its interaction with emotional related cue processing in depressive populations. Implications for future research and theoretical perspectives will be discussed within the framework of current models of depressive disorder, based upon the hypothesis that negative ruminations are at the center of depression processes.

AB  - Background: Bipolar disorder refers to a group of chronic psychiatric disorders of mood and energy levels. While dramatic psychiatric symptoms dominate the acute phase of the diseases, the chronic course is often determined by an increasing burden of co-occurring medical conditions. High rates of diabetes mellitus in patients with bipolar disorder are particularly striking, yet unexplained. Treatment and lifestyle factors could play a significant role, and some studies also suggest shared pathophysiology and risk factors.
   Objective: In this systematic literature review, we explored data around the relationship between bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus in recently published population-based cohort studies with special focus on the elderly.
   Methods: A systematic search in the PubMed database for the combined terms "bipolar disorder" AND "elderly" AND "diabetes" in papers published between January 2009 and December 2015 revealed 117 publications; 7 studies were large cohort studies, and therefore, were included in our review.
   Results: We found that age-and gender-adjusted risk for diabetes mellitus was increased in patients with bipolar disorder and vice versa (odds ratio range between 1.7 and 3.2).
   Discussion: Our results in large population-based cohort studies are consistent with the results of smaller studies and chart reviews. Even though it is likely that heterogeneous risk factors may play a role in diabetes mellitus and in bipolar disorder, growing evidence from cell culture experiments and animal studies suggests shared disease mechanisms. Furthermore, disease-modifying effects of bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus on each other appear to be substantial, impacting both treatment response and outcomes.
   Conclusions: The risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with bipolar disorder is increased. Our findings add to the growing literature on this topic. Increasing evidence for shared disease mechanisms suggests new disease models that could explain the results of our study. A better understanding of the complex relationship between bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus could lead to novel therapeutic approaches and improved outcomes.

AB  - Background: There is a growing body of evidence relating to how information and communication technology (ICT) can be used to support people with physical health conditions. Less is known regarding mental health, and in particular, mood disorder.
   Objective: To conduct a metasynthesis of all qualitative studies exploring the use of ICTs by people with mood disorder.
   Methods: Searches were run in eight electronic databases using a systematic search strategy. Qualitative and mixed-method studies published in English between 2007 and 2014 were included. Thematic synthesis was used to interpret and synthesis the results of the included studies.
   Results: Thirty-four studies were included in the synthesis. The methodological design of the studies was qualitative or mixed-methods. A global assessment of study quality identified 22 studies as strong and 12 weak with most having a typology of findings either at topical or thematic survey levels of data transformation. A typology of ICT use by people with mood disorder was created as a result of synthesis.
   Conclusions: The systematic review and metasynthesis clearly identified a gap in the research literature as no studies were identified, which specifically researched how people with mood disorder use mobile ICT. Further qualitative research is recommended to understand the meaning this type of technology holds for people. Such research might provide valuable information on how people use mobile technology in their lives in general and also, more specifically, how they are being used to help with their mood disorders.

AB  - Children who experience chronic stressors are vulnerable to emotional and physical health problems across the lifespan. This phenomenon raises questions for scientists and clinicians alike. How does adversity get under the skin of the developing child? Through what mechanisms does it confer vulnerability to a heterogeneous set of mental and physical illnesses? And how does it instantiate risk across different life stages, engendering vulnerability to conditions that develop shortly after stressor exposure-like depression-and conditions that manifest decades later, like heart disease? Although answers to these questions have started to emerge, research has typically focused on single diseases or organ systems. To understand the plethora of health problems associated with childhood adversity, we argue that the field needs a second generation of research that recognizes multidirectional transactions among biological systems. To help facilitate this process, we propose a neuroimmune network hypothesis as a heuristic framework for organizing knowledge from disparate literatures and as a springboard for generating integrative research. Drawing on existing data, we argue that early-life adversity amplifies crosstalk between peripheral inflammation and neural circuitries subserving threat-related, reward-related, and executive control-related processes. This crosstalk results in chronic low-grade inflammation, thereby contributing to adiposity, insulin resistance, and other predisease states. In the brain, inflammatory mediators act on cortico-amygdala threat and cortico-basal ganglia reward, circuitries in a manner that predisposes individuals to self-medicating behaviors like smoking, drug use, and consumption of high-fat diets. Acting in concert with inflammation, these behaviors accelerate the pathogenesis of emotional and physical health problems.

AB  - Youths exposed to armed conflict have a higher prevalence of mental health and psychosocial difficulties. Diverse interventions exist that aim to ameliorate the effect of armed conflict on the psychological and psychosocial wellbeing of conflict affected youths. However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of these interventions is limited. Using standard review methodology, this review aims to address the effectiveness of psychological interventions employed among this population. The search was performed across four databases and grey literature. Article quality was assessed using the Downs and Black Quality Checklist (1998). Where possible, studies were subjected to meta-analyses. The remaining studies were included in a narrative synthesis. Eight studies concerned non clinical populations, while nine concerned clinical populations. Review findings conclude that Group Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is effective for reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and improving prosocial behaviour among clinical cohorts. The evidence does not suggest that interventions aimed at non clinical groups within this population are effective. Despite high quality studies, further robust trials are required to strengthen the evidence base, as a lack of replication has resulted in a limited evidence base to inform practice.

AB  - Background: A fragmented research field exists on the prevalence of anxiety disorders. Here, we present the results of a systematic review of reviews on this topic. We included the highest quality studies to inform practice and policy on this issue. Method: Using PRISMA methodology, extensive electronic and manual citation searches were performed to identify relevant reviews. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken by two reviewers. Inclusion criteria consisted of systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the prevalence of anxiety disorders that fulfilled at least half of the AMSTAR quality criteria. Results: We identified a total of 48 reviews and described the prevalence of anxiety across population subgroups and settings, as reported by these studies. Despite the high heterogeneity of prevalence estimates across primary studies, there was emerging and compelling evidence of substantial prevalence of anxiety disorders generally (3.8-25%), and particularly in women (5.2-8.7%); young adults (2.5-9.1%); people with chronic diseases (1.4-70%); and individuals from Euro/Anglo cultures (3.8-10.4%) versus individuals from Indo/Asian (2.8%), African (4.4%), Central/Eastern European (3.2%), North African/Middle Eastern (4.9%), and Ibero/Latin cultures (6.2%). Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety disorders is high in population subgroups across the globe. Recent research has expanded its focus to Asian countries, an increasingly greater number of physical and psychiatric conditions, and traumatic events associated with anxiety. Further research on illness trajectories and anxiety levels pre- and post-treatment is needed. Few studies have been conducted in developing and under-developed parts of the world and have little representation in the global literature.

AB  - Objective: There are mounting calls for bipolar disorder to be managed in primary care, yet the exact prevalence remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of bipolar disorder in general primary care attendees without other comorbid psychiatric diagnosis.
   Method: We systematically searched major electronic databases from inception till 03/2015. Articles were included that reported the prevalence of bipolar disorder determined in line with structured clinical assessment in primary care settings. Two independent authors conducted searches, completed methodological appraisal and extracted data. A random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed.
   Results: Sixteen studies were included accounting for 425,691 participants (mean age = 41.1years [standard deviation = 7.2 years] 33.3% males). Overall, the global prevalence of bipolar disorder was 1.9% (95% confidence interval = [0.6, 5.4]). The prevalence of bipolar disorder in studies recording a current diagnosis was 3.7% (95% confidence interval = [1.9, 6.0]) and 0.7% (95% confidence interval = [0.2, 1.5]) in studies considering a 12-month period. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder appeared higher in North America (3.7%, 95% confidence interval = [0.9, 8.1]) compared to Europe (0.8%, 95% confidence interval = [0.3, 1.5]). Meta-regression suggests that a more recent publication date (co-efficient=0.089, 95% confidence interval = [0.0173, 0.1654], z=2.19, p=0.01, R-2=0.21) and younger age of participants (co-efficient -0.0851, 95% confidence interval = [-0.1696, 0.005], z=-1.97, p=0.04, R-2=0.24) moderated a higher prevalence of bipolar disorder.
   Conclusion: The global prevalence of bipolar disorder in primary care is 1.9%, with potentially higher prevalence rates in North America compared to Europe. A more recent study publication date is a significant predictor of higher prevalence of bipolar disorder. Potential reasons/drivers of this are considered within the text.

AB  - Neuropsychological and psychiatric disorders represent a major concern and cause of disabilities after the trauma, contributing to worse recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the lack of well-defined parameters to evaluate patient's psychiatric disorders leads to a wide range of diagnoses and symptoms. The aim of this study was to perform a review of literature in order to gather data of the most common scales and inventories used to assess and diagnose depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after TBI. We conducted a literature search via MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science. We included reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis studies, and we used the following keywords: "traumatic brain injury OR TBI," "depression OR depressive disorder," "anxiety," and "posttraumatic stress disorder OR PTSD." From 610 titles, a total of 68 systematic reviews or meta-analysis were included in the section "Results" of this review: depression (n = 32), anxiety (n = 9), and PTSD (n = 27). Depression after TBI is a more established condition, with more homogeneous studies. Anxiety and PTSD disorders have been studied in a heterogeneous way, usually as comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Some scales and inventories designed for the general community may not be appropriate for patients with TBI.

AB  - Although emotion and cognition were considered to be separate aspects of the psyche in the past, researchers today have demonstrated the existence of an interplay between the two processes. Emotional intelligence (EI), or the ability to perceive, use, understand, and regulate emotions, is a relatively young concept that attempts to connect both emotion and cognition. While El has been demonstrated to be positively related to well-being, mental and physical health, and non-aggressive behaviors, little is known about its underlying cognitive processes. The aim of the present study was to systematically review available evidence about the relationship between El and cognitive processes as measured through "cool" (i.e., not emotionally laden) and "hot" (i.e., emotionally laden) laboratory tasks. We searched Scopus and Medline to find relevant articles in Spanish and English, and divided the studies following two variables: cognitive processes (hot vs. cool) and El instruments used (performance-based ability test, self-report ability test, and self-report mixed test). We identified 26 eligible studies. The results provide a fair amount of evidence that performance-based ability El (but not self-report El tests) is positively related with efficiency in hot cognitive tasks. El, however, does not appear to be related with cool cognitive tasks: neither through self-reporting nor through performance-based ability instruments. These findings suggest that performance-based ability El could improve individuals' emotional information processing abilities.

AB  - Trafficking is a global human rights violation with multiple and complex mental health consequences. Valid and reliable mental health assessment tools are needed to inform health-care provision. We reviewed mental health assessment tools used in research with men and women trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation. We searched nine electronic databases (PsycINFO, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Embase, Assia, the Web of Science, Global Health, Google Scholar, and Open Grey) and hand-searched the reference lists of relevant identified studies. Seven studies were included in this Review. Six of the studies screened for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety; one study screened for harmful use or abuse of alcohol and used a diagnostic tool to assess post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Two studies included men in their sample population. Although the reported prevalence of mental health problems was high, little information was provided about the validity, reliability, and cultural appropriateness of assessment tools. Further research is needed to determine which assessment tools are culturally appropriate, valid, and reliable for trafficked people.

AB  - Objective: Amidst a growing concern regarding concussion in sports, there is an emerging link between sport concussion and mental health outcomes. This review summarizes the current literature addressing long-term psychiatric sequelae associated with sport concussion in adults.
   Method: Several databases were searched using a broad list of keywords for each of concussion, sports, and mental health, with a resultant 311 studies for initial review. After limiting studies based on duplication, appropriateness of data, and relevance, 21 studies remained pertaining to depression, anxiety, substance use, and behavioural changes, including those highlighting chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
   Results: Most studies identified suggested an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms related to concussion history. A conference abstract and qualitative study suggested increasing anxiety related to concussion history; however, a PhD dissertation found no relationship. In reviewing substance use, several studies mentioned use in athletes suspected of having concussion histories, although no link was established, while another noted undiagnosed concussion as leading to current substance misuse. Regarding behavioural changes, all studies identified occurrences of behaviour and/or cognitive changes in participants, with 2 studies suggesting a link with concussion history. With respect to CTE, concerns with mood, behaviour, cognition, and substance use were consistently highlighted, suggesting relations to previous sport concussion; however, the notion of different CTE subtypes and clear aetiology behind concussion severity or frequency was not consistently elucidated.
   Conclusion: There appears to be a growing body of evidence supporting the presence of long-term psychiatric and psychological sequelae following sport concussion in adults.

AB  - Evidence supports inflammatory involvement in mood and cognitive symptoms across psychiatric, neurological and medical disorders; however, inflammation is not a sensitive or specific characteristic of these diagnoses. The National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) ask for a shift away from symptom-based diagnoses toward a transdiagnostic neurobiological focus in the study of brain illnesses. The RDoC matrix may provide a useful framework for integrating the effects of inflammation on brain function. Based on preclinical and clinical findings, relevant relationships span negative and positive valence systems, cognitive systems, systems for social processes and arousal/regulatory systems. As an exemplar, we consider the psychopathological domain of anhedonia, conceptualizing the relevance of inflammation (e.g., cellular immunity) and downstream processes (e.g., indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activation and oxidative inactivation of tetrahydrobiopterin) across RDoC units of analysis (e.g., catecholamine neurotransmitter molecules, nucleus accumbens medium spiny neuronal cells, dopaminergic mesolimbic and mesocortical reward circuits, animal paradigms, etc.). We discuss implications across illnesses affecting the brain, including infection, major depressive disorder, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Bipolar disorder affects up to one in 25 individuals and identification of early risk indicators of negative outcomes could facilitate early detection of patients with greatest clinical needs and risk. We aimed to investigate the association between childhood maltreatment and key negative outcomes in patients with bipolar disorder.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase to identify articles published before Jan 1, 2015, examining the association of maltreatment (physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, neglect, or family conflict) before age 18 years with clinical features and course of illness in bipolar disorder. Data were extracted from published reports and any missing information was requested from investigators. We did 12 independent random-effects meta-analyses to quantify the associations between childhood maltreatment and course of illness or clinical features.
   Findings We initially identified 527 records and after unsuitable studies were removed, our search yielded 148 publications of which 30 were used in the meta-analysis. Patients with bipolar disorder and history of childhood maltreatment had greater mania severity (six studies, 780 participants; odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.21-3.39, p=0.008), greater depression severity (eight studies, 1007 participants; 1.57, 1.25-1.99, p=0.0001), greater psychosis severity (seven studies, 1494 participants; 1.49, 1.10-2.04, p=0.011), higher risk of comorbidity with post-traumatic stress disorder (eight studies, 2494 participants; 3.60, 2.45-5.30, p<0.0001), anxiety disorders (seven studies, 5091 participants; 1.90, 1.39-2.61, p<0.0001), substance misuse disorders (11 studies, 5469 participants; 1.84, 1.41-2.39, p<0.0001), alcohol misuse disorder (eight studies, 5040 participants; 1.44, 1.13-1.83, p=0.003), earlier age of bipolar disorder onset (14 studies, 5733 participants; 1.85, 1.43-2.40, p<0.0001), higher risk of rapid cycling (eight studies, 3010 participants; 1.89, 1.45-2.48, p<0.0001), greater number of manic episodes (seven studies, 3909 participants; 1.26, 1.09-1.47, p=0.003), greater number of depressive episodes (eight studies, 4025 participants; 1.38, 1.07-1.79, p=0.013), and higher risk of suicide attempt (13 studies, 3422 participants; 2.25, 1.88-2.70, p<0.0001) compared with those with bipolar disorder without childhood maltreatment. Overall, these associations were not explained by publication bias, undue effects of individual studies, or variation in study quality.
   Interpretation Childhood maltreatment predicts unfavourable clinical features and course of illness in patients with bipolar disorder.

AB  - Background: One relatively new and increasingly popular approach of increasing access to treatment is Web-based intervention programs. The advantage of Web-based approaches is the accessibility, affordability, and anonymity of potentially evidence-based treatment. Despite much research evidence on the effectiveness of Web-based interventions for anxiety found in the literature, little is known about what is publically available for potential consumers on the Web.
   Objective: Our aim was to explore what a consumer searching the Web for Web-based intervention options for anxiety-related issues might find. The objectives were to identify currently publically available Web-based intervention programs for anxiety and to synthesize and review these in terms of (1) website characteristics such as credibility and accessibility; (2) intervention program characteristics such as intervention focus, design, and presentation modes; (3) therapeutic elements employed; and (4) published evidence of efficacy.
   Methods: Web keyword searches were carried out on three major search engines (Google, Bing, and Yahoo-UK platforms). For each search, the first 25 hyperlinks were screened for eligible programs. Included were programs that were designed for anxiety symptoms, currently publically accessible on the Web, had an online component, a structured treatment plan, and were available in English. Data were extracted for website characteristics, program characteristics, therapeutic characteristics, as well as empirical evidence. Programs were also evaluated using a 16-point rating tool.
   Results: The search resulted in 34 programs that were eligible for review. A wide variety of programs for anxiety, including specific anxiety disorders, and anxiety in combination with stress, depression, or anger were identified and based predominantly on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. The majority of websites were rated as credible, secure, and free of advertisement. The majority required users to register and/or to pay a program access fee. Half of the programs offered some form of paid therapist or professional support. Programs varied in treatment length and number of modules and employed a variety of presentation modes. Relatively few programs had published research evidence of the intervention's efficacy.
   Conclusions: This review represents a snapshot of available Web-based intervention programs for anxiety that could be found by consumers in March 2015. The consumer is confronted with a diversity of programs, which makes it difficult to identify an appropriate program. Limited reports and existence of empirical evidence for efficacy make it even more challenging to identify credible and reliable programs. This highlights the need for consistent guidelines and standards on developing, providing, and evaluating Web-based interventions and platforms with reliable up-to-date information for professionals and consumers about the characteristics, quality, and accessibility of Web- based interventions.

AB  - Background
   Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is a putative underlying mechanism for increased cardiovascular disease risk in individuals with psychiatric disorders. Previous studies suggest that this risk may be related to psychotropic medication use. In the present study we systematically reviewed and analyzed published studies of heart rate variability (HRV), measuring ANS output, to determine the effect of psychiatric illness and medication use.
   Methods
   We searched for studies comparing HRV in physically healthy adults with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder to controls and comparing HRV pre- and post-treatment with a psychotropic medication.
   Results
   In total, 140 case-control (mood, anxiety, psychosis, dependent disorders, k = 151) and 30 treatment (antidepressants, antipsychotics; k = 43) studies were included. We found that HRV was reduced in all patient groups compared to controls (Hedges g = -0.583) with a large effect for psychotic disorders (Hedges g = -0.948). Effect sizes remained highly significant for medication-free patients compared to controls across all disorders. Smaller and significant reductions in HRV were observed for specific antidepressants and antipsychotics.
   Limitations
   Study quality significantly moderated effect sizes in case-control analyses, underscoring the importance of assessing methodological quality when interpreting HRV findings.
   Conclusion
   Combined findings confirm substantial reductions in HRV across psychiatric disorders, and these effects remained significant even in medication-free individuals. Reductions in HRV may therefore represent a significant mechanism contributing to elevated cardiovascular risk in individuals with psychiatric disorders. The negative impact of specific medications on HRV suggest increased risk for cardiovascular disease in these groups, highlighting a need for treatment providers to consider modifiable cardiovascular risk factors to attenuate this risk.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, which can be used to selectively disrupt patterns of neural activity that are associated with symptoms of mental illness. tDCS has been implemented in numerous therapeutic trials across a range of patient populations, with a rapidly increasing number of studies being published each year. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tDCS in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Four electronic databases were searched from inception until December 2015 by two independent reviewers, and 66 eligible studies were identified. Depression was the most extensively researched condition, followed by schizophrenia and substance use disorders. Data on obsessive compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, and anorexia nervosa were also obtained. The quality of included studies was appraised using a standardised assessment framework, which yielded a median score corresponding to "weak" on the three-point scale. This improved to "moderate" when case reports/series were excluded from the analysis. Overall, data suggested that tDCS interventions comprising multiple sessions can ameliorate symptoms of several major psychiatric disorders, both acutely and in the long-term. Nevertheless, the tDCS field is still in its infancy, and several methodological and ethical issues must be addressed before clinical efficacy can truly be determined. Studies probing the mechanisms of action of tDCS and those facilitating the definition of optimised stimulation protocols are warranted. Furthermore, evidence from large-scale, multi centre randomised controlled trials is required if the transition of this therapy from the laboratory to the clinic is to be considered.

AB  - BackgroundDepression and anxiety are two common mental health problems among older people. There is evidence that using well-validated screening tools can improve detection of depression and anxiety among this group. The review explored the use of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) for screening depression and anxiety among older Chinese immigrants, one of the largest and fastest growing groups of older immigrants in Western society. It focused on the GDS and GAI because both are designed specifically for older people.
   MethodsOnline literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. A narrative approach was used to review included papers.
   ResultsA total of 21 articles were included. There were limited data on anxiety among older Chinese immigrants, with only one unpublished report identified. There were 13 studies (20 articles) using the GDS with this group. Results of these studies indicated that the GDS is a reliable tool in this population; however, there was limited validity data. Two versions of the GDS-15 have been used with older Chinese immigrants, including the standard GDS-15 and Mui's GDS-15. Prevalence of depression ranged between 20% and 30% in most reviewed studies.
   DiscussionResults of this review have practical implications for clinicians in their use of these tools with older Chinese immigrants in Western countries, such as the different GDS versions. It also suggests a number of directions for future research, such as the inclusion of clinical samples and consideration of the diversity within this group.

AB  - Background: The number of mental health apps (MHapps) developed and now available to smartphone users has increased in recent years. MHapps and other technology-based solutions have the potential to play an important part in the future of mental health care; however, there is no single guide for the development of evidence-based MHapps. Many currently available MHapps lack features that would greatly improve their functionality, or include features that are not optimized Furthermore, MHapp developers rarely conduct or publish trial-based experimental validation of their apps. Indeed, a previous systematic review revealed a complete lack of trial-based evidence for many of the hundreds of MHapps available.
   Objective: To guide future MHapp development, a set of clear, practical, evidence-based recommendations is presented for MHapp developers to create better, more rigorous apps.
   Methods: A literature review was conducted, scrutinizing research across diverse fields, including mental health interventions, preventative health, mobile health, and mobile app design.
   Results: Sixteen recommendations were formulated. Evidence for each recommendation is discussed, and guidance on how these recommendations might be integrated into the overall design of an MHapp is offered. Each recommendation is rated on the basis of the strength of associated evidence. It is important to design an MHapp using a behavioral plan and interactive framework that encourages the user to engage with the app; thus, it may not be possible to incorporate all 16 recommendations into a single MHapp.
   Conclusions: Randomized controlled trials are required to validate future MHapps and the principles upon which they are designed, and to further investigate the recommendations presented in this review. Effective MHapps are required to help prevent mental health problems and to ease the burden on health systems.

AB  - Background: Research has shown that participatory music programs can encourage positive health and well-being outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of participatory music programs, which aim to promote positive mental and physical health and well-being outcomes for young people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, characterized as at-risk. Method: The databases EBSCOhost, ProQuest, SCOPUS, HRCA, Informit, JSTOR, SAGE and OVID were searched for literature published between 2002 and 2013. Outcomes from studies were plotted against the Shultz and Northridge's Social Determinants of Health framework (2005). Results: In total, six sources were included in this review. The majority of music participation programs targeted toward young people characterized as at-risk possess positive outcomes on the Proximate and Health and Well-being levels of the SDOH framework, such as a reduction in anxiety, depression, emotional alienation, truancy and aggression. Additionally, participants in programs reported an increase in attendance in school, self-esteem, cultural empathy, confidence, personal empowerment and healthy nutrition. Conclusion: Results suggest that participation in music programs is able to encourage positive mental and psychosocial health outcomes for individuals. Considering the short-term focus of programs reviewed, and limitations surrounding data analysis and collection, this paper underscores the need for rigorous research that explores the potential long-term outcomes of similar programs.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a systematic literature review of animal and human studies reporting anxiolytic or antidepressive effects of ayahuasca or some of its isolated alkaloids (dimethyltryptamine, harmine, tetrahydroharmine, and harmaline).
   Methods: Papers published until 3 April 2015 were retrieved from the PubMed, LILACS and SciELO databases following a comprehensive search strategy and using a predetermined set of criteria for article selection.
   Results: Five hundred and fourteen studies were identified, of which 21 met the established criteria. Studies in animals have shown anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca, harmine, and harmaline, and experimental studies in humans and mental health assessments of experienced ayahuasca consumers also suggest that ayahuasca is associated with reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms. A pilot study reported rapid antidepressive effects of a single ayahuasca dose in six patients with recurrent depression.
   Conclusion: Considering the need for new drugs that produce fewer adverse effects and are more effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptomatology, the described effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids should be further investigated.

AB  - The burgeoning field of gene-by-environment (G x E) interactions has revealed fascinating biological insights, particularly in the realm of stress-, anxiety-, and depression-related disorders. In this review we present an integrated view of the study of GxE interactions in stress and anxiety disorders, including the evolution of genetic association studies from genetic epidemiology to contemporary large-scale genome-wide association studies and GxE studies. We convey the importance of consortia efforts and collaboration to gain the large sample sizes needed to move the field forward. Finally, we discuss several robust and well-reproduced GxE interactions and demonstrate how epidemiological identification of GxE interactions has naturally led to a plethora of basic research elucidating the mechanisms of high-impact genetic variants.

AB  - Mood and anxiety disorders are prevalent conditions affecting one out of four people during lifetime. The development of high validity animal models to study these disorders has been a major challenge in the past. When considering experimental approaches for studying affective disorders, the social defeat paradigm has been shown to have etiological, predictive and face validity. Here, we explain the general principle of social defeat stress paradigms, with a strong focus on the resident-intruder model and compare different experimental settings as published to date. We discuss behavioral changes described in defeated animals as well as changes in the animal's physiological parameters. In addition, we provide an overview of the molecular adaptations that are found in animals subjected to defeat stress, with special attention to neural circuits and neuroendocrine signaling. Defeat produces specific behaviors resembling the signs and symptoms of humans with affective disorders, such as anhedonia, social avoidance, despair and anxiety. These can be linked to a wide range of physiological changes-ranging from cardiovascular changes to alterations in the immune system- or by disturbances in specific neurotransmitter systems, in particular serotonin and dopamine. The defeat stress model thus impacts on several functional domains of behavior and may mimic cardinal features of a multitude of psychiatric disorders including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia. This manuscript critically reviews the core findings, strengths and limitations of the range of animal studies in this field and provides future perspectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The NESARC, a "third-generation" psychiatric epidemiologic survey that integrated detailed measures of alcohol and drug use and problems has been the data source for over > 850 publications. A comprehensive review of NESARC findings and their implications is lacking.
   NESARC was a survey of 43,093 participants that covered alcohol, drug and psychiatric disorders, risk factors, and consequences. Wave 1 of the NESARC was conducted in 2001-2002. Three years later, Wave 2 follow-up re-interviews were conducted with 34,653 of the original participants. Scopus and Pubmed were used to search for NESARC papers, which were sorted into topic areas and summarized.
   The most common disorders were alcohol and posttraumatic stress disorders, and major depression. Females had more internalizing disorders and males had more externalizing disorders, although the preponderance of males with alcohol disorders (the "gender gap") was less pronounced than it was in previous decades. A race/ethnic "paradox" (lower risk among disadvantaged minorities than whites) remains unexplained. Younger participants had higher risk for substance and personality disorders, but not unipolar depressive or anxiety disorders. Psychiatric comorbidity was extensive and often formed latent trans-diagnostic domains. Since 1991-1992, risk for marijuana and prescription drug disorders increased, while smoking decreased, although smoking decreases were less pronounced among those with comorbidity. A nexus of comorbidity, social support, and stress predicted transitions in diagnostic status between Waves 1 and 2. Childhood maltreatment predicted psychopathology. Alcohol and drug use disorders were seldom treated; attitudinal barriers (little perceived need, perceived alcoholism stigma, pessimism about efficacy) were more important in predicting non-treatment than financial barriers.
   Understanding comorbidity and the effects of early stressors will require research incorporating biologic components, e.g., genetic variants and brain imaging. The lack of treatment for alcohol and drug disorders, predicted by attitudinal rather than financial variables, suggests an urgent need for public and professional education to reduce the stigma associated with these disorders and increase knowledge of treatment options.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the effect of induced negative and positive mood on meal consumption in healthy participants and patients with eating and weight disorders.
   Method: The search term "MOOD" was combined with the following keywords: "TEST MEAL" or "LABORATORY FEEDING" or "LABORATORY MEAL" or "TASTE TEST" or "TASTE TASK" to identify the relevant studies.
   Results: Thirty-three studies were selected, including 2491 participants. Two meta-analyses compared negative mood or positive mood with neutral mood. Induced negative mood was significantly associated with greater food intake, especially in restrained eaters and binge eaters. Positive mood was also associated with greater caloric intake across groups.
   Conclusion: These findings support the causal relationship between negative mood and greater food intake, especially in restrained eaters and binge eaters. Preliminary evidence indicates that strategies to improve positive mood might be of benefit for people with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, although the size of the effect across a single meal is small.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders are increasingly being recognised as having a biological basis, but their diagnosis is made exclusively behaviourally. A promising approach for 'biomarker' discovery has been based on pattern recognition methods applied to neuroimaging data, which could yield clinical utility in future. In this review we survey the literature on pattern recognition for making diagnostic predictions in psychiatric disorders, and evaluate progress made in translating such findings towards clinical application. We evaluate studies on many criteria, including data modalities used, the types of features extracted and algorithm applied. We identify problems common to many studies, such as a relatively small sample size and a primary focus on estimating generalisability within a single study. Furthermore, we highlight challenges that are not widely acknowledged in the field including the importance of accommodating disease prevalence, the necessity of more extensive validation using large carefully acquired samples, the need for methodological innovations to improve accuracy and to discriminate between multiple disorders simultaneously. Finally, we identify specific clinical contexts in which pattern recognition can add value in the short to medium term. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective To provide a review of the literature comparing anxious and depressive symptoms in caregivers of children with asthma with caregivers of healthy children. Method A systematic search identified 25 studies from 17 articles, reporting outcomes on 4,300 caregivers of children with asthma and 25,064 caregivers of healthy children. Results Overall, anxious (d = 0.50) and depressive symptoms (d = 0.44) were higher in caregivers of children with asthma compared with caregivers of healthy children. Age, site of recruitment, and whether the asthma diagnosis was medically confirmed were included as potential moderators. The relationship between parental psychopathology and asthma was stronger in those with medically confirmed asthma and participants recruited from clinical settings. Other moderators were not significant. Conclusions Caregivers of children with asthma appear to have greater anxious and depressive symptoms than caregivers of healthy children, but the reasons are unclear. More research that investigates modifiable factors that may moderate this association is urgently needed.

AB  - A systematic review of literature reporting prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression amongst community samples of resettled Iraqi refugees was undertaken. A search of the electronic databases of Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL, PILOTS, Scopus, and Cochrane, up to November 2013 was conducted. Following the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, eight empirical papers were included in the review and analysis. Specifically, six studies reported on PTSD prevalence (total n = 1,912), which ranged from 8 to 37.2 % and seven studies reported on rates of depression (total n = 1,647) noted to be 28.3 to 75 %. The overall interobserver agreement for the methodological quality assessment was good to excellent with a Kappa coefficient of 0.64. Iraqi refugees continue to represent one of the largest groups being resettled worldwide. This systematic review indicates that prevalence of PTSD and depression is high and should be taken into consideration when developing mental health early intervention and treatment services.

AB  - Psychodynamic therapy (PDT) is an umbrella concept for treatments that operate on an interpretive-supportive continuum and is frequently used in clinical practice. The use of any form of psychotherapy should be supported by sufficient evidence. Efficacy research has been neglected in PDT for a long time. In this review, we describe methodological requirements for proofs of efficacy and summarise the evidence for use of PDT to treat mental health disorders. After specifying the requirements for superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence trials, we did a systematic search using the following criteria: randomised controlled trial of PDT; use of treatment manuals or manual-like guidelines; use of reliable and valid measures for diagnosis and outcome; adults treated for specific mental problems. We identified 64 randomised controlled trials that provide evidence for the efficacy of PDT in common mental health disorders. Studies sufficiently powered to test for equivalence to established treatments did not find substantial differences in efficacy. These results were corroborated by several meta-analyses that suggest PDT is as efficacious as treatments established in efficacy. More randomised controlled trials are needed for some mental health disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, more adequately powered equivalence trials are needed.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the literature about the symptom of rumination in bipolar disorder (BD).
   Methods: We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed), ISI Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO, and SciELO databases using the descriptors "rumination'' and "bipolar disorder'' and no time limits. This strategy yielded 105 references, of which 74 were selected. Inclusion criteria were studies involving patients with BD and the use of at least one validated scale for the assessment of rumination. Review articles were excluded. Seventeen articles were ultimately analyzed and included in the review.
   Results: Rumination is present in all BD phases, is a stable interepisodic symptom, is associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hypomania, and may occur in response to both positive and negative affect. There is no research on rumination and neurobiological findings in patients with BD.
   Conclusions: Rumination seems to be independent of mood state, but shows close relationship with it. It is possible that rumination has a negative impact on cognitive and executive functions, particularly inhibitory control. Finally, rumination is an important symptom in both phases of BD, and, therefore, may be a useful target for further exploration as a dimensional domain and a transdiagnostic phenomenon in Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) projects.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this paper was to systematically review and meta-analyse the prevalence of co-morbid psychiatric disorders (DSM-IV Axis I disorders) among treatment-seeking problem gamblers.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted for peer-reviewed studies that provided prevalence estimates of Axis I psychiatric disorders in individuals seeking psychological or pharmacological treatment for problem gambling (including pathological gambling). Meta-analytic techniques were performed to estimate the weighted mean effect size and heterogeneity across studies.
   Results: Results from 36 studies identified high rates of co-morbid current (74.8%, 95% CI 36.5-93.9) and lifetime (75.5%, 95% CI 46.5-91.8) Axis I disorders. There were high rates of current mood disorders (23.1%, 95% CI 14.9-34.0), alcohol use disorders (21.2%, 95% CI 15.6-28.1), anxiety disorders (17.6%, 95% CI 10.8-27.3) and substance (non-alcohol) use disorders (7.0%, 95% CI 1.7-24.9). Specifically, the highest mean prevalence of current psychiatric disorders was for nicotine dependence (56.4%, 95% CI 35.7-75.2) and major depressive disorder (29.9%, 95% CI 20.5-41.3), with smaller estimates for alcohol abuse (18.2%, 95% CI 13.4-24.2), alcohol dependence (15.2%, 95% CI 10.2-22.0), social phobia (14.9%, 95% CI 2.0-59.8), generalised anxiety disorder (14.4%, 95% CI 3.9-40.8), panic disorder (13.7%, 95% CI 6.7-26.0), post-traumatic stress disorder (12.3%, 95% CI 3.4-35.7), cannabis use disorder (11.5%, 95% CI 4.8-25.0), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (9.3%, 95% CI 4.1-19.6), adjustment disorder (9.2%, 95% CI 4.8-17.2), bipolar disorder (8.8%, 95% CI 4.4-17.1) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (8.2%, 95% CI 3.4-18.6). There were no consistent patterns according to gambling problem severity, type of treatment facility and study jurisdiction. Although these estimates were robust to the inclusion of studies with non-representative sampling biases, they should be interpreted with caution as they were highly variable across studies.
   Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for gambling treatment services to undertake routine screening and assessment of psychiatric co-morbidity and provide treatment approaches that adequately manage these co-morbid disorders. Further research is required to explore the reasons for the variability observed in the prevalence estimates.

AB  - Objective: Chronic neurological conditions (CNCs) affect over one million people in the UK alone. Individuals with CNCs endure an increased prevalence of comorbid depression and anxiety. Poor mental health exacerbates the cost of the treatment and management of CNCs. CBT is recommended for the treatment of depression. However the application of CBT to individuals with CNCs may be limited by disease characteristics (e.g. mobility issues restricting therapy attendance and reducing engagement with behavioural activation, as well as difficulties challenging the veracity of disease-related negative thoughts that may reflect accurate appraisals). The objective of this review is to assess the clinical effectiveness of cognitive and behavioural interventions for depressive symptoms in individuals with non-acquired, medically explained CNCs.
   Data sources: Searches of The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PubMed, and PsychINFO were conducted.
   Results: All studies suggested that CBT is an effective treatment for depression comorbid to CNCs, however when CBT was compared to an active therapy control condition, between group differences were unstable.
   Conclusion: CBT has promise for the treatment for depression in such conditions; however treatment protocols and outcome measures should be adapted for this population. Future trials should control for non-specific effects of therapy and, as much as possible, introduce blinding into methodologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.

AB  - AimThe prevention of mental disorders is a growing field and there are interventions that have been demonstrated to prevent some disorders, particularly depression, from developing. The aim of the current study is to update two existing reviews of the cost-effectiveness studies of preventive interventions for mental disorders in order to determine whether such interventions are good value-for-money.
   MethodsA search was undertaken in Medline, PsycInfo and Econlit. The search was limited to articles published in English covering the period from 2010 to September 2013. Inclusion criteria for the review comprised comparative economic evaluations of interventions designed to prevent mental disorders.
   ResultsTen new economic evaluations have been published since 2010, more than doubling the numbers of economic evaluations of preventive interventions for mental disorders published prior to 2010. Using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist, the majority of studies were of a good standard and used cost-utility frameworks.
   ConclusionsIndicated types of interventions for the prevention of depression and anxiety appeared to be particularly good value-for-money and most of these studies were modelled evaluations. Unfortunately, many such interventions are still not routinely provided. Future trials of preventive interventions for mental disorders need to include robust economic evaluations so that the economic impact of such interventions from the individual study participant perspective can be determined.

AB  - Background Having a visual, hearing or physical impairment (defined as problems in body function or structure) may adversely influence the mental well-being of military personnel. This paper reviews the existing literature regarding the prevalence of mental health problems among (ex-) military personnel who have a permanent, predominantly, physical impairment.
   Method Multiple electronic literature databases were searched for relevant studies (EMBASE (1980-January 2014), MEDLINE (1946-January 2014), PsycINFO (2002-January 2014), Web of Science (1975-January 2014)).
   Results 25 papers were included in the review, representing 17 studies. Studies conducted among US military personnel (n=8) were most represented. A range of mental health disorders were investigated; predominately post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also depression, anxiety disorder (excluding PTSD), psychological distress and alcohol misuse. The findings indicate that mental health disorders including PTSD (range 2-59%), anxiety (range 16.1-35.5%), depression (range 9.7-46.4%) and psychological distress (range 13.4-36%) are frequently found whereby alcohol misuse was least common (range 2.2-26.2%).
   Conclusions Common mental health disorders were frequently identified among (ex-) military personnel with a physical impairment. Adequate care and support is necessary during the impairment adaptation process to facilitate the psychosocial challenges (ex-) military personnel with an impairment face. Future research should be directed into factors impacting on the mental well-being of (ex-) military personnel with an impairment, how prevalence rates vary across impairment types and to identify and act on specific needs for care and support.

AB  - Mood disorder and depressive syndromes represent a common comorbid condition in neurological disorders with a prevalence rate that ranges between 20% and 50% of patients with stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Notwithstanding, these conditions are often under-diagnosed and under-treated in the clinical practice and negatively affect the functional recovery, the adherence to treatment, the quality of life, and even the mortality risk. In addition, a bidirectional association between depression and neurological disorders may be possible being that depressive syndromes may be considered as a risk factor for certain neurological diseases. Despite the large amount of evidence regarding the effects of music therapy (MT) and other musical interventions on different aspects of neurological disorders, no updated article reviewing outcomes such as mood, emotions, depression, activity of daily living and so on is actually available; for this reason, little is known about the effectiveness of music and MT on these important outcomes in neurological patients. The aim of this article is to provide a narrative review of the current literature on musical interventions and their effects on mood and depression in patients with neurological disorders. Searching on PubMed and PsycInfo databases, 25 studies corresponding to the inclusion criteria have been selected; 11 of them assess the effects of music or MT in Dementia, 9 explore the efficacy on patients with Stroke, and 5 regard other neurological diseases like Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/ motor neuron disease, Chronic quadriplegia, Parkinson's Disease, and Acquired Brain dysfunctions. Selected studies are based on relational and rehabilitative music therapy approaches or concern music listening interventions. Most of the studies support the efficacy of MT and other musical interventions on mood, depressive syndromes, and quality of life on neurological patients.

AB  - BackgroundThe literature on the prevalence of mental disorders affecting children and adolescents has expanded significantly over the last three decades around the world. Despite the field having matured significantly, there has been no meta-analysis to calculate a worldwide-pooled prevalence and to empirically assess the sources of heterogeneity of estimates.
   MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of the literature searching in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for prevalence studies of mental disorders investigating probabilistic community samples of children and adolescents with standardized assessments methods that derive diagnoses according to the DSM or ICD. Meta-analytical techniques were used to estimate the prevalence rates of any mental disorder and individual diagnostic groups. A meta-regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of population and sample characteristics, study methods, assessment procedures, and case definition in determining the heterogeneity of estimates.
   ResultsWe included 41 studies conducted in 27 countries from every world region. The worldwide-pooled prevalence of mental disorders was 13.4% (CI 95% 11.3-15.9). The worldwide prevalence of any anxiety disorder was 6.5% (CI 95% 4.7-9.1), any depressive disorder was 2.6% (CI 95% 1.7-3.9), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was 3.4% (CI 95% 2.6-4.5), and any disruptive disorder was 5.7% (CI 95% 4.0-8.1). Significant heterogeneity was detected for all pooled estimates. The multivariate metaregression analyses indicated that sample representativeness, sample frame, and diagnostic interview were significant moderators of prevalence estimates. Estimates did not vary as a function of geographic location of studies and year of data collection. The multivariate model explained 88.89% of prevalence heterogeneity, but residual heterogeneity was still significant. Additional meta-analysis detected significant pooled difference in prevalence rates according to requirement of funcional impairment for the diagnosis of mental disorders.
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest that mental disorders affect a significant number of children and adolescents worldwide. The pooled prevalence estimates and the identification of sources of heterogeneity have important implications to service, training, and research planning around the world.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies indicate that comorbid anxiety disorders predict a more severe course of illness in bipolar disorder (BD). The relatively high prevalence of social anxiety in BD points to the potential role that sociocultural factors, such as stigma, play in exacerbating the progression of this disorder. Stigma creates social anxiety in affected individuals because it essentially forces them into a vulnerable social status that is marked by public disgrace. Although the etiology of debilitating social anxiety in BD may involve multiple factors, stigma deserves particular clinical attention because research in this area indicates that it is common and its internalization is associated with poor outcome.
   METHODS: We conducted a literature review using search terms related to stigma, social anxiety, bipolar disorder, illness severity, and outcomes. The electronic databases searched included PsychINFO, Pub Med, JSTOR, and EBSCOhost Academic Search Complete with limits set to include articles published in English.
   RESULTS: The literature indicates that internalized stigma often triggers the core psychological experiences of social anxiety and is highly correlated with clinical and functional outcome in BD. On a psychological level, internalized stigma and social anxiety can create distress that triggers symptoms of BD. From a biological perspective, stigma constitutes a chronic psychosocial stressor that may interact with the pathophysiology of BD in inflammatory ways.
   CONCLUSIONS: The connection between stigma and social anxiety, and their combined effects on people with BD, carries important implications for psychiatric care. To obtain an accurate clinical formulation, initial evaluations may seek to examine stigma-related experiences and determine their relationship to anxiety symptoms and psychosocial functioning. In addition, direct interventions for reducing the ill effects of stigma in BD deserve clinical attention, because they may carry the potential to enhance outcomes.

AB  - Circadian rhythm alterations have been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly those of sleep, addiction, anxiety, and mood. Circadian rhythms are known to be maintained by a set of classic clock genes that form complex mutual and self-regulatory loops. While many other genes showing rhythmic expression have been identified by genome-wide studies, their roles in circadian regulation remain largely unknown. In attempts to directly connect circadian rhythms with neuropsychiatric disorders, genetic studies have identified gene mutations associated with several rare sleep disorders or sleep-related traits. Other than that, genetic studies of circadian genes in psychiatric disorders have had limited success. As an important mediator of environmental factors and regulators of circadian rhythms, the epigenetic system may hold the key to the etiology or pathology of psychiatric disorders, their subtypes or endophenotypes. Epigenomic regulation of the circadian system and the related changes have not been thoroughly explored in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders. We argue for systematic investigation of the circadian system, particularly epigenetic regulation, and its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders to improve our understanding of human behavior and disease etiology.

AB  - The aims of this review are (i) to summarize and evaluate current knowledge on the association between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in pregnant and postpartum women, (ii) to provide suggestions for future research on this topic, and (iii) to highlight some clinical implications. Relevant publications were identified through literature searches of four databases (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES) using keywords such as "child abuse," "posttraumatic stress," "pregnancy," and "postpartum". Five studies were included in this review. Findings across all studies were consistent with higher prevalence of PTSD diagnosis or symptomatology among women with history of CSA. However, only findings from two studies were statistically significant. One study observed higher overall PTSD scores in women with CSA history compared to women with non-CSA trauma history or no trauma history during pregnancy (mean +/- SD 1.47 (0.51) vs. 1.33 (0.41) vs. 1.22 (0.29), p < 0.001), at 2 months postpartum (mean +/- SD 1.43 (0.49) vs. 1.26 (0.38) vs. 1.19 (0.35), p < 0.001), and at 6 months postpartum (mean +/- SD 1.36 (1.43) vs. 1.20 (0.33) vs. 1.14 (0.27), p < 0.001). Another study observed that the prevalence of PTSD during pregnancy was 4.1 % in women with no history of physical or sexual abuse, 11.4 % in women with adult physical or sexual abuse history, 16.0 % in women with childhood physical or sexual abuse history, and 39.0 % in women exposed to both childhood and adult physical or sexual abuse (p < 0.001); in a subsequent analysis, the investigators reported that pregnant women with PTSD had over 5-fold odds of having a history of childhood completed rape compared to counterparts without PTSD (OR = 5.3, 95 % CI 3.2, 8.7). Overall, available evidence suggests positive associations of CSA with clinical PTSD or PTSD symptomatology among pregnant and postpartum women.

AB  - Background: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a complex condition wich is associated with emotional factors, specially depression and anxiety. Objectives: To make a systematic review to provide a detailed summary of relevant literature on the association between CPP and different psychiatric disorders/symptoms. Methods: A systematic review of articles in the international literature published between 2003 and 2014 was performed in the electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, LILACS, and SciELO using the terms (chronic pelvic pain) AND (psychiatry OR psychiatric OR depression OR anxiety OR posttraumatic stress OR somatoform). The searches returned a total of 529 matches that were filtered according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 18 articles were selected. Results: The investigations focused mainly on the assessment of depression and anxiety disorders/symptoms, with rather high rates (17-38.6%). Depression and anxiety symptoms were more prevalent among women with CPP compared to healthy groups. Comparisons between groups with CPP and with specific pathologies that also have pain as a symptom showed that depression indicators are more frequent in CPP. Depressive symptoms tend to be more common in CPP and have no particular association with pain itself, the core feature of CPP. Discussion: Other aspects of CPP seem to play a specific role in this association. Anxiety and other psychiatric disorders require further investigation so that their impact on CPP can be better understood.

KW  - facial affect
KW  - theory of mind
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social cognition - the ability to identify, perceive, and interpret socially relevant information - is an important skill that plays a significant role in successful interpersonal functioning. Social cognitive performance is recognized to be impaired in several psychiatric conditions, but the relationship with major depressive disorder is less well understood. The aim of this review is to characterize the current understanding of: (i) the different domains of social cognition and a possible relationship with major depressive disorder, (ii) the clinical presentation of social cognition in acute and remitted depressive states, and (iii) the effect of severity of depression on social cognitive performance.
   METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify clinical studies investigating social cognition in a major depressive disorder population, yielding 31 studies for this review.
   RESULTS: Patients with major depressive disorder appear to interpret social cognitive stimuli differently to healthy controls: depressed individuals may interpret emotion through a mood-congruent bias and have difficulty with cognitive theory of mind tasks requiring interpretation of complex mental states. Social cognitive performance appears to be inversely associated with severity of depression, whilst the bias toward negative emotions persists even in remission. Some deficits may normalize following effective pharmacotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: The difficulties with social interaction observed in major depressive disorder may, at least in part, be due to an altered ability to correctly interpret emotional stimuli and mental states. These features seem to persist even in remission, although some may respond to intervention. Further research is required in this area to better understand the functional impact of these findings and the way in which targeted therapy could aid depressed individuals with social interactions.

AB  - Backgrounds. The extent to which psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of violence to partners is unclear. This review aimed to establish risk of violence against partners among men and women with diagnosed psychiatric disorders.
   Methods. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Searches of eleven electronic databases were supplemented by hand searching, reference screening and citation tracking of included articles, and expert recommendations.
   Results. Seventeen studies were included, reporting on 72 585 participants, but only three reported on past year violence. Pooled risk estimates could not be calculated for past year violence against a partner and the three studies did not consistently report increased risk for any diagnosis. Pooled estimates showed an increased risk of having ever been physically violent towards a partner among men with depression (odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.5-3.3), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.3-4.4) and panic disorder (OR 2.5, 95% CI C% 1.7-3.6). Increased risk was also found among women with depression (OR 2.4, 95% CI 2.1-2.8), GAD (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.9-3.0) and panic disorder (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.5).
   Conclusions. Psychiatric disorders are associated with high prevalence and increased odds of having ever been physically violent against a partner. As history of violence is a predictor of current violence, mental health professionals should ask about previous partner violence when assessing risk.

AB  - Objective: Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a chronic pain disease with high prevalence rates and substantial health care costs. An interdisciplinary classification system is commonly used (UPOINT) which includes psychosocial factors. Nevertheless, psychosocial influences on CP/CPPS only recently became a research focus. Therefore, we aimed to synthesize the existing data and to identify further research topics. Then, based on our results, diagnosis and treatment can be improved.
   Methods: In a systematic review conducted according to the PRISMA reporting guidelines we searched different databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO) using the broad search terms "chronic pelvic pain syndrome AND men". Two raters independently screened the literature and assessed the risk of bias.
   Results: We included 69 original research articles which considered psychosocial variables. We found studies investigating different psychosocial factors (pain catastrophizing, stress, personality factors, social aspects), co-morbid psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety and trauma-related disorders, somatization disorder, substance abuse) and Quality of Life (QoL). In addition, there is a high risk of bias in most studies e.g. concerning the study design or the measures.
   Conclusions: There is evidence suggesting that psychological factors are important in understanding CP/CPPS. However, research concentrated on a few aspects while the others were not covered adequately. We found evidence of a higher number of psychosocial factors and psychiatric co-morbidities than is currently included in the UPOINT system. More high quality research is needed to understand the interplay of psychosocial factors in CP/CPPS. Furthermore, these factors should be incorporated into treatment approaches.

AB  - Objective: The role of anxiety in the use of urgent care in people with long term conditions is not fully understood. A systematic review was conducted with meta-analysis to examine the relationship between anxiety and future use of urgent healthcare among individuals with one of four long term conditions: diabetes; coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.
   Methods: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, CINAHL, the British Nursing Library and the Cochrane Library were conducted These searches were supplemented by hand-searching bibliographies, citation tracing eligible studies and asking experts within the field about relevant studies. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they: a) used a standardised measure of anxiety, b) used prospective cohort design, c) included adult patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease (CHD), asthma, diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), d) assessed urgent healthcare use prospectively. Data regarding participants, methodology, and association between anxiety and urgent care use was extracted from studies eligible for inclusion. Odds ratios were calculated for each study and pooled using random effects models.
   Results: 8 independent studies were identified for inclusion in the meta-analysis, with a total of 28,823 individual patients. Pooled effects indicate that anxiety is not associated with an increase in the use of urgent care (OR = 1.078, p = 0.476), regardless of the type of service, or type of medical condition.
   Conclusions: Anxiety is not associated with increased use of urgent ore. This finding is in contrast to similar studies which have investigated the role of depression as a risk factor for use of urgent care. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Most psychiatric disorders present symptom patterns that cause severe impairment on the emotional, cognitive and social level. Thus, adolescents who suffer from a mental disorder risk finding themselves in a downward spiral caused by the reciprocal association of psychological symptoms and negative school experiences that may culminate in early school leaving. In addition to previous collective work that mainly focused on school refusing behaviour among children and was presented as an expert's opinion, the following systematic review fills the knowledge gap by providing a structured overview of the bidirectional association between mental health and secondary school dropout based on a sound methodology and with a particular focus on mediating factors.
   Methods: Four electronic databases were searched from January 1990 until June 2014. Selected references were assessed for study details, main results, mediating factors and methodological limitations. Standardized risk of bias assessment was conducted.
   Results: Mood and anxiety disorders seemed to have a less consequential direct effect on early school leaving than substance use and disruptive behaviour disorders. The association between externalizing disorders and educational attainment was even stronger when the disorder occurred early in life. On the other hand, internalizing disorders were reported to develop as a consequence of school dropout. Only few studies had addressed gender differences, with discrepant results. Socio-economic background, academic achievement and family support were identified as significant mediating factors of the association between mental disorders and subsequent educational attainment.
   Conclusions: Findings suggested a strong association between mental health and education, in both directions. However, most studies focused on mediating factors that could not be targeted by intervention programs.

AB  - The plus-maze, the light-dark box and the open-field are the main current tests of unconditioned anxiety for mice and rats. Despite their disappointing achievements, they remain as popular as ever and seem to play an important role in an ever-growing demand for behavioral phenotyping and drug screening. Numerous reviews have repeatedly reported their lack of consistency and reliability but they failed to address the core question of whether these tests do provide unequivocal measures of fear-induced anxiety, that these measurements are not confused with measures of fear-induced avoidance or natural preference responses - i.e. discriminant validity. In the present report, I examined numerous issues that undermine the validity of the current tests, and I highlighted various flaws in the aspects of these tests and the methodologies pursued. This report concludes that the evidence in support of the validity of the plus-maze, the light/dark box and the open-field as anxiety tests is poor and methodologically questionable.

AB  - Disasters are destructive, potentially traumatic events that affect millions of youth each year.
   The purpose of this paper was to review the literature on depressive symptoms among youth after disasters. Specifically, we examined the prevalence of depression, risk factors associated with depressive symptoms, and theories utilized in this research area.
   We searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and PubMed electronic databases for English language articles published up to May 1, 2013. Reference lists from included studies were reviewed to capture additional studies. Only quantitative, peer reviewed studies, conducted with youth under the age of 18 years, that examined postdisaster depressive symptoms were included. Seventy-two studies met inclusion criteria. Prevalence of depressive symptoms, disaster type, correlates of depressive symptoms, and theories of depressive symptoms were reviewed.
   Only 27 studies (38 %) reported on prevalence rates among youth in their sample. Prevalence rates of depression among youth postdisaster ranged from 2 to 69 %. Potential risk factors were identified (e.g., female gender, exposure stressors, posttraumatic stress symptoms). Theories were examined in less than one-third of studies (k = 21).
   Given the variability in prevalence rates, difficulty identifying a single profile of youth at risk for developing depressive symptoms, and lack of a unifying theory emerging from the studies, recommendations for future research are discussed. Use of established batteries of assessments could enable comparisons across studies. Merging existing theories from children's postdisaster and depression literatures could aid in the identification of risk factors and causal pathways.

AB  - Background: Anxiety and related disorders are among the most common mental disorders, with lifetime prevalence reportedly as high as 31%. Unfortunately, anxiety disorders are under-diagnosed and under-treated.
   Methods: These guidelines were developed by Canadian experts in anxiety and related disorders through a consensus process. Data on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment (psychological and pharmacological) were obtained through MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and manual searches (1980-2012). Treatment strategies were rated on strength of evidence, and a clinical recommendation for each intervention was made, based on global impression of efficacy, effectiveness, and side effects, using a modified version of the periodic health examination guidelines.
   Results: These guidelines are presented in 10 sections, including an introduction, principles of diagnosis and management, six sections (Sections 3 through 8) on the specific anxiety-related disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder), and two additional sections on special populations (children/adolescents, pregnant/lactating women, and the elderly) and clinical issues in patients with comorbid conditions.
   Conclusions: Anxiety and related disorders are very common in clinical practice, and frequently comorbid with other psychiatric and medical conditions. Optimal management requires a good understanding of the efficacy and side effect profiles of pharmacological and psychological treatments.

AB  - Mindfulness programs for schools are popular. We systematically reviewed the evidence regarding the effects of school based mindfulness interventions on psychological outcomes, using a comprehensive search strategy designed to locate both published and unpublished studies. Systematic searches in 12 databases were performed in August 2012. Further studies were identified via hand search and contact with experts. Two reviewers independently extracted the data, also selecting information about intervention programs (elements, structure etc.), feasibility, and acceptance. Twenty-four studies were identified, of which 13 were published. Nineteen studies used a controlled design. In total, 1348 students were instructed in mindfulness, with 876 serving as controls, ranging from grade 1 to 12. Overall effect sizes were Hedge's g=0.40 between groups and g=0.41 within groups (p<0.0001). Between group effect sizes for domains were: cognitive performance g=0.80, stress g=0.39, resilience g=0.36, (allp<0.05), emotional problems g=0.19 third person ratings g=0.25 (bothn. s.). All in all, mindfulness-based interventions in children and youths hold promise, particularly in relation to improving cognitive performance and resilience to stress. However, the diversity of study samples, variety in implementation and exercises, and wide range of instruments used require a careful and differentiated examination of data. There is great heterogeneity, many studies are under powered, and measuring effects of Mindfulness in this setting is challenging. The field is nascent and recommendations will be provided as to how interventions and research of these interventions may proceed.

AB  - Background Mental health is an important issue in the working population. Interventions to improve mental health have included physical activity. Aims To review evidence for the effectiveness of workplace physical activity interventions on mental health outcomes.
   Methods A literature search was conducted for studies published between 1990 and August 2013. Inclusion criteria were physical activity trials, working populations and mental health outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Jadad scale.
   Results Of 3684 unique articles identified, 17 met all selection criteria, including 13 randomized controlled trials, 2 comparison trials and 2 controlled trials. Studies were grouped into two key intervention areas: physical activity and yoga exercise. Of eight high-quality trials, two provided strong evidence for a reduction in anxiety, one reported moderate evidence for an improvement in depression symptoms and one provided limited evidence on relieving stress. The remaining trials did not provide evidence on improved mental well-being.
   Conclusions Workplace physical activity and yoga programmes are associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. Their impact on stress relief is less conclusive.

AB  - The differentiation of faces, facial expressions and affective pictures involves processes of higher mental activity that have considerable applications in the psychology of moods and emotions. At present, the search for functional correlates of brain oscillations is an important trend in neuroscience. Furthermore, analyses of oscillatory responses provide key knowledge on the physiology of brain dynamics. Studies analysing oscillatory dynamics in face perception and emotional pictures have increased in recent years; however, the literature lacks a review of the current state of the art. This study provides a comprehensive review of the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma oscillatory responses on presentation of faces, facial expressions and affective pictures (International Affective Picture System, IAPS). The reviewed literature revealed that the brain is more sensitive to emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli. A common and reliable finding from all reviewed studies was the increased brain responsiveness towards negative emotional pictures (face expression or IAPS). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   This review aims to address concerns about the potential overinclusiveness and vagueness of bipolar spectrum concepts, and also, concerns about the overlap between bipolar illness and borderline personality.
   Method:
   Narrative review based on historical and empirical studies.
   Results:
   Bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) came to be separate entities with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM III), in contrast to the Kraepelinian manic-depressive insanity (MDI) concept, which included both. The bipolar spectrum concept is a return to this earlier Kraepelinian perspective. Further, very different features differentiate the disease of bipolar illness (family history of bipolar illness, severe recurrent mood episodes with psychomotor activation) from the clinical picture of borderline personality (dissociative symptoms, sexual trauma, parasuicidal self-harm). The term 'disorder' obfuscates an ontological difference between diseases, such as manic-depressive illness, and clinical pictures, such as hysteria/post-traumatic stress disorder/dissociation/borderline personality.
   Conclusions:
   Bipolar spectrum concepts are historically rooted in Kraepelin's manic-depressive illness concept, are scientifically testable, and can be clearly formulated. Further, they differ in kind from traumatic/dissociative conditions in ways that can be both historically and scientifically established.

AB  - Objective
   MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, including genes involved in neuronal function and plasticity that have relevance for brain function and mental health. We therefore performed a systematic review of miRNAs in general adult psychiatric disorders.
   Method
   Systematic searches in PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science were conducted to identify published clinical articles on microRNAs in general adult psychiatric disorders. We also reviewed references from included articles.
   Results
   There is mounting evidence of microRNAs' regulatory roles in a number of central nervous system processes, including neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. The majority of clinical studies of microRNAs in psychiatric disorders are in schizophrenia, where a number of specific microRNAs have been identified in separate studies. There is some evidence of marked downregulation of some microRNAs in affective disorders. Treatment with antidepressants appears to upregulate microRNA levels. There is currently little evidence from human studies in anxiety, addiction or other psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusion
   MicroRNA research in psychiatry is currently in a nascent period, but represents an emerging and exciting area, with the potential to clarify molecular mechanisms of disease and identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic agents.

AB  - Background: Since the introduction of specified diagnostic criteria for mental disorders in the 1970s, there has been a rapid expansion in the number of large-scale mental health surveys providing population estimates of the combined prevalence of common mental disorders (most commonly involving mood, anxiety and substance use disorders). In this study we undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of this literature.
   Methods: We applied an optimized search strategy across the Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE and PubMed databases, supplemented by hand searching to identify relevant surveys. We identified 174 surveys across 63 countries providing period prevalence estimates (155 surveys) and lifetime prevalence estimates (85 surveys). Random effects meta-analysis was undertaken on logit-transformed prevalence rates to calculate pooled prevalence estimates, stratified according to methodological and substantive groupings.
   Results: Pooling across all studies, approximately 1 in 5 respondents (17.6%, 95% confidence interval:16.3-18.9%) were identified as meeting criteria for a common mental disorder during the 12-months preceding assessment; 29.2% (25.9-32.6%) of respondents were identified as having experienced a common mental disorder at some time during their lifetimes. A consistent gender effect in the prevalence of common mental disorder was evident; women having higher rates of mood (7.3%:4.0%) and anxiety (8.7%:4.3%) disorders during the previous 12 months and men having higher rates of substance use disorders (2.0%:7.5%), with a similar pattern for lifetime prevalence. There was also evidence of consistent regional variation in the prevalence of common mental disorder. Countries within North and South East Asia in particular displayed consistently lower one-year and lifetime prevalence estimates than other regions. One-year prevalence rates were also low among Sub-Saharan-Africa, whereas English speaking counties returned the highest lifetime prevalence estimates.
   Conclusions: Despite a substantial degree of inter-survey heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, the findings confirm that common mental disorders are highly prevalent globally, affecting people across all regions of the world. This research provides an important resource for modelling population needs based on global regional estimates of mental disorder. The reasons for regional variation in mental disorder require further investigation.

AB  - Aims: To analyze the association between psychosocial working conditions and burnout and its core component emotional exhaustion, a systematic literature review was undertaken including cohort studies, case-control studies, and randomized controlled trials.
   Methods: The literature search in Medline and PsycInfo was based on a defined search string and strict exclusion and inclusion criteria. Evaluation of the 5,599 initially identified search hits by two independent reviewers and a detailed quality assessment resulted in six methodologically adequate cohort studies considering the relationship between psychosocial working conditions and burnout (one study) as well as the burnout core component emotional exhaustion (five studies).
   Results: The results of our systematic review point to a relationship between psychosocial working conditions and the development of emotional exhaustion/burnout. Particularly high job demands seem to play a role in the development of emotional exhaustion. However, strong intercorrelations between workplace factors, as a matter of principle, make the identification of a single psychosocial workplace factor (being associated with an especially high or low risk of burnout) difficult.
   Conclusions: Multidimensional approaches including reduction of work demands, enhancement of decision latitude and improving the social climate might be promising for preventing burnout and emotional exhaustion. However, methodologically adequate intervention studies are urgently needed to prove the effectiveness of workplace interventions.

AB  - ObjectiveChildhood maltreatment (CM) has been associated with several diseases in adult life, including diabetes, obesity and mental disorders. Inflammatory conditions have been postulated as possible mediators of this relationship. The aim was to conduct a systematic review regarding the association between CM and inflammatory markers in adulthood.
   MethodA literature search of the PubMed, ISI, EMBASE and PsychINFO databases was conducted. The key terms used were as follows: Child Maltreatment', Childhood Trauma', Early Life Stress', Psychological Stress', Emotional Stress', Child Abuse' and Child Neglect'. They were cross-referenced separately with the terms: C-reactive Protein (CRP)', Tumor Necrosis Factor', Cytokine', Interleukin', Inflammatory' and Inflammation'.
   ResultsTwenty articles remained in the review after exclusion criteria were applied. Studies showed that a history of CM was associated with increased levels of CRP, fibrinogen and proinflammatory cytokines. Increased levels of circulating CRP in individuals with a history of CM were the most robust finding among the studies. Data about anti-inflammatory mediators are still few and inconsistent.
   ConclusionChildhood maltreatment is associated with a chronic inflammatory state independent of clinical comorbidities. However, studies are heterogeneous regarding CM assessment and definition. Important methodological improvements are needed to better understand the potential impact of CM on inflammatory response.

AB  - Aim: Accumulating data show that patients with bipolar disorder (BD) experience substantial symptomatology months or years before full manifestation. Based on the need for early preventive interventions in BD as well as data suggesting effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions for BD, we aimed to review the evidence for psychotherapeutic treatments in help-seeking individuals considered at risk for BD (At-Risk-BD).
   Methods: Searching PubMed and PsycINFO, clinical trial registries and recently published systematic reviews, a systematic review was performed of psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic intervention studies in At-Risk-BD individuals.
   Results: Only three completed studies were identified, two of which were randomized trials (n = 77) and one was an open pilot study (n = 13). Two ongoing studies (projected n = 150 and n = 100, respectively) were found in trial registries. The available evidence suggests potential effectiveness of multi-family psychoeducational psychotherapy and family-focussed therapy for symptom reduction and prevention of BD conversion.
   Conclusions: Psychotherapeutic treatments are a reasonable starting point for At-Risk-BD subjects when symptom severity, distress and impairment are sufficiently significant to initiate treatment. Ongoing studies will further clarify the effectiveness and timing of psychotherapeutic interventions for At-Risk-BD individuals and whether or not they should be given alone or in conjunction with other treatments. Large multi-site studies with standardized procedures/manuals are needed to advance the field.

   Methods: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method to conduct a systematic review in January 2013. We searched seven databases with a comprehensive list of search terms. Included articles had a sample size of 200 patients or more and assessed bipolar disorder using a structured clinical interview or bipolar screening questionnaire in random adult primary care patients. Risk of bias in each study was also assessed.
   Results: We found 5595 unique records in our search. Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria. The percentage of patients with bipolar disorder found on structured psychiatric interviews in 10 of 12 studies ranged from 0.5% to 4.3%, and a positive screen for bipolar disorder using a bipolar disorder questionnaire was found in 7.6% to 9.8% of patients.
   Conclusion: In 10 of 12 studies using a structured psychiatric interview, approximately 0.5% to 4.3% of primary care patients were found to have bipolar disorder, with as many as 9.3% having bipolar spectrum illness in some settings. Prevalence estimates from studies using screening measures that have been found to have low positive predictive value were generally higher than those found using structured interviews.

AB  - Background: Melatonin (MLT) is a pleiotropic neurohormone controlling many physiological processes and whose dysfunction may contribute to several different diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, circadian and mood disorders, insomnia, type 2 diabetes and pain. Melatonin is synthesized by the pineal gland during the night and acts through 2 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), MT1 (MEL1a) and MT2 (MEL1b). Although a bulk of research has examined the physiopathological effects of MLT, few studies have investigated the selective role played by MT1 and MT2 receptors. Here we have reviewed current knowledge about the implications of MT2 receptors in brain functions. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and articles reference lists for studies on MT2 receptor ligands in sleep, anxiety, neuropsychiatric diseases and psychopharmacology, including genetic studies on the MTNR1B gene, which encodes the melatonin MT2 receptor. Results: These studies demonstrate that MT2 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer disease and pain and that selective MT2 receptor agonists show hypnotic and anxiolytic properties. Limitations: Studies examining the role of MT2 receptors in psychopharmacology are still limited. Conclusion: The development of novel selective MT2 receptor ligands, together with further preclinical in vivo studies, may clarify the role of this receptor in brain function and psychopharmacology. The superfamily of GPCRs has proven to be among the most successful drug targets and, consequently, MT2 receptors have great potential for pioneer drug discovery in the treatment of mental diseases for which limited therapeutic targets are currently available.

AB  - There is an expanding field of research into how making or listening to music can improve wellbeing. As a spontaneous, social, creative nonverbal process unfolding in real time, musical improvisation between individuals is a unique psychological phenomenon distinct from other areas of musical activity. It may therefore have an influence on health or wellbeing distinct from other musical behaviours, and from other components of a musical intervention. Given the psychological complexity of this behaviour it is important to establish the parameters of improvisation, the effects on health or wellbeing that are perceived or claimed for it, and any mechanisms understood to bring about these effects. To establish this, literature was reviewed that explicitly investigates or theorises about the capacity of musical improvisation to influence health or wellbeing. Only work examining its application within music therapy was identified. The behaviours and interactions that constitute improvisation during music therapy are clearly defined. Improvisation in music therapy is seen to have specific benefits for particular populations including the amelioration of neurological damage, improvements in mental health conditions, reductions in stress and anxiety, and improved communication and joint attention behaviours in children with autistic spectrum disorders. Four unique characteristics of musical improvisation are identified as underlying these effects: its potential to link conscious with unconscious processes, the demands on attention of absorption in a creative process, the non-verbal social and creative interaction experienced, and the capacity for expressing difficult or repressed emotions without having to articulate these verbally. Although improvisation is undertaken in music therapy for a purpose distinct from that of improvisation in other contexts, its processes can be seen as substantively similar, suggesting that improvising in itself may offer intrinsic benefits to health or wellbeing to broader populations and outwith the therapeutic context. Based on this review, a model is proposed for how improvisation in music can influence the health or wellbeing of those involved.

AB  - With the increasing understanding of the involvement of basal ganglia circuits in the functions of movement, cognition, emotion and motivation, the network model of dystonia posits a plausible mechanism for the co-occurrence of mental dysfunctions in dystonia-plus syndromes. Genetic mutations that alter the production of neurotransmitters and receptors can potentially affect the function of these interconnecting circuits and yield non-motor symptoms as well. This article reviews the psychiatric findings in dystonia-plus syndromes reported thus far in the literature, both in animal models and human subjects. Based on this innovative understanding of the pathophysiology, implications to treatment of combined motor and non-motor symptoms (i.e. mental dysfunctions) are also briefly discussed.

AB  - A decade of research has demonstrated the explanatory potential of interplay between genetic variants and environmental factors in the development of common mental disorders. Initial findings have undergone tests of replicability and specificity. Some gene-environment interactions have been confirmed, some have not replicated and yet other turned out to be more specific than initially thought. Specific and complementary roles of genetic factors have been delineated: a common functional length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) moderated the effect of childhood maltreatment on chronic depression in adulthood, but did not substantially influence the effects of adult stressful life events on the onset of new depressive episodes; in contrast, a common functional polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) moderated the effect of stressful life events in adulthood in triggering new depressive episodes, but did not influence the effects of childhood maltreatment. Molecular mechanisms underlying gene-environment interactions are being uncovered, including DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications. New gene-environment interactions continue to be reported, still largely from hypothesis-driven research. Statistical and biological prioritization strategies are proposed to facilitate a systematic discovery of novel gene-environment interactions in genome-wide analyses.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are complex diseases, which often occur in combination with major depression, alcohol use disorder, or general medical conditions. Anxiety disorders were the most common mental disorders within the EU states in 2010 with 14% prevalence. Anxiety disorders are triggered by environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals, and therefore genetic research offers a great route to unravel molecular basis of these diseases. As anxiety is an evolutionarily conserved response, mouse models can be used to carry out genome-wide searches for specific genes in a setting that controls for the environmental factors. In this review, we discuss translational approaches that aim to bridge results from unbiased genome-wide screens using mouse models to anxiety disorders in humans. Several methods, such as quantitative trait locus mapping, gene expression profiling, and proteomics, have been used in various mouse models of anxiety to identify genes that regulate anxiety or play a role in maintaining pathological anxiety. We first discuss briefly the evolutionary background of anxiety, which justifies cross-species approaches. We then describe how several genes have been identified through genome-wide methods in mouse models and subsequently investigated in human anxiety disorder samples as candidate genes. These studies have led to the identification of completely novel biological pathways that regulate anxiety in mice and humans, and that can be further investigated as targets for therapy.

AB  - <bold>Objective:</bold> To investigate the beneficial and adverse effects of a mental practice intervention on activities, cognition, and emotion in patients after stroke, patients with Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.
   <bold>Methods:</bold> Electronic databases PubMed/Medline, PEDro, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Rehadat, Embase, and Picarta were searched until June 2012. Fourteen randomized controlled trials in stroke and two randomized controlled trials in Parkinson's disease were included, representing 491 patients (421 with stroke). No randomized controlled trials in multiple sclerosis were identified. The methodologic quality of the included trials was assessed with the Amsterdam-Maastricht-Consensus-List (AMCL). Information on study characteristics and outcomes was summarized and evidence for effects described. Data from individual studies in stroke with same outcome measures were pooled.
   <bold>Results:</bold> The included 16 randomized controlled trials were heterogeneous and methodologic quality varied. Ten trials reported significant effects in favor of mental practice in patients with stroke (n = 9) and Parkinson's disease (n = 1). In six studies mental practice had similar effects as therapy as usual (n = 5 in stroke and n = 1 in Parkinson's disease). Of six performed meta-analyses with identical measures in stroke studies only two showed significant effects of mental practice: short-term improvement of arm-hand-ability (ARAT: SMD 0.62; 95% CI: 0.05 to 1.19) and improvement of performance of activities (NRS: SMD 0.9; 95% CI: 0.04 to 1.77). Five studies found effects on cognition (e.g., effects on attention, plan actions in unfamiliar surroundings) and four reported observed side-effects, both positive (e.g., might increase motivation and arousal and reduce depression) and negative (e.g., diminished concentration, irritation).
   <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Mental practice might have positive effects on performance of activities in patients with neurological diseases, but this review reports less positive results than earlier published ones. Strengths and limitations of past studies are pointed out. Methodologic recommendations for future studies are given.

AB  - Depression involves a dysfunction in an affective fronto-limbic circuitry including the prefrontal cortices, several limbic structures including the cingulate cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus as well as the basal ganglia. A major emphasis of research on the etiology and treatment of mood disorders has been to assess the impact of centrally generated (top-down) processes impacting the affective fronto-limbic circuitry. The present review shows that peripheral (bottom-up) unipolar stimulation via the visual and the auditory modalities as well as by physical exercise modulates mood and depressive symptoms in humans and animals and activates the same central affective neurocircuitry involved in depression. It is proposed that the amygdala serves as a gateway by articulating the mood regulatory sensorimotor stimulation with the central affective circuitry by emotionally labeling and mediating the storage of such emotional events in long-term memory. Since both amelioration and aggravation of mood is shown to be possible by unipolar stimulation, the review suggests that a psychophysical assessment of mood modulation by multimodal stimulation may uncover mood ameliorative synergisms and serve as adjunctive treatment for depression. Thus, the integrative review not only emphasizes the relevance of investigating the optimal levels of mood regulatory sensorimotor stimulation, but also provides a conceptual springboard for related future research

AB  - Objective To review the literature on psychological and biological findings on resilience (i.e. the successful adaptation and swift recovery after experiencing life adversities) at the level of the individual, and to integrate findings from animal and human studies. Method Electronic and manual literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCHINFO, using a range of search terms around biological and psychological factors influencing resilience as observed in human and experimental animal studies, complemented by review articles and cross-references. Results The term resilience is used in the literature for different phenomena ranging from prevention of mental health disturbance to successful adaptation and swift recovery after experiencing life adversities, and may also include post-traumatic psychological growth. Secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions and having a purpose in life are three important psychological building blocks of resilience. Overlap between psychological and biological findings on resilience in the literature is most apparent for the topic of stress sensitivity, although recent results suggest a crucial role for reward experience in resilience. Conclusion Improving the understanding of the links between genetic endowment, environmental impact and gene-environment interactions with developmental psychology and biology is crucial for elucidating the neurobiological and psychological underpinnings of resilience.

AB  - Animal models are vital tools to study the genetic, molecular, cellular, and environmental parameters involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Over the years, these models have expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis of many neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Although animal models have been widely used in psychiatry, and despite several years of extensive research with these models, their validity is still being investigated and presents a challenge to both investigators and clinicians as well. In this concise review, we will describe the most common animal models utilized in neuropsychiatry, including animal models of depression, anxiety, and psychosis. In addition, we will also discuss the validity and reliability of these models and current challenges in this domain. Furthermore, this work will discuss the role of gene environment interaction as an additional contributing factor that modulates neuropsychological outcome and its implication on animal models. This overview will give a succinct summary of animal models in psychiatry which will be useful both to the seasoned researcher, as well as novices in the field. (C) 2013 IBRO.

AB  - Religion/spirituality has been increasingly examined in medical research during the past two decades. Despite the increasing number of published studies, a systematic evidence-based review of the available data in the field of psychiatry has not been done during the last 20 years. The literature was searched using PubMed (1990-2010). We examined original research on religion, religiosity, spirituality, and related terms published in the top 25 % of psychiatry and neurology journals according to the ISI journals citation index 2010. Most studies focused on religion or religiosity and only 7 % involved interventions. Among the 43 publications that met these criteria, thirty-one (72.1 %) found a relationship between level of religious/spiritual involvement and less mental disorder (positive), eight (18.6 %) found mixed results (positive and negative), and two (4.7 %) reported more mental disorder (negative). All studies on dementia, suicide, and stress-related disorders found a positive association, as well as 79 and 67 % of the papers on depression and substance abuse, respectively. In contrast, findings from the few studies in schizophrenia were mixed, and in bipolar disorder, indicated no association or a negative one. There is good evidence that religious involvement is correlated with better mental health in the areas of depression, substance abuse, and suicide; some evidence in stress-related disorders and dementia; insufficient evidence in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and no data in many other mental disorders.

AB  - Music is used to regulate mood and arousal in everyday life and to promote physical and psychological health and well-being in clinical settings. However, scientific inquiry into the neurochemical effects of music is still in its infancy. In this review, we evaluate the evidence that music improves health and well-being through the engagement of neurochemical systems for (i) reward, motivation, and pleasure; (ii) stress and arousal; (iii) immunity; and (iv) social affiliation. We discuss the limitations of these studies and outline novel approaches for integration of conceptual and technological advances from the fields of music cognition and social neuroscience into studies of the neurochemistry of music.

AB  - Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a robust operational measure of sensorimotor gating. In schizophrenic patients PPI is deficient. The aim of our review was to investigate the state of science regarding PPI and psychiatric disorders aside from schizophrenia. We used the online database PubMed in order to search for original published reports on PPI studies. The terms "prepulse inhibition", "sensorimotor gating", "blink recovery", and "blink reflex excitability" have been combined with the names of psychiatric disorders. We found that PPI is deficient in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS). In bipolar disorder dysfunctional PPI seems to be rather state dependent. Studies on depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) consistently report no alterations. Evidence regarding sensorimotor gating in anxiety, autism, fragile X syndrome, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance disorders, and Huntington's disease is still poor. There is a strong need for further studies on PPI in psychiatric disorders. PPI is highly applicable for translational research and might also be a very useful tool to investigate the mode of action of innovative, neuro-modulative techniques. Future PPI studies should control for influencing variables such as smoking, sex, or medication. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive aims to improve ecological status within river basins. This requires knowledge of responses of aquatic assemblages to recovery processes that occur after measures have been taken to reduce major stressors. A systematic literature review comparatively assesses recovery measures across the four major water categories. The main drivers of degradation stem primarily from human population growth and increases in land use and water use changes. These drivers and pressures are the same in all four water categories: rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters. Few studies provide evidence of how ecological knowledge might enhance restoration success. Other major bottlenecks are the lack of data, effects mostly occur only in short-term and at local scale, the organism group(s) selected to assess recovery does not always provide the most appropriate response, the time lags of recovery are highly variable, and most restoration projects incorporate restoration of abiotic conditions and do not include abiotic extremes and biological processes. Restoration ecology is just emerging as a field in aquatic ecology and is a site, time and organism group-specific activity. It is therefore difficult to generalise. Despite the many studies only few provide evidence of how ecological knowledge might enhance restoration success.

AB  - Objective: E-mental health technologies are increasing rapidly, both in number and in utilisation by consumers, health systems and researchers. This review aimed to: (i) examine the features and scientific evidence for e-mental health programs; (ii) describe the growth in these programs in the past decade, and track the extent and quality of scientific research over time; and (iii) examine Australian and international contribution to the field.
   Method: Two types of e-mental health programs; 'web interventions' and mobile applications'; targeting depression, bipolar disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety, panic disorder and general stress were included. Data were collected from the Beacon website (www.beacon.anu.edu.au; last updated July 2011). Features of each program and their supporting scientific evidence were coded.
   Results: In total, 62 web interventions and 11 mobile applications were identified. Half of these were developed in Australia. The majority of programs were aimed towards adults and were based upon cognitive behavioural therapy. Approximately equal numbers of programs were developed for all targeted disorders except bipolar disorder, which was underrepresented. Only 35.5% of programs, all of which were web-based, had been evaluated by at least one RCT. The number of publications over the last decade is increasing. The majority were from Australian sources. Non-Australian research was lower in diversity and quantity.
   Conclusions: E-mental health research is increasing globally. Australia continues to be an international leader in this field. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder remain the disorders most targeted. Whilst the scientific evidence supporting e-mental health programs is growing, a substantial lack of high-quality empirical support was evident across the field, particularly for mobile applications and bipolar and social anxiety.

AB  - Aging is an inevitable process that is associated to loss of functional capacities in several body systems, like the cardiovascular, the skeletal muscle mass, the osteoarticular and the neuro-immune-endocrine systems. Changes appear due to interactions between genetic factors and way of life, such as diet and sedentary life style. This review shows evidence from the past twenty years concerning the importance of physical exercise to reduce the deleterious effects of aging, regarding the improvement in functional performance, the prevention of diseases and increased longevity. Moreover, physical exercise improves the cognitive function and the mood. Aerobic and strength training collaborate with the prevention and treatment of mental diseases, which are mostly prevalent in older adults, like major depression, dementia and Parkinson's disease. Several mechanisms of neurobiological action are proposed to explain how exercise can actually reduce the effects of aging.

AB  - Background: Olfaction and its relation to mental health is an area of growing interest. Brain areas linked to olfaction partially overlap with brain areas involved in psychiatric disorders; consequently, the study of olfactory function allows us to explore the integrity of these brain areas with a non-invasive and effective method. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to review olfactory function in affective and anxiety disorders. Methods: For this purpose, an extensive literature review of English-language studies on olfactory function in patients with the aforementioned pathologies was performed using several online databases. A manual search of relevant journals and books as well as reference lists from selected papers was also performed. Results:The available data show that depressed patients are usually characterised by preserved olfactory function, except for detection threshold, where contrasting reports have been found. Bipolar disorder has been studied to a lesser extent, but the findings have shown a lack of impairment in most cases. Research on seasonal affective disorders is scant, and future studies are needed to make conclusions. Anxiety disorders have been scarcely approached, but the results note identification deficits in obsessive-compulsive and posttraumatic stress disorders. Conclusions: Olfactory assessment appears to be a complementary, valuable research tool in the study of psychiatric disorders. However, further investigation is needed to improve our understanding of olfactory function in these disorders. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background: The staging method, whereby a disorder is characterized according to its seriousness, extension, development and features, is attracting increasing attention in clinical psychology and psychiatry. The aim of this systematic review was to critically summarize the tools that are available for reproducing and standardizing the clinical intuitions that are involved in a staging formulation. Methods: A comprehensive research was conducted on the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from inception to May 2012. The following search terms were used: 'stage/staging' AND 'psychiatric disorder/mental disorder/schizophrenia/mood disorder/anxiety disorder/substance use disorder/eating disorder'. Results: A total of 78 studies were identified for inclusion in the review. We discussed studies addressing or related to the issue of staging in a number of mental disorders (schizophrenia, unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, substance use disorders, anorexia and bulimia nervosa). The literature indicates that disorders have a longitudinal development or a treatment history that can be categorized according to stages. We proposed staging formulations for the above-mentioned psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: Staging models offer innovative assessment tools for clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. Characterizing each stage of an illness demarcates major prognostic and therapeutic differences among patients who otherwise seem to be deceptively similar since they share the same psychiatric diagnosis. A stage 0 to denote an at-risk condition does not appear to be warranted at the current state of research. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - We review studies examining the relationship between maladaptive repetitive thinking (RT) and the following characteristics of mental time travel (MTT): (1) emotional response (22 studies), (2) sensory reliving (3 studies), (3) field-observer perspective (4 studies) and (4) reduced specificity (29 studies). The results suggest that maladaptive RT is associated with increased emotional response to mentally travelling to negative events and with reduced specificity of past MTT. The results for sensory reliving and field-observer perspective were mixed. We discuss why maladaptive RT is associated with both increased emotional response and reduced specificity, which has been suggested to decrease emotional responses to MTT. We suggest that differences in the conceptualization of maladaptive RT and sampling clinical versus healthy participants may explain this apparently contradictory finding. Alternatively, maladaptive RT may be characterized by both increased emotional response to MTT and attempts at reducing the emotional response through reduced specificity. Finally, we offer suggestions for future research.

AB  - Objective: Episodes of bipolar disorder are defined as depressive or manic, but depressive and manic symptoms can combine in the same episode. Coexistence or rapid alternation of depressive and manic symptoms in the same episode may indicate a more severe form of bipolar disorder and may pose diagnostic and treatment challenges. However, definitions of mixed states, especially those with prominent depression, are not well established.
   Method: The authors performed literature searches for bipolar disorder, multivariate analyses, and the appearance of the terms "mixed" in any field; references selected from the articles found after the search were combined after a series of conferences among the authors.
   Results: The authors reviewed the evolution of the concept of mixed states and examined the symptom structure of mixed states studied as predominantly manic, predominantly depressive, and across both manic and depressive episodes, showing essentially. parallel structures of mixed states based on manic or depressive episodes. The authors analyzed the relationships between mixed states and a severely recurrent course of illness in bipolar disorder, with early onset and increased co-occurring anxiety-, stress-, and substance-related disorders, and they used this information to derive proposed diagnostic criteria for research or clinical use.
   Conclusions: The definitions and properties of mixed states have generated controversy, but the stability of their characteristics over a range of clinical definitions and diagnostic methods shows that the concept of mixed states is robust. Distinct characteristics related to the course of illness emerge at relatively modest opposite polarity symptom levels in depressive or manic episodes. (Am J Psychiatry 2013; 170:31-42)

AB  - Background: Allostatic load (AL) relates to the neural and bodily "wear and tear'' that emerge in the context of chronic stress. This paper aims to provide clinicians with a comprehensive overview of the role of AL in patophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) and its practical implications.
   Methods: PubMed searches were conducted on English-language articles published from 1970 to June 2011 using the search terms allostatic load, oxidative stress, staging, and bipolar disorder cross-referenced with cognitive impairment, comorbidity, mediators, prevention.
   Results: Progressive neural and physical dysfunction consequent to mood episodes in BD can be construed as a cumulative state of AL. The concept of AL can help to reconcile cognitive impairment and increased rates of clinical comorbidities that occur over the course of cumulative BD episodes.
   Conclusions: Data on transduction of psychosocial stress into the neurobiology of mood episodes converges to the concept of AL. Mood episodes prevention would not only alleviate emotional suffering, but also arrest the cycle of AL, cognitive decline, physical morbidities and, eventually, related mortality. These objectives can be achieved by focusing on effective prophylaxis from the first stages of the disorder, providing mood-stabilizing agents and standardized psychoeducation and, potentially, addressing cognitive deficits by the means of specific medication and neuropsychological interventions.

AB  - Objective: There is a reciprocal association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and coronary heart disease (CHD). These conditions are linked by a causal network of mechanisms. This causal network should be quantitatively studied and it is hypothesised that the investigation of vagal function represents a promising starting point. Heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to investigate cardiac vagal control in the context of MDD and CHD. This review aims to examine the relationship of HRV to both MDD and CHD in the context of vagal function and to make recommendations for clinical practice and research.
   Methods: The search terms 'heart rate variability', 'depression' and 'heart disease' were entered into an electronic multiple database search engine. Abstracts were screened for their relevance and articles were individually selected and collated.
   Results: Decreased HRV is found in both MDD and CHD. Both diseases are theorised to disrupt autonomic control feedback loops on the heart and are linked to vagal function. Existing theories link vagal function to both mood and emotion as well as cardiac function. However, several factors can potentially confound HRV measures and would thus impact on a complete understanding of vagal mechanisms in the link between MDD and CHD.
   Conclusions: The quantitative investigation of vagal function using HRV represents a reasonable starting point in the study of the relationship between MDD and CHD. Many psychotropic and cardiac medications have effects on HRV, which may have clinical importance. Future studies of HRV in MDD and CHD should consider antidepressant medication, as well as anxiety, as potential confounders.

AB  - This study systematically maps, assesses and aggregates research relating to postnatal depression (PND) and poverty in low and lower middle income countries (LLMICs). Our search of 12 databases yielded 2202 articles, of which 47 items from 17 countries were included in our mapping. We highlight mechanisms for the relationships between poverty and PND in LLMICs. The research base on the relationships between poverty and PND in LLMIC is limited, but has recently expanded. It is dominated by studies that consider whether poverty is a risk factor for PND. Income, socio-economic status and education are all inconsistent risk factors for PND. Clues to better ways of framing and capturing economic stress in PND research is found in the qualitative studies included in our mapping. Evidence focusses overwhelmingly on individual-level analyses. To understand the scale and implications of PND in LLMICs, research has to take account of neighbourhoods, communities, and localities.

AB  - Background: A number of studies have shown that although exposure to potentially traumatic events is common, development of PTSD is relatively rare, which is one of the reasons PTSD still remains a controversial psychiatric entity. The aim of this article was to provide an overview of the research on the role of personality traits in the vulnerability, resilience, posttraumatic growth and expressions associated with PTSD. Personality based approach represents a dimensional aspect of the transdisciplinary integrative model of PTSD.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, PsycINFO, and Academic Search Complete from 1980 (the year PTSD was first included in the DSM) and 2012 (the year the literature search was performed). Manual examination of secondary sources such as the reference sections of selected articles and book chapters were also conducted.
   Results: Most of the reviewed studies dealing with personality traits as vulnerability and protective factors for PTSD examined the relationship between basic personality dimensions and severity of symptoms of PTSD. These studies have applied three types of methodological designs: cross-sectional, post-trauma and pre-trauma longitudinal studies, with latter being the least common option.
   Conclusion: Finding that appears relatively consistent is that PTSD is positively related to negative emotionality, neuroticism, harm avoidance, novelty-seeking and self-transcendence, as well as to trait hostility/anger and trait anxiety. On the other hand, PTSD symptoms are negatively associated with extraversion, conscientiousness, self-directedness, the combination of high positive and low negative emotionality, as well as with hardiness and optimism, while posttraumatic growth shows inverse relation to most of these traits. Furthermore, a number of studies have confirmed the existance of three distinct personality-based subtypes of PTSD: internalizing, externalizing and low pathology PTSD. These findings may help in further uncovering etiological mechanisms and in building new strategies for prevention, identification and reduction of health risks among this trauma population, as well as facilitating potential posttraumatic growth. However, focusing on just a single dimensional perspective will unable us to generate comprehensive knowledge of the etiology, course and treatment of PTSD.

AB  - Background
   Relatively little is known of the use of systematic review and synthesis methods of non-randomised psychiatric epidemiological studies, which play a vital role in aetiological research, planning and policy-making.
   Aims
   To evaluate reviews of psychiatric epidemiological studies of functional mental disorders that employed synthesis methods such as systematic review or meta-analysis, or other forms of quantitative review.
   Method
   We searched the literature to identify appropriate reviews published during the period 1996 to April 2009. Selected reviews were evaluated using published review guidelines.
   Results
   We found 106 reviews in total, of which 38 (36%) did not mention method of data abstraction from primary studies at all. Many failed to mention study quality, publication bias, bias and confounding. In 73 studies that performed a metaanalysis, 58 (79%) tested for heterogeneity and of these, 47 found significant heterogeneity. Studies that detected heterogeneity made some allowance for this. A major obstacle facing reviewers is the wide variation between primary studies in the use of instruments to measure outcomes and in sampling methods used.
   Conclusions
   Many deficiencies found in systematic reviews are potentially remediable, although synthesis of primary study findings in a field characterised by so many sources of heterogeneity will remain challenging.

AB  - Background: This review integrates neuroimaging studies of 2 domains of social cognition - emotion comprehension and theory of mind (ToM) - in patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. The influence of key clinical and method variables on patterns of neural activation during social cognitive processing is also examined. Methods: Studies were identified using PsycINFO and PubMed (January 1967 to May 2011). The search terms were "fMRI," "emotion comprehension," "emotion perception," "affect comprehension," "affect perception," "facial expression," "prosody," "theory of mind," "mentalizing" and "empathy" in combination with "major depressive disorder," "bipolar disorder," "major depression," "unipolar depression," "clinical depression" and "mania." Results: Taken together, neuroimaging studies of social cognition in patients with mood disorders reveal enhanced activation in limbic and emotion-related structures and attenuated activity within frontal regions associated with emotion regulation and higher cognitive functions. These results reveal an overall lack of inhibition by higher-order cognitive structures on limbic and emotion-related structures during social cognitive processing in patients with mood disorders. Critically, key variables, including illness burden, symptom severity, comorbidity, medication status and cognitive load may moderate this pattern of neural activation. Limitations: Studies that did not include control tasks or a comparator group were included in this review. Conclusion: Further work is needed to examine the contribution of key moderator variables and to further elucidate the neural networks underlying altered social cognition in patients with mood disorders. The neural networks underlying higher-order social cognitive processes, including empathy, remain unexplored in patients with mood disorders.

AB  - Purpose of review
   In recent years, deficits in emotion regulation have been studied as a putative maintaining factor and promising treatment target in a broad range of mental disorders. This article aims to provide an integrative review of the latest theoretical and empirical developments in this rapidly growing field of research.
   Recent findings
   Deficits in emotion regulation appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and treatment of various forms of psychopathology. Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties.
   Summary
   Despite some yet to be resolved challenges, the concept of emotion regulation has a broad and significant heuristic value for research in mental health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder (BD), frequently are associated with substance use disorders (SUDs). There are well-designed trials for the treatment of SUDs in the absence of a comorbid condition. However, one cannot generalize these study results to individuals with comorbid mood disorders, because therapeutic efficacy and/or safety and tolerability profiles may differ with the presence of the comorbid disorder. Therefore, a review of the available evidence is needed to provide guidance to clinicians facing the challenges of treating patients with comorbid mood disorders and SUDs.
   METHODS: We reviewed the literature published between January 1966 and November 2010 by using the following search strategies on PubMed. Search terms were bipolar disorder or depressive disorder, major (to exclude depression, postpartum; dysthymic disorder; cyclothymic disorder; and seasonal affective disorder) cross-referenced with alcohol or drug or substance and abuse or dependence or disorder. When possible, a level of evidence was determined for each treatment using the framework of previous Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments recommendations. The lack of evidence-based literature limited the authors' ability to generate treatment recommendations that were strictly evidence based, and as such, recommendations were often based on the authors' opinion.
   RESULTS: Even though a large number of treatments were investigated for alcohol use disorder (AUD), none have been sufficiently studied to justify the attribution of level 1 evidence in comorbid AUD with major depressive disorder (MDD) or BD. The available data allows us to generate first-choice recommendations for AUD comorbid with MDD and only third-choice recommendations for cocaine, heroin, and opiate SUD comorbid with MOD. No recommendations were possible for cannabis, amphet-amines, methamphetamines, or polysubstance SUD comorbid with MDD. First-choice recommendations were possible for alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine SUD comorbid with BD and only second-choice recommendations for heroin, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and polysubstance SUD comorbid with BD. No recommendations were possible for opiate SUD comorbid with BD. Finally, psychotherapies certainly are considered an essential component of the overall treatment of SUDs comorbid with mood disorders. However, further well-designed studies are needed in order to properly assess their potential role in specific SUDs comorbid with a mood disorder.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although certain treatments show promise in the management of mood disorders comorbid with SUDs, additional well-designed studies are needed to properly assess their potential role in specific SUDs comorbid with a mood disorder.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. It is generally defined by its progressive motor features; but increased attention is being paid to its non-motor neuropsychiatric symptoms, which profoundly impact quality of life for patients and caregivers. Anxiety and depression are particularly problematic and are the strongest predictors of quality of life in PD. Recent research has focused on non-pharmacological approaches to treating depression and anxiety in patients with PD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a potentially efficacious non-pharmacological treatment for mood and anxiety symptoms associated with PD. Accordingly, this review examines empirical studies of CBT-based treatments for depression and anxiety symptoms in PD. Medical Subject Headings were used in searches of PsychInfo and PubMed of English-language articles published in peer-reviewed journals, resulting in the identification of 10 articles. Four additional articles were identified from the references of these articles and upon the suggestions of experts, for 15 articles in all. Results of individual studies varied significantly; however, the randomized controlled trials showed encouraging results and support the need for further investigation of the utility of CBT for depressed and anxious patients with PD. CBT is potentially a useful treatment for patients with PD and comorbid depression and/or anxiety, but more systematic research will be necessary to measure its effects.

AB  - Pesticides applied to sloping farmland may lead to surface water contamination through rapid transport processes as influenced by the complex topography and high spatial variability of soil properties and land use in hilly or mountainous regions. However, the fate of pesticides applied to sloping farmland has not been sufficiently elucidated. This article reviews the current understanding of pesticide transport from sloping farmland to surface water. It examines overland flow and subsurface lateral flow in areas where surface soil is underlain by impervious subsoil or rocks and tile drains. It stresses the importance of quantifying and modeling the contributions of various pathways to rapid pesticide loss at catchment and regional scales. Such models could be used in scenario studies for evaluating the effectiveness of possible mitigation strategies such as constructing vegetated strips, depressions, wetlands and drainage ditches, and implementing good agricultural practices. Field monitoring studies should also be conducted to calibrate and validate the transport models as well as biophysical-economic models, to optimize mitigation measures in areas dominated by sloping farmland.

AB  - Spatial learning and memory tasks have captured a solid position in neuroscience research. A variety of holeboard-type tasks are suitable for investigating the effects of a broad range of experimental manipulations on spatial learning and memory in a broad range of species, including fish, rodents, cats, pigs, tupaias, and humans. We summarize the concepts and procedures underlying tests of spatial discrimination learning, with special emphasis on holeboard-type tasks and task-specific characteristics. Holeboard-type tasks enable a broad range of mnemonic and cognitive variables to be measured in parallel, including cognitive processes such as habituation processes, spatial working and reference memory, and search strategies, but also non-cognitive variables, such as exploration, anxiety-related behavior, and stereotypies. These tasks are sensitive to a large number of naturally occurring differences (e.g. strain differences and age effects) and to the effects of non-genetic (e.g. specific brain lesions, stress, treatment with cognition impairers or cognition enhancers) and genetic experimental manipulations. In conclusion, holeboard-type tasks provide powerful tools to investigate multiple aspects of spatial orientation behavior in the same experimental setup. Cross-species comparison of holeboard performance shows the potential for translational studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The search for novel antidepressants may be facilitated by pre-clinical animal models that relay on specific neural circuit and related neurochemical endpoint measures, which are anchored in concrete neuroanatomical and functional neural-network analyzes. One of the most important initial considerations must be which regions of the brain are candidates for the maladaptive response to depressogenic challenges. Consideration of persistent differences or changes in the activity of cerebral networks can be achieved by mapping oxidative metabolism in ethologically or pathogenetically relevant animal models. Cytochrome oxidase histochemistry is a technique suitable to detect regional long-term brain activity changes relative to control conditions and has been used in a variety of animal models. This work is summarized and indicates that major changes occur mainly in subcortical areas, highlighting specific brain regions where some alterations in regional oxidative metabolism may represent adaptive changes to depressogenic adverse life events, while others may reflect failures of adaptation. Many of these changes in oxidative metabolism may depend upon the integrity of serotonergic neurotransmission, and occur in several brain regions shown by other techniques to be involved in endogenous affective circuits that control emotional behaviors as well as related higher brain regions that integrate learning and cognitive information processing. These brain regions appear as primary targets for further identification of endophenotypes specific to affective disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review the impact of comorbid mental disorders on health care costs in adult persons with asthma.
   Method: A comprehensive search for studies investigating adult persons (>= 18 years) with asthma was conducted. All studies were included, which allowed a comparison of health care utilization and costs between asthma patients with mental disorders and asthma patients without.
   Results: The literature search revealed 1977 potentially relevant studies. Eighteen primary studies (20 publications) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Mood disorders (n=14) and anxiety disorders (n=9) were studied most often. Increased rates of hospitalizations (odds ratio range, 0.9-6.1; n=7), emergency department visits (odds ratio range, 1.8-17.2; n=7) and general practitioner visits (standardized mean difference range, 0.1-1.1; n=6) were found in asthma patients with mental comorbidity. Indirect costs of work absence were investigated in two studies pointing in the same direction of increased costs. Evidence is sparse regarding other outcomes due to a lack of primary studies.
   Conclusion: The present systematic review highlights a meaningful impact of comorbid mental disorders on health care utilization and costs in adult patients with asthma. Thus, psychodiagnostic routines and appropriate mental health treatments are needed to reduce health care costs in asthma care. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Quality-of-life (QOL) assessment and improvement have recently been recognized as important components of health care, in general, and mental health care, in particular. Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have a significantly diminished QOL. Methods: Using a Medline search of relevant keywords for the past 26 years, this article reviews the empirical literature to provide information regarding QOL measurement, impairment, impact of comorbidity, and treatment effects in MDD. Results: Studies showed that QOL is greatly affected by depression. Severity of depression is also a major contributor to further reduction in QOL when depression is comorbid with other psychiatric and medical disorders. Treatment for MDD has been shown to improve QOL in the acute treatment phase, but QOL remains low compared to healthy controls even when symptoms are in remission following treatment. Conclusions: Patients with MDD suffer from poor QOL even after reduction of symptom severity. Clinicians should therefore include QOL assessment as an important part of treating depression. More research is needed to examine the factors contributing to poor QOL in MDD and to develop interventions to ameliorate it. Additionally, future treatment studies of MDD with or without comorbid disorders should track QOL as the ultimate outcome measure of treatment success. (HARV REV PSYCHIATRY 2011; 19: 229-239.)

AB  - Background: Several computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) packages are now available to treat mild to moderate depression with or without anxiety. These have been usually been reviewed alongside cCBT for a wide range of psychological problems. Here, we single out the results of these reviews for the most common mental disorder, mild to moderate depression. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the quality of existing reviews and to enable reliable comparisons of alternative computer packages for the same patient group.
   Methods: A thorough search and analysis of reviews of efficacy of cCBT published between 1999 and February 2011.
   Results: The search yielded twelve systematic reviews from ten studies covering depression. Their methodology is appraised and selected findings are presented here.
   Conclusions: The meta-review supports the efficacy of cCBT for treatment of depression; however there is limited information on different approaches, whose relative cost-effectiveness remains to be demonstrated. Suggestions are made for future studies in the field.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the evidence for MBSR and MBCT.
   Method: Systematic searches of Medline, PsycInfo and Embase were performed in October 2010. MBSR, MBCT and Mindfulness Meditation were key words. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT) using the standard MBSR/MBCT programme with a minimum of 33 participants were included.
   Results: The search produced 72 articles, of which 21 were included. MBSR improved mental health in 11 studies compared to wait list control or treatment as usual (TAU) and was as efficacious as active control group in three studies. MBCT reduced the risk of depressive relapse in two studies compared to TAU and was equally efficacious to TAU or an active control group in two studies. Overall, studies showed medium effect sizes. Among other limitations are lack of active control group and long-term follow-up in several studies.
   Conclusion: Evidence supports that MBSR improves mental health and MBCT prevents depressive relapse. Future RCTs should apply optimal design including active treatment for comparison, properly trained instructors and at least one-year follow-up. Future research should primarily tackle the question of whether mindfulness itself is a decisive ingredient by controlling against other active control conditions or true treatments.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of psychological treatments for depression and anxiety disorders in low- and middle- income countries (LAMIC). Method: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on psychological treatment of depression and anxiety disorders in low-and middle income countries using an existing database (www.evidencebasedpsychotherapies.org), PubMed, Embase, Psychinfo, Dissertation Abstracts International and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies published in all languages. Additional studies were identified from reference lists of found studies. Randomized controlled trials in which a psychological intervention for anxiety or depression was compared to a control condition (care-as-usual, waiting list, placebo, or another control group) were included. The randomized controlled trials needed to be conducted in a LAMI country (classification of LAMI countries according to the World Bank's list of economies) to be eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Psychological treatments were defined as interventions in which the core element of treatment consisted of verbal communication between a therapist and a patient. Results: Seventeen studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 3,010 participants. The mean standardized difference between the treatment and control groups at post-test was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.76 similar to 1.28) which corresponds well with the effects found in high-income countries. Conclusion: These results indicate that psychological treatments of depression and anxiety disorders are also effective in LAMI countries, and may encourage global dissemination of these interventions.

AB  - Objective: Weight loss surgery has been heralded as a treatment alternative for patients with morbid obesity. Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent in bariatric surgery candidates and a myriad of psychosocial variables has been explored to identify mediators of post-surgery weight loss. The following review aims to elucidate psychosocial predictors of weight loss outcomes specific to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGBS).
   Methods: We searched PubMed for prospective trials evaluating psychosocial predictors for weight loss with RYGBS published between 2000 and 2010. Manual searches of references listed in review articles, case series and anecdotal reports supplemented our literature search. Additional literature on post-bariatric surgery psychosocial outcomes and management of psychiatric sequelae in bariatric surgery patients are discussed in this review.
   Results: A total of 20 prospective studies were identified. Our review found that few psychosocial factors have been studied and results were predominantly inconclusive. We observed heterogeneity amongst studies with respect to study duration and assessment methods. Binge eating disorder, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders have not reliably predicted weight loss in identified studies. Preliminary results suggest that psychosocial support is an important predictor of postoperative weight loss and highlight a likely role for pre-and post-surgery support groups.
   Conclusion: Social support, current or lifetime Axis I disorder, and post-operative loss of control over eating have been identified as important predictors of weight loss post-RYGBS. Larger, long-term studies are needed to further elucidate psychosocial risk factors for weight loss post-RYGBS.

AB  - In the field of traumatic stress, chemoprophylaxis is a term that is often used but rarely well under stood. There has been no shortage of debate on the issue, but few rigorous studies to ground the discussion. The purpose of the current paper is to explore the issues surrounding this contentious area. Databases including PubMed, PsychArticles and Web of Knowledge were searched using the key words 'chemo or pharmaco', 'prevention or prophylaxis', and 'PTSD or post-traumatic stress'. Relevant journals and reference lists of the papers obtained through this search were scanned for additional references. Studies that investigated the use of pharmacotherapy to prevent the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder were considered for this paper. Studies that examined the treatment of established PTSD were excluded. A total of 15 empirical studies were included in the review (including five randomized controlled trials), and twice as many non-data-driven papers. Evidence for the prophylactic use of alcohol, morphine, propranolol, and hydrocortisone is presented, followed by a discussion of the many challenges of using pharmacological interventions in this context. While attention to this issue has increased in recent times, the dearth of empirical data has done little to further the field. Larger studies are indicated following small trials with medications such as propranolol and hydrocortisone. There remain a number of ethical and practical questions to be answered before the widespread use of chemoprophylaxis can be recommended.

AB  - Introduction: Psychological therapies can modify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of people with mental disorders, but the underlying brain mechanisms remain to be clarified. Advances in neuroimaging techniques can help us to understand of how different psychotherapies change the human brain. This review has aimed to systematically investigate the brain effects of psychological therapies for adults with anxiety disorders.
   Method: Several electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE and EBSCO) up to April 2010 were searched. Abstracts which appeared to fulfill the initial selection criteria (structured psychological treatment in adults with anxiety disorders with at least one neuroimaging study performed before and after the treatment) were selected and their original articles were then retrieved. References from the selected English and Spanish language publications were also hand searched.
   Results: Eighteen studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The majority of these papers reported cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in specific phobia, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder or panic disorder. Psychological interventions changed neural circuits involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, especially activity in frontal-striatal circuits in OCD and prefrontal areas in arachnophobia (spider phobia). However, the results are largely inconsistent among themselves and with the neurobiological models of anxiety, in particular as regards the changes on the limbic level.
   Conclusions: Despite the variety of methodological concerns, initial neuroimaging studies have shown that psychological interventions can change brain function related to anxiety disorders in the patients who respond to treatment. Neuromodulation mechanisms related to specific anxiety disorders remained to be elucidated. Future studies should delineate the process of "normalization" that occurs in the brain during a psychological treatment, helping to enrich the current neurobiological models of the origins, maintenance and treatment of anxiety disorders.

AB  - Acupuncture has been reported to affect the autonomic system. Currently, there are no systematic reviews examining the effect of acupuncture on HRV available in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to summarize and critically assess the effects of acupuncture on heart rate variability. We searched the literature using 14 databases for articles published from the earliest available publications until October 2009 without language restrictions. We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture and sham acupuncture. The risk of bias in each study was assessed using the Cochrane criteria. Twelve RCTs met all of the inclusion criteria. One RCT evaluated the effects of acupuncture in patients with minor depression or anxiety disorders and another RCT examined the effect of acupuncture on migraine patients. Another four RCTs tested the effects of acupuncture in healthy subjects who were exposed to several conditions, including mental stress, fatigue from driving, and caffeine intake. The remaining six RCTs assessed the effects of acupuncture on healthy subjects in a normal state without any stressors. Five RCTs found significant differences in HRV between patients treated with acupuncture versus those treated with sham acupuncture (controls). However, the majority of the other RCTs showed inconsistent results or did not identify significant differences in HRV spectral parameters among individuals treated with acupuncture as compared to those treated with sham acupuncture. In conclusion, sham-controlled RCTs showed variable results and no clear evidence that acupuncture has any specific effects on HRV. Therefore, more rigorous research appears to be warranted.

AB  - Objective: Mindfulness meditations (MM) are a group of meditation practices which are increasingly receiving attention. The aim of the present work is to review current findings about the neural correlates of MM and compare such findings with other specific and non-specific treatments.
   Methods: A literature search was undertaken using MEDLINE, ISI web of knowledge, the Cochrane database and references of retrieved articles. Studies which focused on the functional neural correlates of MM, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and placebo published up to August 2009 were screened in order to be considered for the inclusion.
   Results: Main findings suggest that long-term MM practice allows a more flexible emotional regulation by engaging frontal cortical structures to dampen automatic amygdala activation. A large overlap exists between cerebral areas activated during MM, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and those activated by placebo. However, while MM, psychotherapy and placebo seem to act through a top-down regulation, antidepressants seem to act through a bottom-up process.
   Conclusion: MM seem to target specific brain areas related to emotions and emotional regulation. Similar mechanisms have been observed also in other interventions, particularly psychotherapy.

AB  - Objectives: Little research has focused on the relation of immigration and suicidal behaviour in youth. Nevertheless, the impact of migration on the mental health of youth is an issue of increasing societal importance. This review aimed to present studies on the prevalence of suicidal behaviour in immigrant youth in various countries and to provide possible explanations for suicidal behaviour in immigrant youth, especially regarding acculturation.
   Methods: The review included a literature search to locate articles on the subject of suicidal behaviour in immigrant youth in the context of acculturation.
   Results: Studies on suicidal behaviour in culturally diverse youth are few and most of the existing research does not differentiate ethnic minorities from immigrants. Studies on epidemiology and on specific risk factors were found regarding various immigrant youth including Hispanics in the United States, Asians in North America and Europe, as well as comparative studies between different immigrant groups in specific countries.
   Conclusions: The relation between immigration status and suicidal behaviours in youth appears to vary by ethnicity and country of settlement. Time spent in the new country as well as intergenerational communication and conflicts with parents have, in many of the studies, been related to suicidality in immigrant youth. Summing up, there is a clear and urgent need to further pursue the work in this field, to develop targeted public health interventions as well as psychosocial treatment for preventing suicide in these youth.

AB  - Objective: To provide a best estimate of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among detained male adolescents, with particular emphasis on impairment, multi-informant assessment, and race or ethnicity.
   Method: Computer-assisted searches were executed to identify relevant studies.
   Results: Fifteen studies using adolescents as informants met inclusion criteria (n = 3401), of which only 2 reported within a subsample on parent-derived diagnoses. The mean prevalence of any disorder was 69.9% (95% CI 69.5% to 70.3%); with conduct disorder occurring most frequently (46.4%, 95% CI 45.6% to 47.3%), followed by substance use disorder (45.1%, 95% CI 44.6% to 45.5%), oppositional defiant disorder (19.8%, 95% CI 19.2% to 20.3%), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (13.5%, 95% CI 13.2% to 13.9%). Although lower, rates for internalizing disorders were still substantial, with any anxiety disorder found in 15.9% (95% CI 15.6% to 16.1%), major depression in 12.0% (95% CI 11.7% to 12.2%), and posttraumatic stress disorder in 9.6% (95% CI 9.2% to 10.0%). Three studies reported on psychotic disorders, finding low rates (1.35%, 95% CI 1.32% to 1.39%). Estimates of prevalence were only marginally different when impairment was not required, while consistency between adolescents and parents was poor. Findings on the relations between race or ethnicity were too scarce and inconsistent to interpret.
   Conclusion: Detained male adolescents bear substantial mental health needs, emphasizing the need to organize effective mental health services for this troubled group. However, our knowledge on mental disorders in detained youth should be enhanced, in particular regarding the reliability of adolescents, compared with parent report, and whether clinically relevant differences exist by race or ethnicity.

AB  - Suicide is an escalating public health problem, and alcohol use has consistently been implicated in the precipitation of suicidal behavior. Alcohol abuse may lead to suicidality through disinhibition, impulsiveness and impaired judgment, but it may also be used as a means to ease the distress associated with committing an act of suicide. We reviewed evidence of the relationship between alcohol use and suicide through a search of MedLine and PsychInfo electronic databases. Multiple genetically-related intermediate phenotypes might influence the relationship between alcohol and suicide. Psychiatric disorders, including psychosis, mood disorders and anxiety disorders, as well as susceptibility to stress, might increase the risk of suicidal behavior, but may also have reciprocal influences with alcohol drinking patterns. Increased suicide risk may be heralded by social withdrawal, breakdown of social bonds, and social marginalization, which are common outcomes of untreated alcohol abuse and dependence. People with alcohol dependence or depression should be screened for other psychiatric symptoms and for suicidality. Programs for suicide prevention must take into account drinking habits and should reinforce healthy behavioral patterns.

   Method: An electronic and a manual literature search of psychotherapies for mood and anxiety disorders were conducted.
   Results: Five new therapies for mood disorders and 3 interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder with co-occurring substance abuse met criteria for inclusion in this review. Fewer psychotherapies have been developed for other anxiety disorders. Although research for some of the psychotherapies has demonstrated superiority to usual care, none have firmly established efficacy or specific benefits over other established psychotherapies.
   Conclusions: A plurality of the new psychotherapies introduced and established in the past 5 years have been different assimilations of previously established cognitive-behavioural, interpersonal, or psychodynamic models. While initial results are promising for some, more rigorous efficacy trials and replications are necessary before conclusions can be drawn regarding their relative benefits.

AB  - Several decades of research have focused on the impact of exposure to postnatal depression on children, while anxiety has been largely overlooked. Estimates of the prevalence of postnatal maternal anxiety (PMA) range from 3% to 43%, suggesting PMA may be an important risk factor for adverse outcomes in children. This review summarizes what is known about the effects of PMA exposure on children and makes recommendations for future research. A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE (R) and PsychINFO (R) through 2008 identified 18 studies that evaluated child outcomes associated with PMA exposure. Identified studies covered three domains: somatic, developmental, and psychological outcomes. The strongest evidence for an adverse effect of PMA exposure is in somatic and psychological outcomes; the evidence for an effect of PMA on child development is inconclusive. Methodological differences among the studies make comparisons difficult and there are a number of common limitations that challenge the validity of these studies.

TI  - Work-related stress and psychosomatic medicine
AB  - This article introduces key concepts of work-related stress relevant to the clinical and research fields of psychosomatic medicine. Stress is a term used to describe the body's physiological and/or psychological reaction to circumstances that require behavioral adjustment. According to the Japanese National Survey of Health, the most frequent stressors are work-related problems, followed by health-related and then financial problems. Conceptually, work-related stress includes a variety of conditions, such as overwork, unemployment or job insecurity, and lack of work-family balance. Job stress has been linked to a range of adverse physical and mental health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Stressful working conditions can also impact employee well-being indirectly by directly contributing to negative health behaviors or by limiting an individual's ability to make positive changes to lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking and sedentary behavior. Over the past two decades, two major job stress models have dominated the occupational health literature: the job demand-control-support model and the effort-reward imbalance model. In both models, standardized questionnaires have been developed and frequently used to assess job stress. Unemployment has also been reported to be associated with increased mortality and morbidity, such as by cardiovascular disease, stroke, and suicide. During the past two decades, a trend toward more flexible labor markets has emerged in the private and public sectors of developed countries, and temporary employment arrangements have increased. Temporary workers often complain that they are more productive but receive less compensation than permanent workers. A significant body of research reveals that temporary workers have reported chronic work-related stress for years. The Japanese government has urged all employers to implement four approaches to comprehensive mind/body health care for stress management in the workplace: focusing on individuals, utilizing supervisory lines, enlisting company health care staff, and referring to medical resources outside the company. Good communications between occupational health practitioners and physicians in charge in hospitals/clinics help employees with psychosomatic distress to return to work, and it is critical for psychosomatic practitioners and researchers to understand the basic ideas of work-related stress from the viewpoint of occupational health.

AB  - In addition to nigrostriatal pathology and corresponding motor disturbances, Parkinson's disease (PD) is often characterized by co-morbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, most notably anxiety and depression. Separate lines of evidence indicate that inflammatory processes associated with microglial activation and cytokine release may be fundamental to the progression of both PD and its co-morbid psychiatric pathology. Accordingly, we assessed the contribution of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), to a range of PD-like pathology provoked by the ecologically relevant herbicide and dopamine (DA) toxin, paraquat. To this end, paraquat provoked overt motor impairment (reduced home-cage activity and impaired vertical climbing) and signs of anxiety-like behavior (reduced open field exploration) in wild-type but not IFN-gamma-deficient mice. Correspondingly, paraquat promoted somewhat divergent variations in neurochemical activity among wild-type and IFN-gamma null mice at brain sites important for both motor (striatum) and co-morbid affective pathologies (dorsal hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and locus coeruleus). Specifically, the herbicide provoked a dosing regimen-dependent reduction in striatal DA levels that was prevented by IFN-gamma deficiency. In addition, the herbicide influenced serotonergic and noradrenergic activity within the dorsal hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex; and elevated noradrenergic activity within the locus coeruleus. Although genetic ablation of IFN-gamma had relatively few effects on monoamine variations within the locus coeruleus and prefrontal cortex, loss of the pro-inflammatory cytokine did normalize the paraquat-induced noradrenergic alterations within the hippocampus. These findings further elucidate the functional implications of paraquat intoxication and suggest an important role for IFN-gamma in the striatal and motor pathology, as well as the co-morbid behavioral and hippocampal changes induced by paraquat.

AB  - Background: Most of our social interactions involve perception of emotional information from the faces of other people. Furthermore, such emotional processes are thought to be aberrant in a range of clinical disorders, including psychosis and depression. However, the exact neurofunctional maps underlying emotional facial processing are not well defined. Methods: Two independent researchers conducted separate comprehensive PubMed (1990 to May 2008) searches to find all functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using a variant of the emotional faces paradigm in healthy participants. The search terms were: "fMRI AND happy faces," "fMRI AND sad faces," "fMRI AND fearful faces," "fMRI AND angry faces," " fMRI AND disgusted faces" and "fMRI AND neutral faces." We extracted spatial coordinates and inserted them in an electronic database. We performed activation likelihood estimation analysis for voxel-based meta-analyses. Results: Of the originally identified studies, 105 met our inclusion criteria. The overall database consisted of 1785 brain coordinates that yielded an overall sample of 1600 healthy participants. Quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis of brain activation provided neurofunctional maps for 1) main effect of human faces; 2) main effect of emotional valence; and 3) modulatory effect of age, sex, explicit versus implicit processing and magnetic field strength. Processing of emotional faces was associated with increased activation in a number of visual, limbic, temporoparietal and prefrontal areas; the putamen; and the cerebellum. Happy, fearful and sad faces specifically activated the amygdala, whereas angry or disgusted faces had no effect on this brain region. Furthermore, amygdala sensitivity was greater for fearful than for happy or sad faces. Insular activation was selectively reported during processing of disgusted and angry faces. However, insular sensitivity was greater for disgusted than for angry faces. Conversely, neural response in the visual cortex and cerebellum was observable across all emotional conditions. Limitations: Although the activation likelihood estimation approach is currently one of the most powerful and reliable meta-analytical methods in neuroimaging research, it is insensitive to effect sizes. Conclusion: Our study has detailed neurofunctional maps to use as normative references in future fMRI studies of emotional facial processing in psychiatric populations. We found selective differences between neural networks underlying the basic emotions in limbic and insular brain regions.

AB  - Estimated prevalence of childhood and adolescent depression varies from 0.4% to 3% at the 0-12 age range and 3.3% to 12.4% at the 13-18 age range. Despite similarities in the clinical picture of major depression in children, adolescents, and adults, there are notable differences in the neurobiological correlates and treatment response of depressed patients in these different age cohorts. In contrast to adults, most depressed children fail to respond to antidepressants. The main aim of this paper is to review several studies which attempt to develop and examine genetic animal models for childhood depression, in order to enable a search for new, unique treatment approaches for depressed children. Two different "depressive-like" rat strains were studied: Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) and their controls, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats; and the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) strain and their controls, Wistar rats. The results suggest that prepubertal FSL and WKY rats exhibit different styles of depressive behavior, one co-morbid with "anxiety-like" behavior (WKY), and one that is not (FSL). These two profiles may model clinical characteristics that resemble two subgroups of depressed children. However, in general the data on the WKY rats would seem most consistent with a classic childhood depressive profile. The FSL profile may possibly be related to chronic stress, and its role as a potential model of childhood depression requires further support. These two different putative genetic animal models of childhood depression can help in the attempts to understand the neurobiological basis and to predict successful treatment strategies for different patterns of childhood psychopathology.

AB  - Objective: Deliberate self-harm behavior-without suicidal intent-is a serious health problem and may be studied as a clinical phenomenon in its own right. Empirical studies of sociodemographic and psychological correlates and risk factors are systematically reviewed. Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX (German psychological literature), and reference lists. We targeted self-induced bodily harm without conscious suicidal intent. Studies on suicidal behavior or self-poisoning were only included if they also assessed nonsuicidal self-harm. Results: Fifty-nine original studies met the criteria. Deliberate self-harm may occur at all ages, yet adolescents and young adults are at a higher risk. Evidence on gender is complex. Only 5 studies realize a prospective design (6 months to 10 years) and test predictors. The majority use cross-sectional and retrospective methods. No longitudinal study (separately) examines new incidence. Evidence of correlates encompasses distal/proximal, person/environment, and state/trait factors. Many studies report associations between current self-harm behavior and a history of childhood sexual abuse. Adolescent and adult self-harmers experience more frequent and more negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and aggressiveness, than persons who do not self-harm. Two studies yield specific interactions between childhood trauma and current traits and states such as low emotional expressivity, low self-esteem, and dissociation with respect to a vulnerability to self-harm. Conclusion: Evidence of distal, biographical stressors is fairly strong. Proximal stressors have rarely been investigated; protective factors, hardly at all. Despite many findings of correlates, the data do not yet justify terming them risk factors. Longitudinal studies are needed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although exposure to substantial stress has a major impact on the development of depression, there is considerable variability in the susceptibility of individuals to the adverse effects of stress. The personality trait of high anxiety has been identified as a vulnerability factor to develop depression. We propose here a new unifying model based on a series of neurocognitive mechanisms (and fed with crucial information provided by research on the fields of emotion, stress and cognition) whereby individuals presenting a high anxiety trait are particularly vulnerable to develop depression when facing stress and adversity. Our model highlights the importance of developing prevention programs addressed to restrain, in high anxious individuals, the triggering of a dysfunctional neurocognitive cascade while coping with stress.

We attempt to examine potential mechanisms that have been proposed as mediators for the RS and mental health relation. We also examine more philosophical areas including patient and physician opinions about inclusion of RS in patient care, and ethical issues that may arise. We review suggested guidelines for sensitive patient inquiry, and opportunities and challenges for education of psychiatrists and trainees. We also study practical ways to incorporate psychospiritual interventions into patient treatment, with specific reference to more common spiritual issues such as forgiveness, gratitude, and altruism.

AB  - To provide clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations for the management of depression in adults that are informative, easy to assimilate and facilitate clinical decision making.
   A comprehensive literature review of over 500 articles was undertaken using electronic database search engines (e.g. MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Cochrane reviews). In addition articles, book chapters and other literature known to the authors were reviewed. The findings were then formulated into a set of recommendations that were developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians who routinely deal with mood disorders. The recommendations then underwent consultative review by a broader advisory panel that included experts in the field, clinical staff and patient representatives.
   The clinical practice recommendations for depression (Depression CPR) summarize evidence-based treatments and provide a synopsis of recommendations relating to each phase of the illness. They are designed for clinical use and have therefore been presented succinctly in an innovative and engaging manner that is clear and informative.
   These up-to-date recommendations provide an evidence-based framework that incorporates clinical wisdom and consideration of individual factors in the management of depression. Further, the novel style and practical approach should promote uptake and implementation.

AB  - Objective: To review the clinical features and current knowledge on the treatment of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Method: We searched the PubMed database combining HIV/AIDS with different keywords for psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms (e.g. depression, mania, anxiety, psychosis, dementia, substance abuse) and for psychopharmacological treatment. The years covered by these searches included 1980 to 2008. Results: Patients with HIV infection are at an increased risk of psychiatric illness. Major depressive disorder and subsyndromal depressive symptoms, as well as anxiety disorder and substance abuse are more prevalent among HIV infected individuals than among the general population. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are common among HIV patients, and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is a serious condition during the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) stage of HIV disease. Secondary mania and psychosis might be the first clinical symptom of HIV dementia. The introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in significant decreases in morbidity and mortality for HIV infected patients. HAART has also decreased the incidence of HAD, but does not give complete protection from this condition. The utility of psychotropic medications in HIV patients has not been studied sufficiently as a basis for guidelines, and more controlled trials are needed. Conclusion: Psychiatric illness is common in HIV infected individuals, and underlines the importance for screening not only for cognitive impairment but also for co morbid mental disease in HIV-positive patients. Further studies of the neuropsychiatric complications during HIV disease and the use of psychotropics under these circumstances are clearly needed. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of HAD is essential to identify additional therapeutic strategies for prevention and treatment of this neurodegenerative disease. Studies are also needed for optimizing effective utilization of antiretrovirals into the CNS. Mania and psychosis secondary to HAD may be used as an indicator to initiate HAART, irrespective of CD4 count. Further research on the utility of HAART in the treatment of such acute neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with HIV infection should be initiated.

AB  - Background The number of asylum seekers, refugees and internally displaced people worldwide is rising. Western countries are using increasingly restrictive policies, including the detention of asylum seekers, and there is concern that this is harmful.
   Aims
   To investigate mental health outcomes among adult, child and adolescent immigration detainees.
   Method
   A systematic review was conducted of studies investigating the impact of immigration detention on the mental health of children, adolescents and adults, identified by a systematic search of databases and a supplementary manual search of references.
   Results
   Ten studies were identified. All reported high levels of mental health problems in detainees. Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were commonly reported, as were self-harm and suicidal ideation. Time in detention was positively associated with severity of distress. There is evidence for an initial improvement in mental health occurring subsequent to release, although longitudinal results have shown that the negative impact of detention persists.
   Conclusions
   This area of research is in its infancy and studies are limited by methodological constraints. Findings consistently report high levels of mental health problems among detainees. There is some evidence to suggest an independent adverse effect of detention on mental health.

Further, psychiatrists may find exciting work within the relatively new field of palliative care, which is devoted to the prevention and relief of all suffering. Increasingly, individuals are living longer with multiple issues that cause suffering, interfere with their lives, and often lead to psychosocial sequelae. To ensure state-of-the-art care for patients and families throughout an illness and any ensuing bereavement period, many experienced psychiatrists are needed as consultants to, and as members of, interdisciplinary palliative care teams. This need presents limitless opportunities for psychiatrists to care for patients, provide education, and engage in research. The potential to make a difference is great.

AB  - Parkinson's disease and other motor disorders of midbrain basal ganglia dopaminergic functioning are often characterized by alterations of brainstem and limbic systems with accompanying co-morbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory processes may play an important role in such neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathology. In this regard, inhibition of the inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was reported to limit the impact of stressors as well as the neurodegenerative effects of dopaminergic toxins. The present investigation assessed the impact of the putative dopamine toxin paraquat (a widely used herbicide) upon motor functioning, behavioural indices of anxiety-like states and central monoamine levels and whether these effects were altered in mice lacking COX-2. Indeed, paraquat did induce motor impairment and altered dopamine utilization within the striatum, and COX-2 deletion moderately attenuated these effects. Conversely, COX-2 deficiency enhanced the impact of paraquat upon indices of anxiety (open field exploration) and on serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic alterations within two brain regions implicated in stressor-related pathologies, namely the dorsal hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that COX-2 might differentially influence the motor and psychiatric symptoms associated with environmental toxin exposure. Furthermore, these data indicate that the neurochemical impact of paraquat is not restricted to the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway but also involves stressor-sensitive limbic regions. It is possible that COX-2 may play a dual role by contributing to the motor impairment induced by paraquat, but acting to moderate the effects of paraquat upon processes aligned with anxiety and depression.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence estimating an impact of occupational factors on mood disorders and suicide, and the efficacy of interventions. This review is based on literature searches using Medline and Psych INFO from 1966 to 2007 (keywords: work stress, job insecurity, job strain, shift work, violence, occupational health, mood disorders, depression, and suicide). To establish the relationship between occupational variables and mood disorders, we focused on clinically significant disorders rather than depressive symptoms. During the last decade, prospective epidemiological studies have suggested a predictive association between the work environment and mood disorders. Recently, increasing numbers of clinical trials have shown favorable effect size of intervention and suggested preferable return-on-investment results. However, low awareness and social stigma still decrease workers access to treatment. Mental health professionals in conjunction with employers have to devise a creative system to make the quality care being offered more accessible to employees. In addition, further outcome data is needed to evaluate the benefit of managing mood disorders in the workplace, and to foster awareness of positive implications for employees, employers, their families, and the society at large. In addition, the work environment, with its chemical (e.g. chemosensory factors, pollutants), physical (e.g. lighting, noise, temperature, outdoor views and activities), biological (e.g., chronobiological factors, allergens, infectious agents), psychological (e.g. demand-control, effort-reward balance), social (e.g. cohesiveness, support), and organizational (e.g. leadership styles) component should meet minimal standards, and may improve with striving towards the optimum.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a critical review of the research on mood and anxiety disorders in relatives of individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). In the first section, we explore methodological issues with these studies. In the second section, we present results. METHOD: A Medline search identified studies published on family history of mood and anxiety disorders in AN, and was complemented by a manual search. Only studies from 1980 to 2006 using strict diagnostic criteria for the disorders were included (Feighner and Halmi criteria for AN, Reasearch Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Third Edition - Revised (DSM-III-R) or DSM - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) for anorexia and other disorders]. RESULTS: A review of the research methods used in the studies revealed a number of methodological problems. Therefore, we provide only a description of the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in relatives of individuals with AN. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of the methodological issues uncovered, the value of the results of these studies and their implications for further study are considered.

AB  - Objective: There is growing epidemiological literature focusing on the bidirectional association between psychosocial factors and atopic disorders, but no efforts to quantify the relationship systematically have been published. Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed up to June 2007. The studies included were prospective cohort studies investigating the influence of psychosocial factors on atopic disorders and the effect of atopic disorders on mental health. Two investigators independently extracted data and determined study quality. Results: There were 43 studies (in 22 articles), of which 34 evaluated the effect of psychosocial factors on atopic disorders and 9 evaluated the effect of atopic disorders on mental health. The major atopic disease assessed in these studies was asthma (90.7%) with allergic rhinitis, 4.7%; atopic dermatitis, 2.3%; and food allergies, 2.3%. The overall meta-analysis exhibited a positive association between psychosocial factors and future atopic disorder (correlation coefficient (r) as combined size effect .024; 95% confidence interval, 0.014-0.035; p <.001) as well as between atopic disorders and future poor mental health (r =.044, 95% confidence interval, 0.021- 0.067, p < .001). More notably, the subgroup meta-analysis on the healthy and atopic disorder populations showed psychosocial factors had both an etiological and prognostic effect on atopic disorders. Conclusions: The current review revealed a robust relationship between psychosocial factors and atopic disorders. This supports the use of psychological in addition to conventional physical and pharmacological interventions, in the successful prevention and management of atopic disorders.

AB  - Objective: Several papers arriving from the neuroimmunomodulation field are showing the relevant relationships between the nervous and the immune systems. A review of studies was carried out to describe the bases of the studies on neuroimmunomodulation. Experimental models: It is clear nowadays that emotional states such as anxiety and depression change immune system activity, an affect also observed after both stress and use of nervous system acting drugs. Sick behavior: The behavior displayed by sick organisms might be thought as being a consequence of homeostatic strategies. Possible mechanism of the action by means of immune system to nervous system: A very big emphasis is being given to Hipothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, simpathetic nervous system and cytokines participation on nervous system and immune system relationships. Conclusion: The present revision intend to show some essential studies in the neuroimmunomodulation field; it makes a critical analysis of the mutual relationships between nervous system and immune system.

AB  - The insular cortex is located in the centre of the cerebral hemisphere, having connections with the primary and secondary somatosensory areas, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdaloid body, prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, frontal and parietal opercula, primary and association auditory cortices, visual association cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and motor cortex. Accordingly, dense connections exist among insular cortex neurons. The insular cortex is involved in the processing of visceral sensory, visceral motor, vestibular, attention, pain, emotion, verbal, motor information, inputs related to music and eating, in addition to gustatory, olfactory, visual, auditory, and tactile data. In this article, the literature on the relationship between the insular cortex and neuropsychiatric disorders was summarized following a computer search of the Pub-Med database. Recent neuroimaging data, including voxel based morphometry, PET and fMRI, revealed that the insular cortex was involved in various neuropsychiatric diseases such as mood disorders, panic disorders, PTSD, obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. Investigations of functions and connections of the insular cortex suggest that sensory information including gustatory, olfactory, visual, auditory, and tactile inputs converge on the insular cortex, and that these multimodal sensory information may be integrated there.

   Methods: Using MEDLINE and PubMed searches, we reviewed the recent research on the origins, course, and consequences of pregnancy-related depression.
   Results: Depressive disorders are more common in pregnancy and postpartum than widely assumed, and there is no predictable protective effect of pregnancy. Relapse rates are high, and the postpartum period represents a time of increased vulnerability to depression.
   Conclusion: Early identification and treatment of perinatal depression will minimize morbidity and mortality for the woman, the child, and the family.

   Methods: We conducted a literature search of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases. Key words included the following: perinatal, pregnancy, postpartum, depression, anxiety, pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, psychotherapy, and treatment.
   Results: Recent literature reflects that both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for perinatal women are associated with positive and negative outcomes. No treatment decision was found to be risk-free. The detrimental effects of untreated mental illness on the mother, as well as on the baby, highlight the need for treatment intervention. The long-term effects of exposure to either medications or maternal mental illness are unknown, as yet.
   Conclusion: Women with perinatal depression and anxiety disorders require timely and efficient management with a goal of providing symptom relief for the suffering mother while simultaneously ensuring the baby's safety. Although knowledge in the area of appropriate intervention is constantly evolving, rigorous and scientifically sound research in the future is critical.

AB  - Background Several virtual reality (VR) applications for the understanding, assessment and treatment of mental health problems have been developed in the last 10 years. The purpose of this review is to outline the current state of virtual reality research in the treatment of mental health problems. Methods PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for all articles containing the words "virtual reality". In addition a manual search of the references contained in the papers resulting from this search was conducted and relevant periodicals were searched. Studies reporting the results of treatment utilizing VR in the mental health field and involving at least one patient were identified. Results More than 50 studies using VR were identified, the majority of which were case studies. Seventeen employed a between groups design: 4 involved patients with fear of flying; 3 involved patients with fear of heights; 3 involved patients with social phobia/public speaking anxiety; 2 involved people with spider phobia; 2 involved patients with agoraphobia; 2 involved patients with body image disturbance and 1 involved obese patients. There are both advantages in terms of delivery and disadvantages in terms of side effects to using VR. Although virtual reality based therapy appears to be superior to no treatment the effectiveness of VR therapy over traditional therapeutic approaches is not supported by the research currently available. Conclusions There is a lack of good quality research on the effectiveness of VR therapy. Before clinicians will be able to make effective use of this emerging technology greater emphasis must be placed on controlled trials with clinically identified populations.

AB  - The authors review research showing that when recalling autobiographical events, many emotionally disturbed patients summarize categories of events rather than retrieving a single episode. The mechanisms underlying such overgeneral memory are examined, with a focus on M. A. Conway and C. W. Pleydell-Pearce's (2000) hierarchical search model of personal event retrieval. An elaboration of this model is proposed to account for overgeneral memory, focusing on how memory search can be affected by (a) capture and rumination processes, when mnemonic information used in retrieval activates ruminative thinking; (b) functional avoidance, when episodic material threatens to cause affective disturbance; and (c) impairment in executive capacity and control that limits an individual's ability to remain focused on retrieval in the face of distraction.

This paper reviews published data on the economic impact of CBT to inform recommendations for current Canadian mental health care funding policy.
   Method: We searched the literature for economic analyses of CBT in the treatment of mental disorders.
   Results: We identified 22 health economic studies involving CBT for mood, anxiety, psychotic, and somatoform disorders. Across health care settings and patient populations, CBT alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy represented acceptable value for health dollars spent, with CBT costs offset by reduced health care use.
   Conclusions: International evidence suggests CBT is cost-effective. Greater access to CBT would likely improve outcomes and result in cost savings. Future research is warranted to evaluate the economic impact of CBT in Canada.

   Method: A systematic search of the literature published from 1990 onwards was conducted.
   Results: Mental disorders in old-age are common. The most serious threats to mental health in old-age are posed by dementia and depression. It is a clear cut finding that dementia exponentially increases with age. The basic issue of whether depression increases or decreases with age remains unsolved. Databases on substance use, mild cognitive impairment, psychotic syndromes, anxiety, and somatoform disorders in old-age are much smaller, making conclusions difficult to draw.
   Conclusion: Numerous questions in the field remain to be answered. Concerted action is needed to produce comparable data across Europe.

This article aims to provide an overview of these important findings in order to assist the clinician in treating women with bipolar disorder. Complex issues regarding the treatment of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the post-partum period are discussed.
   Method: A literature review was undertaken using Medline (1966-current), PsychInfo and PubMed databases. Search terms used were gender, sex, women, bipolar disorder, suicide, epidemiology, rapid cycling, mixed episode, treatment, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, pregnancy, post-partum, menopause, lactation and breast-feeding.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of bipolar I disorder is equal in men and women; however, bipolar II appears to be more common in women. Gender differences have been reported in the phenomenology, course and outcome of this condition. Some comorbid disorders, such as thyroid disease and anxiety disorders have more relevance to women. Increasingly, sex differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medications used in bipolar disorder are being reported.
   Conclusions: There is increasing evidence for gender differences in a number of clinical features of bipolar disorder that have relevance to management. Although more studies are needed, it is important for clinicians to be aware of these issues to optimize treatment of women with this condition.

AB  - Purpose of review Behavioral and psychiatric disturbances are the more frequent consequences of traumatic brain injury and major determinants of the quality of life of patients. This review was designed to familiarize the reader with the more recent work published in this field.
   Recent findings We have now a more consistent view of the epidemiology of post-traumatic brain injury psychiatric disorders both in adult and pediatric populations. Mood disorders, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders are the more prevalent psychiatric diagnoses among traumatic brain injury patients. The phenomenological characteristics and clinical correlates of major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorders, and post-traumatic brain injury attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have been studied in more detail. Newer structural, metabolic and functional neuroimaging techniques help to clarify the pathogenesis of these disorders. In turn, this knowledge may lead to the implementation of more efficient therapeutic interventions. Unfortunately, controlled treatment studies have been the exception in the field, and treatment decisions usually lack adequate empirical support.
   Summary Recent advances in the basic neuroscience of traumatic brain injury as well as in behavioral genetics, social science and neuroimaging techniques should contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the psychiatric disorders occurring after the injury. There is a great need for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to establish the most effective treatments for these disorders.

AB  - Genetically engineered mice were originally generated to delineate the role of a specific gene product in behavioral or neuroendocrine phenotypes, rather than to produce classic animal models of depression. To learn more about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying a clinical condition such as depression, it has proven worthwhile to investigate changes in behaviors characteristic of depressed humans, such as anxiety, regardless of whether or not these alterations may also occur in other disorders besides depression. The majority of patients with mood and anxiety disorders have measurable shifts in their stress hormone regulation as reflected by elevated secretion of central and peripheral stress hormones or by altered hormonal responses to neuroendocrine challenge tests. In recent years, these alterations have been increasingly translated into testable hypotheses addressing the pathogenesis of illness. Refined molecular technologies and the creation of genetically engineered mice have allowed to specifically target individual genes involved in regulation of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system elements (e.g. CRF and CRF-related peptides, their receptors, binding protein). Studies performed in such mice have complemented and extended our knowledge. The cumulative evidence makes a strong case implicating dysfunction of these systems in the pathogenesis of depression and leads us beyond the monoaminergic synapse in search of eagerly anticipated strategies to discover and develop better therapies for depression.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature on the perinatal risks involved in untreated depression during pregnancy.
   Method: We searched Medline and medical texts for all studies pertaining to this area up to the end of April 2003. Key phrases entered were depression and pregnancy, depression and pregnancy outcome, and depression and untreated pregnancy. We did not include bipolar depression.
   Results: While there is wide variability in reported effects, untreated depression during pregnancy appears to carry substantial perinatal risks. These may be direct risks to the fetus and infant or risks secondary to unhealthy maternal behaviours arising from the depression. Recent human data suggest that untreated postpartum depression, not treatment with antidepressants in pregnancy, results in adverse perinatal outcome.
   Conclusion: The biological dysregulation caused by gestational depression has not received appropriate attention: most studies focus on the potential but unproven risks of psychotropic medication. No in-depth discussion of the role of psychotherapy is available. Because they are not aware of the potentially catastrophic outcome of untreated maternal depression, this imbalance may lead women suffering from depression to fear teratogenic effects and refuse treatment.

AB  - Research investigating the alexithymia construct is advancing rapidly and has broadened considerably in recent years as a result of interdisciplinary efforts, new methodologies, and experimental techniques. New developments in the field include a shift from measurement-based validational studies to experimental investigations, which explore the relation between alexithymia and various aspects of emotional processing; the use of functional brain imaging techniques to explore neural activity associated with alexithymia; and experimental studies that measure multiple indices of physiological response to standardized emotion-inducing stimuli. Developmental research and attachment studies are providing ways for investigating potential etiological sources of the construct; and experimental approaches are being used to explore relations between alexithymia and other health-related personality constructs. In addition, longitudinal and treatment studies are clarifying the relation between alexithymia and psychopathology and the extent to which alexithymia predicts treatment outcome. Investigators need to embrace the new methods and techniques for the field of research to further increase understanding of the alexithymia construct and its association with physical and mental illness.

AB  - Objective: Our objective was to review and compare, with meta-analytic methods, observational studies on the association of medically unexplained physical symptoms, anxiety, and depression with special emphasis on healthy and organically ill control groups and on different types of symptoms, measures, and illness behavior. Methods: A search of MEDLINE and PsycLIT/ PsycINFO for abstracts from 1980 to April 2001 was performed; principal investigators in the field were contacted and article reference lists were used to retrieve additional relevant articles. Two hundred forty-four studies were included on the basis of consensus ratings if they fulfilled seven of eight inclusion criteria pertaining to diagnostic accuracy and statistical appropriateness. Five hundred twenty-two studies were deferred or excluded. We focused specifically on the four functional somatic syndromes for which there were sufficient numbers for meta-analytic integration: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD), fibromyalgia (FM), and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Data were extracted independently by two authors according to a prespecified coding manual with up to 70 parameters per study. Results: Effect sizes for the association of the four functional somatic syndromes with depression and anxiety were of moderate magnitude but were highly significant statistically when compared with healthy persons and controls with medical disorders of known organic pathology. Moreover, this association was significant whether depression was measured with or without somatic items. Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by higher scores of depression, fibromyalgia by lower scores of anxiety than irritable bowel syndrome. Consulting behavior and severity of somatization is related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Meta-analytic integration confirms that the four functional somatic syndromes (IBS, NUD, FM, CFS) are related to (but not fully dependent on) depression and anxiety. At present, there is only limited meta-analytic evidence for the same sort of association for medically unexplained physical symptoms in general. In view of the relative independence from depression and anxiety, classification and treatment of these symptoms and syndromes as "common mental disorders" does not seem fully appropriate.

AB  - Objective: This article reviews sex differences in psychiatric comorbidity among individuals with substance use disorders and, in particular, the clinical significance of these differences for treatment outcome among women.
   Method: We undertook a computerized search of major health care databases. To enhance the search, we drew prior relevant articles from the reference list.
   Results: Women with alcohol and other drug use disorders present higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity, particularly mood and anxiety disorders, than do men. Moreover, the comorbid diagnosis, particularly of depression, is more often primary in women, while in men the comorbidity is more often secondary to the substance abuse diagnosis. In addition, there is evidence that psychiatric comorbidity is associated with distinct, sex-specific outcomes for substance use treatment.
   Conclusions: Sex differences in the clinical presentation of substance-dependent individuals with psychiatric comorbidity present specific treatment challenges and opportunities.

AB  - Background: Given the growth of juvenile detainee populations, epidemiologic data on their psychiatric disorders are increasingly important. Yet, there are few empirical studies. Until we have better epidemiologic data, we cannot know how best to use the system's scarce mental health resources.
   Methods: Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children version 2.3, interviewers assessed a randomly selected, stratified sample of 1829 African American, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic youth (1172 males, 657 females, ages 10-18 years) who were arrested and detained in Cook County, Illinois (which includes Chicago and surrounding suburbs). We present 6-month prevalence estimates by demographic subgroups (sex, race/ethnicity, and age) for the following disorders: affective disorders (major depressive episode, dysthymia, manic episode), anxiety (panic, separation anxiety, overanxious, generalized anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders), psychosis, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, (oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), and substance use disorders (alcohol and other drugs).
   Results: Nearly two thirds of males and nearly three quarters of females met diagnostic criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders. Excluding conduct disorder (common among detained youth), nearly 60% of males and more than two thirds of females met diagnostic criteria and had diagnosis-specific impairment for one or more psychiatric disorders. Half of males and almost half of females had a substance use disorder, and more than 40% of males and females met criteria for disruptive behavior disorders. Affective disorders were also prevalent, especially among females; more than 20% of females met criteria for a major depressive episode. Rates of many disorders were higher among females, non-Hispanic whites, and older adolescents.
   Conclusions: These results suggest substantial psychiatric morbidity among juvenile detainees. Youth with psychiatric disorders pose a challenge for the juvenile justice system and, after their release, for the larger mental health system.

AB  - To expand and accelerate research on mood disorders, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) developed a project to formulate a strategic research plan for mood disorder research. One of the areas selected for review concerns the development and natural history of these disorders.
   The NIMH convened a multidisciplinary Workgroup of scientists to review the field and the NIMH portfolio and to generate specific recommendations. To encourage a balanced and creative set of proposals, experts were included within and outside this area of research, as well as public stakeholders.
   The Workgroup identified the need for expanded knowledge of mood disorders in children and adolescents, noting important gaps in understanding the onset, course, and recurrence of early-onset unipolar and bipolar disorder. Recommendations included the need for a multidisciplinary research initiative on the pathogenesis of unipolar depression encompassing genetic and environmental risk and protective factors. Specifically, we encourage the NIMH to convene a panel of experts and advocates to review the findings concerning children at high risk for unipolar depression. Joint analyses of existing data sets should examine specific risk factors to refine models of pathogenesis in preparation for the next era of multidisciplinary research. Other priority areas include the need to assess the long-term impact of successful treatment of juvenile depression and known precursors of depression, in particular, childhood anxiety disorders. Expanded knowledge of pediatric-onset bipolar disorder was identified as a particularly pressing issue because of the severity of the disorder, the controversies surrounding its diagnosis and treatment, and the possibility that widespread use of psychotropic medications in vulnerable children may precipitate the condition. The Workgroup recommends that the NIMH establish a collaborative multisite multidisciplinary Network of Research Programs on PediatricOnset Bipolar Disorder to achieve a better understanding of its causes, course, treatment, and prevention. The NIMH should develop a capacity-building plan to ensure the availability of trained investigators in the child and adolescent field.
   Mood disorders are among the most prevalent, recurrent, and disabling of all illnesses. They are often disorders of early onset. Although the NIMH has made important strides in mood disorders research, more data, beginning with at-risk infants, children, and adolescents, are needed concerning the etiology and developmental course of these disorders. A diverse program of multidisciplinary research is recommended to reduce the burden on children and families affected with these conditions.

AB  - A review of behavioral and neurobiological data on mood and mood regulation as they pertain to an understanding of mood disorders is presented. Four approaches are considered: 1) behavioral and cognitive; 2) neurobiological; 3) computational; and 4) developmental. Within each of these four sections, we summarize the current status of the field and present our vision for the future, including particular challenges and opportunities. We conclude with a series of specific recommendations for National Institute of Mental Health priorities. Recommendations arc presented for the behavioral domain, the neural domain, the domain of behavioral-neural interaction, for training, and for dissemination. It is in the domain of behavioral-neural interaction, in particular, that new research is required that brings together traditions that have developed relatively independently. Training interdisciplinary clinical scientists who meaningfully draw upon both behavioral and neuroscientific literatures and methods is critically required for the realization of these goals.

AB  - This report summarizes the deliberations of a panel with representation from diverse disciplines of relevance to the genetics of mood disorders. The major charge to the panel was to develop a strategic plan to employ the tools of genetics to advance the understanding, treatment, and outcomes for mood disorders. A comprehensive review of the evidence for the role of genetic factors in the etiology of mood disorders was conducted, and the chief impediments for progress in gene identification were identified. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) portfolios in the Genetics Research Branch and the Division of Mental Disorders, Behavioral Sciences, AIDS, and all genetics training activities were reviewed. Despite some promising leads, there are still no confirmed linkage findings for mood disorders. Impediments to gene finding include the lack of phenotypic validity, variation in ascertainment sources and methodology across studies, and genetic complexity. With respect to linkage, the committee recommended that a large-scale, integrated effort be undertaken to examine existing data from linkage and association studies of bipolar disorders using identical phenotypes and statistical methods across studies to determine whether the suggestive linkage findings at some loci can be confirmed. Confirmation would justify more intensive approaches to gene finding. The committee recommended that the NIMH support continued efforts to identify the most heritable subtypes and endophenotypes of major depression using the tools of genetic epidemiology, neuroscience, and behavioral science. The field of genetic epidemiology was identified as an important future direction because population-based, epidemiologic studies of families and unrelated affected individuals assume increasing importance for common chronic diseases. To prepare for shifts to more complex genetic models, the committee recommended that the NIMH develop new interdisciplinary training strategies to prepare for the next generation of genetics research.

AB  - Objective: A hypercoagulable state before overt thrombosis resulting from an imbalance between the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems is related to cardiovascular disease progression and acute coronary syndromes. Psychological stressors and depressive and anxiety disorders also are associated with coronary artery disease. This review explores whether changes in blood coagulation. anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic activity may constitute psychobiological pathways that link psychological factors with coronary syndromes. Methods: Literature on coagulation, anticoagulation, and fibrinolysis measures in conjunction with psychological factors (mental stress, psychosocial strain, and psychiatric disorders) was identified by MEDLINE search back to 1966 and through checking the bibliographies of these sources. Sixty-eight articles were critically reviewed. Results: In healthy subjects, acute mental stress simultaneously activates coagulation (ie, fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor) and fibrinolysis (ie, tissue-type plasminogen activator) within a physiological range. In patients with atherosclerosis and impaired endothelial anticoagulant function, however, procoagulant responses to acute stressors may outweigh anticoagulant mechanisms and thereby promote a hypercoagulable state. Chronic psychosocial stressors (job strain or low socioeconomic status) are related to a hypercoagulable state reflected by increased procoagulant molecules (ie, fibrinogen or coagulation factor VII) and by reduced fibrinolytic capacity. There is also some evidence that points to hypercoagulability in depression. Conclusions: Different categories of psychological measures to varying extent are associated with characteristic patterns of coagulation and fibrinolysis activity. Associations between psychological factors and several coagulation and fibrinolysis variables related to atherosclerosis provide a plausible biobehavioral link to coronary artery disease.

AB  - Background: The Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment partnered to produce clinical guidelines for psychiatrists for the treatment of depressive disorders.
   Methods: A standard guidelines development process was followed. Relevant literature was identified using a computerized Medline search supplemented by review of bibliographies. Operational criteria were used to rate the quality of scientific evidence, and the line of treatment recommendations included consensus clinical opinion. This section, on Axis I, and Axis II, and Axis III comorbidity, is 1 of 7 articles that were drafted and reviewed by clinicians. Revised drafts underwent national and international expert peer review.
   Results: Comorbid depression on Axis I is particularly prevalent in patients with anxiety disorders, substance and use disorders, and eating disorders, but it also occurs in patients with schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and dementia. Depressive comorbidity has implications for assessment, management, and outcome. The relation between depression and personality disorders is complex. Patients with this comorbidity often require longer, more intense, and multimodal therapies. Depression is also prevalent in medical illnesses, requires careful diagnosis, and responds to standard antidepressant treatments.
   Conclusions: Comorbidity can influence the course and outcome of both associated conditions. Depression-specific psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy should be considered with comorbid depression is diagnosed.

Observed more in primary care and community populations than in speciality settings, varying conceptualisations have been applied to define these conditions.
   Aims To examine definitional issues for subthreshold forms of depression (e.g. minor depression) and to suggest future directions for research and nosology in psychiatry and primary care.
   Method A Medline search was conducted. The relevant articles were reviewed with regard to specific categories of information.
   Results Studies applied a myriad of names and definitions for subthreshold depression with varying duration, symptom thresholds and exclusions. Prevalence rates also vary depending upon the definitions, settings and populations researched.
   Conclusions Future research needs to apply methodological and intellectual rigour and systematically consider a broader clinical and nosological context. in addition, collaboration between psychiatry and primary care on research and clinical issues is needed.

AB  - Insight is a quality which has been highly valued by most clinicians in the mental health field, largely because a strong link is assumed between good insight and better quality of life. Yet it is a complex construct, one which has not until recently been subjected to much critical scrutiny or adequately explicated. All too often, particularly in the field of psychosis, the term has been used as shorthand for the degree of congruence between the explanatory models and views on the mode and conditions of treatment of the clinician and the patient. Conflicts about these matters are ubiquitous in the care of psychotic patients. Recently, there has been a recognition that there are a number of dimensions to the construct, and that some of these relate to differences in attributional perspective. This has opened up the issue to more sophisticated research drawing on established but untapped psychological and neurobiological theories, and has formed a better framework for the development of more effective research and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Objective: This paper is the first of a 2-part review on the topic of stalking. It outlines the behaviours involved, epidemiology, motivation of offenders, and mental health consequences for the victim.
   Method: Computerized literature searches were used ti identify relevant papers from psychiatric and legal journals. Publications by victims' and women's organizations provided additional information.
   Results: Up to 1 in 20 women will be stalked during her lifetime. The minority of victims are female, while the offenders are usually male. Stalking behaviours range from surveillance to threatening aggressive or violent acts. The majority of stalking relates to failed intimate relationships. Stalkers may also suffer from erotomania or obsessional love with a primary psychiatric diagnosis. Victims may experience anxiety, depression, guilt, helplessness. and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Conclusion: Stalking is a serious offence perpetrated by disturbed offenders. It can cause major mental health consequences, which ave often poorly understood by society.

AB  - The use of behavioural tests aiming to assess the psychological components of stress in animals has led to divergent and sometimes arbitrary interpretations of animal behaviour. This paper presents a critical evaluation of behavioural methods currently used to investigate stress and emotionality. One of its main goals is to demonstrate, through experimental evidence, that emotionality may no longer be seen as a unidimensional construct. Accordingly, following a discussion about concepts, we propose a multiple-testing approach, paralleled by factor analyses, as a tool to dissociate and study the different dimensions of emotionality. Within this multidimensional context, genetic studies (illustrated here by different rat models) are shown to be particularly useful to investigate the neurobiology of stress/emotionality. A genetic approach can be used (i) to broaden and dissect the variability of responses within and between populations and (ii) to search for the molecular bases (i.e. genes and gene products) which underlie such a variability.

AB  - Objective: To examine the progress of positron emission tomography (PET) as a tool for understanding the psychobiology of mood disorders, particularly major depression and bipolar disorder.
   Method: Review of the literature on functional imaging of mood disorders.
   Results: Functional imaging techniques have been used in psychiatric research as a noninvasive method to study the behaviour and function of the brain. Techniques used so far have involved the manipulation of emotion in healthy volunteers, the evaluation of depressed (unipolar and bipolar as well as secondary depression), manic, and normal subjects under resting and various activation conditions, such as cognitive activation, acute pharmacological challenge, and chronic thymoleptic treatments. As a result, functional imaging studies tend to support abnormalities in specific frontal and limbic regions.
   Conclusion: Different PET methods demonstrate consistent abnormalities in the prefrontal, cingulate, and amygdala regions. These findings are in agreement with past animal and clinical anatomical correlates of mood and emotions.

AB  - Animal data indicate that serotonin (5-HT) is a major neurotransmitter involved in the control of numerous central nervous system functions including mood, aggression, pain, anxiety, sleep, memory, eating behavior, addictive behavior, temperature control, endocrine regulation, and motor behavior. Moreover, there is evidence that abnormalities of 5-HT functions are related to the pathophysiology of diverse neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease, tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, dystonia, Huntington's disease, familial tremor, restless legs syndrome, myoclonus, Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, sleep disorders, and dementia. The psychiatric disorders of schizophrenia, mania, depression, aggressive and self-injurious behavior, obsessive compulsive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, substance abuse, hypersexuality, anxiety disorders, bulimia, childhood hyperactivity, and behavioral disorders in geriatric patients have been linked to impaired central 5-HT functions. Tryptophan, the natural amino acid precursor in 5-HT biosynthesis, increases 5-HT synthesis in the brain and, therefore, may stimulate 5-HT release and function. Since it is a natural constituent of the diet, tryptophan should have low toxicity and produce few side effects. Based on these advantages, dietary tryptophan supplementation has been used in the management of neuropsychiatric disorders with variable success. This review summarizes current clinical use of tryptophan supplementation in neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Objective:  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a heterogeneous disorder of unknown etiology.  Little is known about the comorbidity of this disorder with disorders other than conduct.  Therefore, the authors made a systematic search of the psychiatric and psychological literature for empirical studies dealing with the comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with other disorders.  Data Collection:  The search terms included hyperactivity, hyperkinesis, attention deficit disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cross-referenced with antisocial disorder (aggression, conduct disorder, antisocial disorder), depression (depression, mania, depressive disorder, bipolar), anxiety (anxiety disorder, anxiety), learning problems (learning, learning disability, academic achievement), substance abuse (alcoholism, drug abuse), mental retardation, and Tourette's disorder.  Findings:  The literature supports considerable comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, and other disorders, such as mental retardation, Tourette's syndrome, and borderline personality disorder.  Conclusions:  Subgroups of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder might be delineated on the basis of the disorder's comorbidity with other disorders.  These subgroups may have differing risk factors, clinical courses, and pharmacological responses.  Thus, their proper identification may lead to refinements in preventive and treatment strategies.  Investigation of these issues should help to clarify the etiology, course, and outcome of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

AB  - Thalassemia is an inherited disease that causes the production of damaged hemoglobin chains. Patients are diagnosed with thalassemia major due to major clinical signs and deep anemia. This study aimed to examine the major thalassemia and psychosocial aspect of it, which is such an important issue, to serve as a roadmap for better handling these patients and to contribute to the literature. The method used in this study was narrative review. A literature review was conducted by searching the materials published in databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar search engine from 2001 to 2020. Besides WHO website was searched. Thalassemia major damages the heart, liver, lungs and endocrine organs due to anemia and iron accumulation. In addition, the patient may experience mental and social problems due to the congenital nature of the disease and its lifelong duration. The psychosocial problems and treatment burdens of thalassemia patients are very high. There are many studies about the prevalence and physical consequences of thalassemia. However, there are not enough articles and researches describing the psychosocial effects of thalassemia on patients and what can be done about these effects. For this reason, this paper focuses on the process of thalassemia and the psychosocial problems it creates to contribute to the literature and to be a roadmap for better handling these patients.

AB  - A classic question in cognitive psychology concerns the nature of memory search in short-term recognition. Despite its long history of investigation, however, there is still no consensus on whether memory search takes place serially or in parallel or is based on global access. In the present investigation, we formalize a variety of models designed to account for detailed response time distribution data in the classic Sternberg (Science 153: 652-654, 1966) memory-scanning task. The models vary in their mental architectures (serial exhaustive, parallel self-terminating, and global access). Furthermore, the component processes within the architectures that make match/mismatch decisions are formalized as linear ballistic accumulators (LBAs). In fast presentation rate conditions, the parallel and global access models provide far better accounts of the data than does the serial model. LBA drift rates are found to depend almost solely on the lag between study items and test probes, whereas response thresholds change with memory set size. Under slow presentation rate conditions, even simple versions of the serial-exhaustive model provide accounts of the data that are as good as those of the parallel and global access models. We provide alternative interpretations of the results in our General Discussion.

AB  - A growing population of older adults resides in sub-Saharan Africa's urban slums. Although environmental conditions in slums are adversarial, there is limited knowledge on the wellbeing of older adults residing in these settings. This review sought to understand the scope, extent, and nature of current research on the health and wellbeing of older slum dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa. We searched 8 bibliographic databases for studies examining the health and wellbeing of older slum dwellers in the region. We also completed a grey literature search. The literature search together yielded 3,388 records, of which we selected 25 for review following a rigorous screening process. The included studies covered a variety of health issues of concern to older slum dwellers: (1) disease and injury prevalence; (2) self-assessed health and quality of life status; (3) physical/mental health impairment and disability; (4) healthcare access and utilisation; and (5) sociodemographic disparities in health and wellbeing. The gaps in this literature include a regional bias in research efforts, near absence of non-slum control samples, and limited research on the health impacts of the built environment of slums. Suggestions for future research are presented.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating diagnosis with, however, potential for an extremely intriguing aesthetic component. Despite motor and cognitive deficits, an emerging collection of studies report a burst of visual artistic output and alterations in produced art in a subgroup of patients. This provides a unique window into the neurophysiological bases for why and how we might create and enjoy visual art, as well as into general brain function and the nature of PD or other neurodegenerative diseases. However, there has not been a comprehensive organization of literature on this topic. Nor has there been an attempt to connect case evidence and knowledge on PD with present understanding of visual art making in psychology and neuroaesthetics in order to propose hypotheses for documented artistic changes. Here, we collect the current research on this topic, tie this to PD symptoms and neurobiology, and provide new theories focusing on dopaminergic neuron damage, over-stimulation from dopamine agonist therapy, and context or genetic factors revealing the neurobiological basis of the visual artistic brain.

AB  - Binge drinking is a widespread alcohol consumption pattern in youth that is linked to important behavioral and cerebral impairments, in both the short and the long term. From a critical review of the current literature on this topic, we conclude that binge drinkers display executive impairments, cerebral modifications, and problems with emotion-related processes. Five key empirical and theoretical topics are discussed to pave the way for future research in the field: (1) the specificity of the brain modifications observed in binge drinkers that may index a compensatory mechanism or result from multiple withdrawals; (2) the nature of the relationship between binge drinking and impairments, suggesting reciprocal influences between excessive alcohol consumption and executive deficits; (3) the possible recovery of brain and cognitive functioning after the cessation of binge drinking; (4) the validity of the continuum hypothesis, suggesting links between binge drinking and severe alcohol use disorders; and (5) the existing strategies to reduce binge drinking habits or rehabilitate the associated cognitive deficits. Future perspectives are described in relation to the questions raised to identify the crucial variables to be addressed in research and clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose of review
   The aim of this article is to review findings on the prevalence, phenomenology and treatment of psychotic features in borderline personality disorder (BPD), and to discuss factors that might be related to their occurrence.
   Recent findings
   Of patients with BPD about 20-50% report psychotic symptoms. Hallucinations can be similar to those in patients with psychotic disorders in terms of phenomenology, emotional impact, and their persistence over time. Although more research is needed on the exact nature of psychotic phenomena in patients with BPD, terms like pseudo-psychotic or quasi-psychotic are misleading and should be avoided. Childhood trauma might play an important role in the development of psychotic symptoms in patients with BPD, as in other populations. More research is necessary on the role of comorbid disorders, especially posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Atypical antipsychotics seem to be beneficial in some patients; evidence on psychotherapy of psychotic symptoms is sparse.
   Summary
   Psychotic symptoms, especially hallucinations, seem to be an important feature of BPD. More research on potential mediators and adequate treatment approaches for psychotic symptoms in BPD is needed, and current diagnostic systems might require revision to emphasise psychotic symptoms.

AB  - This paper deals with brain research and depth psychology. Because brain research is becoming significantly more sophisticated and increasingly able to assay the neurobiology of subjective (i.e. mental) events in vivo, it is suggested that any school of depth psychology will probably not survive as a mainstream treatment modality if its theory and practice is found to be in frank variance with the findings of the modern neurosciences. Jung's psychology is compared to Freud's and shown to be reasonably consonant with such findings. Historical highlights of Jung's nonreductive way of conceptualizing and working are presented and put in the context of more recent scientifically defensible concepts (emergence, supervenience, complexity theory) from the fields of both philosophy of science and philosophy of mind. These concepts postulate a hierarchical model of reality which permits an exploration of the mind/brain relationship without resorting to reductionism or dualism. A sense of the present struggle is conveyed between the proponents of these and more traditional scientific concepts. Finally, the nature of mind/brain confluence is elucidated by examples from the areas of learning, memory, and the capacity to symbolize in order to illustrate how clinical practices and observations familiar to experienced depth therapists and also in agreement with Jungian theory are compatible with neuroscientific findings. A research suggestion is offered.

AB  - The gap between need and access to mental health care is widest in low-resource settings. Health systems in these contexts devote few resources to expanding mental health care, and it is missing from the agenda of most global health donors. This is partially explained by the paucity of data regarding the nature and extent of the mental health burden in these settings, so accurate and comparable measurement is essential to advocating for, developing, and implementing appropriate policies and services. Inaccurate estimation of mental illness prevalence, and misunderstandings regarding its etiologies and expressions, are associated with unnecessary costs to health systems and people living with mental illness. This paper presents a selective literature review of the challenges associated with mental health measurement in these settings globally, presents several case studies, and suggests three strategies for researchers to improve their assessments: utilize qualitative data, conduct cognitive interviews and train research teams with a focus on inter-rater reliability. These three strategies presented, added to the complement of tools used by mental health researchers in low-resource settings, will enable more researchers to conduct culturally valid work, improve the quality of data available, and assist in narrowing the treatment gap.

AB  - The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis refers to the concept that 'alnutrition during the fetal period induces a nature of thrift in fetuses, such that they have a higher change of developing non-communicable diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, if they grow up in the current well-fed society.' Epigenetics is a chemical change in DNA and histones that affects how genes are expressed without alterations of DNA sequences. Several lines of evidence suggest that malnutrition during the fetal period alters the epigenetic expression status of metabolic genes in the fetus and that this altered expression can persist, and possibly lead to metabolic disorders. Similarly, mental stress during the neonatal period can alter the epigenetic expression status of neuronal genes in neonates. Moreover, such environmental, stress-induced, epigenetic changes are transmitted to the next generation via an acquired epigenetic status in sperm. The advantage of epigenetic modifications over changes in genetic sequences is their potential reversibility; thus, epigenetic alterations are potentially reversed with gene expression. Therefore, we potentially establish'preemptive medicine,' that, in combination with early detection of abnormal epigenetic status and early administration of epigenetic-restoring drugs may prevent the development of disorders associated with the DOHaD.

AB  - A diversity of bacteria, protozoans and viruses ("endozoites") were recently uncovered within healthy tissues including the human brain. By contrast, it was already recognized a century ago that healthy plants tissues contain abundant endogenous microbes ("endophytes"). Taking endophytes as an informative precedent, we overview the nature, prevalence, and role of endozoites in mammalian tissues, centrally focusing on the brain, concluding that endozoites are ubiquitous in diverse tissues. These passengers often remain subclinical, but they are not silent. We address their routes of entry, mechanisms of persistence, tissue specificity, and potential to cause long-term behavioral changes and/or immunosuppression in mammals, where rabies virus is the exemplar. We extend the discussion to Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, andToxoplasma, as well as to diverse bacteria and yeasts, and debate the advantages and disadvantages that endozoite infection might afford to the host and to the ecosystem. We provide a clinical perspective in which endozoites are implicated in neurodegenerative disease, anxiety/depression, and schizophrenia. We conclude that endozoites are instrumental in the delicate balance between health and disease, including age-related brain disease, and that endozoites have played an important role in the evolution of brain function and human behavior.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Temporary foreign workers contribute to economic prosperity in Canada, but they experience forms of structural inequities and have minimal rights, which can contribute to their ill health. The objective of this scoping review is to examine the extent, range and nature of the Canadian literature on the health of temporary foreign workers and their families in Canada.
   METHODS: The review was guided by Arksey and O'Malley's five stages for conducting a scoping review. We performed a comprehensive search of seven databases, which revealed 994 studies. In total, 10 published research papers, which focused exclusively on the health of temporary foreign workers in Canada, were included in the study; these 10 papers represented the findings from 9 studies.
   SYNTHESIS: The majority of the studies involved seasonal agricultural workers in the province of Ontario (n = 8). Major health issues of temporary foreign workers included mental health, occupational health, poor housing and sanitation, and barriers to accessing health care, including fear of deportation and language barriers. These health issues are highly shaped by temporary foreign workers' precarious immigration status in Canada.
   CONCLUSION: Findings from this study demonstrate the need to reduce barriers to health care and to conduct more research on other groups of temporary foreign workers, outside the agricultural sector.

TI  - PORTRAIT OF A SCHOLAR: JASON WALTER BROWN
AB  - This biography presents a half century of the commitment of Prof. Jason W. Brown, M.D., to the development of neurology, neuropsychology and philosophy of mind. For over 30 years clinical professor of neurology at New York University Medical Center, Jason Brown is best known for his work in neuropsychology and process philosophy, especially time, change and related issues in the philosophy of mind. He is the author of 11 scientific monographs and over 200 peer-reviewed articles in neuropsychology and theory of mind. His most recent book is Love and Other Emotions (2012). The biography also summarizes the main features of microgenetic theory, especially the account of consciousness, of the transition from self to image, act and object, the epochal nature of this transition, and its relation to introspection, imagination and agency. The affinities of microgenetic theory to many aspects of process thought should be evident to readers of this journal, but the theory, which was developed in pathological case studies, rests on a wealth of clinical detail. In brief, the micro-temporal transition from archaic to recent formations (distributed systems) in the phyletic history of the forebrain constitutes the absolute mental state, with consciousness the relation of self to image and/or object. The reader will also find here the overlap of states, the continuity of the core over successive states, and subjective time experience.

AB  - Objective: To examine the neurobiological basis of personality and depression.
   Method: We examined preclinical and clinical studies related to neuroanatomy, neuroendocrine, molecular, and genetic alterations in depressed patients. We considered whether common neurobiological factors might be shared between personality and depression.
   Results: Preclinical studies provide insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of depression including neuroendocrine alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function, neuroanatomical alterations in key brain regions, and alterations in neurotrophin and serotonergic signalling systems. Clinical studies show similar alterations in depressed patients. Evidence suggests that neuroendocrine alterations in HPA function may contribute to personality traits. Brain regions implicated in depression, including the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex, might play a role in personality. Key molecules implicated in depression have been extensively studied with reference to personality traits, particularly neuroticism. To date, physiological measures (serum and positron emission tomography) provide the strongest evidence implicating brain-derived neurotrophic factor and serotonin in personality, while genetic evidence is less convincing.
   Conclusions: A neurobiological link exists between personality and depression; however, more work is needed to provide an understanding of the nature of this relation and to link this work with clinical studies examining the influence of personality factors on depression.

AB  - Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition with associated difficulties that present differently across individuals. One such difficulty is recognizing basic and complex facial expressions. Research has previously found that there are many evidence-based support programs available for building non-verbal communication skills. These programs are frequently administered with a therapist or in a group setting, making them inflexible in nature. Programs hosted on e-technology are becoming increasingly popular, with many parents supportive of them. Applications (apps) that are hosted on technology such as iPads or mobile phones allow users to engage in building skills in real-time social settings and own what they are learning. These technologies are frequently used by autistic children, with apps typically focusing on identifying facial features. Yet at this current time, there are mixed reviews of how to design such programs and what their theoretical backing is, with many studies using a mix of observation and psychological assessments as outcome measures. Eye-tracking and electroencephalography are established methodologies that measure neural processing and gaze behaviors while viewing faces. To better support the field moving forward, objective measures such as these are a way to measure outcomes of apps that are designed for helping children on the spectrum build skills in understanding facial expressions.

AB  - Antidepressant (AD) drugs are widely prescribed for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders. The continuous use of ADs causes significant quantities of these bioactive chemicals to enter the aquatic ecosystems mainly through wastewater effluent discharge. This may result in many aquatic or-ganisms being inadvertently affected by these drugs. Fluoxetine (FLX) and venlafaxine (VEN) are currently among the most widely detected ADs in aquatic systems. A growing body of experimental evidence demonstrates that FLX and VEN have a substantial capacity to induce neurotoxicity and cause behavioral dysfunctions in a wide range of teleost species. At the same time, these studies often report seemingly contradictory results that are con-founding in nature. Hence, we clearly require comprehensive reviews that attempt to find overarching patterns and establish possible causes for these variable results. This review aims to explore the current state of knowl-edge regarding the neurobehavioral effects of FLX and VEN on fishes. This study also discusses the potential mechanistic linkage between the neurotoxicity of ADs and behavioral dysfunction and identifies key knowledge gaps and areas for future research.

AB  - Recent research suggests that the mere act of retrieving a memory can temporarily make that memory vulnerable to disruption. This process of "reconsolidation" will typically restabilize the neural representation of the memory and foster its long-term storage. However, the process of reconsolidating the memory takes time to complete, and during this limited time window, the original memory may be modified either by the presentation of new information or with pharmacological agents. Such findings have prompted rising interest in using disruption during reconsolidation as a clinical intervention for anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and substance use disorders. However, "boundary conditions" on memory reconsolidation may pose significant obstacles to clinical translation. The aim of this article is to critically examine the nature of these boundary conditions, their neurobiological substrates, and the potential effect they may have on disruption of reconsolidation as a clinical intervention. These boundary conditions also highlight potential constraints on the reconsolidation phenomenon and suggest a limited role for memory updating consistent with evolutionary accounts of associative learning for threat and reward. We conclude with suggestions for future research needed to elucidate the precise conditions under which reconsolidation disruption may be clinically useful.

AB  - Scientific studies funded by the United States government must now include both males and females as experimental subjects. This is a welcomed change for those of us who have been reporting on sex differences for decades. That said, there are some issues to consider; I focus on one in this review: females used in animal models of mental illness and health are almost always virgins and yet most adult females around the world, irrespective of species, are not virgins. I am not advocating that all scientists include non-virgin females in laboratory studies, but rather to consider the dynamic nature of the female brain when drawing conclusions through discovery. Stressful life experiences, including those related to sexual aggression and trauma, can have a lasting impact on processes of learning related to mental health and plasticity in the female brain. Her response to stress can change rather dramatically as she emerges from puberty to become pregnant and produce offspring, as she must learn to care for those offspring. The inclusion of females in scientific research has been a long time coming but it comes with a history. Going forward, we should take advantage of that history to generate hypotheses that are both reasonable and meaningful.

AB  - Patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) experience difficulties in multiple cognitive and affective abilities. A large body of literature has argued that MDD patients show impaired executive functions (EFs) and deficits in theory of mind (ToM), the ability to infer the mental states of others. However, the relationship between ToM and EFs has been poorly investigated. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of studies that evaluated the association between ToM and EFs in patients with MDD diagnosis. A literature review was conducted to identify all published studies in which ToM and EFs measures were administered to individuals with MDD and in which the relationship between these two domains was investigated. Eleven studies were included, and for each study, we discussed the findings related to ToM, EFs, and the nature of the link between these two aspects. Most of the studies reported that patients with MDD, compared with healthy controls, showed significant impairments in both ToM and EFs abilities. Moreover, this review indicates the presence of a significant association between these two domains in MDD patients, supporting the evidences that executive functioning is important to perform ToM tasks. Although the results that emerged are interesting, the relationship between ToM and EFs in MDD needs further investigation.

AB  - While many reviews of job stress and the stressor-strain relationship have been conducted, such reviews typically focus exclusively on quantitative data. In the current paper, we review qualitative studies on occupational stress that met two criteria: (1) the studies employed qualitative methods; (2) the stressors, strains and/or coping strategies were grouped into identifi able, higher-order categories. Results indicated that the nature of the stressors experienced varied by (a) occupation, (b) country, (c) seniority and (d) gender. The review further revealed that organizational constraints, work overload and interpersonal confl ict were relatively universal stressors. Anger and annoyance were the most frequently reported psychological strains in the United States and the United Kingdom, while Chinese workers exhibited tension and anxiety and Indian workers exhibited acceptance. Coping strategies also varied by gender, occupation and country. Research on gender differences suggested that, compared to men, women tended to report more interpersonal stressors. Differences in the ways in which the two types of methodologies are applied, as well as their relative strengths and weaknesses, underline the value of qualitative approaches to the study of occupational stress, especially when used in conjunction with quantitative methods in mixed-methods studies.

AB  - In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in research dedicated to the psycho-behavioural modulation of immune function, i.e. the field of Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI). This has led, necessarily, to the use of several in vitro and in vivo techniques in attempts to delineate the relationship between these two phenomena. However, since the field's inception, considerable uncertainty has existed over the significance of the immune outcomes detected and this has been compounded by the equivocal nature of some of the published data. A great deal of this uncertainty could, however, be overcome if a clearer understanding was achieved on the advantages and limitations conferred by the manifold immune assays described in the literature. This would, in turn, encourage their more appropriate use within PNI. Hence, in this review we describe the rationale behind, and offer an evaluation of, some of the more frequently used in vitro and in vivo immunological and virological techniques, We hope that a clear understanding of the rationale behind such assays and their inherent advantages and limitations will inform the discussion of the significance of stress-related immune impairment.

AB  - Cholinergic muscarinic stimulation of vast areas of the limbic brain induced a well-documented polydipsia in laboratory rats. This excessive water-drinking behavior has not received any convincing biological and physiological interpretation for the last 50 years. This review offers such an interpretation and suggests that cholinergically induced drinking response, mostly by carbachol, is associated with activation of the ascending mesolimbic cholinergic system that serves for initiation of emotional aversive arousal of the organism. The ascending cholinergic system originates from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, has a diffuse nature, and affects numerous subcortical limbic structures. It is proposed that the carbachol-induced drinking response is related to the state of anxiety and does not serve the regulation of thirst. Instead, the response is anxiety-induced polydipsia that might occur as a soothing procedure that decreases the aversiveness of the negative emotional state induced by carbachol. It is concluded that carbachol-induced water-drinking behavior is a rewarding process that contributes to alleviating the feeling of anxiety by bringing some relief from the cholinergically induced aversive state, and it is a homologue to anxiety-driven polydipsia in humans.

AB  - Biological development is driven by a complex dance between nurture and nature, determined not only by the specific features of the interacting genetic and environmental influences but also by the timing of their rendezvous. The initiation of large-scale longitudinal studies, ever-expanding knowledge of genetics, and increasing availability of neuroimaging data to provide endophenotypic bridges between molecules and behavior are beginning to provide some insight into interactions of developmental stage, genes, and the environment, although daunting challenges remain. Prominent amongst these challenges are difficulties in identifying and quantifying relevant environmental factors, discerning the relative contributions to multiply determined outcomes, and the likelihood that brain development is a non-linear dynamic process in which small initial differences may yield large later effects. Age-sensitive mechanisms include developmental changes in gene expression, epigenetic modifications, synaptic arborization/pruning, and maturational improvements in our capacity to seek out environments of our choosing. Greater understanding of how genetic and environmental factors interact differently across ages is an important step toward elucidating the mechanisms by which phenotypes are created - and how they may differ in health and disease. This knowledge may also provide clues to guide the type and timing of interventions to maximize outcomes.

AB  - Involuntary separation from close social companions is widely held to lead to pathophysiological outcomes. Presumably, the relationship with, or category of, the separated individual determines the nature of the physiological response. Here, experiments examining the consequences of brief involuntary separation on the activity of the stress-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system are reviewed. Only those studies designed specifically to assess the effect of the absence of the social partner are considered. Evidence for HPA activation in response to social separation has been obtained in a number of species; yet, many studies find no effect of separation of affiliative partners on HPA activity. The occurrence of an HPA response to separation does not appear to be related to the phylogenetic position or cognitive capacity of the species studied, nor is it a universal response to mother-infant separation. Rather, it is suggested that the pattern of results can be largely understood in the context of attachment. Separation of partners exhibiting signs of emotional attachment leads to an immediate and persistent HPA response, whereas separation of partners that are affiliative, but do not exhibit attachment, has little or no effect on HPA activity.

AB  - Background To date, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) trials have primarily focused on clinical recovery; however, personal recovery is actually the fundamental aspect of the recovery process. The aim of this study was to summarise and synthesise the existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of CBT for personal recovery in patients with schizophrenia. Aim This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of CBT for personal recovery in patients with schizophrenia. Methods A systematic search of the literature in PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Embase and Web of Science (SCI) was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials reporting the impact of CBT interventions on personal recovery in patients with schizophrenia. The estimated effect sizes of the main study outcomes were calculated to estimate the magnitude of the treatment effects of CBT on personal recovery. We also evaluated the CBT's effect size at the end-of-treatment and long-term (follow-up) changes in some aspects of personal recovery. Results Twenty-five studies were included in the analysis. The effect of CBT on personal recovery was 2.27 (95% CI 0.10 to 4.45; I-2=0%; p=0.04) at post-treatment and the long-term effect size was 2.62 (95% CI 0.51 to 4.47; I-2=0%; p=0.02). During the post-treatment period, the pooled effect size of CBT was 0.01 (95% CI -0.12 to 0.15; I-2=33.0%; p>0.05) for quality of life (QoL), 0.643 (95% CI 0.056 to 1.130; I-2=30.8%; p<0.01) for psychological health-related QoL, -1.77 (95% CI -3.29 to -0.25; I-2=40%; p=0.02) for hopelessness and 1.85 (95% CI 0.69 to 3.01; I-2=41%; p<0.01) for self-esteem. We also summarised the effects of CBT on QoL (subscale scores not included in the evaluation of the pooled effect size), self-confidence and connectedness, and all results corresponded to positive effects. However, there was insufficient evidence regarding the long-term effects of CBT on personal recovery. Conclusions CBT is an effective therapy with meaningful clinical effect sizes on personal recovery and some aspects of personal recovery of schizophrenia after treatment. However, the effect is relatively immediate and rapidly decreases as time progresses. Therefore, in the future, more studies should focus on the mechanism of CBT for personal recovery and the factors that influence the long-term effects of CBT.

AB  - Objective: Between the ages of 12 and 25 the onset of mental disorders typically occurs, and the burden of mental health problems is greatest for this group. Indicated preventive interventions to target individuals with subclinical symptoms to prevent the transition to clinical levels of disorders have gained considerable traction. However, the threshold to seek help appears to be high even when help is needed. Online interventions could offer a solution, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This scoping review will present an overview of the recent research of indicated online preventive interventions for youth (12-25 years) experiencing the early stages of mental health complaints with the aim of identifying the nature and extent of the research evidence.
   Methods: The 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley was used. Academic literature published from 2013 onwards in printed or electronic format was included from Scopus, PsychINFO, and Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL.
   Results: The search yielded 11,122 results, with the final selection resulting in inclusion of 30 articles for this review. In total, the articles included 4,950 participants. 26.7% of the selected articles focused on youth between 12 and 25 years. Of the articles 60% did not screen for, nor exclude participants with clinical levels of symptoms. Most studies used a common evidence-based therapy for the disorder-category targeted. More than half of the online interventions included some form of human support. Adherence levels ranged between 27.9 and 98%. The results indicate general effectiveness, usability and acceptability of online indicated preventive interventions. The most commonly used approach was CBT (n = 12 studies). Studies varied in their size, rigor of study, effectiveness and outcome measures. Online interventions with a combination of clinical and peer moderation (n = 3 studies) appear to result in the most stable and highest effect sizes.
   Conclusion: Online indicated preventive mental health interventions for youth with emerging mental health issues show promise in reducing various mental health complaints, and increasing positive mental health indicators such as well-being and resilience. Additionally, high levels of usability and acceptability were found. However, the included studies show important methodological shortcomings. Also, the research has mainly focused on specific diagnostic categories, meaning there is a lack of transdiagnostic approaches. Finally, clear definitions of- as well as instruments to measure- emerging or subclinical mental health symptoms in youth remain are missing.

AB  - Despite recognised benefits of Simulation-Based Education (SBE) in healthcare, specific adaptations required within psychiatry have slowed its adoption. This article aims to discuss conceptual and practical features of SBE in psychiatry that may support or limit its development, so as to encourage clinicians and educators to consider the implementation of SBE in their practice. SBE took off with the aviation industry and has been steadily adopted in clinical education, alongside role play and patient educators, across many medical specialities. Concurrently, healthcare has shifted towards patient-centred approaches and clinical education has recognised the importance of reflective learning and teaching centred on learners' experiences. SBE is particularly well-suited to promoting a holistic approach to care, reflective learning, emotional awareness in interactions and learning, cognitive reframing, and co-construction of knowledge. These features present an opportunity to enhance education throughout the healthcare workforce, and align particularly well to psychiatric education, where interpersonal and relational dimensions are at the core of clinical skills. Additionally, SBE provides a strategic opportunity for people with lived experience of mental disorders to be directly involved in clinical education. However, tenacious controversies have questioned the adequacy of SBE in the psychiatric field, possibly limiting its adoption. The ability of simulated patients (SPs) to portray complex and contradictory cognitive, psychological and emotional states has been questioned. The validity of SBE to develop a genuine empathetic understanding of patients, to facilitate a comprehensive multiaxial diagnostic formulation, or to develop flexible interpersonal skills has been criticised. Finally, SBE's relevance to developing complex psychotherapeutic skills is much debated, while issues such as symptom induction in SPs or patients involvement raise ethical dilemmas. These controversies can be addressed through adequate evidence, robust learning design, and high standards of practice. Well-designed simulated scenarios can promote a positive consideration of mental disorders and complex clinical skills. Shared guidelines and scenario libraries for simulation can be developed, with expert psychiatrists, patients and students involvement, to offer SPs and educators a solid foundation to develop training. Beyond scenario design, the nuances and complexities in mental healthcare are also duly acknowledged during the debriefing phases, providing a crucial opportunity to reflect on complex interpersonal skills or the role of emotions in clinicians' behaviour. Considered recruitment and support of SPs by clinical educators can help to maintain psychological safety and manage ethical issues. The holistic and reflexive nature of SBE aligns to the rich humanistic tradition nurtured within psychiatry and medicine, presenting the opportunity to expand the use of SBE to support a range of clinical skills and workforce competencies required in psychiatry.

AB  - Simple Summary In a great part of the world, trout fishing has long inspired human spiritual ideals of immersion into nature and recreation, far removed from the fast-encroaching urbanization. Concurrently, these values and emotions fueled a white-hot business, establishing a florid market of outdoor recreation. Since the 20th century, the trout-culture industry strived to provide anglers with fishing entertainment by stocking massive amounts of non-native trouts in dozens of countries, irrespective of the lakes' and rivers' carrying capacity. This had dire consequences on the structural and functional diversity of these ecosystems. "Trout wars" sparked throughout the world between the promoters of stocking activities and the promoters of "wild trout management" and ethics. The "Italian trout war" has been fought on the harsh battleground of trout taxonomy, ecology, distribution, and native vs. non-native interfertile species. Northern Italy, home to the Italian Alpine and subalpine trouts and economic center of the national trout-culture and stocking industry, was particularly affected by this clash. We review here the state of art of this ongoing debate, outlining our scientific view of the taxonomy, evolution, distribution, and sustainable management of the native Italian trouts of northern Italy. During the last 150 years, the trout-culture industry focused on enhancing trout populations by stocking, in response to the growing anglers' demand and the habitat degradation associated to the rapid urbanization and hydropower development. The industrialized north of Italy, home to the Italian Alpine and subalpine trout populations, is the source of most of the revenues of the national trout-culture industry. Its rapid growth, and the massive introduction of non-native interfertile trouts eroded the genetic diversity of native lineages, leading to harsh confrontations between scientists, institutions, and sportfishing associations. We review here the state of the art of the taxonomy and distribution of the northern Italian native trouts, presenting both scientific results and historical documentation. We think the only native trouts in this region are Salmo marmoratus, widespread in this region, plus small and fragmented populations of S. ghigii, present only in the South-western Alps. We strongly recommend the interruption of stocking of domesticated interfertile non-native trouts in this area, and recommend the adoption of Evolutionary Significant Units for salmonid fishery management. We further propose future research directions for a sustainable approach to the conservation and ecosystem management of the fishery resources and inland waters of northern Italy.

AB  - How do individuals manage to maintain strong emotional and personal relationships with God, despite the physical (and metaphysical) challenges posed by that task? Past studies show that individuals relate to God in characteristic ways based in part on their God concepts, the ways they internally represent the nature of God. The current manuscript summarizes research suggesting that these concepts arise in part through mapping processes involving metaphor and analogy. This review suggests these cognitive processes influence the content of God concepts that ultimately determine how individuals relate to God. Future research would benefit from considering the important role that basic cognitive mapping plays in far-reaching emotional and behavioral outcomes.

AB  - In recent years it has been demonstrated that cognitive development from infancy to later childhood displays some degree of (correlational) continuity.  Studies that have demonstrated this continuity are reviewed, focusing on measures of visual information processing, means-ends problem-solving and other cognitive indices of infant performance.  Models of continuity are described and evaluated, and the relevance of the findings and models to the Nature-Nurture issue are considered, with particular attention to the related issues of the role of experience in early life, and the extent to which infant development is canalized.  Theoretical and practical applications of the research are discussed.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - Cognitive psychology had a profound impact on psychopathology research. Nevertheless, the fact that cognition cannot be observed or manipulated directly complicates debates about the nature of the mental mechanisms that mediate psychopathology. This is less troublesome for psychopathology researchers who adopt an explicitly pragmatic approach that aims to use cognitive theories as tools for improving psychotherapy than for psychopathology researchers who seek to establish whether those theories are 'correct.' A pragmatic cognitive approach fosters progress by encouraging (a) reality-checks aimed at ending unproductive theoretical debates between cognitive theories, (b) a separation between to-be-explained psychological phenomena and explanatory mental constructs, (c) theoretical diversity, and (d) interactions with behavior analysis.

AB  - Modern psychology has long focused on the body as the basis of the self. Recently, predictive processing accounts of interoception (perception of the body 'from within') have become influential in accounting for experiences of body ownership and emotion. Here, we describe embodied selfhood in terms of 'instrumental interoceptive inference' that emphasises allostatic regulation and physiological integrity. We apply this approach to the distinctive phenomenology of embodied selfhood, accounting for its non-object-like character and subjective stability over time. Our perspective has implications for the development of selfhood and illuminates longstanding debates about relations between life and mind, implying, contrary to Descartes, that experiences of embodied selfhood arise because of, and not in spite of, our nature as 'beast machines'.

AB  - Zoos and aquariums have an enormous global reach and hence an ability to craft meaningful conservation action for threatened species, implement educational strategies to encourage human engagement, development and behavior change, and conduct scientific research to enhance the husbandry, roles and impacts of the living collection. The recreational role of the zoo is also vast- people enjoy visiting the zoo and this is often a shared experience amongst family and friends. Evaluating how the zoo influences this "captive audience" and extending its reach to include a compassionate approach to animals and people can further enhance the mission, value, and relevance of their work. The modern zoo's current aims-Conservation, Education, Research and Recreation-provide useful foundations for the activities that zoos conduct at a local and national level. However, to improve sustainability of their actions and outcomes, we feel that Wellbeing should become the fifth aim of the modern zoo for the future- both from an animal perspective (ensuring that populations are managed according to prevailing behavioral needs) and from a human perspective (enhancing access to nature, promoting planetary friendly behavior changes and ways of living, and advancing the wellbeing of the zoo's workforce). This paper provides discussion and review of how Wellbeing is already a substantial part of what zoos work on as well as posing the idea of altering the Recreation aim of the zoo to one of Engagement, which potentially is more measurable and therefore can allow zoo researchers and managers further options for the collection of evidence on the local and global reach of their zoo's aims. Education, Engagement, Conservation, Research and Wellbeing provide a more complete picture of the roles of the modern zoo for the animals (both in situ and ex situ), human visitors and workforce, and to society more widely.

AB  - Relational values (RV) are values that arise from a relationship with nature, encompassing a sense of place, feelings of well-being (mental and physical health), and cultural, community, or personal identities. With sharks, such values are formed by diverse groups that interact with these animals and their ecosystems, either physically or virtually, whether a scientist, student, fisher, or media-viewer. Further, these user groups may overlap or come into conflict over management plans, media portrayals of sharks, and their conservation status. Although scientists have not explicitly aimed to assess RV through sharks, qualitative studies of shark fishers, tourism operators, tourists, and the public, as well as historical and archeological accounts, can be interpreted through an analytical lens to reveal values which can also be defined as relational. To this end, this review considers studies capturing RV alongside those of economic value (increasingly, the value of a shark is appraised by their financial value in shark tourism) and the social and cultural roles of sharks. Based on these studies and the broader RV literature, we then outline a workflow for how RV can be leveraged in scientific inquiry, equitable resource management, and education. We conclude that via collaborative assessments of RV, with implicit inclusion of multiple values of sharks and by acknowledging their importance to all parties involved in user conflicts, the RV framework can lead to a constructive dialog on polarizing conservation and management issues. By illuminating shared values, and/or revealing dichotomies of values ascribed toward certain areas or objects, this framework can provide inroads to mediation, seeking to conserve or even restore relationships with nature, and their derived values as much as is possible. This approach can yield unexpected knowledge, solutions, and compromises in an increasingly complex conservation landscape.

AB  - In this study of the origins of individual differences in theory of mind (ToM), the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study sample of 1,116 sixty-month-old twin pairs completed a comprehensive battery of ToM tasks. Individual differences in ToM were striking and strongly associated with verbal ability. Behavioral genetic models of the data showed that environmental factors explained the majority of the variance in ToM performance in this sample. Shared environmental influences on verbal ability had a common impact on ToM and explained more than half the phenotypic correlation between these two skills. Possible underlying proximal mechanisms are discussed, including maternal speech and mind-mindedness, sibling interactions, and peer influences.

AB  - Developmental theories can be affirmed, challenged, and augmented by incorporating knowledge about atypical ontogenesis. Because investigations of human behavior are restricted by difficulties associated with compromising the integrity of the individual's biological and psychological functioning, it becomes valuable to draw on the potential afforded by 'experiments of nature'. Examination of individuals with high-risk conditions and psychopathological disorders can provide an entree into the study of system organization, disorganization, and reorganization. In this article, child maltreatment is examined to illustrate the benefit that can be derived from the study of individuals subjected to nonnormative caregiving experiences. The relevance of research on mal treatment to several important aspects of developmental theory is explicated.

Third, it summarizes the current published studies on the treatment of conduct disorder, which roughly corresponds to the population of children in the juvenile justice system. Finally, it examines the ways that different classes of medications might be considered when approaching juvenile delinquents and the ways that psychopharmacology could be used as part of an overall treatment plan.

AB  - A flurry of theoretical and empirical work concerning the production of and response to facial and vocal expressions has occurred in the past decade. That emotional expressions express emotions is a tautology but may not be a fact. Debates have centered on universality, the nature of emotion, and the link between emotions and expressions. Modern evolutionary theory is informing more models, emphasizing that expressions are directed at a receiver, that the interests of sender and receiver can conflict, that there are many determinants of sending an expression in addition to emotion, that expressions influence the receiver in a variety of ways, and that the receiver's response is more than simply decoding a message.

AB  - Neurons are complex differentiated cells with specialised, polarised membrane domains. Their function and viability is intimately linked to the availability of trophic factors, but ultimately depends on active membrane transport connecting axons and dendrites with the distant cell body. Neurons, because of their extreme polarisation, size and post-mitotic nature may be uniquely sensitive to the accumulation of damaged or aggregated cytosolic proteins, or membranes, and rely on autophagy for survival. Autophagy is a highly conserved, ubiquitous lysosomal degradative process, which plays an important role in cell homeostasis in both normal growth settings, and abnormal, stressful conditions. Although recent evidence supports this assumption, how autophagy protects cells from damage leading to neurodegeneration is not yet clear.

AB  - Much scientific thinking is spatial in nature, and even non-spatial information is often communicated using maps, diagrams, graphs, analogies and other forms of spatial communication. Students' spatial skills are correlated with their success in learning science, both concurrently and predictively. Given that spatial skills are malleable, can spatial thinking be used to improve science education? This article reviews two ways in which we might proceed. Strategy 1 is to enhance students' spatial skills early in life, or at least prior to instruction. Strategy 2 is to make more effective use of spatial teaching techniques that allow for spatial as well as verbal learning, even by students with weaker spatial skills. Recent evidence suggests optimism about both approaches.

AB  - A number of recent studies have demonstrated a role for state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods in the assessment of patients in the vegetative state and other so-called 'disorders of consciousness'. In several cases, functional MRI has been used to show that aspects of speech perception, emotional processing, language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in some patients who behaviourally meet all of the criteria that define the vegetative state. This work has profound implications for clinical care, diagnosis, prognosis and medical-legal decision making (relating to the prolongation, or otherwise, of life after severe brain injury), as well as for more basic scientific questions about the nature of consciousness and the neural representation of our own thoughts and intentions.

AB  - The hippocampus and caudate nucleus are anatomical components of relatively independent memory systems and recent research has focused on the nature of the interaction between these two systems. The amygdala exerts a general modulatory influence on memory storage processes related, in part, to an organism's level of affective or emotional arousal. Moreover, affective state can influence the use of different memory systems, and the amygdala may mediate this effect of emotion on memory. Recent evidence indicates that the amygdala modulates the separate types of memory mediated by the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. Recent human brain imaging studies also point to both sex- and hemisphere-related asymmetries in amygdala participation in emotionally influenced memory.

AB  - We previously proposed that three metacognitive processes meta-awareness, disidentification from internal experience, and reduced reactivity to thought content - together constitute decentering. We review emerging methods to study these metacognitive processes and the novel insights they provide regarding the nature and salutary function(s) of decentering. Specifically, we review novel psychometric studies of self-report scales of decentering, as well as studies using intensive experience sampling, novel behavioral assessments, and experimental micro-interventions designed to target the metacognitive processes. Findings support the theorized interrelations of the metacognitive processes, help to elucidate the pathways through which they may contribute to mental health, and provide preliminary evidence of their salutary roles as mechanisms of action in mindfulness-based interventions.

AB  - Emotion regulation is a process directed toward achieving desired emotions. People want to experience different emotions at different times and for different reasons, leading them to change emotions accordingly. Research on desired emotions has made several discoveries. First, what people want to feel varies across individuals and across situations. Second, what people want to feel depends on how much they value emotions and on the extent to which they expect emotions to yield behavioral, social, or epistemic benefits. Third, what people want to feel sets the direction of emotion regulation and can shape emotional experiences and subsequent behavior. Identifying and understanding desired emotional states can promote healthier emotion regulation and emotional experiences, and more adaptive personal and social functioning.

AB  - Recent data in both rodents and humans suggests that the timing of extinction trials after conditioning influences the magnitude and duration of extinction. For example, administering extinction trials soon after Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats, mice, and humans results in minimal fear suppression - the so-called immediate extinction deficit. Here I review recent work examining the behavioral and neural substrates of the immediate extinction deficit. I suggest that extinction is most effective at some delay after conditioning, because brain systems involved in encoding and retrieving extinction memories function sub-optimally under stress.

TI  - The organization of Roman religious beliefs
KW  - GOD
AB  - This study will focus on the difference sin the way that Roman Paganism and Christianity organize systems of beliefs. It rejects the theory that 'beliefs' have no place in the Roman religion, but stresses the differences between Christian orthodoxy, in which mandatory dogmas define group identity, and the essentially polythetic nature of Roman religious organization, in which incompatible beliefs could exist simultaneously in the community without conflict. In explaining how such beliefs could coexist in Rome, the study emphasizes three main conceptual mechanisms: (1) polymorphism, the idea that gods could have multiple identities with incompatible attributes, (2) orthopraxy, the focus upon standardized ritual rather than standardized belief, and (3) pietas, the Roman ideal of reciprocal obligation, which was flexible enough to allow Romans to maintain relationships simultaneously with multiple gods at varying levels of personal commitment.

Previous research related to the capacities of persons with mental illness in relation to these standards is reviewed and critiqued. The principles underlying the design of the MacArthur Treatment Competence Study are described.

AB  - The epidemiologic study of DNA methylation (DNAm) and mental health is a burgeoning area, but confounding and reverse causation remain important to know about. Whether use of non-brain tissues is appropriate when investigating brain phenotypes depends on the hypothesis and whether the goal is causality or to identify biomarkers. Look-ups of the correspondence between DNAm in blood and brain and use of Mendelian randomization (MR) can be done to follow-up, to some degree, on the causal nature of some findings. Social scientists, health methodologists (epidemiologists), and basic scientists - thinkers who view epigenetics and mental health from different perspectives - can come together in the design and framing of findings to avoid pitfalls and innovate beyond what each could do alone.

AB  - Lesion studies in monkeys have provided some of the most compelling evidence for the involvement of the amygdala in emotional and social behaviour. In spite of this it has proved surprisingly difficult to uncover the precise nature of the role of the amygdala. A number of recent studies now indicate that the amygdala is involved in a specific class of stimulus-reward association and this discovery, combined with important anatomical findings, has made it possible to gain a much more detailed appreciation of the contribution of the amygdala to emotion in non-human primates. In parallel with this, it appears increasingly likely that amygdala dysfunction contributes to the emotional changes that accompany certain neurological disorders, including dementia and schizophrenia.

However, identification of a single integrated structure of normal and abnormal personality has remained elusive. Here, a constructive replication approach was used to delineate an integrative hierarchical account of the structure of normal and abnormal personality. This hierarchical structure, which integrates many Big Trait models proposed in the literature, replicated across a meta-analysis as well as an empirical study, and across samples of participants as well as measures. The proposed structure resembles previously suggested accounts of personality hierarchy and provides insight into the nature of personality hierarchy more generally. Potential directions for future research on personality and psychopathology are discussed.

Clutton-Brock, 1989). The nature, extent, and influence of human paternal investment on the physical and social well-being of children are reviewed in light of the social and ecological factors that are associated with paternal investment in other species. On the basis of this review, discussion of the evolution and proximate expression of human paternal investment is provided.

AB  - The environmental monitoring strategy termed ecosystem-based approach (EBA) underlines the obvious benefits of managing natural resources on a holistic level, and it is particularly invoked for the rational and sustainable management of aquatic resources. However, when coming to implement EBA into monitoring schemes, such as those derived from the implementation of the European legislation concerning water quality, difficulties inherent to the complex and dynamic nature of ecosystems arise, including (i) identify appropriate, relevant and easily measurable indicators of ecosystem integrity, and (ii) combine the heterogeneous information gathered at the different levels of organization included in an ecosystem into a simple and practical decision-making scheme. The first kind of difficulties maybe partially overcome by implementing monitoring schemes which take into account the hierarchical nature of ecosystem processes and did not neglect the use of indicators at low levels of biological organization, including ecotoxicological biomarkers and bioassays. Secondly, the integration of the monitoring results into a practical decision-making scheme can best be achieved by using non-metric multivariate analysis, which is especially suitable for data bases including different metrics, and allows the processing of variables showing non-monotonic response to human stress, from molecular biomarkers to community indices. The difficulties inherent to the current rigid scheme of water quality assessment heavily based on ratio-to-reference univariate indicators and arbitrary reference values and class boundaries for each single indicator are illustrated with a case study in the Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula). The classification of aquatic ecosystems into discrete categories of ecological status can best be achieved by combining observations at different levels of biological organization, from molecular biomarkers to community traits, with explicative physicochemical and hydromorphological elements, and by using non-metric multivariate analysis techniques.

AB  - Mental health burden is a major health concern worldwide. In the last few decades, we are witnessing innovations that are successfully addressing gaps in the mental health service delivery in Indian context. This is an opportune time to explore existing innovative mental health initiatives in the country and integrate viable interventions to primary healthcare facilities to strengthen public mental healthcare delivery. The descriptive review of literature on innovative mental health programs in India was carried out. The initial search from google scholar and PubMed database yielded 1152 articles, of which 1114 were excluded that did not meet inclusion criteria. Full texts of 38 articles were reviewed and finally 22 studies were included for the study. Based on the review, most innovations are broadly summarized into five categories: (1) quality improvement mental health programs; (2) community-based mental health programs; 3) non-specialist mental health programs, 4) mobile-technology based mental health programs, 5) tele-mental health programs. These promising innovations in treatment and care can be customized as per the context for scale up and integrated into the primary healthcare system through District Mental Health Programme.The innovative approach not only makes mental health services more accessible and affordable but also empowering in nature by encouraging community members in early detection, prevention of mental illness and appropriate treatment referral to existing primary health care services.

AB  - Changes in cognition, behaviour and emotion frequently occur in patients with primary and secondary brain tumours. This impacts the ability to make considered decisions, especially following surgical resection, which is often overlooked in the management of patients. Moreover, the impact of cognitive deficits on decision making ability affects activities of daily living and functional independence. The assessment process to ascertain decision making capacity remains a matter of debate. One avenue for evaluating a patient's ability to make informed decisions in the context of brain tumour resection is neuropsychological assessment. This involves the assessment of a wide range of cognitive abilities on standard measurement tools, providing a robust approach to ascertaining capacity. Evidence has shown that a comprehensive and tailored neuropsychological assessment has greater sensitivity than brief cognitive screening tools to detect subtle and/or specific cognitive deficits in brain tumours. It is the precise nature and severity of any cognitive deficits that determines any implications for decision making capacity. This paper focuses on cognitive deficits and decision making capacity following surgical resection of both benign and malignant, and primary and secondary brain tumours in adult patients, and the implications for patients' ability to consent to future medical treatment and make decisions related to everyday activities.

AB  - Major depression is associated with a bias toward negative emotional processing and increased self-focus, i.e., the process by which one engages in self-referential processing. The increased self-focus in depression is suggested to be of a persistent, repetitive and self-critical nature, and is conceptualized as ruminative brooding. The role of the medial prefrontal cortex in self-referential processing has been previously emphasized in acute major depression. There is increasing evidence that self-referential processing as well as the cortical midline structures play a major role in the development, course, and treatment response of major depressive disorder. However, the links between self-referential processing, rumination, and the cortical midline structures in depression are still poorly understood. Here, we reviewed brain imaging studies in depressed patients and healthy subjects that have examined these links. Self-referential processing in major depression seems associated with abnormally increased activity of the anterior cortical midline structures. Abnormal interactions between the lateralized task-positive network, and the midline cortical structures of the default mode network, as well as the emotional response network, may underlie the pervasiveness of ruminative brooding. Furthermore, targeting this maladaptive form of rumination and its underlying neural correlates may be key for effective treatment.

AB  - The health care delivery system in the United States, structured to provide single-disease care, presents unique challenges for patients with complex physical and psychiatric comorbidities. Patients in these populations are often referred to multiple specialty clinics, encounter little continuity of care or collaboration among their providers, incur high health care costs, and experience poor treatment outcomes. Given these barriers, questions remain about the extent to which siloed and fragmented care, as opposed to the complex nature of the illnesses themselves, contribute to poor outcomes. If given the opportunity to receive well-integrated, consistent, and personalized care, can patients with historically difficult-to-treat comorbid medical and mental illnesses make progress? This article describes an innovative model of care called functional rehabilitation that is designed to address existing barriers in treatment. The functional rehabilitation program seeks to disrupt the escalating effects of interacting comorbidities by offering highly collaborative treatment from a small team of clinicians, personalized interventions using a shared decision-making framework, multipronged treatment options, colocation in a large hospital system, and significant 1:1 time with patients. The article includes a case example with longitudinal outcome data that illustrates how progress can be made with appropriate programmatic supports. Future research should examine the cost-effectiveness of this model of care.

AB  - Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may influence rates of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) among individuals suffering from Bipolar Disorder (BD). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the strength and consistency of the potential association between ADHD and AUD in BD. We searched main electronic databases for studies indexed up to November 2020. We included observational studies investigating the association between ADHD and AUD among individuals with BD. The association between ADHD and AUD was estimated using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). Eleven studies, involving 2734 individuals with BD (516 with ADHD), were included in the meta-analysis. Individuals with both BD and ADHD had higher rates of AUD as compared with subjects with BD only (34.0% vs. 18.3%). The estimated OR of AUD for ADHD was 2.50 (95% CI: 1.91 to 3.27; I-2 = 13.0%). Study-level characteristics did not influence the effect size. No risk of publication bias was estimated. Despite some limitations, this meta-analysis estimated an association between ADHD and AUD among individuals suffering from BD. At least a portion of the high rates of AUD in BD may, thereby, be related to comorbid ADHD. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the nature of this relationship.

AB  - This paper presents a selective review of the literature addressing the influence of young children's conversational environments and interactions on their psychological understanding of persons. Our dual purposes are to reveal some consensus on the current state of knowledge and to foster a programmatic approach to future research. The initial sections clarify what is meant by conversation and describe the nature of theory-of-mind development. We adopt the term socio-cognitive development to convey the fact that children's theory-of-mind understanding becomes more elaborate and flexible throughout childhood, and we discuss issues of measurement. The following sections deal directly with the influence of conversational environments and interactions on children's socio-cognitive understanding. We present findings that suggest that conversational interactions are of fundamental importance for the development of children's socio-cognitive understanding, and we examine the particular aspects of the former that have been shown to be the most effective in promoting the latter. We discuss the relationship between children's conversational references to thoughts and feelings and experimental assessments of their socio-cognitive understanding, and we offer a detailed list of considerations for future research. In the remaining sections, we highlight the important roles of (i) young children's expanding linguistic competence and (ii) their relationships, and we discuss implications for individual differences in children's developing social competence.

People who are their caregivers usually become the main care providers, which impacts their quality of life; (2) Aim: Analyze the different problems (physical, emotional, social, and financial) faced by people who are caregivers of adults with cancer and describe the strategies required to improve their quality of life; (3) Method: A literature review was conducted on the following database: PubMed, Cinahl, PsycINFO, and Scopus. The following eligibility criteria were specified: (a) research studies of quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods, (b) consistent with objective, and (c) published in the English language or Spanish during the last five years; (4) Results: 36 studies were selected from those found in the literature. Regarding the problems mentioned: eight studies described physical issues, 26 emotional effects, 10 social implications, and seven financial strains. Twenty-eight studies described strategies to improve the quality of life of caregivers; (5) Conclusions: Caregivers are usually women around the age of 50. Problems faced are mostly emotional in nature, followed by social, physical, and financial ones. In order to cope with this burden, there are some strategies that can be developed to help to build skills to manage both the disease and the impact derived from it, therefore improving their quality of life.

AB  - Working memory capacity is an important psychological construct, and many real-world phenomena are strongly associated with individual differences in working memory functioning. Although working memory and attention are intertwined, several studies have recently shown that individual differences in the general ability to control attention is more strongly predictive of human behavior than working memory capacity. In this review, we argue that researchers would therefore generally be better suited to studying the role of attention control rather than memory-based abilities in explaining real-world behavior and performance in humans. The review begins with a discussion of relevant literature on the nature and measurement of both working memory capacity and attention control, including recent developments in the study of individual differences of attention control. We then selectively review existing literature on the role of both working memory and attention in various applied settings and explain, in each case, why a switch in emphasis to attention control is warranted. Topics covered include psychological testing, cognitive training, education, sports, police decision-making, human factors, and disorders within clinical psychology. The review concludes with general recommendations and best practices for researchers interested in conducting studies of individual differences in attention control.

AB  - The stressful nature of caring for an older adult with a chronic disease, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), can create barriers between the caregiver-care recipient, as they try to navigate their continuously changing social relationship. Interpersonal synchrony (i.e., matching or similarity of movement, emotions, hormones, or brain activity), is an innovative approach that could help to sustain caregiving relationship dynamics by promoting feelings of connection and empathy through shared behavior and experiences. This review investigates the current literature on interpersonal synchrony from an interdisciplinary perspective by examining interpersonal synchrony through psychological, neural, and hormonal measures across the adult lifespan. We then present a case for examining the degree to which interpersonal synchrony can be used to facilitate affiliation and well-being in the caregiver-care recipient relationship. We find that there is significant evidence in healthy adult populations that interpersonal synchrony can support affiliative feelings, prosocial behavior, and well-being. Characterizing the psychological, neural, and hormonal mechanisms of interpersonal synchrony is a first step towards laying the groundwork for the development of tools to support relational closeness and empathy in the caregiving context. Finally, we explore the strengths and limitations of using interpersonal synchrony to support relational well-being, and discuss possible avenues for future research.

AB  - Historical data play an important role in our understanding of environmental change and ecosystem dynamics. By lengthening the temporal scale of scientific inquiry, historical data reveal insights into the dynamic nature of ecosystems. However, most historical data has yet to make a full contribution, remaining "dark" and out of reach to the broader scientific community. This article responds to several calls stressing the importance of empirical historical materials and urges their preservation and accessibility. Despite the importance of historical data collections, few standards have emerged to integrate historical dark data into the larger digital data landscape. To encourage greater use of historical data across scientific disciplines it is vital to make data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (e.g., the FAIR principles). In this paper we discuss the potential of historical dark data to contribute to the modern digital ecological data landscape. We do this by focusing on three cases from the University of California field and research stations and the groups that have worked to make historical dark data discoverable. Despite the common goal of maximizing the potential use of these data collections, each case and the methods employed are unique, and showcase varying levels of success in achieving the FAIR principles and shepherding historical data into the twenty-first century.

AB  - Although generalization to conditioned stimuli is not a new phenomenon, renewed interest in understanding its biological underpinning has stemmed from its association with a number of anxiety disorders. Generalization as it relates to fear processing is a temporally dynamic process in which animals, including humans, display fear in response to similar yet distinct cues or contexts as the time between training and testing increases. This Review surveys the literature on contextual fear generalization and its relation to several views of memory, including systems consolidation, forgetting, and transformation hypothesis, which differentially implicate roles of the hippocampus and neocortex in memory consolidation and retrieval. We discuss recent evidence on the neurobiological mechanisms contributing to the increase in fear generalization over time and how generalized responding may be modulated by acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval mechanisms. Whereas clinical perspectives of generalization emphasize a lack of fear inhibition to CS- cues or fear toward intermediate CS cues, the time-dependent nature of generalization and its relation to traditional views on memory consolidation and retrieval are often overlooked. Understanding the time-dependent increase in fear generalization has important implications not only for understanding how generalization contributes to anxiety disorders but also for understanding basic long-term memory function.

AB  - Chemsex is described as the use of certain drugs-commonly methamphetamine, gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)/gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB), and mephedrone-before or during planned sexual activity primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM). Evidence shows that MSM who engage in chemsex are at increased risk of physical harm, such as sexually transmittable infections (STIs), and are more likely to experience mental health symptoms. To further assess this, we reviewed the recent literature to evaluate whether the psychological impact of chemsex behavior includes suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts. Pubmed/MEDLINE was searched for articles reporting suicidal ideation and behavior among chemsex users with the terms "chemsex", "sexualized drug use", "suicide", and "mental health". Twelve articles (three case reports and nine cross-sectional studies) were included in the final narrative review. Overall, we retrieved mixed results regarding the relationship between chemsex practice and suicidality outcomes. Considering the inhomogeneous nature of the studies, the findings indicate that suicidality could be an issue of concern among MSM in general but among chemsex users in particular. Possible risk factors for suicidality among chemsex participants may include adversities experienced due to one's sexual orientation and an increased risk for HIV and other STI infections and the resulting negative impact on mental well-being. These aspects warrant further investigations.

AB  - Decades of research confirm that noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons are essential for arousal, attention, motivation, and stress responses. While most studies on LC transmission focused unsurprisingly on norepinephrine (NE), adrenergic signaling cannot account for all the consequences of LC activation. Galanin coexists with NE in the vast majority of LC neurons, yet the precise function of this neuropeptide has proved to be surprisingly elusive given our solid understanding of the LC system. To elucidate the contribution of galanin to LC physiology, here we briefly summarize the nature of stimuli that drive LC activity from a neuroanatomical perspective. We go on to describe the LC pathways in which galanin most likely exerts its effects on behavior, with a focus on addiction, depression, epilepsy, stress, and Alzheimer's disease. We propose a model in which LC-derived galanin has two distinct functions: as a neuromodulator, primarily acting via the galanin 1 receptor (GAL1), and as a trophic factor, primarily acting via galanin receptor 2 (GAL2). Finally, we discuss how the recent advances in neuropeptide detection, optogenetics and chemical genetics, and galanin receptor pharmacology can be harnessed to identify the roles of LC-derived galanin definitively.

AB  - Retrograde amnesia following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a major concern for both patients and clinicians. In contemporary ECT research, retrograde autobiographical amnesia (RAA) is commonly measured with instruments assessing autobiographical memory (AM) consistency over time. However, normal AM recall loses in consistency with the passage of time, and time has a differential effect on stability of personal memories. In addition, experiencing depression is associated with a decreased ability to recall specific AMs, and this difficulty may persist in the euthymic phase of recurrent depression. Despite these scientific facts, relatively few attempts have been made to accurately measure the specific effect of ECT on AM independent of both normal and mood-associated forgetting over time. This major gap in our knowledge prevents us at present from objectively quantifying the nature and extent of RAA associated with ECT. In turn, this hinders our identifying and implementing strategies for prevention or remediation of AM deficits. The present article aims to provide an up-to-date review and historical perspective of this major methodological conundrum for ECT research, highlight current issues in retrograde amnesia assessment following ECT, and propose directions for future studies. In conclusion, we suggest methods to reliably and specifically measure the extent and progression over time of ECT-associated RAA independently from persistent depressive symptoms' contribution and normal loss in AM consistency over time.

AB  - This article surreys progress in Darwinian medicine since 1991. Evolutionary thinking has been providing an increasing flow of fresh ideas into medical science, ideas that would not be suggested by other perspectives. Recent contributions have shed new light on the evolution of virulence, of antibiotic resistance, of oocytic atresia, of menopause, of the timing of the expression of genetic disease, of links between mate choice and disease resistance and of genomic conflict between mother and fetus over resource provisioning. An important consequence of changes from the environment of evolutionary adaptedness concerns reproductive cancers; the incidence of reproductive cancers may be linked to changes in the frequency of menstruation in postindustrial societies. Other intriguing developments include some unanticipated and undesirable consequences of good hygiene, hope from an unexpected quarter for progress on nerve and muscle regeneration, evolutionary interpretations of mental disease, and insights from functional genomics into the nature of tradeoffs. The application of evolutionary thinking to problems in medical research and practice has thus yielded an abundant and growing boniest of insights. Some are well founded, others remain speculative. The field is moving-from an initial phase dominated by speculation and hypothesis formation into a more rigorous phase of experimental testing of explicit alternatives. Currently the most promising areas, those in which experimental rigor can be applied efficiently, include experimental evolution and functional genomics. The pioneers can be proud of what they have set in motion.

AB  - This article addresses issues affecting the progress of research on the psychological treatment of schizophrenia, including the need for comprehensive and long-term treatment, individual differences in treatment needs, the role of the patient in the treatment process, and the limitations imposed by information-processing deficits. Despite these issues, research on psychological treatment has made significant progress over the last decade. Controlled trials of social skills training, the most widely studied intervention for individual patients, suggest some beneficial effects, although the results are mixed. Recent interest in cognitive rehabilitation or teaching patients how to manage cognitive deficits holds promise, but the feasibility and efficacy of these approaches remain to be demonstrated. Family intervention programs aimed at educating relatives and helping them cope more effectively with the patient's illness have shown positive effects on the course of schizophrenia, although treatment gains appear to be modest and of uncertain durability. The results of controlled research on psychological treatment suggest that intervention may improve the outcome of schizophrenia, but that many patients may require long-term treatment due to the chronic nature of the illness. Future avenues of research include the timing of psychological treatment, the integration of individual and family approaches, the interaction between novel antipsychotic medications and response to psychological treatment, and the development of new interventions for patients who abuse drugs and alcohol or who are nonresponsive to existing treatments.

AB  - Families caring for children with disabilities face particular challenges and demands compared to those caring for children without disabilities. Evidence suggests that there is considerable variation in how caregivers of children with disabilities adapt to their caregiving demands and stressors. The different adaptations to the children with disabilities may cause different impacts on the health and well-being of caregivers. This paper provides a brief overview of the literature on the impact of caring for children with disabilities on the health and quality of life of caregivers and the factors related to the health outcomes and quality of life. A literature search was conducted by using various electronic databases, including PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and MEDLINE using specific key terms. Thirty-one articles published in peer-review journals from the last six years (2009-2014) were reviewed. Most of the studies were quantitative studies. Factors discussed that impact on caregivers' health and quality of life include the caregivers' sociodemographic background and child's disability-related factors. Several mediators and moderators including coping strategies, social support, parental stress, self-esteem and self-efficacy are described in this paper. This review highlighted the importance of these factors to better understand the complex nature of stress processes and the caregivers' adaptations to their children's disabilities.

AB  - Neurorehabilitation programs are commonly employed with the goal to help restore functionality in patients. However, many of these therapies report only having a small impact. In response to the need for more effective and innovative approaches, rehabilitative methods that take advantage of the neuroplastic properties of the brain have been used to aid with both physical and cognitive impairments. In line with this, there has been a particular interest in the use of physical exercise as well as musical related activities. Although such therapies demonstrate potential, they also have limitations that may affect their use, calling for further exploration. Here, we propose dance as a potential parallel to physical and music therapies. Dance may be able to aid with both physical and cognitive impairments, particularly due to it combined nature of including both physical and cognitive stimulation. Not only does it incorporate physical and motor skill related activities, but it can also engage various cognitive functions such as perception, emotion, and memory, all while being done in an enriched environment. Other more practical benefits, such as promoting adherence due to being enjoyable, are also discussed, along with the current literature on the application of dance as an intervention tool, as well as future directions required to evaluate the potential of dance as an alternative therapy in neurorehabilitation.

AB  - The science of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is motivated by a translational goal - the discovery and exploitation of knowledge about the nature of ADHD to the benefit of those individuals whose lives it affects. Over the past fifty years, scientific research has made enormous strides in characterizing the ADHD condition and in understanding its correlates and causes. However, the translation of these scientific insights into clinical benefits has been limited. In this review, we provide a selective and focused survey of the scientific field of ADHD, providing our personal perspectives on what constitutes the scientific consensus, important new leads to be highlighted, and the key outstanding questions to be addressed going forward. We cover two broad domains - clinical characterization and, risk factors, causal processes and neuro-biological pathways. Part one focuses on the developmental course of ADHD, co-occurring characteristics and conditions, and the functional impact of living with ADHD - including impairment, quality of life, and stigma. In part two, we explore genetic and environmental influences and putative mediating brain processes. In the final section, we reflect on the future of the ADHD construct in the light of cross-cutting scientific themes and recent conceptual reformulations that cast ADHD traits as part of a broader spectrum of neurodivergence.

AB  - Positive mood contributes to mental and physical wellbeing. The broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 2001) proposed that the beneficial effects of positive mood on life quality result from attentional broadening. In this article, we systematically review (following PRISMA guidelines; Moher et al., 2009), a host of studies investigating the nature and extent of attentional changes triggered by the experience of positive mood, with a focus on vision. While several studies reported a broadening of attention, others found that positive mood led to a more diffuse information processing style. Positive mood appears to lessen attention selectivity in a way that is context-specific and bound to limitations. We propose a new framework in which we postulate that positive mood impacts the balance between internally and externally directed attention, through modulations of cognitive control processes, instead of broadening attention per se. This novel model is able to accommodate discrepant findings, seeks to translate the phenomenon of the so-called broadening of attention with positive mood into functional terms, and provides plausible neurobiological mechanisms underlying this effect, suggesting a crucial role of the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex in this interaction.

AB  - Background A significant proportion of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-treated patients experience anxiety anticipating the treatment, often to such an extent that they refuse or discontinue a much-needed treatment. Despite its great impact on treatment adherence, anxiety in patients receiving ECT is underexposed in the scientific literature.
   Objectives We aimed to review the prevalence and specific subjects of ECT-related anxiety and therapeutic interventions to reduce it.
   Methods We performed a computerized search (EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) for articles meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) qualitative (interview) studies, quantitative (questionnaire) studies, or experimental (interventional) studies that (2) report on anxiety that is related to a planned, ongoing, or past ECT treatment.
   Results Of 1160 search results, 31 articles were included. Electroconvulsive therapy-related anxiety is estimated to be present in 14% to 75% of patients and is most often linked to worries about memory impairment or brain damage. Only a few interventions (chlorpromazine, meprobamate, propofol, a talking-through technique, an information leaflet, and animal-assisted therapy) have been proposed to reduce patients' ECT-related anxiety.
   Conclusions Electroconvulsive therapy-related anxiety is a highly prevalent phenomenon, and the literature provides little guidance for its clinical management. Most studies are of a low methodological quality and suffer from significant limitations, thereby hampering generalized conclusions. Given the clinical importance of ECT-related anxiety, further study on its nature and evolution through the course of treatment and on anxiety-reducing interventions is warranted.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) poses one of the highest disease burdens worldwide. Yet, current treatments targeting serotonergic and noradrenaline reuptake systems are insufficient to provide long-term relief from depressive symptoms in most patients, indicating the need for new treatment targets. Having the ability to influence behavior similar to depressive symptoms, as well as communicate with neuronal and neuroendocrine systems, the innate immune system is a strong candidate for MDD treatments. Given the complex nature of immune signaling, the main question becomes: What is the role of the innate immune system in MDD? The current review presents evidence that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), via driving both peripheral and central immune responses, can interact with serotonergic neurotransmission and cause neuroendocrine disturbances, thus integrating with widely observed hallmarks of MDD. Additionally, through describing the multi-directional communication between immune, neural and endocrine systems in stress, TLR4-related mechanisms can mediate stress-induced adaptations, which are necessary for the development of MDD. Therefore, apart from exogenous pathogenic mechanisms, TLR4 is involved in immune changes as a result of endogenous stress signals, playing an integral part in the pathophysiology, and could be a potential target for pharmacological treatments to improve current interventions for MDD.

AB  - Singing has been used in language rehabilitation for decades, yet controversy remains over its effectiveness and mechanisms of action. Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) is the most well-known singing-based therapy; however, speculation surrounds when and how it might improve outcomes in aphasia and other language disorders. While positive treatment effects have been variously attributed to different MIT components, including melody, rhythm, hand-tapping, and the choral nature of the singing, there is uncertainty about the components that are truly necessary and beneficial. Moreover, the mechanisms by which the components operate are not well understood. Within the literature to date, proposed mechanisms can be broadly grouped into four categories: (1) neuroplastic reorganization of language function, (2) activation of the mirror neuron system and multimodal integration, (3) utilization of shared or specific features of music and language, and (4) motivation and mood. In this paper, we review available evidence for each mechanism and propose that these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, but rather represent different levels of explanation, reflecting the neurobiological, cognitive, and emotional effects of MIT Thus, instead of competing, each of these mechanisms may contribute to language rehabilitation, with a better understanding of their relative roles and interactions allowing the design of protocols that maximize the effectiveness of singing therapy for aphasia.

AB  - Purpose of review
   This article reviews recent findings on Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) and proposes future research which would help to establish the nature of CPTSD in relation to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
   Recent findings
   Research on survivors of torture and war has found that CPTSD can occur when there is no history of childhood abuse. fMRI studies appear to highlight differences in neural activity in individuals exhibiting primary dissociation compared with individuals exhibiting secondary dissociation. Research has begun to show that, when symptoms of secondary dissociation are appropriately managed, exposure-based therapies are an effective treatment for individuals with CPTSD.
   Summary
   Much research on CPTSD has emphasized its developmental basis and the disruptive effects of trauma in childhood and adolescence on subsequent emotional development. However, some studies on survivors of torture in adult life identify similar symptom patterns, despite there being no history of childhood trauma. It is argued that comparative research is required between victims of developmental trauma (such as childhood sexual abuse) and victims who experienced prolonged interpersonal trauma in adulthood (such as torture), as this could be useful in establishing the cause of CPTSD and in delineating clinically and therapeutically meaningful subtypes. It is also proposed that a focus on underlying neurobiological processes would help in developing and refining CPTSD as a construct and informing treatment.

AB  - The objective of this systematic review was to identify the overlapping and unique aspects of the operationalizations of negative work behaviors (NWBs) to specify a new integrative definition of NWB. More specifically, we examined (1) how many operationalizations and conceptualizations of NWB can be identified, (2) whether these operationalizations can be categorized into facets, i. e., the nature of NWB, harm, actor types, and roles, with subcategories, (3) what the meaningful overlap in these operationalizations was, (4) whether the operationalizations tapped unique and meaningful elements, i.e., positive labels and dynamic processes, and (5) how the overlapping and unique elements of the operationalizations could be integrated into a new theory-based research model for NWB for future research. In the literature search based on the Prisma framework, Pubmed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, we identified k = 489 studies that met the inclusion criteria of our review. The results of these studies revealed 16 frequently studied NWB labels, e.g., bullying and aggression. Many of these could be categorized in the same way, namely, in terms of the type of behavior, type of harm, and type of actor involved in the NWB. In our new definition of NWB, we integrated the content of the overlapping and meaningful unique elements of the 16 labels.

AB  - One hallmark of psychiatric conditions is the vast continuum of individual differences in susceptibility vs. resilience resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The environmental enrichment paradigm is an animal model that is useful for studying a range of psychiatric conditions, including protective phenotypes in addiction and depression models. The major question is how environmental enrichment, a non-drug and non-surgical manipulation, can produce such robust individual differences in such a wide range of behaviors. This paper draws from a variety of published sources to outline a coherent hypothesis of inoculation stress as a factor producing the protective enrichment phenotypes. The basic tenet suggests that chronic mild stress from living in a complex environment and interacting non-aggressively with conspecifics can inoculate enriched rats against subsequent stressors and/or drugs of abuse. This paper reviews the enrichment phenotypes, mulls the fundamental nature of environmental enrichment vs. isolation, discusses the most appropriate control for environmental enrichment, and challenges the idea that cortisol/corticosterone equals stress. The intent of the inoculation stress hypothesis of environmental enrichment is to provide a scaffold with which to build testable hypotheses for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying these protective phenotypes and thus provide new therapeutic targets to treat psychiatric/neurological conditions.

AB  - Epigenetics are heritable changes in gene expression not coded in the DNA sequence, which stand at the interface between the genome, environmental exposure and development. From an occupational health perspective, epigenetic variants may link workplace exposures and health effects. Therefore, this review aimed to overview possible epigenetic effects induced by welding fumes on exposed workers and health implications. A systematic search was performed on Pubmed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases. DNA methylation changes have been reported in genes responsible for the cardiac autonomic function and coagulation, i.e., LINE-1, GPR133 and F2RL3, in mitochondrial-DNA-sequences involved in the regulation of energy-generation/redox-signaling, as well as in inflammatory activated genes, i.e., iNOS. However, the limited number of retrieved articles, their cross-sectional nature, the lack of a suitable qualitative-quantitative exposure assessment, and the heterogeneity of biological-outcomes investigated, prevent the extrapolation of a definite causal relationship between welding fumes and epigenetic phenomena. Future studies should clarify the function of such epigenetic alterations as possible markers of occupational exposure and early effect, dose-response relationships, and underlying molecular mechanisms. Overall, this may be helpful to guide suitable risk assessment and management strategies to protect the health of workers exposed to welding fumes.

AB  - Purpose - UK mental health strategy calls for interventions that empower people to self-manage their condition. In lifestyle coaching, coach and client work collaboratively on positive behaviour change to improve client health. There is debate about the appropriateness of coaching for mental health, yet claims have not been supported with evidence. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the nature and scope of the existing research literature in this field.
   Design/methodology/approach - Scoping review.
   Findings - The growing evidence base shows positive outcomes of coaching; for instance, symptom reduction, enhanced self-management and achievement of personal goals.
   Research limitations/implications - The evidence base is small and of variable quality, offering insights that warrant further exploration.
   Practical implications - Coaching not only supports better self-management but also addresses further mental health strategy priorities (such as improved physical health and social functioning). Coaches need not be mental health experts; therefore coaching may be a cost-effective intervention.
   Social implications - As mental ill-health prevalence continues to rise despite widespread use of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies and medication, there is a need to explore how novel approaches such as coaching might be integrated into mental healthcare.
   Originality/value - This is the first study to collate the evidence on mental health coaching, highlighting its extensive potential, which should be further explored in research and practice.

AB  - Mental illnesses are chronic conditions in which an individual will often experience recurrent outcomes such as hospitalization, symptomatic relapse or self-harm behaviours. Most clinical research in psychiatry considers only the first event, and does not analyze subsequent recurrent events. Methods exist to analyze recurrent events; however, these methods are underused in the psychiatric research literature. This review identifies that recurrent events can be analyzed using a time homogenous or time-to-recurrent-event (TTRE) framework. The TTRE framework is underutilized in psychiatric research; however, this framework allows for longitudinal observations that are more congruent with the chronic nature of psychiatric illness than typical first event analyses. There are several readily available statistical models using the TTRE framework extending the standard Cox proportional hazards model. Our decision tool outlines four aspects of a research question to consider when selecting a TTRE model: (1) importance of event timing, (2) explanatory vs predictive, (3) common vs event-specific hazard, and (4) correlation of events within an individual. Analyzing recurrent events in psychiatric research provides an opportunity to address research questions aimed at understanding the longitudinal course of a chronic condition. These approaches may provide novel insights into risk factors or interventions for psychiatric illness, and ultimately improved outcomes for these chronic conditions.

AB  - This systematic review examines and consolidates existing evidence on stigma associated with the top four non-communicable diseases (NCDs)-cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes-and its impact on the lives of people affected. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, JSTOR, Science Direct, and Web of Science for original research in English that explored health-related stigma among people living with either of the four NCDs. A three-step integrative synthesis of data was conducted. Twenty-six articles (qualitative = 15; quantitative = 11) were selected, with most (n= 15) related to cancers, followed by diabetes (n= 7), chronic respiratory diseases (n= 3), and cardiovascular diseases (n= 1). Blame, shame, and fear were the main causes of stigma, the origin and nature of which differed according to the disease-specific features. The manifestations (enacted and felt stigma) and consequences (social, behavioral, psychological, and medical) of stigma across NCDs were similar. Inconsistencies existed in the conceptualization of stigma processes. To fill this gap, we developed an NCD-related stigma framework. People living with NCDs can experience stigma, which can negatively impact their health, management of their disease, and quality of life. The new framework can help in improving the understanding of the processes and experiences of stigma related to NCDs.

AB  - Stress and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation play a major role in various pathophysiological processes associated with both mood disorders and suicidal behavior. We conducted a systematic review with the primary aim of clarifying the nature and extent of HPA axis activity and suicidal behavior. The second aim of this review was to investigate whether potential biomarkers related to HPA axis abnormalities act as individual susceptibility factors for suicide. The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews was used. Only articles published in English peer-reviewed journals were considered for possible inclusion; we excluded case reports, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews, and studies that did not clearly report statistical analysis, diagnostic criteria, or the number of patients included. Overall, 36 articles on HPA axis and suicide risk met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Studies that investigated tests detecting biomarkers and the role of early life stressors in suicide risk were also included. We found that HPA axis activity is involved in suicide risk, regardless of the presence or absence of psychiatric conditions. The HPA axis abnormalities, mainly characterized by hyperactivity of the HPA axis, may exert an important modulatory influence on suicide risk. Impaired stress response mechanisms contribute to suicide risk. Targeting HPA axis dysregulation might represent a fruitful strategy for identifying new treatment targets and improving suicide risk prediction.

AB  - Preventive healthcare is considered a cornerstone of good health and well-being that can play a major role in reducing a country's healthcare costs and improving both the length and quality of people's lives. Previous research on preventive healthcare behaviors has been predominantly cross-sectional, ignoring the dynamic nature of people's health behaviors over a full life span. As a result, the reasons for the development, stability, and changes of individuals' preventive healthcare behaviors over time remain relatively unknown. Our article contends that to understand the degree of people's engagement in preventive healthcare behaviors, we must understand the origins, continuity, and discontinuity of such behaviors. We offer the life course paradigm as a viable framework for studying preventive healthcare behaviors at different stages in life. Based on theory and previous research, our article proposes that the onset, continuity, and changes in preventive healthcare behaviors are the outcomes of physical, social, and emotional demands triggered by life events that require adaptation through the mechanisms of socialization, stress and coping, and human development. These mechanisms are the underlying change processes of the three main life course theoretical perspectives-normative, stress, and human capital, respectively. Our paper discusses implications of adopting the life course approach for theory and practice, and offers a research agenda in the form of general propositions and conceptual directions for future research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the common occurrence and debilitating nature of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), currently there is no universally accepted definition for TRD. This review summarizes the different methods used to define TRD, and provides an overview of the TRD literature.
   METHODS: PsycInfo, Medline, and Ovid were searched to identify relevant articles published in peer-reviewed journals. A combination and/or variation of the following keywords were searched: treatment resistant, treatment refractory, depression, defining, staging, and modeling. Identified articles provided a description of the methods utilized for defining and/or measuring TRD, prevalence and impact of TRD, risk factors for TRD, and/or factors that contribute to the misclassification of non-TRD patients.
   RESULTS: Multiple methods for defining/measuring TRD have been proposed; however, variability in these methods has limited the comparability between TRD studies. Although various risk factors for TRD have been suggested, few have been consistently supported. The misclassification of non-TRD patients as having TRD is related to various clinical and treatment-related factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a universal standard definition for TRD is necessary to reduce the variability in how TRD is defined, and the misclassification of non-TRD patients. A universal definition would benefit clinical and research settings by allowing data to be easily compared across these settings.

AB  - Together with genetic factors, early-life experience governs the expression and function of stress-related genes throughout life. This, in turn, contributes to either resilience or vulnerability to depression and to aging-related cognitive decline. In humans and animal models, both the quality and quantity of early-life maternal care has been shown to be a predominant signal triggering bi-directional and enduring changes in expression profiles of genes including glucocorticoids and corticotropin releasing factor (CRH; hypothalamic and hippocampal), associated with the development of resilient or vulnerable phenotypes. However, many crucial questions remain unresolved. For examples, how is the maternal-derived signal transmitted to specific neuronal populations where enduring (likely epigenetic) regulation of gene expression takes place? What is the nature of this information? In other words, how do neurons know to `turn on' epigenetic machinery? What are the direct functional consequences of altered gene expression? This review describes the voyage of recurrent bursts of sensory input from the mother (`mother's love') to CRH-expressing hypothalamic neurons that govern the magnitude of the response to stress. In addition, the acute and enduring effects of both nurturing and fragmented maternal care on the structure, cellular signaling and function of specific hippocampal and hypothalamic neurons are discussed. The evolving understanding of the processes initiated by the early life experience of `mother's love' suggest novel molecular targets for prevention and therapy of stress-related affective and cognitive disorders.

AB  - Although emotion processing deficits have been implicated in schizophrenia since its original description, with symptoms including a "flat" and "inappropriate" affect, the extent and nature of emotion processing performance in schizophrenia are still unclear. Several studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have deficits in the processing of emotional facial expressions and these have included patients from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds. The deficits seem to affect mainly the ability to name and discriminate expressions. Furthermore, performance correlates with symptom severity, which indicates that deficits in discriminating emotional aspects of facial expressions have clinical significance. Impairment in the specificity of emotion identification may lead to misunderstanding of social communication and may underlie difficulties in social adjustment experienced by people with schizophrenia. The aim of the paper is a review of current literature about emotional processing in patients with schizophrenia. Studies have examined the perception, experience, and expression of emotion in schizophrenia as well as the relation between performance on emotion and olfactory tasks. Studies on emotion expression repeatedly showed that individuals with schizophrenia display fewer overt expressions than nonpatient comparison subjects in verbal, facial, and acoustic channels. Studies on emotion experience tend to show a higher frequency of negative affect and a higher sensitivity to negative conditions and stress. Deficits in emotion recognition have been clearly identified for all channels studied. Studies on olfaction and emotion in schizophrenia revealed that olfactory and emotion recognition abilities appear significantly linked in schizophrenia.

KW  - INTERVENTIONS
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Background: The success of electronic medical records (EMRs) is dependent on implementation features, such as usability and fit with clinical processes. The use of EMRs in mental health settings brings additional and specific challenges owing to the personal, detailed, narrative, and exploratory nature of the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment in this field. Understanding the determinants of successful EMR implementation is imperative to guide the future design, implementation, and investment of EMRs in the mental health field.
   Objective: We intended to explore evidence on effective EMR implementation for mental health settings and provide recommendations to support the design, adoption, usability, and outcomes.
   Methods: The scoping review combined two search strategies that focused on clinician-facing EMRs, one for primary studies in mental health settings and one for reviews of peer-reviewed literature in any health setting. Three databases (Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched from January 2010 to June 2020 using keywords to describe EMRs, settings, and impacts. The Proctor framework for implementation outcomes was used to guide data extraction and synthesis. Constructs in this framework include adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, cost, penetration, and sustainability. Quality assessment was conducted using a modified Hawker appraisal tool and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses.
   Results: This review included 23 studies, namely 12 primary studies in mental health settings and 11 reviews. Overall, the results suggested that adoption of EMRs was impacted by financial, technical, and organizational factors, as well as clinician perceptions of appropriateness and acceptability. EMRs were perceived as acceptable and appropriate by clinicians if the system did not interrupt workflow and improved documentation completeness and accuracy. Clinicians were more likely to value EMRs if they supported quality of care, were fit for purpose, did not interfere with the clinician-patient relationship, and were operated with readily available technical support. Evidence on the feasibility of the implemented EMRs was mixed; the primary studies and reviews found mixed impacts on documentation quality and time; one primary study found downward trends in adverse events, whereas a review found improvements in care quality. Five papers provided information on implementation outcomes such as cost and fidelity, and none reported on the penetration and sustainability of EMRs.
   Conclusions: The body of evidence relating to EMR implementation in mental health settings is limited. Implementation of EMRs could benefit from methods used in general health settings such as co-designing the software and tailoring EMRs to clinical needs and workflows to improve usability and acceptance. Studies in mental health and general health settings rarely focused on long-term implementation outcomes such as penetration and sustainability. Future evaluations of EMRs in all settings should consider long-term impacts to address current knowledge gaps.

KW  - Mental Healthcare Act 2017
AB  - Mental health continues to fight for acceptance in health care all over the world. The need for a separate act for mental illnesses proves this fact even more. The very nature of the mental illness has necessitated legislation to aid the service providers and service users. The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 has taken great initiatives in terms of protection of human rights for people with mental illness such as the inclusion of mental illness in health insurance, stress on informed consent, decriminalization of suicide, and introduction of advance directives (ADs) and punishment to those who violate the law. However, in a country like India where the family as a unit has more significance than personal autonomy, the new act emphasizes the patient's rights and, in doing so, may make the doctors more defensive and fearful in making clinical decisions, thus shifting the burden to the shoulders of the family members. There is a need for suitable amendments to include the family's concerns as well; otherwise, the present act would stand as an alien Western law enforced on Indian cohesive family dynamics. Qualitative studies are required from the family's perspective to illustrate the hindrances that the patients' families are facing. In the context of Indian family structure and dynamics and working in the Indian community, we feel that without suitable amendments to include the family's concerns, the present act would stand as an alien Western law enforced on Indian cohesive family dynamics.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory processes in the central nervous system that are mediated by microglial activation play important roles in several neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, development of methods for microglial inhibition is considered an important strategy in the search for neuroprotective agents. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is distributed wildly in nature, but rapid decomposition by esterase leads to its low bioavailability. In this study, we investigated the effects of KS370G, a novel caffeic acid phenylethyl amide, on microglial activation. KS370G significantly inhibited the release of nitric oxide (NO) and the expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Treatment with KS370G also induced heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 expression in the microglia. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effects of KS370G were found to be regulated by phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-alpha (AMPK-alpha) translocated to the nucleus. Moreover, KS370G showed significant anti-neuroinflammatory effects on microglial activation in vivo and on motor behavior as well. The protective effect of KS370G was weakened by an AMPK inhibitor Compound C. This study focuses on the importance of key molecular determinants of inflammatory homeostasis, AMPK, HO-1, and SOCS-3, and their possible involvement in anti-neuroinflammatory responses.

AB  - This review summarizes all reported and suspected functions of ultrasonic vocalizations in infant and adult rats. The review leads to the conclusion that all types of ultrasonic vocalizations subserving all functions are vocal expressions of emotional arousal initiated by the activity of the reticular core of the brainstem. The emotional arousal is dichotomic in nature and is initiated by two opposite-in-function ascending reticular systems that are separate from the cognitive reticular activating system. The mesolimbic cholinergic system initiates the aversive state of anxiety with concomitant emission of 22 kHz calls, while the mesolimbic dopaminergic system initiates the appetitive state of hedonia with concomitant emission of 50 kHz vocalizations. These two mutually exclusive arousal systems prepare the animal for two different behavioral outcomes. The transition from broadband infant isolation calls to the well-structured adult types of vocalizations is explained, and the social importance of adult rat vocal communication is emphasized. The association of 22 kHz and 50 kHz vocalizations with aversive and appetitive states, respectively, was utilized in numerous quantitatively measured preclinical models of physiological, psychological, neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neurodevelopmental investigations. The present review should help in understanding and the interpretation of these models in biomedical research.

AB  - Adolescents are increasingly exposed to Internet-facilitated crime as they spend more time online. The mental health risks and legal consequences for youth involved in cyberstalking are growing areas of concern. The nature of online stalking presents several challenges regarding investigation, fair adjudication, fact-finding, and legislation. Laws governing online stalking behaviors inconsistently reference the age of a victim or perpetrator as a factor for consideration in case disposition. During adjudication, the forensic psychiatrist may be asked to evaluate the victim or perpetrator involved in cyberstalking. This article focuses on the current legal landscape governing cyberstalking behavior involving adolescents, the roles a forensic psychiatrist may assume in this context, and the opportunity to bring a developmental perspective to these cases.

The numerical symbols used in all these behaviors build on the approximate number system (ANS) which represents the number of discrete objects or events as a continuous mental magnitude. Here, we first discuss evidence that the ANS bears a set of behavioral and brain signatures that are universally displayed across animal species, human cultures and development. We then turn to the question of whether the ANS constitutes a specialized cognitive and neural domain - a question central to understanding how this system works, the nature of its evolutionary and developmental trajectory and its physical instantiation in the brain.

AB  - Humans are ultrasocial, yet, theories of cognition have often been occupied with the solitary mind. Over the past decade, an increasing volume of work has revealed how individual cognition is influenced by the presence of others. Not only do we rapidly identify others in our environment, but we also align our attention with their attention, which influences what we perceive, represent, and remember, even when our immediate goals do not involve coordination. Here, we refer to the human sensitivity to others and to the targets and content of their attention as 'altercentrism'; and aim to bring seemingly disparate findings together, suggesting that they are all reflections of the altercentric nature of human cognition.

AB  - By concentrating on the unconscious processes driving evolutionary mechanisms, evolutionary psychology has neglected the role of consciousness in generating human adaptations. The authors argue that there exist several "Darwinian algorithms" that are grounded in a novel representational system. Among such adaptations are information-retention homicide, the killing of others who are believed to possess information about the self that has the potential to jeopardize inclusive fitness, and those generating suicide, which may necessitate the capacity for self-referential emotions such as shame. The authors offer these examples to support their argument that human psychology is characterized by a representational system in which conscious motives have inserted themselves at the level of the gene and have fundamentally changed the nature of hominid evolution.

Specifically, the diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) was created to describe the disordered patient demonstrating restrictive eating and malnutrition but without the fear of weight gain or body image disturbance that are evident in AN and BN. Here we examine the ARFID diagnosis and its implementation in clinical practice, as well as comorbidities. We review studies that examine differences in characteristics and outcomes between patients with ARFID and AN, and also discuss treatment methods, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, family-based treatment, and pharmacotherapy. We conclude by discussing the heterogeneous nature of the disorder and recommend directions for future research.

AB  - The lesion method provides unique insight into how the human brain generates emotion and feeling. Recent work has explored a number of interesting topics including the dissociation of emotional experience from memory in patients with amnesia, the reliability of specific emotional deficits following focal brain damage (including fear and the amygdala), and the investigation of compensatory neural mechanisms in lesion patients. Several detailed case studies have challenged the necessary role of the insular cortex in both awareness and feeling by showing that even in rare instances of complete bilateral insula destruction, the patient remains fully sentient and capable of expressing and feeling emotion. These findings highlight the distributed nature of emotion processing in the human brain and emphasize the importance of utilizing the lesion method for elucidating brain-behavior relationships.

TI  - The simulated mental health review tribunal - a valuable training tool for senior house officers?
AB  - AIMS AND METHOD
   Psychiatric senior house officers currently receive little formal training in how to give testimony at mental health review tribunals. The development of a simulated tribunal workshop for trainees, which is group-based, interactive and experiential in nature, with meaningful user and carer input is described.
   RESULTS
   We have incorporated simulated mental health review tribunal workshops into our academic programme and these have been successfully evaluated. Feedback has shown a marked increase in the confidence levels of trainees regarding tribunals.
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
   The new Mental Health Act (England andWales) is likely to place increasing demands on psychiatrists, in terms of giving testimony at mental health review tribunals. Simulated training for senior house officers, incorporating user and carer perspectives, can improve their skills and confidence in presenting at actual tribunals.

AB  - This paper analyses the legal nature of the dispute settlement system in the World Trade Organization. It places the Panel stage at the heart of it and stresses the crucial role of the World Trade Organization Secretariat. It submits proposals for structural reform. It qualifies Panel reports as a product of a legal agency process in global administrative law. It consequently recalibrates the role of the Appellate Body with a view to bring about checks and balances. This paper explores the neglected role of standards of review of the Appellate Body vis-a-vis Panels. While securing a continued leading role of the Appellate Body on constitutional issues and fundamental principles of the system, it suggests a more deferential standard of reasonableness in reviewing Panel findings on World Trade Organization rules.

AB  - We review evidence on the cognitive neuropsychology of visual object processing, from 1984-2004, dividing the work according to whether it deals with the analysis of visual features, objects, or the relations between object processing and action. Research across this period has led to (1) a more detailed analysis of disorders of feature processing and feature binding, (2) a finer-grained understanding of disorders of object recognition, how these disorders can change over time, and their relations to visual imagery, and (3) new accounts of the relations between vision and action. Cognitive neuropsychological studies have played a key part in furthering our understanding of the functional nature of object processing in the brain.

The discovery of the involvement of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and Ten Eleven Translocation (TET) family of enzymes in the demethylation pathway uncovered a potential link between neuronal TET protein function and cognitive processes. In this review, we provide an overview on how profile of 5hmC and TET enzymes are powerful mechanisms to explain neuronal plasticity and long-term behaviors, such as cognition. More specifically, we discuss how the current knowledge integrates the function of each TET enzyme in neurophysiology and brain function.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was substantially redefined for DSM-5, with significant changes in nosology, definition of a traumatic stressor, and number and nature of symptom criteria. These updates, motivated by decades of empirical findings and clinical observation, provide better coverage of the full range of trauma-related clinical presentations while maintaining backward compatibility with previous versions of PTSD. Nonetheless, they have been criticized as being unwarranted, creating excessively complex criteria, and generating unacceptable levels of diagnostic discordance. However, when the goals and expectable effects of the DSM-5 PTSD revision process are considered in light of a growing number of relevant studies, the DSM-5 PTSD criteria perform well and represent a valuable incremental step in the ongoing evolution of the PTSD construct.

We will deal specifically with multiple personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Both polarize the discussion of diagnostic categories with dissociative symptoms. This review compares the initial ideas (one century old) with the current scenario and emerging trends in research, which are relating cognitive processes and dissociative phenomena and disorders from a neuroscientific approach. We discuss the ideas on dissociation, hypnosis and suicide associated with these disorders. There seems to be a lack of consensus as to the nature of dissociation with theoretical, empirical and clinical implications.

Psychology of religion offers a chance for an expansion of behavioral science into realms of importance to many people. For example, both development during adolescence and the implications of gender differences may be illuminated by a consideration of the role of religion in human life. Particular topics discussed include conversion and religious mobility, religious experience, images of God, identity, and mental health and coping.

AB  - Little research has examined changes in emotional experience in adolescents. We hypothesized that the experience of shame would lead adolescents to become increasingly hostile. We report a one-year longitudinal study involving 765 high school students (392 males and 373 females; mean age = 14.41 yrs) in Grade 9 at Time 1 and 670 students (335 males and 335 females) in Grade 10 at Time 2. Shame and hostility showed high levels of stability over one-year. Structural equation modelling showed that higher shame in Grade 9 was predictive of increases in hostility in Grade 10, whereas hostility was not predictive of increases in shame. These results are discussed with reference to the nature of shame and its potential to provoke antisocial behaviour. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The inconsistent definition of empathy has had a negative impact on both research and practice. The aim of this article is to review and critically appraise a range of definitions of empathy and, through considered analysis, to develop a new conceptualisation. From the examination of 43 discrete definitions, 8 themes relating to the nature of empathy emerged: "distinguishing empathy from other concepts"; "cognitive or affective?"; "congruent or incongruent?"; "subject to other stimuli?"; "self/other distinction or merging?"; "trait or state influences?"; "has a behavioural outcome?"; and "automatic or controlled?" The relevance and validity of each theme is assessed and a new conceptualisation of empathy is offered. The benefits of employing a more consistent and complete definition of empathy are discussed.

AB  - The nature of the self has been one of the central problems in philosophy and most recently in neuroscience. Here, we suggest that animals and humans share a 'core self' represented in homologous underlying neural networks. We argue that the core self might be constituted by an integrative neuronal mechanism that enables self-related processing (SRP). Because mammalian organisms are capable of relating bodily states, intrinsic brain states (e.g. basic attentional, emotional and motivational systems) and environmental stimuli to various life-supporting goal-orientations, SRP appears to be a core ability preserved across numerous species. Recent data suggest that SRP is operating via a central integrative neural system made up of subcortical-cortical midline structures (SCMSs), that are homologous across mammalian species.

After presenting the hadron level theorem we describe experiments that have provided convincing evidence against its applicability to these decays. In the theoretical part we juxtapose the hadron level and quark level approaches and discuss the violation of Hara's theorem in the latter. We review quark model phenomenology, which offers a promising description of experimental data. Measurements that should be made to settle the theoretical controversy are pinpointed. The importance of radiative hyperon decays in understanding the nonlocal composite nature of hadrons is stressed.

Mental health providers and professionals across the world have to work with clients that are often from cultures other than their own. The differences in cultures have a range of implications for mental health practice, ranging from the ways that people view health and illness, to treatment seeking patterns, the nature of the therapeutic relationship and issues of racism and discrimination. This paper will excavate some of these considerations with a view to raising possible ways in which mental health systems and professionals can engage across cultures more equitably and sustainably.

AB  - One theory of visual mental imagery posits that early visual cortex is also used to support representations during imagery. This claim is important because it bears on the "Imagery debate": Early visual cortex supports depictive representations during perception, not descriptive ones. Thus, if such cortex also plays a functional role in imagery, this is strong evidence that imagery does not rely exclusively on the same sorts of representations that underlie language. The present article first outlines the nature of a processing system in which such a dual use of early visual cortex (in perception and in imagery) makes sense. Following this, literature bearing on the claim that early visual cortex is used in visual mental imagery is reviewed, and key issues are discussed.

AB  - Young children exhibit several deficits in reasoning about their own and other people's mental states. We propose that these deficits, along with more subtle limitations in adults' social-cognitive reasoning, are all manifestations of the same cognitive bias. This is the 'curse of knowledge' - a tendency to be biased by one's own knowledge when attempting to appreciate a more naive or uninformed perspective. We suggest the developmental differences in mental state reasoning exist because the strength of this bias diminishes with age, not because of a conceptual change in how young children understand mental states. By pointing out the common denominator in children's and adults' limitations in mental state reasoning we hope to provide a unified framework for understanding the nature and development of social cognition.

AB  - The established links between workplace bullying and poor mental health provide a prima facie reason to expect that workplace bullying increases the risk of suicidal ideation (thoughts) and behaviours. Until now, there has been no systematic summary of the available evidence. This systematic review summarises published studies reporting data on workplace bullying and suicidal ideation, or behaviour. The review sought to ascertain the nature of this association and highlight future research directions. 5 electronic databases were searched. 2 reviewers independently selected the articles for inclusion, and extracted information about study characteristics (sample, recruitment method, assessment and measures) and data reporting the association of workplace bullying with suicidal ideation and behaviour. 12 studies were included in the final review-8 reported estimates of a positive association between workplace bullying and suicidal ideation, and a further 4 provided descriptive information about the prevalence of suicidal ideation in targets of bullying. Only 1 non-representative cross-sectional study examined the association between workplace bullying and suicidal behaviour. The results show an absence of high-quality epidemiological studies (eg, prospective cohort studies, which controlled for workplace characteristics and baseline psychiatric morbidity). While the available literature (predominantly cross-sectional) suggests that there is a positive association between workplace bullying and suicidal ideation, the low quality of studies prevents ruling out alternative explanations. Further longitudinal, population-based research, adjusting for potential covariates (within and outside the workplace), is needed to determine the level of risk that workplace bullying independently contributes to suicidal ideation and behaviour.

AB  - Contemporary discussions within the fields of neuroscience (biology), physics and philosophy have provided profound new insights into the architecture of the brain, brain processes and the nature of consciousness. These insights permit the formulation of theoretical models that attempt to describe the organization of the self-system: that is, the way in which knowledge about the self is organized and related with respect to distinct context-related setf-representations. During the last decade the issue of 'dissociative identity disorder' (DID; previously termed 'multiple personality disorder' or MPD) has obtained increasingly greater attention within the fields of psychopathology and psychiatry. The arguments outlined in this paper are based on the assumption that dissociative identity disorder is actually an associative identity disorder. It is the result of deficient integrative and associative processes in the self-system or the use of different ego centers instead of one. Because the inaccessibility of the non-integrated parts of the self (i.e. amnesia) is one of the determining characteristics for the diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder, it is argued that this disorder can only manifest itself with individuals showing a high cognitive complexity of organization of self-relevant information. Cognitive complexity of the neurological system may be an endogenous factor affecting the occurrence of associative disorders and in part explain the many instances in which severe childhood abuse (i.e. physical, sexual and/or mental abuse) does not result in any symptoms of failing association.

AB  - Developing individuals and their families benefit from a warm and supportive relationship that fosters the development of good self-regulatory skills in the child needed for a host of positive developmental outcomes. Children and parents face special challenges to self regulation when faced with a child's chronic illness. A developmental model is presented that traces how positive parental involvement is coordinated with a child's self regulation skills (regulation of cognition, emotion, and behavior) that are essential for positive health management. This involves different temporal patterns of coordination of child and parent (and other close relationships) that lead to accumulating regulatory developments that afford benefits for managing illness. This process begins early in infancy through attachment and develops into childhood and adolescence to involve the coordination of parental monitoring and child disclosure that serves as a training ground for the expansion of social relationships beyond the family during emerging adulthood. The specific case of families dealing with type 1 diabetes is used to illustrate the transactional and dynamic nature of parent-child coordination across development. We conclude that a developmental model of parent-child coordination holds promise for understanding positive health outcomes and offers new methodological and statistical tools for the examination of development of both child and parent.

AB  - This review aims to clarify four perennial issues surrounding the concept of curiosity: its nature, conceptual distinction from situational interest, types, and educational implications. First, we argue that humans have evolved to be deeply curious to adapt to a world of uncertainty. Curiosity can be likened to an appetite for knowledge which can be satiated by specific information that fills a knowledge gap. Information-seeking behavior is determined by the expected availability of information using a cost-benefit analysis. Second, although curiosity and situational interest are often considered synonyms, we show that the two constructs differ in terms of their theoretical account, biological underpinnings, triggering factors, emotional valence, specificity of information searches, and relationship with individual interest. Unlike situational interest, which is the positive affect triggered by a wide variety of sources (e.g., autonomy, relatedness, competence), curiosity is an aversive cognitive state caused by an information gap. Situational interest follows the hedonic principle and is associated with opioid liking system in the brain. Curiosity, by contrast, is understood through drive theory and involves dopaminergic wanting system. Situational interest drives individuals to approach the stimulus while curiosity promotes the active seeking of missing information. Iterative cycles of curiosity resolution can lead to the development of individual interest. Third, we introduce two types of curiosity: curiosity for what (forward curiosity) is provoked by unpredictability, whereas curiosity for why (backward curiosity) arises from incongruity. Finally, driven by the unique characteristics of curiosity, we suggest ways to design learning environment that can nurture students' curiosity.

AB  - Since its introduction approximately 20 years ago, the Challenge-Hindrance Stress Model (CHM) has been widely accepted both among academic and practitioner audiences. The model posits that workplace stressors can be grouped into two categories. Hindrance stressors will interfere with performance or goals, while challenge stressors contribute to performance opportunities. These two categories of stressors are theorized to exhibit differential relationships with strain, with hindrance stressors being more consistently linked to psychological, physical, or behavioral strain compared to challenge stressors. Despite the popularity of this model, recent evidence suggests that the proposed differential relationship hypothesis has not consistently held true for all types of strain. Thus, a reexamination or modification of this paradigm is clearly warranted. In the present review, we describe existing evidence surrounding the CHM and describe the rationale for a shifting paradigm. We outline recent advances in research using the CHM, such as novel moderators and mediators, the need to explicitly measure challenge and hindrance appraisal and differentiate between hindrance and threat appraisal, the dynamic nature of these appraisals over time, and the recognition that a single stressor could be appraised simultaneously as both a challenge and a hindrance. Finally, we provide recommendations and future research directions for scholars examining stress and stress management through a CHM lens, including recommendations related to study design, the measurement of stressors, the integration of CHM with other models of stress, and interventions for stress management.

   The provision of psychotherapy over distance using technology is a growing market reaching many patients and therefore the risks and benefits need to be known by all psychotherapists whether they themselves practice online or not. This comprehensive review of the main ethical arguments for and against different forms of online psychotherapy aims to enhance discussion of ethical issues in this growing area. Methods
   A search of three databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science) was conducted in August 2019 using a specific search protocol yielding 249 publications. Results
   Of 24 ethical arguments in favor of online psychotherapy and 32 against, the top five ethical arguments in favor of online psychotherapy were (1) increased access to psychotherapy and service availability and flexibility; (2) therapy benefits and enhanced communication; (3) advantages related to specific client characteristics (e.g. remote location); (4) convenience, satisfaction, acceptance, and increased demand; and (5) economic advantages. The top five ethical arguments against engagement in online psychotherapy were (1) privacy, confidentiality, and security issues; (2) therapist competence and need for special training; (3) communication issues specific to technology; (4) research gaps; and (5) emergency issues. Conclusions
   The findings may be of help to practitioners in deciding whether to engage in online psychotherapy, and in informing patients about risks and benefits, improving ethical guidelines, and stimulating further ethical discussion. The findings are argumentative and qualitative in nature, and further quantitative research is needed.

AB  - Objective: Internalized stigma can lead to pervasive negative effects among people with severe mental illness (SMI). Although prevalence of internalized stigma is high, there is a dearth of interventions and meanwhile a lack of evidence as to their effectiveness. This study aims at unraveling the existence of different therapeutic interventions and the effectiveness internalized stigma reduction in people with SMI via a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: Five electronic databases were searched. Studies were included if they (1) involved community or hospital based interventions on internalized stigma, (2) included participants who were given a diagnosis of SMI > 50%, and (3) were empirical and quantitative in nature.
   Results: Fourteen articles were selected for extensive review and five for meta-analysis. Nine studies showed significant decrease in internalized stigma and two showed sustainable effects. Meta-analysis showed that there was a small to moderate significant effect in therapeutic interventions (SMD = -0.43; p = 0.003). Among the intervention elements, four studies suggested a favorable effect of psychoeducation. Meta-analysis showed that there was small to moderate significant effect (SMD = -0.40; p = 0.001).
   Conclusion: Most internalized stigma reduction programs appear to be effective. This systematic review cannot make any recommendation on which intervention is more effective although psychoeducation seems most promising. More Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) on particular intervention components using standard outcome measures are recommended in future studies. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Review of the theoretical frameworks for the study of child development within public health and epidemiology
AB  - Background Care for child development has gained international momentum in research and community-based programming. It encompasses various domains including cognitive, psychomotor, emotional, behavioural and social development, and a multitude of factors that have the potential to influence its trajectories. However, the multidisciplinary nature of child development initiatives is marred by a lack of unified perspectives across disciplines, especially basic conceptual understanding generated in the fields of education and psychology, which are not effectively exploited in public health programmes and epidemiological research.
   Methods The article suggests a four-point evaluation criteria to child development theories based on the ability to communicate in (1) Cross-disciplines, (2) an Overarching facility to address various developmental domains, (3) the capacity to link child development with Lifelong developmental potentials and, most importantly, (4) Epidemiological capability to provide supporting empirical evidence for community-based public health interventions (COLE criteria).
   Results Key child development theories have been reviewed by broadly grouping them into three categories on the basis of content and approach, such as descriptive theories, psychological construct-based theories, and context-based theories. The strengths and challenges of these theories have been evaluated on the basis of COLE criteria.
   Conclusion Although most of these theories can contribute at different levels in child development initiatives, context-based theories have been particularly proposed to practitioners, researchers and policy makers for community-based programming, principally for its potential to address issues of social inequality, poverty and childcare practices, which are at the core of public health initiatives, and provide multiple level of opportunities to intervene.

AB  - Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (Complex PTSD) has been recently proposed as a distinct clinical entity in the WHO International Classification of Diseases, 11(th) version, due to be published, two decades after its first initiation. It is described as an enhanced version of the current definition of PTSD, with clinical features of PTSD plus three additional clusters of symptoms namely emotional dysregulation, negative self-cognitions and interpersonal hardship, thus resembling the clinical features commonly encountered in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Complex PTSD is related to complex trauma which is defined by its threatening and entrapping context, generally interpersonal in nature. In this manuscript, we review the current findings related to traumatic events predisposing the above-mentioned disorders as well as the biological correlates surrounding them, along with their clinical features. Furthermore, we suggest that besides the present distinct clinical diagnoses (PTSD; Complex PTSD; BPD), there is a cluster of these comorbid disorders, that follow a continuum of trauma and biological severity on a spectrum of common or similar clinical features and should be treated as such. More studies are needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis, particularly in clinical terms and how they correlate to clinical entities' biological background, endorsing a shift from the phenomenologically only classification of psychiatric disorders towards a more biologically validated classification.

AB  - There are three main mechanisms of neuronal cell death which may act separately or cooperatively to cause neurodegeneration. This lethal triplet of metabolic compromise, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress causes neuronal cell death that is both necrotic and apoptotic in nature. Aspects of each of these three mechanisms are believed to play a role in the neurodegeneration that occurs in both Parkinsons and Huntington's diseases. Strategies to rescue or protect injured neurons usually involve promoting neuronal growth and function or interfering with neurotoxic processes. Considerable research has been done on testing a large array of neuroprotective agents using animal models which mimic these disorders. Some of these approaches have progressed to the clinical arena. Here, we review neuroprotective strategies which have been found to successfully ameliorate the neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. First, we will give an overview of the mechanisms of cell death and the background of Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Then we will elaborate on a range of neuroprotective strategies, including neurotrophic factors, anti-excitotoxins, antioxidants, bioenergetic supplements, anti-apoptotics, immunosuppressants, and cell transplantation techniques. Most of these approaches hold promise as potential therapies in the treatment of these disorders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All lights reserved.

AB  - Parenting has been robustly associated with offspring psychosocial development, and these effects are likely reflected in brain development. This hypothesis is being tested with increasingly rigorous methods and the use of magnetic resonance imaging, a powerful tool for characterizing human brain structure and function. The objective of this narrative review was to examine methodological issues in this field that impact the conclusions that can be drawn and to identify future directions in this field. Studies included were those that examined associations between parenting and offspring brain structure or function. Results show four thematic features in this literature that impact the hypotheses that can be tested, and the conclusions drawn. The first theme is a limited body of studies including repeated sampling of offspring brain structure and function, and therefore an over-reliance on cross-sectional or retrospective associations. The second involves a focus on extremes in early life caregiving, limiting generalizability. The third involves the nature of parenting assessment, predominantly parent- or child-report instead of observational measures which may be more ecologically valid measures of parenting. A closely related fourth consideration is the examination of detrimental versus positive parenting behaviors. While studies with one or more of these thematic limitations provide valuable information, future study design should consider addressing these limitations to determine how parenting shapes offspring brain development.</p>

AB  - Epistemic curiosity is a desire for knowledge accompanied by positive emotions, increased arousal, and exploratory behavior (Grossnickle, Educational Psychology Review, 28(1), 23-60, 2016). Although curiosity has typically been characterized as a domain-general construct, domain-general conceptualizations do not acknowledge systematic changes in an individuals' development (e.g., domain knowledge) as they advance within a domain. Moreover, a domain-general conceptualization of curiosity stands in direct contrast to research on interest, given that interest is typically described as domain-specific (e.g., interest for mathematics). Without a domain-specific conceptualization of curiosity as it relates to development within academic domains, comparisons between curiosity and interest will remain muddled. In the present theoretical review, we put forward a conceptualization of curiosity as domain-specific and examine how the components of curiosity develop within one academic domain: mathematics. In doing so, we juxtapose conceptualizations of epistemic curiosity with literature related to the development of other epistemic factors (i.e., knowledge, epistemic beliefs) in mathematics. Specifically, we build on the knowledge gap theories of epistemic curiosity (Litman, Personality and Individual Differences, 48(4), 397-410, 2010; Loewenstein, Psychological Bulletin, 116(1), 75-98, 1994) to consider developmental shifts in (a) knowledge gaps, (b) heightened arousal, and (c) exploratory behaviors within the domain of mathematics. Understanding the domain-specific and developmental nature of curiosity is critical for distinguishing curiosity from interest and for supporting motivation within mathematics classrooms.

AB  - Metal dyshomeostasis in the brain (BMD) has often been proposed as a possible cause for several neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). Nevertheless, the precise nature of the biochemical mechanisms of metal involvement in NDs is still largely unknown. Mounting evidence suggests that normal aging itself is characterized by, among other features, a significant degree of metal ion dysmetabolism in the brain. This is probably the result of a progressive deterioration of the metal regulatory systems and, at least in some cases, of life-long metal exposure and brain accumulation. Although alterations of metal metabolism do occur to some extent in normal aging, they appear to be highly enhanced under various neuropathological conditions, causing increased oxidative stress and favoring abnormal metal-protein interactions. Intriguingly, despite the fact that most common NDs have a distinct etiological basis, they share striking similarities as they are all characterized by a documented brain metal impairment. This review will primarily focus on the alterations of metal homeostasis that are observed in normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease. We also present a brief survey on BMD in other NDs (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Prion Protein disease) in order to highlight what represents the most reliable evidence supporting a crucial involvement of metals in neurodegeneration. The opportunities for metal-targeted pharmacological strategies in the major NDs are briefly outlined as well.

AB  - This paper reviews the evidence that provides the basis for a functional neuroanatomy of anxiety and fear. The afferent arm of the anxiety circuit includes the exteroceptive sensory systems of the brain, which convey the sensory information contained in a fear- or anxiety-inducing stimulus to the dorsal thalamus. Visceral afferent pathways alter the function of the locus coeruleus and the amygdala The thalamus relays sensory information to the primary sensory receptive areas of the cortex, which project to adjacent unimodal and polymodal cortical association areas. The cortical association areas send projections to the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and cingulate gyrus. A pivotal role for the amygdala in the transmission and interpretation of fear and anxiety is suggested by extensive afferents to the amygdala from thalamic and cortical exteroceptive systems, as well as by subcortical visceral afferent pathways. The neuronal interactions between the amygdala enable the individual to initiate adaptive behaviors to threat based upon the nature of the threat and prior experience. The efferent pathways involving the amygdala, locus coeruleus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and striatum mediate autonomic, neuroendocrine, and skeletal-motor responses associated with fear and anxiety. The proposed brain structures, neural mechanisms, and neural circuits related to anxiety provide a basis for increased understanding of the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.

AB  - Remembering and forgetting are fundamental features of an organism. Extinction is a type of forgetting where there is a decrease in the significance and/or the meaning of an associative memory when elements of that memory no longer predict one another. The neural mechanisms underlying extinction of fear memories have been extensively studied in the laboratory because extinction processes are clinically relevant to exposure therapies that treat anxiety disorders. However, only in the last decade have we begun to unveil the similarities and differences in plasticity underlying extinction across development. So far it is clear that extinction is a developmentally dissociated process in behavior and in pharmacology, however there are many large gaps in the literature in understanding how the developmental trajectory of different neurotransmitters contribute to changes in the nature of extinction across development. We attempt to address these gaps in the present review. Major neurotransmitter systems including the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems, the monoamines, the endogenous opioid and cannabinoid systems, acetylcholines, and neuropeptides such as oxytocin have all been identified to play some role in extinction of fear memories and have been covered in this review. We hope to facilitate more research into mechanisms of extinction at different stages of life, especially noting that mental disorders are increasingly classified as neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Animals have quick-acting nociceptive reflexes that protect them from tissue damage. Some taxa have also evolved the capacity for pain. Pain appears to be linked to long-term changes in motivation brought about by the aversive nature of the experience. Pain presumably enhances long-term protection through behaviour modification based, in part, on memory. However, crustaceans have long been viewed as responding purely by reflex and thus not experiencing pain. This paper considers behavioural and physiological criteria that distinguish nociception from potential pain in this taxon. These include trade-offs with other motivational systems and prolonged motivational change. Complex, prolonged grooming or rubbing demonstrate the perception of the specific site of stimulus application. Recent evidence of fitness-enhancing, anxiety-like states is also consistent with the idea of pain. Physiological changes in response to noxious stimuli mediate some of the behavioural change. Rapid avoidance learning and prolonged memory indicate central processing rather than mere reflexes. Thus, available data go beyond the idea of just nociception. However, the impossibility of total proof of pain described in ways appropriate for our own species means that pain in crustaceans is still disputed. Pain in animals should be defined in ways that do not depend on human pain experience.

AB  - During the past few decades, the psychological trait of optimism has garnered an increasing amount of interest from scientists, and numerous studies have now shown that optimism is associated with important benefits. The present review summarizes the main findings from this body of research. We begin by describing the two main ways in which researchers have defined and operationalized optimism, as "optimistic explanatory style" and as "dispositional optimism". Second, we provide an overview of the various studies documenting the benefits of optimism. Optimism indeed appears to be associated with higher levels of subjective well-being, better health, and more success. In addition, we describe some of the ongoing controversies in this area of research. Third, we summarize what researchers currently know about the causes of optimism, and how optimism can be fostered in adults as well as in youth. Finally, the present review highlights the adaptive nature of optimism, while recognizing that being optimistic under all circumstances may not always be best. Cultivating flexible and realistic optimism may therefore be most advantageous. We conclude by pointing out important areas of research for the future. These include continuing the search for the biological and brain substrates of optimism, and investigating the psychological and physiological benefits of adopting a flexible (as opposed to rigid) optimistic outlook on life.

AB  - Hundreds of thousands of individuals experience traumatic injuries each year. Some are mild to moderate in nature and patients experience full functional recovery and little change to their physical appearance. Others result in enduring, if not permanent, changes in physical functioning and appearance. Reconstructive plastic surgical procedures are viable treatments options for many patients who have experienced the spectrum of traumatic injuries. The goal of these procedures is to restore physical functioning and reduce the psychosocial burden of living with an appearance that may be viewed negatively by the patient or by others. Even after receipt of reconstructive procedures, many patients are left with residual disfigurement. In some, disability and disfigurement may be so profound that individuals are candidates for vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) procedures, i.e., the transplantation of a vascularized human body part containing multiple tissue types (skin, muscle, bone, nerves, and blood vessels) as an anatomical and/or structural unit. This narrative review paper summarizes the literature on the psychosocial burden experienced by those who have visible disfigurement. While many of these individuals experience stigma and discrimination, relatively few studies have employed a stigma framework to understand the psychosocial sequelea. This paper briefly addresses this framework. Last, particular focus is given to the psychosocial issues of individuals with particularly severe injuries who are potential candidates for VCA procedures.

AB  - The need for objective measurement in psychiatry has stimulated interest in alternative indicators of the presence and severity of illness. Speech may offer a source of information that bridges the subjective and objective in the assessment of mental disorders. We systematically reviewed the literature for articles exploring speech analysis for psychiatric applications. The utility of speech analysis depends on how accurately speech features represent clinical symptoms within and across disorders. We identified four domains of the application of speech analysis in the literature: diagnostic classification, assessment of illness severity, prediction of onset of illness, and prognosis and treatment outcomes. We discuss the findings in each of these domains, with a focus on how types of speech features characterize different aspects of psychopathology. Models that bring together multiple speech features can distinguish speakers with psychiatric disorders from healthy controls with high accuracy. Differentiating between types of mental disorders and symptom dimensions are more complex problems that expose the transdiagnostic nature of speech features. Convergent progress in speech research and computer sciences opens avenues for implementing speech analysis to enhance objectivity of assessment in clinical practice. Application of speech analysis will need to address issues of ethics and equity, including the potential to perpetuate discriminatory bias through models that learn from clinical assessment data. Methods that mitigate bias are available and should play a key role in the implementation of speech analysis.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant delays to non-urgent elective surgery. Decision making regarding prioritisation for surgery is currently informed primarily by clinical urgency. The ways in which decision making should also consider potential social and economic harm arising from surgical delay are currently unclear. This scoping review aimed to identify evidence related to (i) the nature and prevalence of social and economic harm experienced by patients associated with delayed surgery, and (ii) any patient assessment tools that could measure the extent of, or predict, such social and economic harm. A rapid scoping review was undertaken following JBI methodological guidance. The following databases were searched in October 2020: AMED; BNI; CINAHL; EMBASE; EMCARE; HMIC; Medline; PsychINFO, Cochrane, and the JBI. A total of 21 publications were included. The findings were categorised into five themes: (i) employment, (ii) social function and leisure, (iii) finances, (iv) patients' experiences of waiting, and (v) assessment tools that could inform decision making. The findings suggest that, for some patients, waiting for surgery can include significant social, economic, and emotional hardship. Few validated assessment tools exist. There is an urgent need for more research on patients' experiences of surgical delay in order to inform a more holistic process of prioritising people on surgical waiting lists in the COVID-19 pandemic recovery stages.

AB  - One of the most striking demonstrations of experience-dependent plasticity comes from studies of sensory-deprived individuals (e.g., blind or deaf), showing that brain regions deprived of their natural inputs change their sensory tuning to support the processing of inputs coming from the spared senses. These mechanisms of crossmodal plasticity have been traditionally conceptualized as having a double-edged sword effect on behavior. On one side, crossmodal plasticity is conceived as adaptive for the development of enhanced behavioral skills in the remaining senses of early-deaf or blind individuals. On the other side, crossmodal plasticity raises crucial challenges for sensory restoration and is typically conceived as maladaptive since its presence may prevent optimal recovery in sensory-re-afferented individuals. In the present review we stress that this dichotomic vision is oversimplified and we emphasize that the notions of the unavoidable adaptive/maladaptive effects of crossmodal reorganization for sensory compensation/restoration may actually be misleading. For this purpose we critically review the findings from the blind and deaf literatures, highlighting the complementary nature of these two fields of research. The integrated framework we propose here has the potential to impact on the way rehabilitation programs for sensory recovery are carried out, with the promising prospect of eventually improving their final outcomes.

AB  - The target article is an attempt to make some progress on the problem of color realism. Are objects colored? And what is the nature of the color properties? We defend the view that physical objects (for instance, tomatoes, radishes, and rubies) are colored, and that colors are physical properties, specifically, types of reflectance. This is probably a minority opinion, at least among color scientists. Textbooks frequently claim that physical objects are not colored, and that the colors are "subjective" or "in the mind." The article has two other purposes: First, to introduce an interdisciplinary audience to some distinctively philosophical tools that are useful in tackling the problem of color realism and, second, to clarify the various positions and central arguments in the debate.
   The first part explains the problem of color realism and makes some useful distinctions. These distinctions are then used to expose various confusions that often prevent people from seeing that the issues are genuine and difficult, and that the problem of color realism ought to be of interest to anyone working in the field of color science. The second part explains the various leading answers to the problem of color realism, and (briefly) argues that all views other than our own have serious difficulties or are unmotivated. The third part explains and motivates our own view, that colors are types of reflectances and defends it against objections made in the recent literature that are often taken as fatal.

AB  - Health care professionals' interpersonal communication skills with adolescents and young adults play a vital role in early identification of issues, provision of emotional support, effective illness management and health education. The aim of this systematic review of research was to examine the literature on different aspects of interpersonal communication with young clients in health care settings, in order to understand barriers and facilitating factors in their communication for better health care outcomes. Twenty-three articles published between January 2004 and September 2014 were collected via CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO and Sociological Abstracts. The findings revealed three major themes: (1) challenges of addressing sensitive and intimate aspects of young clients' lives; (2) trust and sense of emotional safety was a prerequisite for open and engaging communication; and (3) importance of having a sense of inclusion and autonomy. Recommendations arising from the review were: (1) overcome the barriers in discussing health-related concerns that are sensitive in nature by developing routine screening and clear intervention pathways; (2) routinely inform young clients about legal and professional obligations in treating their information; (3) develop resources and training opportunities for health professionals to build ethical reasoning skills, skills to assess young clients' cognitive competencies, and skills to assess situational contexts to better negotiate the dynamics between parents and a young client; and (4) increase awareness of the importance of humanistic engagements to promote open and engaging communication.

AB  - Black Sea is one of the most severely degraded and exploited large marine ecosystems in the world. For the last 50 years after the depletion of large predatory fish stocks, anchovy (with the partial contribution of sprat) has been acting as the main top predator species and experienced a major stock collapse at the end of 1990s. After the collapse, eastern part of the southern Black Sea became the only region sustaining relatively high anchovy catch (400,000 tons) whereas the total catch within the rest of the sea was reduced to nearly its one-third. The lack of recovery of different fish stocks under a slow ecosystem rehabilitation may be attributed, on the one hand, to inappropriate management measures and the lack of harmonized fishery policy among the riparian countries. On the other hand, impacts of multiple stressors (eutrophication, alien species invasions, natural climatic variations) on the food web may contribute to resilience of the system toward its recovery. The overfishing/recovery problem therefore cannot be isolated from rehabilitation efforts devoted to the long-term chronic degradation of the food web structure, and alternative fishery-related management measures must be adopted as a part of a comprehensive ecosystem-based management strategy. The present study provides a data driven ecosystem assessment, underlines the key environmental issues and threats, and points to the critical importance of holistic approach to resolve the fishery-ecosystem interactions. It also stresses the transboundary nature of the problem.

It aimed to determine: whether online support groups reduce grief-related symptoms for persons who are grieving; and the positive and negative attributes of online support groups experienced by bereaved users of these groups. A comprehensive search within major article databases and Google Scholar, and hand searching of reference lists in retrieved articles, resulted in nine peer-reviewed, scholarly studies that met the inclusion criteria. These quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies were assessed using the MMAT quality appraisal tool, and their findings were critically synthesised using a narrative and thematic approach. Insufficient, high-quality quantitative research prevented conclusions being drawn about the effect of online support groups on grief-related symptoms. However, the qualitative evidence shows that there are clear positive attributes of online peer support that are valued by bereaved users. These include being part of an understanding community of persons who have experienced a similar loss, emotional support, sharing of information, remembrance, reconstruction of a sense of identity, and a realisation of the changing nature of grief over time. Until there is evidence of therapeutic effects, it seems that online support groups may be a useful adjunct to, but not alternative to, grief therapy or counselling. Recommendations for much needed research are given.

AB  - Natural products have been used to protect the skin from harmful UV radiation for decades. Due to the ecotoxicological implications of synthetic sunscreen exposure in aquatic ecosystems, there is a greater need to explore alternative sources of UV filters. Recent research has focused on discovering novel UV absorbing photoprotective molecules from nature. In response to the excessive damage caused by UVB rays, plants induce the production of high concentrations of phytoprotective secondary metabolites and anti-oxidative enzymes. Despite promising UV absorbing and photoprotective properties, plant secondary metabolites have been underutilized in topical delivery due to low solubility and high instability. Numerous phytochemicals have been effectively nanosized, incorporated in formulations, and studied for their sustained effects in photoprotection. The present review outlines recent developments in nanosizing and delivering photoprotective crude plant extract and phytochemicals from a phytochemical perspective. We searched for articles using keywords: "UV damage," "skin photoprotection," "photodamage," and "nano delivery" in varied combinations. We identified and reviewed literature from 43 original research articles exploring nanosized phytochemicals and crude plant extracts with photoprotective activity. Nanosized phytochemicals retained higher amounts of bioactive compounds in the skin and acted as depots for their sustained release. Novel approaches in nanosizing considerably improved the photostability, efficacy, and water resistance of plant secondary metabolites. We further discuss the need for broad-spectrum sunscreen products, potential challenges, and future growth in this area.

AB  - Exposure to protective factors, conditions that protect against the occurrence of an undesirable outcome or promote the occurrence of a desirable outcome within an adolescent's environment, can foster healthy adolescent behaviors and reduce adult morbidity and mortality. Yet, little is known about the nature and effect of protective factors on the positive social and health outcomes among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) adolescents. We conducted a review of the literature to identify the protective factors associated with positive health outcomes among AIAN adolescents. We consulted Elsevier Science Direct, ERIC EBSCOhost, PubMed, and the Web of Science databases. A total of 3421 articles were encountered. Excluded publications were those that did not focus on AIAN adolescents (n = 3341), did not identify protective factors (n = 56), were not original research studies (n = 8), or were not written in the English language. We identified nine categories of protective factors positively associated with health and social outcomes, including: current and/or future aspirations, personal wellness, positive self-image, self-efficacy, non-familial connectedness, family connectedness, positive opportunities, positive social norms, and cultural connectedness. Such factors positively influenced adolescent alcohol, tobacco, and substance use; delinquent and violent behavior; emotional health including depression, suicide attempt; resilience; and academic success. Protective factors spanned multiple domains of the socio-ecological model. Strengths-based health promotion efforts that leverage local, innate protective factors and work with AIANs to create environments rich in protective factors are key to improving the health and wellbeing of AIAN adolescents.

AB  - Screening and brief interventions head the list of effective evidence-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of alcohol use disorders in healthcare settings. However, healthcare professionals have been reluctant to engage with this kind of activity both because of the sensitive nature of the subject and because delivery is potentially time-consuming. Digital technologies for behavioral change are becoming increasingly widespread and their low delivery costs make them highly attractive. Internet and mobile technologies have been shown to be effective for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and smoking cessation in healthcare settings, and have the potential to add substantial value to the delivery of brief intervention for alcohol. Online alcohol questionnaires have been shown to elicit reliable responses on alcohol consumption and compared with conventional prevention techniques, digital alcohol interventions delivered in various settings have been found to be as effective in preventing alcohol-related harms. The last decade has seen the emergence of a range of approaches to the implementation in health care settings of referral to Internet-based applications for screening and brief interventions (eSBI) for alcohol. Research in this area is in its infancy, but there is a small body of evidence providing early indications about implementation and sustainability, and a number of studies are currently underway. This paper examines some of the evidence emerging from these and other studies and assesses the implications for the future of eSBI delivery in primary care settings.

AB  - The inspirational aspect of creativity remains shrouded in mystery. Methodological problems have hindered research into creativity, and such a situation makes the interpretation and comparison of studies problematic. The link between creativity and psychopathology is overstated by the print, electronic, and celluloid media. This paper attempts to explain the creative process from a psychological and psychiatric perspective leaving room for different unexplained aspects of generativity for open discussion. A selective survey of the literature was performed to identify scholarly views of creativity and psychopathology. Data sources included PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The concept of inspiration was examined from psychological, psychopathological, and biological standpoints.
   A better understanding of creativity has clinical implications. Psychopathology can facilitate creativity, but it is not the maker of creativity that involves a harmonious blending of divergent and convergent thinking. The present trend in psychiatry of medicalizing all unusual behavior is not at all productive in fostering creativity among children. The cognitively gifted children differ widely from children with autistic spectrum disorders; the creative thinking of gifted children is polythetic, whereas such potentials of autistic individuals are generally monothetic.
   The study of creativity helps develop an expanded model of the mind. However, research into creativity has produced contradictory results. The assumed link between creativity and mental disorder could be clarified only when we elucidate the creative process. Further research is needed in regard to the psycho-biological nature of creativity, including genetic links, implications for neuropharmacology, and the treatment of pathology or psychological disorders.

Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using the intervention instrument Knowledge Development Process-Constructivist. In total, 33 scientifically relevant empirical articles were selected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, representative of the theme of PESs' UCs. The treatment of the data was due to critical reflection on the findings, synthesized in a literature map. Findings The study identified 24 UCs, most of which were negative. These were divided into two categories: feelings/emotions and attitudes/implications. Most conscious attitudes manifested themselves at the managerial level, whereas the unconscious ones appeared at the operational level. It was established that employees are more likely to be induced to adopt dysfunctional behaviours. Social aspects that interact with a PES, such as contextual and cultural factors, are fundamental for understanding how PES's UCs occur. Originality/value The study provides insights for researchers and professionals in the field of performance evaluation who wish to delve deeper into the theme of UCs, based on the proposed structure of a literature map that consists of dividing consequences into feelings and attitudes; checking the occurrence level (managerial or operational); and identifying the nature of the attitude, whether it is conscious or unconscious.

AB  - Objectives: Mental health is a key area for learning within undergraduate medical education. Given the nature of mental illness, interactions may have the potential to uniquely affect patients. This study set out to systematically review studies reporting experiences and perceptions of patients with mental illness' clinical interactions with medical students. This includes which factors encourage patients to interact with medical students and if patients perceive negative and positive effects from these interactions.
   Method: Studies reporting patient experiences of involvement in undergraduate medicine were included. A standardised search of online databases was carried out independently by 2 authors and consensus reached on the inclusion of studies. Data extraction and quality assessment were also completed independently, after which a content analysis of interventions was conducted and key themes extracted. Studies were included from peer-reviewed journals, in any language.
   Results: Eight studies from 5 countries were included, totaling 1088 patients. Most patients regarded interacting with medical students as a positive experience. Patients described feeling comfortable with medical students, and the majority believed it is important for students to see real patients'. Patients described benefits to them as enjoyment, being involved in student education, and developing an illness narrative.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that most patients with mental illness want to interact with medical students, and this should be encouraged during student placements. Further research, however, is required to understand in more depth what else can be done to improve the comfort and willingness for patients to interact with students, including barriers to this.

AB  - ObjectiveClinical psychology students and clinicians in regional and remote areas face challenges accessing required supervision and peer consultation. Distance supervision using existing online conferencing tools (e.g., SKYPE) is one option, but limitations of existing platforms require an external method of initiating a supervisory relationship and securely sharing confidential documents and videos. This paper addresses the development of an e-supervision application to overcome these limitations, and examines issues inherent to such a development.
   MethodA newly developed e-supervision application provides online access to a database of clinical supervisors and peers for students to search, contact and meet, with additional document sharing and video annotation tools to support standard supervision activities. The authors provide a selected review of clinical, technical, legal and ethical considerations that have arising during the design, development and testing of this application.
   ResultsTechnological barriers exist, both in internet capacity in rural areas, and with institutions allowing access to common meeting platforms. Online interactions necessitate a different communication style, which may deter new users. The highly confidential and sensitive nature of supervision resources (client videos and notes) requires the implementation of best practice security measures, and consideration of Australian Privacy law and informed consent procedures for clients.
   ConclusionsIssues around online security, confidentiality and verification of users need to be considered and addressed in the development of online supervision services. User perceptions of security and utility will ultimately determine uptake of online supervision services, and further investigation of user perceptions is required.

AB  - There is a growing awareness that gut commensal metabolites play a major role in host physiology and indeed the pathophysiology of several illnesses. The composition of the microbiota largely determines the levels of tryptophan in the systemic circulation and hence, indirectly, the levels of serotonin in the brain. Some microbiota synthesize neurotransmitters directly, e.g., gamma-amino butyric acid, while modulating the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). The composition of the microbiota determines the levels and nature of tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) which in turn has profound effects on aryl hydrocarbon receptors, thereby influencing epithelial barrier integrity and the presence of an inflammatory or tolerogenic environment in the intestine and beyond. The composition of the microbiota also determines the levels and ratios of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate and propionate. Butyrate is a key energy source for colonocytes. Dysbiosis leading to reduced levels of SCFAs, notably butyrate, therefore may have adverse effects on epithelial barrier integrity, energy homeostasis, and the T helper 17/regulatory/T cell balance. Moreover, dysbiosis leading to reduced butyrate levels may increase bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation. As examples, we describe the role of microbial metabolites in the pathophysiology of diabetes type 2 and autism.

AB  - Childhood trauma (CT) has repeatedly been associated with cognitive deficits in patients with psychosis but many inconsistencies have been reported so that the nature of the relationship remains unclear. The purpose of this review was to better characterize the contribution of CT to cognitive deficits by considering the type, severity and frequency of childhood traumatic events and their relationships with psychosis at all stages.
   Relevant studies were identified via electronic and manual literature searches and included original studies that investigated the relationship between CT and higher cognitive performance or social cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and psychosis at all stages of the illness stages (i.e. ultra-high risk, first episode or chronic phase).
   Overall, a majority of studies reported that patients who experienced CT displayed deficits in general cognitive ability compared to patients with psychosis without such a history. Associations between CT and other cognitive function were more mixed. When comparing patient groups, the association between CT and cognitive function was more inconsistent in patients with chronic schizophrenia than in healthy participants, ultra-high risk individuals, first-episode patients and patients with chronic bipolar disorder.
   In understanding the variability in the reported relationships between CT and cognition across study populations, we highlight the variety of questionnaires used and discuss the likelihood of there being differences in cognitive function based on specific stressors, severity and frequency. Finally, we consider future research steps that may shed light on psychobiological mechanisms underlying CT and cognitive performance in patients with psychosis.

AB  - Intraseptal arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been suggested to control in laboratory rodents not only emotionality but also learning and memory. However, depending upon the nature of the test procedure and, thus, the specific memory paradigm under study, administration of synthetic AVP into the lateral septum can have no effect, enhance or even impair learning and memory. Similar contradictory results were obtained after local administration of AVP V1 receptor antagonists in different learning and memory paradigms: blockade of AVP signalling in the lateral septum revealed either no essential function or a significant contribution of the endogenous neuropeptide. Based on the data available from studies investigating the impact of AVP in classical and operant conditioning, olfactory recognition and Morris water maze learning, it is proposed that endogenous AVP released within the lateral septum acts as neurotransmitter and neuromodulator to favour elemental (mono-modal) over complex (multi-modal) stimulus processing. Excessive availability of AVP, for example by intraseptal administration of the synthetic neuropeptide, interferes with memory performance in such tasks in which the integration of complex stimuli by the dorsal hippocampus is required, most likely by an inhibition of the septohippocampal pathway. In contrast, performance in tasks which focus on the processing of elemental stimuli such as olfactory recognition and classical and operant conditioning can be improved by intraseptal AVP administration, presumably due to an attenuation of complex stimulus processing.

AB  - Purpose
   Stigma associated with mental health problems is widespread in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Consequently, this may prevent many Saudi people from accessing the mental health-care services and support they need. The purpose of this study is to consider how stigma affects people needing to access mental health services in the KSA. To achieve this aim, this study reviews the knowledge base concerning stigma and mental health in KSA and considers specific further research necessary to increase the knowledge and understanding in this important area.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This review examines the relevant literature concerning mental health stigma and related issues in KSA using the Arksey and O'Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses frameworks. As a scoping review, it has used a systematic approach in literature searching. The results of the search were then thematically analysed and the themes were then discussed in light of the concepts of stigma and mental health.
   Findings
   Stigma around mental health impedes access to care, the nature of care and current clinical practice in the KSA. The voices of those with mental health issues in KSA are almost entirely unrepresented in the literature.
   Originality/value
   The review identifies that mental health stigma and cultural beliefs about mental health in KSA may act as barriers to accessing services. The voice of mental health service users in KSA remains largely unheard. If public discussion of mental health issues can increase, people's experiences of accessing services may be improved.

AB  - Aims: Regarding the importance of health as well as the discussion of thinking in psychology and philosophy, so far, no model has been presented in the field of the relationship between "thinking and health" with this model. Therefore, the present study aimed to introduce the new model of healthy thinking based on human soul faculties. Materials and Methods: Using the narrative review method, 63 sources were selected among the 240-evidence, including books, articles, national, and international reports and theses from PubMed, Google Scholar, Elsevier, and Web of sciences, then entered the analysis stage Indicators of sensory and intellectual thinking were extracted from these sources. Then, the indicators were coded and analyzed according to the Content Analysis method. Results: The results of this research are used in psychotherapy in clinical psychology because researches have shown that thinking and especially healthy thinking has a very effective role in mental health and a healthy lifestyle. Several concepts are available in this model: The nature of thinking, levels of thinking, sources of error in thinking such as cognitive distortions, cognitive bias, and perceptual errors. Conclusion: The models of thinking that have been proposed in the world so far have many shortcomings, including none of them has the power to clarification thinking and none of the theories and models have the relationship between thinking and health been clearly explained, while the proposed thinking model of the present study does not have such shortcomings.

AB  - This paper deals with the theory of the social genesis of higher mental functions (HMF) developed by V.gotsky and Luria. Their systemic cultural-historical approach, the first premise of developmental neuropsychology, stresses the influence of social and cultural factors on the child's cognitive development, the social nature of function formation, and the role of mediation (the use of social means) in the genesis of HMF. The dynamic ontogenic localization of HMF at various levels is discussed, along with the types of brain structures and their functional integration. The psychogenetic studies done in Russia in the 1920s and 1930s by Luria et al., using the twins method, analyzed genotype - environment relations through cultural-historical theory. These studies revealed changes in the relative impact of heredity and environment due to modifications in mental functioning in response to different educative procedures and the role of speech acquisition in mental development. These psychogenetic studies proved that speech and language have a formative effect on mental processes, and that twins form a risk group in terms of mental development. The psychogenetic studies by Luria also formed the basis of neuropsychological remediation, especially the principles of developing games for small children. The differences between the Russian and Western approaches in developmental neuropsychology are discussed, as well as trends in the progress of developmental neuropsychology. This progress is due to the tendency to analyze the dynamics of brain / mind functioning and interaction through the social conditions of a person's life

AB  - The imprecise nature of psychiatric nosology restricts progress towards characterizing and treating mental health disorders. One issue is the 'heterogeneity problem': different causal mechanisms may relate to the same disorder, and multiple outcomes of interest can occur within one individual. Our review tackles this heterogeneity problem, providing considerations, concepts, and approaches for investigators examining human cognition and mental health. We highlight the difficulty of pure dimensional approaches due to 'the curse of dimensionality'. Computationally, we consider supervised and unsupervised statistical approaches to identify putative subtypes within a population. However, we emphasize that subtype identification should be linked to a particular outcome or question. We conclude with novel hybrid approaches that can identify subtypes tied to outcomes, and may help advance precision diagnostic and treatment tools.

AB  - Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects individuals across their lifetime, though the effects of ageing in older adulthood are poorly understood to date. This systematic review assessed six characteristics in older autistic adults (cognitive functioning, co-occurring difficulties, autism symptom severity, social integration, adaptive functioning, language processing). A total of 41 studies met inclusion criteria, 16 of which included autistic adults with intellectual disability, and three were longitudinal in nature. Findings show differing effects of ageing across the six domains. Factors contributing to discrepancies such as age and IQ differences, methodology and healthy survivor effect are discussed. The need for more longitudinal studies to investigate changes across developmental stages alongside other limitations, future directions and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - This article discusses recent developments and advances in the neuroscience of music to understand the nature of musical emotion. In particular, it highlights how system identification techniques and computational models of music have advanced our understanding of how the human brain processes the textures and structures of music and how the processed information evokes emotions. Musical models relate physical properties of stimuli to internal representations called features, and predictive models relate features to neural or behavioral responses and test their predictions against independent unseen data. The new frameworks do not require orthogonalized stimuli in controlled experiments to establish reproducible knowledge, which has opened up a new wave of naturalistic neuroscience. The current review focuses on how this trend has transformed the domain of the neuroscience of music.

AB  - Recent grief research suggests that the influential cognitive stress theory should be updated with evidence from cognitive neuroscience. Combining human and animal neuroscience with attachment theory, we propose that semantic knowledge of the everlasting nature of the attachment figure and episodic, autobiographical memories of the death are in conflict, perhaps explaining the duration of grieving and generating predictions about complications in prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Our gone-but-also-everlasting model emphasizes that grieving may be a form of learning, requiring time and experiential feedback. Difficulties before loss, such as spousal dependency or pre-existing hippocampal volume, can prolong learning and predict PGD. Complications such as avoidance, rumination, and stress-induced hippocampal atrophy may also develop after loss and create functional or structural mechanisms predicting PGD.

AB  - Behavioural development of birds is shaped by the complex interplay between genetics and environment. It is becoming increasingly clear that experiences of previous generations are transferred to the offspring through epigenetic and hormonal effects and result in lasting changes in behaviour. After hatching, social and physical conditions during early life have marked effects on bird behaviour of both the current and following generations. Aspects like the presence or absence of maternal care, the composition of the social environment and the behavioural stimulation offered by the physical environment all have strong influences on the behavioural development of a bird. Research approaches that focus on manipulations during the early-life period and investigate effects on epigenetics, maternal hormones and behavioural development should be encouraged.

TI  - Dueling over Dualism
AB  - Stewart Goetz and Charles Taliaferro in Naturalism (2008), and Chet Raymo in When God is Gone Everything is Holy (2008), take opposite views on the virtues of dualism, particularly regarding the immaterial soul and the material body. Goetz and Taliaferro hit hard at the implausibility of strict naturalism's reduction of mind to brain, sharply criticizing broad naturalism's difficulties with free, normative, value- led, personal action. If the choice is between the immaterial soul and naturalist denials and reductions, they defend dualism. Chet Raymo, as a scientist, loves nature and empirical method too much to accept the need for any other realm or way of knowing. If the choice is between modest intellectual integrity and dogmatic obscurantism, he rejects dualism. I reply that these are false choices: Whitehead's mental and physical 'duality' in his bipolar cosmology trumps the need for 'dualism' without requiring denial of effective mentality and free personal action.

It argues that the parent-child relationship is of pre-eminent importance both because of its direct effect on future mental health and because it sets the scene for future relationships. It also argues that, because of the reciprocal nature of the relationships, the mental health of society can be improved by improving the mental health of any of its individual members. From this it follows that to focus mental health promotion programmes entirely on the most vulnerable limits the potential for improvement, because working with people who are not mentally ill will increase their ability to support those who are. Universal mental health promotion programmes should therefore have relationships - and parent-child relationships in particular - at their heart, aiming to improve everyone's capacity to relate supportively and respectfully to others.

AB  - The social brain is the cornerstone that effectively negotiates and navigates complex social environments and relationships. When mature, these social abilities facilitate the interaction and cooperation with others. Empathy, morality, and justice, among others, are all closely intertwined, yet the relationships between them are quite complex. They are fundamental components of our human nature, and shape the landscape of our social lives. The various facets of empathy, including affective arousal/emotional sharing, empathic concern, and perspective taking, have unique contributions as subcomponents of morality. This review helps understand how basic forms of empathy, morality, and justice are substantialized in early ontogeny. It provides valuable information as to gain new insights into the underlying neurobiological precursors of the social brain, enabling future translation toward therapeutic and medical interventions.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that cognition is embodied and grounded. Abstract concepts, though, remain a significant theoretical challenge. A number of researchers have proposed that language makes an important contribution to our capacity to acquire and employ concepts, particularly abstract ones. In this essay, I critically examine this suggestion and ultimately defend a version of it. I argue that a successful account of how language augments cognition should emphasize its symbolic properties and incorporate a view of embodiment that recognizes the flexible, multimodal and task-related nature of action, emotion and perception systems. On this view, language is an ontogenetically disruptive cognitive technology that expands our conceptual reach.

AB  - The first 100 years of experimental psychology were dominated by 2 major schools of thought: behaviorism and cognitive science. Here the authors consider the common philosophical commitment to determinism by both schools, and how the radical behaviorists' thesis of the determined nature of higher mental processes is being pursued today in social cognition research on automaticity, in harmony with "dual process" models in contemporary cognitive science, which equate determined processes with those that are automatic and which require no intervening conscious choice or guidance, as opposed to "controlled" processes which do, the social cognition research on the automaticity of higher mental processes provides compelling evidence for the determinism of those processes. This research has revealed that social interaction, evaluation and judgment, and the operation of internal goal structures can all proceed without the intervention of conscious acts of will and guidance of the process.

AB  - Data reviewed suggest that previous theories of emotion experience are too narrow in scope and that lack of consensus is due to the fact that emotion experience takes various forms and is heterogenous. The authors treat separately the content of emotion experience, the underlying nonconscious correspondences, and processes producing emotion experience. They classify the nature and content of emotion experience and propose that it depends on 3 aspects of attention: mode (analytic-synthetic; detached-immersed), direction (self-world), and focus (evaluation-action). The account is informed by a 2-level view of consciousness in which phenomenology (1st order) is distinguished from awareness (2nd order). These distinctions enable the authors to differentiate and account for cases of "unconscious" emotion, in which there is an apparent lack of phenomenology or awareness.

There were 160 participants (81 males, 79 females), of whom 121 reported 75 types of peak- and other experiences. Neurotechnologies are methods and devices that purportedly enhance mental functioning by entraining brain-wave patterns, often producing a psychophysiological state of hemispheric synchronization. In the present article, which comprises Part 1, research on peak- and other powelful experiences is reviewed. An overview of neurotechnologies is also given. Part 2, which will follow in the next issue of this Journal, will describe the method used in this study and the results, including short- and long-term aftereffects of the program and the meaning of the experiences for the participants.

AB  - While it is premature to provide a simple model for the vulnerability to the development of either borderline (BPD) or schizotypal (SPD) personality disorder, it is clear that these heritable disorders lend themselves to fruitful neurobiological exploration. The most promising findings in BPD suggest that a diminished top-down control of affective responses, which is likely to relate to deceased responsiveness of specific midline regions of prefrontal cortex, May Underlie the affective hyperresponsiveness in this disorder. In addition, genetic and neuroendocrine and molecular neuro-imaging finding point to a role for serotonin in this affective disinhibition. Clearly SPD falls within the schizophrenia spectrum, but precisely the nature of what predicts full-blown schizophrenia as opposed to the milder Symptoms of SPD is not yet clear.

AB  - What is the nature of our ability to understand and reason about the beliefs of others - the possession of a 'theory of mind', or ToM? Here, we review findings from imaging and lesion studies indicating that ToM reasoning is supported by a widely distributed neural system. Some functional components of this system, such as language-related regions of the left hemisphere, the frontal lobes and the right temporal-parietal cortex, are not solely dedicated to the computation of mental states. However, the system also includes a core, domain-specific component that is centred on the amygdala circuitry. We provide a framework in which impairments of ToM can be viewed in terms of abnormalities of the core system, the failure of a co-opted system that is necessary for performance on a particular set of tasks, or the absence of an experiential trigger for the emergence of ToM.

AB  - Leveraging perspectives from social cognitive theory, the attention-based view, and social networks literatures, we tested the relationship between unethical choice and network unethicality, which we define as respondents' perceptions of their peer advisors' unethical choices. Although social cognitive theory predicts that perceptions of peer advisor unethical choice are positively associated with unethical choice, we theorize that the nature of this relationship depends on the personality of the actor (core self-evaluation) and the situation (moral intensity). Results from a lagged study suggest that individual and situational variables may act as key buffers to the adverse impact of unethical social influence on ethical choice. Strengths, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This article reviews the literature on the association between impulsivity aggression and suicide. The key words impulsivity, aggression, and suicide were entered into the pubmed, psychlit, and proqest databases. Significant articles were scrutinized for relevant information. Impulsivity and aggression are highly correlated with suicidal behavior across psychiatric samples, nosological borders, and non-psychiatric populations. Impulsivity and aggression are related but the nature of this relationship remains unclear. The literature is confusing and contradictory. This is probably due to the difficulty in defining and separating out these concepts and the fact that there is much overlap between them. Future research should aim at clarifying and refining these concepts as well as their link to all the different forms of suicidal behavior.

KW  - COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB  - Shakespearean tragedy explores patterns of feeling and thought that lock characters into asocial consistencies, preventing affective intuitions from modifying self-understanding and judgment in the ways that both early modern moral physiology, as popularized by Erasmus, and current neuroscience suggest ethical sense and practical reasoning require. Blocking "dialogue" between body and discourse, such consistencies induce characters to lapse into what Wilma Bucci describes as "dissociation": either bodily experience disconnects from symbolic representation, or an "emotional schema" activated in "core consciousness," cannot be integrated into "extended consciousness." In Julius Caesar, Brutus's Stoic deprecation of the emotions prevents him from appreciating how embodiment opens memory to affective, prototypic imagery in ways that will guide how the ethical significance of Caesar's body will be grasped' in Hamlet, nature revenges itself upon the dissociation of cognition, and thus identity, from somatic ethical responsiveness that the "rottenness" of the new order of Denmark seeks to effect.

AB  - Alcoholism is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by continued alcohol use despite numerous adverse consequences. Alcohol has been shown to interact with numerous neurotransmitter systems to exert its pharmacological effects. The endogenous opioid system (EOS) has been strongly implicated in the positive and negative reinforcing effects of alcohol. Traditionally recognized as dysphoric/anhedonic in nature, the dynorphin/kappa-opioid receptor (DYN/KOR) system has recently received considerable attention due to evidence suggesting that an upregulated DYN/KOR system may be a critical contributor to the complex factors that result in escalated alcohol consumption once dependent. The present review will discuss alcohol-induced plasticity in the DYN/KOR system and how these neuroadaptations could contribute to excessive alcohol seeking and consumption.

AB  - Current findings on parental influences provide more sophisticated and less deterministic explanations than did earlier theory and research on parenting. Contemporary research approaches include (a) behavior-genetic designs, augmented with direct measures of potential environmental influences; (b) studies distinguishing among children with different, genetically influenced predispositions in terms of their responses to different environmental conditions; (c) experimental and quasi-experimental studies of change in children's behavior as a result of their exposure to parents' behavior, after controlling for children's initial characteristics; and (d) research on interactions between parenting and nonfamilial environmental influences and contexts, illustrating contemporary concern with influences beyond the parent-child dyad. These approaches indicate that parental influences on child development are neither as unambiguous as earlier researchers suggested nor as insubstantial as current critics claim.

AB  - The members of many professional and occupational groups (e.g., emergency services, social services, psychology, and financial sector) can become affected by traumatic events occurring in the workplace. Currently, a range of methodologies and assessment instruments are used in the study of this area, making comparison between studies difficult, and raising issues relating to the validity and reliability of the instruments. Existing research in this area is also hampered by it being predominantly cross-sectional in nature. This paper discusses the issues that need to be dealt with in order to put the study of work-related psychological trauma on a firm theoretical foundation. The issues canvassed include establishing assessment instruments using sound psychometric principles; the need for normative data; the methodological implications of longitudinal, multiwave research design; and evaluating change.

Unfamiliar faces pose a greater challenge to human perception and memory systems. The established behavioural disparities for familiar and unfamiliar faces undoubtedly stem from differences in the quality and nature of their underlying neural representations. In this review, our goal is to characterize what is known about the neural pathways that respond to familiar and unfamiliar faces using data from functional neuroimaging studies. We divide our presentation by type of familiarity (famous, personal, and visual familiarity) to consider the distinct neural underpinnings of each. We conclude with a description of a recent model of person information proposed by Gobbini and Haxby (2007) and a list of open questions and promising directions for future research.

Among the drug abuse research areas discussed here and viewed from this perspective are antecedent and co-occurring psychopathological conditions and other problem behaviors; the diversity of the nature of, paths to, and processes and outcomes related to drug abuse; the role of intermediary influences. the interaction of individual and environmental predisposing and protective factors; the role of families and other social institutions in intervention; and developmental stage characteristics.

AB  - Procrastination is a prevalent and pernicious form of self-regulatory failure that is not entirely understood. Hence, the relevant conceptual, theoretical, and empirical work is reviewed, drawing upon correlational, experimental, and qualitative findings. A meta-analysis of procrastination's possible causes and effects. based on 691 correlations, reveals that neuroticism, rebelliousness, and sensation seeking show only a weak connection. Strong and consistent predictors of procrastination were task aversiveness, task delay, self-efficacy, and impulsiveness, as well as conscientiousness and its facets of self-control, distractibility, organization, and achievement motivation. These effects prove consistent with temporal motivation theory, an integrative hybrid of expectancy theory and hyperbolic discounting. Continued research into procrastination should not be delayed, especially because its prevalence appears to be growing.

These mechanisms were affective, behavioral, cognitive, or some combination of the three. Recent theoretical and methodological work is discussed that has advanced our understanding of teams as complex, multilevel systems that function over time, tasks, and contexts.

AB  - Emotion is conceptualised as an emergent, dynamic process based on an individual's subjective appraisal of significant events. It is argued that theoretical models of emotion need to propose an architecture that reflects the essential nature and functions of emotion as a psychobiological and cultural adaptation mechanism. One proposal for such a model and its underlying dynamic architecture, the component process model, is briefly sketched and compared with some of its major competitors. Recent empirical evidence in support of the model is reviewed. Special emphasis is given to the dynamic aspect of emotion processes, in particular the sequence of appraisal checks and the synchronisation of response systems, as well as the capacity of the model to predict individual differences in emotional responding.

AB  - Interoception, i.e., the processing and integration of sensory information has gained research interest due to its relevance in the psychopathological context. In the present review, we focus upon interoceptive regulation or one's capacity to match bodily signals to his/her desired state by altering the signal or the desired state. More specifically, we discuss attention toward and appraisal of interoceptive stimuli as regulatory mechanisms of interoception. We review findings in the emerging research area of interoceptive attention. Studies suggest that the quality of attention and the nature of appraisal regarding interoceptive information influence interoceptive regulation and subsequent adaptive or maladaptive behavioral strategies among healthy controls as well as clinical populations. We discuss the clinical implications and the need to promote further research as well as to target interoceptive attention and appraisal mechanisms in psychotherapy.

AB  - The nature of domain-specific organization in higher-order visual cortex (ventral occipital temporal cortex, VOTC) has been investigated both in the case of visual experience deprivation and of modality of stimulation in sighted individuals. Object domain interacts in an intriguing and revelatory way with visual experience and modality of stimulation: selectivity for artifacts and scene domains is largely immune to visual deprivation and is multi-modal, whereas selectivity for animate items in lateral posterior fusiform gyrus is present only with visual stimulation. This domain-by-modality interaction is not readily accommodated by existing theories of VOTC representation. We conjecture that these effects reflect a distinction between the visual features that characterize different object domains and their interaction with different types of downstream computational systems.

The effect that impact loads have on ballast degradation and its mitigation due to resilient synthetic mats (i.e. rubber mats) between the ballast and the subballast is investigated using large-scale impact-testing apparatus. Computational modelling with finite element and discrete element methods are increasingly being used to model ballasted tracks reinforced with geosynthetics to capture the continuum media of formation soils and the discrete nature of ballast aggregates. The article focuses on reviewing previous studies by the University of Wollongong on ballasted track substructure and highlights some practical implications whereby innovation progresses from theory to practice.

AB  - The spatial organization of chromosome structure within the interphase nucleus, as well as the patterns of methylome and histone modifications, represent intersecting layers that influence genome accessibility and function. This review is focused on the plastic nature of chromatin structure and epigenetic marks in association to stress situations. The use of chemical compounds (epigenetic drugs) or T-DNA-mediated mutagenesis affecting epigenetic regulators (epi-mutants) are discussed as being important tools for studying the impact of deregulated epigenetic backgrounds on gene function and phenotype. The inheritability of epigenetic marks and chromatin configurations along successive generations are interpreted as a way for plants to communicate past experiences of stress sensing. A mechanistic understanding of chromatin and epigenetics plasticity in plant response to stress, including tissue- and genotype-specific epigenetic patterns, may help to reveal the epigenetics contributions for genome and phenotype regulation.

The method was adapted by many law teachers who were unpersuaded by the idea of law as apolitical science. These included Langdell's colleagues, James Bradley Thayer and John Chipman Gray, who shared Holmes's disdain for the theory. The method survived and flourished despite its theoretical weakness because it worked in practice. No mere rite of passage, it developed numerous traits and skills useful to lawyers, it revealed a true picture of the political and atomized nature of American law, and it nurtured many of the civic virtues that American law teachers have sought to nurture since the time of George Wythe.

In the present review, we focus on the affective consequences of imagined contact. In particular, we review studies showing that imagined contact has powerful effects on reduced intergroup and performance anxiety, as well as increased trust and empathy toward outgroup members. Moreover, these effects extend to the affective part of intergroup attitudes tapped at both an explicit and at an implicit level. We also present evidence that some of these variables mediate the effects of imagined contact on reduced prejudice. Finally, we discuss the double nature, cognitive and affective, of imagined contact.

Much remains to be learned about the nature of changes in work organization, and how they affect worker health and safety. While available evidence is limited, such evidence suggests that recent trends in work organization may be increasing the risk of occupational illnesses. In a groundbreaking publication, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has provided a concise summary of available knowledge and a detailed agenda for research and development.

AB  - A review of the interaction between the positive-negative symptom distinction in schizophrenia and multiple measures of illness natural history reveals some redundant and compelling patterns.  Negative or deficit symptoms are often associated with inferior social/instrumental functioning premorbidly, more abnormal voluntary/involuntary movements at illness presentation, and poorer long-term outcome when present beyond the early phase of illness.  Negative symptoms are semi-independent of positive symptoms.  They are variable early in the illness but accrue in severity, stability, and prognostic weight with time.  The nature of the processes that generate negative symptoms and their specificity to schizophrenia remain to be elucidated.  Nevertheless, it is clear that negative symptoms are a common and valid component of schizophrenia and deserve recognition as such in our nosology.

AB  - Prospective monitoring of mood was started by Kraepelin who made and recorded frequent observations of his patients. During the last decade, the number of research studies using remotely collected electronic mood data has increased markedly. However, standardized measures and methods to collect, analyze and report electronic mood data are lacking. To get better understanding of the nature, correlates and implications of mood and mood instability, and to standardize this process, we propose guidelines for reporting of electronic mood data (eMOOD). This paper provides an overview of remotely collected electronic mood data in mood disorders and discusses why standardized reporting is necessary to evaluate and inform mood research in Psychiatry. Adherence to these guidelines will improve interpretation, reproducibility and future meta-analyses of mood monitoring in mood disorder research.

AB  - Genomic imprinting is a unique form of epigenetic regulation that is highly prevalent in the brain. The complexity of imprinted regulation in the adult and developing brain, and its central roles in neural processes are becoming increasingly appreciated. Here, we outline recent progress in elucidating the influence of imprinted genes on brain function - from neural development to synaptic function, cognition, and social and emotional behaviors. We review how improved sequencing and analytical technology have helped in identifying parental biases in gene expression alongside monoallelic expression in brain tissues, and we discuss the potential roles of imprinted genes in regulating key neural pathways. This review aims to provide a better understanding of the nature and functional significance of genomic imprinting in the normal and pathological brain of mammals, including humans.

We critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of factor analyses, meta-analyses, and experimental literatures. We examine those studies that set out to describe the nature and number of spatial and mathematical skills and specific connections between these abilities, especially those that included children as participants. We also find evidence of strong spatial-mathematical connections and transfer from spatial interventions to mathematical understanding. Finally, we map out the kinds of studies that could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which spatial and mathematical processing are connected and the principles by which mathematical outcomes could be enhanced through spatial training in educational settings.

AB  - This review focuses on some relevant issues concerning the relationship between theory of mind (ToM) and humanoid robots. Humanoid robots are employed in different everyday-life contexts, so it seems relevant to question whether the relationships between human beings and humanoids can be characterized by a mode of interaction typical of the relationships between human beings, that is, the attribution of mental states. Because ToM development continuously undergoes changes from early childhood to late adulthood, we adopted a lifespan perspective. We analyzed contributions from the literature by organizing them around the partition between "mental states and actions" and "human-like features." Finally, we considered how studying human-robot interaction, within a ToM context, can contribute to our understanding of the intersubjective nature of this interaction.

AB  - This article provides a review of past and contemporary debates regarding the role of awareness in attitude formation through evaluative conditioning (EC), that is, by repeatedly pairing a stimulus with other stimuli of positive or negative valence. Because EC is considered the most prototypical method to form and change the network of evaluative associations in memory, the role of awareness in this effect is critical to the question of whether attitudes may be formed and changed through dual processes. We analyze the reasons why there has been so much discussion and disagreement regarding the role of awareness, review past and contemporary methodologies and their limitations, discuss the role of mental processes and conditioning procedures, and identify promising directions for future research in this area.

AB  - The past 50 years have seen an accumulation of evidence suggesting that associative learning depends oil high-level cognitive processes that give rise to propositional knowledge. Yet, many learning theorists maintain a belief in a learning mechanism in which links between mental representations are formed automatically. We characterize and highlight the differences between the propositional and link approaches, and review the relevant empirical evidence. We conclude that learning is the consequence of propositional reasoning processes that cooperate with the unconscious processes involved in memory retrieval and perception. We argue that this new conceptual framework allows many of the important recent advances in associative learning research to be retained, but recast in a model that provides a firmer foundation for both immediate application and future research.

AB  - Research suggests that involvement in relational aggression is associated with serious adjustment problems, including concurrent and future social maladjustment (e.g., problematic friendships; rejection), internalizing problems (e.g., depressive symptoms), and school avoidance. Despite the burgeoning literature focusing on the harmful and damaging nature of relationally aggressive behavior, this research has only recently begun to be used to inform school-based prevention and intervention programming. This article reviews the developmental research related to relational aggression and presents a systematic examination of nine published school-based prevention and intervention programs to prevent relational aggression. Programs reviewed target preschool through eighth-grade students. Strengths and limitations of each program are discussed. Recommendations are offered for future research to develop and validate school-based programming for relational aggression, and implications for school psychologists are discussed.

AB  - A model of awareness based on interoceptive salience is described, which has an endogenous time base that might provide a basis for the human capacity to perceive and estimate time intervals in the range of seconds to subseconds. The model posits that the neural substrate for awareness across time is located in the anterior insular cortex, which fits with recent functional imaging evidence relevant to awareness and time perception. The time base in this model is adaptive and emotional, and thus it offers an explanation for some aspects of the subjective nature of time perception. This model does not describe the mechanism of the time base, but it suggests a possible relationship with interoceptive afferent activity, such as heartbeat-related inputs.

AB  - Traditionally, a great part of the research related to the patient or user experience within clinical contexts, has only been exploring the user experience indirectly-or it has only been exploring some elements or aspects of the overall user experience. The purpose of this review is to investigate which aspects of the user experience are typically explored in the research literature and to shed light on the multifaceted nature of the user experience. We conducted a two-phase review of earlier research, consisting of a brief narrative review and a scoping review, exploring users' experiences with therapeutic health interventions in both indirect and direct ways. Thirty studies, representing several thousands service users, were included in our scoping review. We extracted data related to the different aspects of the user experience covered in the reviewed research through descriptive synthesis. This revealed that a variety of aspects or facets related to the user experience were addressed across the different studies. To further specify these results, we conducted a thematic analysis based on the descriptive data. Through this analysis, we identified five main categories or dimensions relevant to the user experience with therapeutic interventions: 1) Perception of self as patient/user, 2) Perception of the therapist/intervention provider, 3) Perception of the therapeutic relationship/alliance, 4) Perception of the intervention/modality and 5) Perception of contextual factors. Based on this finding, we propose an user experience framework centred around these five domains. For each of the domains within the framework, several subordinate facets are also suggested based on our synthesis and analysis of the reviewed literature as well as clinical relevance. The proposed framework can be used to help understand, evaluate and promote users' experiences with health interventions across user groups, interventions and contexts. Our framework highlights the multifaceted nature of the user experience, and the importance of considering all the different dimensions and facets of this experience in an integrative way both in research designs, health policy development and when implementing and evaluating health interventions in clinical contexts.

AB  - Understanding the cultural commonalities and specificities of facial expressions of emotion remains a central goal of Psychology. However, recent progress has been stayed by dichotomous debates (e.g. nature versus nurture) that have created silos of empirical and theoretical knowledge. Now, an emerging interdisciplinary scientific culture is broadening the focus of research to provide a more unified and refined account of facial expressions within and across cultures. Specifically, data-driven approaches allow a wider, more objective exploration of face movement patterns that provide detailed information ontologies of their cultural commonalities and specificities. Similarly, a wider exploration of the social messages perceived from face movements diversifies knowledge of their functional roles (e.g. the 'fear' face used as a threat display). Together, these new approaches promise to diversify, deepen, and refine knowledge of facial expressions, and deliver the next major milestones for a functional theory of human social communication that is transferable to social robotics.

AB  - Three forced-choice perceptual word identification experiments tested the claim that transitions from positive to negative priming as a function of increasing prime duration are due to cognitive aftereffects. These aftereffects are similar in nature to perceptual aftereffects that produce a negative image due to overexposure and habituation to a stimulus. Each experiment tested critical predictions that come from including habituation in a dynamic neural network with multiple levels of processing. The success of this account in explaining the dynamics of repetition priming, associative-semantic priming, and forward masking effects suggests that habituation is a useful mechanism for reducing source confusion between successively presented stimuli. Implications are considered for visible persistence, repetition blindness, attention-based negative priming, attentional blink, inhibition of return, the negative compatibility effect, affect priming, and flanker preview effects.

AB  - A taxon is a nonarbitrary class whose existence is conjectured as an empirical question, not a mere semantic convenience.  Numerous taxa are known to exist in nature and society (chemical elements, biological species, organic diseases, geological strata, kinds of stars, elementary particles, races, cultures, Mendelizing mental deficiencies, major psychoses, vocations, ideologies, religions).  What personality types, if any, occur in the nonpathological population remains to be researched by sophisticated methods, and cannot be settled by fiat or "dimensional" preference.  The intuitive concept of taxonicity is to be explicated by a combination of formal-numerical and causal criteria.  Taxometric methods should include consistency tests that provide Popperian risk of strong discorroboration.  In social science, latent class methods are probably more useful than cluster algorithms.

In developing the new model, the paper discusses empirical and theoretical limitations inherent to drive and optimal arousal theories of curiosity, and evaluates these models in relation to Litman and Jimerson's (2004) recently developed interest-deprivation (I/D) theory of curiosity. A detailed discussion of the I/D model and its relationship to the neuroscience of wanting and liking is provided, and an integrative I/D/wanting-liking model is proposed, with the aim of clarifying the complex nature of curiosity as an emotional-motivational state, and to shed light on the different ways in which acquiring knowledge can be pleasurable.

TI  - Computational modeling of emotion: explorations through the anatomy and physiology of fear conditioning
AB  - Recent discoveries about the neural system and cellular mechanisms in pathways mediating classical fear conditioning have provided a foundation for pursuing concurrent connectionist models of this form of emotional learning. The models described are constrained by the known anatomy underlying the behavior being simulated. To date, implementations capture salient features of fear learning, both at the level of behavior and at the level of single cells, and additionally make use of generic biophysical constraints to mimic fundamental excitatory and inhibitory transmission properties. Owing to the modular nature of the systems model, biophysical modeling can be carried out in a single region, in this case the amygdala. Future directions include application of the biophysical model to questions about temporal summation in the two sensory input paths to amygdala, and modeling of an attentional interrupt signal that will extend the emotional processing model to interactions with cognitive systems.

This paper provides an overview and assessment of health and place in relation to mental health and the prison locale. Particular attention is devoted to prison culture, both staff and inmate. The incarceration experience (i.e. the nature of enforced residence in the prison environment) can affect negatively prisoners' mental health. The mental health of the prison population is poor, and mental health services in the prison setting have need of further improvement. However, the provision of mental healthcare and the pursuit of good mental health in the prison milieu are challenging. The prison-based exceedingly complex three-way relationship between culture-mental and health-mental healthcare is debated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The start of environmental degradation produces different impacts in quantitative but qualitative ways also. This review will help in understanding the environmental crisis causing a pronounced depletion of species. The technological expansion in the world to meet the expectation of humanity at the cost of natural resources is key factor in disturbing the ecosystem. The awareness about the complete status of wild life and flora in our country is still unknown. Random trapping and hunting of these endangered species is very common round the year. The most important concern is that, the reserves areas constructed for the conservation of nature are under stress resulting in increasing deteriorated conditions.

These emotions and a few others are presumed to have specific causal mechanisms in the brain and properties that are observable (on the face, in the voice, in the body, or in experience)-that is, they are assumed to be natural kinds. If a given emotion is a natural kind and can be identified objectively, then it is possible to make discoveries about that emotion. Indeed, the scientific study of emotion is founded on this assumption. In this article, I review the accumulating empirical evidence that is inconsistent with the view that there are kinds of emotion with boundaries that are carved in nature. I then consider what moving beyond a natural-kind view might mean for the scientific understanding of emotion.

Evidence indicates that drug craving and relapse in humans are often provoked by acute exposure to the self-administered drug, drug-associated cues, or stress. During the last two decades, this clinical scenario has been primarily studied at the preclinical level using the classical reinstatement model. However, a single preclinical model cannot capture the complicated nature of human drug relapse. Therefore, more recently, we and others have developed several other models to study different facets of human drug relapse. In this review, we introduce and discuss recent findings from these other relapse models, including incubation of drug craving, reacquisition and resurgence models, and punishment-based and conflict-based relapse models.

They are quite dynamic organelles in that they fuse, divide and move throughout axons and dendrites. The mechanisms of mitochondrial motility have received much attention, however the significance of the dynamic nature of mitochondria in neurons is unclear. Nonetheless, deficits in mitochondrial trafficking have been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. The role of aberrant mitochondrial trafficking in neuropsychiatric disorders is not as well understood, but may involve similar mechanisms. In this review we examine the evidence which implicates changes in mitochondrial trafficking in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders and hypothesize how defective mitochondrial transport may contribute to disease mechanisms.

Information suggested to an individual about an event can be integrated with the memory of the event itself, so that what actually occurred, and what was discussed later about what may have occurred, become inextricably interwoven, allowing distortion, elaboration, and even total fabrication. In my writings, classes, and public speeches, I've tried to convey one important take-home message: Just because someone tells you something in great detail, with much confidence, and with emotion, it doesn't mean that it is true. Here I describe my professional life as an experimental psychologist, in which I've eavesdropped on this process, as well as many personal experiences that may have influenced my thinking and choices.

Since this functional model was published, a growing body of research has challenged this viewpoint and instead support an interdependence view. In addition, neural models of face processing emphasize differences in terms of the processing of changeable and invariant aspects of faces. This article provides a critical appraisal of this literature and discusses the role of motion in both expression and identity recognition and the intertwined nature of identity, expression and motion processing. We conclude by discussing recent advancements in this area and research questions that still need to be addressed.

Here the alterations of lipid peroxidation in different age and ethnic groups are review. There are many theories to explain the association between lipid peroxidation and basic nature of aging, but there is no exact evidence to explain the biological aging. Theories of aging are multi-factorial process. One of several factors that could be cause of aging process is lipid peroxidation, but inconsistent findings of many researchers have shown that lipid peroxidation may not a main reason of aging.

AB  - Social interactions are essential for mammalian life and are regulated by evolutionary conserved neuronal mechanisms. An individual's internal state, experiences, and the nature of the social stimulus are critical for determining apt responses to social situations. The lateral septum (LS) - a structure of the basal forebrain - integrates abundant cortical and subcortical inputs, and projects to multiple downstream regions to generate appropriate behavioral responses. Although incoming cognitive information is indispensable for contextualizing a social stimulus, neuromodulatory information related to the internal state of the organism significantly influences the behavioral outcome as well. This review article provides an overview of the neuroanatomical properties of the LS, and examines its neurochemical (neuropeptidergic and hormonal) signaling, which provide the neuromodulatory information essential for fine-tuning social behavior across the lifespan.

AB  - Background: Despite evidence from twin and family studies for an important contribution of genetic factors to both childhood and adult onset psychiatric disorders, identifying robustly associated specific DNA variants has proved challenging. In the pregenomics era the genetic architecture (number, frequency and effect size of risk variants) of complex genetic disorders was unknown. Empirical evidence for the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders is emerging from the genetic studies of the last 5 years. Methods and scope: We review the methods investigating the polygenic nature of complex disorders. We provide mini-guides to genomic profile (or polygenic) risk scoring and to estimation of variance (or heritability) from common SNPs; a glossary of key terms is also provided. We review results of applications of the methods to psychiatric disorders and related traits and consider how these methods inform on missing heritability, hidden heritability and still-missing heritability. Findings: Genome-wide genotyping and sequencing studies are providing evidence that psychiatric disorders are truly polygenic, that is they have a genetic architecture of many genetic variants, including risk variants that are both common and rare in the population. Sample sizes published to date are mostly underpowered to detect effect sizes of the magnitude presented by nature, and these effect sizes may be constrained by the biological validity of the diagnostic constructs. Conclusions: Increasing the sample size for genome wide association studies of psychiatric disorders will lead to the identification of more associated genetic variants, as already found for schizophrenia. These loci provide the starting point of functional analyses that might eventually lead to new prevention and treatment options and to improved biological validity of diagnostic constructs. Polygenic analyses will contribute further to our understanding of complex genetic traits as sample sizes increase and as sample resources become richer in phenotypic descriptors, both in terms of clinical symptoms and of nongenetic risk factors.

AB  - Background: Genetic factors are known to contribute to the etiology of bipolar illness, but the actual genetic mechanisms remain to be clarified.
   Methods: This paper reviews the research undertaken to establish the generic basis of bipolar illness and to elucidate the nature of its genetic predisposition.
   Results: The presented findings suggest that bipolar affective disorder is a heterogeneous condition characterized by a complex relationship between the genetic susceptibility and the clinical presentation. Linkage studies have generated promising and replicated findings on chromosomes 18 and 21.
   Conclusion: In spite of the methodological difficulties inherent in the generic study of psychiatric disorders, recent investigations have made important advances and promise to identify specific susceptibility genes.

AB  - Self-regulation is a complex multidimensional construct which has been approached mainly in Western cultural contexts. The present contribution examines the importance of considering the culture-sensitive nature of self-regulation by reviewing theory and research on the development of children's self-regulation in different cultural contexts. This review of theory and research allows to suggest that widely shared values in a cultural group influence parental socialization theories, goals, and practices, which in turn have an impact on how children learn to self-regulate, the forms of self-regulation they develop, and the goals associated with self-regulation. Thus, this article concludes that more specific research is required to relate both the developmental and the cultural aspects of children's self-regulation.

AB  - Brain dynamic changes associated with schizophrenia are largely equivocal, with interpretation complicated by many factors, such as the presence of therapeutic agents and the complex nature of the syndrome itself. Evidence for a brain-wide change in individual network oscillations, shared by all patients, is largely equivocal, but stronger for lower (delta) than for higher (gamma) bands. However, region-specific changes in rhythms across multiple, interdependent, nested frequencies may correlate better with pathology. Changes in synaptic excitation and inhibition in schizophrenia disrupt delta rhythm-mediated cortico-cortical communication, while enhancing thalamocortical communication in this frequency band. The contrasting relationships between delta and higher frequencies in thalamus and cortex generate frequency mismatches in inter-regional connectivity, leading to a disruption in temporal communication between higher-order brain regions associated with mental time travel.

AB  - Recent research suggests that children's heightened susceptibility to parenting may have a (poly) genetic basis, and may be grounded in children's temperament. However, much current evidence is of a preliminary-correlational-nature. Because in correlational designs alternative explanations for gene-environment (G x E) or temperament-environment (T x E) interactions cannot be discounted, it is pivotal to conduct experimental studies in which parenting is actively manipulated. Based on data from a recently conducted randomized trial (n = 387) of the Incredible Years parenting intervention, experimental evidence is provided for G x E and T x E interactions in an at-risk population of children aged 4-8 years. The discussion centers around the use of polygenetic data and microtrial designs, and provides suggestions for how to integrate endophenotypes in tests of G x E and T x E.

AB  - This narrative review examines injuries sustained by soldiers undertaking occupational load carriage tasks. Military soldiers are required to carry increasingly heavier occupational loads. These loads have been found to increase the physiological cost to the soldier and alter their gait mechanics. Aggregated research findings suggest that the lower limbs are the most frequent anatomical site of injury associated with load carriage. While foot blisters are common, other prevalent lower limb injuries include stress fractures, knee and foot pain, and neuropathies, like digitalgia and meralgia. Shoulder neuropathies (brachial plexus palsy) and lower back injuries are not uncommon. Soldier occupational load carriage has the potential to cause injuries that impact on force generation and force sustainment. Through understanding the nature of these injuries targeted interventions, like improved physical conditioning and support to specialised organisations, can be employed.

AB  - The authors examine 6 theories of panic attacks as to whether empirical approaches are capable of falsifying them and their heuristic value. The authors conclude that the catastrophic cognitions theory is least falsifiable because of the elusive nature of thoughts but that it has greatly stimulated research and therapy. The vicious circle theory is falsifiable only if the frightening internal sensations are specified. The 3-alarms theory postulates an indeterminate classification of attacks. Hyperventilation theory has been falsified. The suffocation false alarm theory lacks biological parameters that unambiguously index dyspnea or its distinction between anticipatory and panic anxiety. Some correspondences postulated between clinical phenomena and brain areas by the neuroanatomical hypothesis may be falsifiable if panic does not depend on specific thoughts. All these theories have heuristic value, and their unfalsifiable aspects are capable of modification.

AB  - Rapid human population growth and its consequences of food shortage become a significant concern in recent decades across the world. The untold reasons behind this food shortage were industrialization, urbanization, modern civilization, etc., where the agricultural land has been deployed. With the decreasing farmland and its cultivation, food productivity declined drastically and failed to serve the world's vast human population. The present challenge is to increase productivity with the least agricultural land. Thus, excessive chemical fertilizer has been used to quickly turn out more outstanding food production, leading to more significant damages to soil ecosystem and human health. Henceforth, bio-fertilizers find the best alternatives to chemical fertilizers. This study focuses on complete nature of plant growth Promoting rhizobacteria, which is used in bio fertilizers for sustainable agricultural productivity and everlasting soil fertility. The characteristics of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and its role in plant growth and formulation of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria biofertilizers have been revealed through intensive literature. The consortium information collected from various literatures brings the unique findings that plant growth promoting rhizobacteria is the natural boon to the global agriculturist. This study discusses plant growth promoting rhizobacteria bacterial strains' role in protecting the soil from various biotic and abiotic stresses, regulating plant growth and its role in producing biofertilizers. Besides, it is transformed into commercial products. Eventually, the future trends and research in plant growth promoting rhizobacteria bio inoculants that promote sustainable agriculture have been elucidated. The microorganism is the bio fertilizer's main ingredients, promoting the soil nutrients for efficient plant growth and increasing food productivity. Although many microorganisms efficiently contribute to the soil nutrients, this review narrows down to the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria study. Beneficial bacterium plays a vital role in nutrient mineralization and productivity among the various microorganisms. Bio fertilizers containing beneficial bacteria were economically viable and readily available in nature. This review reveals the complete essence of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and its part in bio fertilizers. (C) 2021 GJESM. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several lines of evidence indicate that schizophrenia has a strong genetic component. But the exact nature and functional role of this genetic component in the pathophysiology of this mental illness remains a mystery. Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) are a recently discovered family of molecules that regulate gene transcription through a variety of means. Consequently, IncRNAs could help us bring together apparent unrelated findings in schizophrenia; namely, genomic deficiencies on one side and neuroimaging, as well as postmortem results on the other. In fact, the most consistent finding in schizophrenia is decreased brain size together with enlarged ventricles. This anomaly appears to originate from shorter and less ramified dendrites and axons. But a decrease in neuronal arborizations cannot explain the complex pathophysiology of this psychotic disorder; however, dynamic changes in neuronal structure present throughout life could. It is well recognized that the structure of developing neurons is extremely plastic. This structural plasticity was thought to stop with brain development. However, breakthrough discoveries have shown that neuronal structure retains some degree of plasticity throughout life. What the neuroscientific field is still trying to understand is how these dynamic changes are regulated and IncRNAs represent promising candidates to fill this knowledge gap. Here, we present evidence that associates specific IncRNAs with schizophrenia. We then discuss the potential role of IncRNAs in neurostructural dynamics. Finally, we explain how dynamic neurostructural modifications present throughout life could, in theory, reconcile apparent unrelated findings in schizophrenia.

AB  - Multi-recording techniques show evidence that neurons coordinate their firing forming ensembles and that brain networks are made by connections between ensembles. While "canonical" microcircuits are composed of interconnected principal neurons and interneurons, it is not clear how they participate in recorded neuronal ensembles: "groups of neurons that show spatiotemporal co-activation". Understanding synapses and their plasticity has become complex, making hard to consider all details to fill the gap between cellular-synaptic and circuit levels. Therefore, two assumptions became necessary: First, whatever the nature of the synapses these may be simplified by "functional connections". Second, whatever the mechanisms to achieve synaptic potentiation or depression, the resultant synaptic weights are relatively stable. Both assumptions have experimental basis cited in this review, and tools to analyze neuronal populations are being developed based on them. Microcircuitry processing followed with multi-recording techniques show temporal sequences of neuronal ensembles resembling computational routines. These sequences can be aligned with the steps of behavioral tasks and behavior can be modified upon their manipulation, supporting the hypothesis that they are memory traces. In vitro, recordings show that these temporal sequences can be contained in isolated tissue of histological scale. Sequences found in control conditions differ from those recorded in pathological tissue obtained from animal disease models and those recorded after the actions of clinically useful drugs to treat disease states, setting the basis for new bioassays to test drugs with potential clinical use. These findings make the neuronal ensembles theoretical framework a dynamic neuroscience paradigm.

AB  - Ongoing environmental changes are affecting physical, chemical and biological soil components. Evidence of impacts of soil changes on pollinators' and seed dispersers' behaviour, fitness and density is scarce, but growing. Here, we reviewed information on such impacts and on a number of mechanisms that may explain its propagation, taking into account the full range of resources required by the large and diverse number of species of these two important functional groups. We show that while there is substantial evidence on the effects of soil nitrogen enrichment and changes in soil water content on the quality and quantity of floral and fruit resources, little is known on the effects of changes of other soil properties (e.g. soil pH, soil structure, other nutrients). Also, the few studies showing correlations between soil changes and pollinator and seed disperser foraging behaviour or fitness do not clearly identify the mechanisms that explain such correlation. Finally, most studies (including those with nitrogen and water) are local and limited to a small number of species, and it remains unclear how variable such effects are across time and geographical regions, and the strength of interactive effects between soil properties. Increasing research on this topic, taking into consideration how impacts propagate through species interaction networks, will provide essential information to predict impacts of ongoing environmental changes and help guide conservation plans that aim to minimize impacts on ecosystem functioning.

AB  - A growing number of studies have been addressing the relationship between theory of mind (TOM) and executive functions (EF) in patients with acquired neurological pathology. In order to provide a global overview on the main findings, we conducted a systematic review on group studies where we aimed to (1) evaluate the patterns of impaired and preserved abilities of both TOM and EF in groups of patients with acquired neurological pathology and (2) investigate the existence of particular relations between different EF domains and TOM tasks. The search was conducted in Pubmed/Medline. A total of 24 articles met the inclusion criteria. We considered for analysis classical clinically accepted TOM tasks (first- and second-order false belief stories, the Faux Pas test, Happe's stories, the Mind in the Eyes task, and Cartoon's tasks) and EF domains (updating, shifting, inhibition, and access). The review suggests that (1) EF and TOM appear tightly associated. However, the few dissociations observed suggest they cannot be reduced to a single function; (2) no executive subprocess could be specifically associated with TOM performances; (3) the first-order false belief task and the Happe's story task seem to be less sensitive to neurological pathologies and less associated to EF. Even though the analysis of the reviewed studies demonstrates a close relationship between TOM and EF in patients with acquired neurological pathology, the nature of this relationship must be further investigated. Studies investigating ecological consequences of TOM and EF deficits, and intervention researches may bring further contributions to this question.

AB  - Primordial emotions are the subjective element of the instincts which are the genetically programmed behaviour patterns which contrive homeostasis. They include thirst, hunger for air, hunger for food, pain and hunger for specific minerals etc. There are two constituents of a primordial emotion-the specific sensation which when severe may be imperious, and the compelling intention for gratification by a consummatory act. They may dominate the stream of consciousness, and can have plenipotentiary power over behaviour.
   It is hypothesized that early in animal evolution complex reflex mechanisms in the basal brain subserving homeostatic responses, in concert with elements of the reticular activating system subserving arousal, melded functionally with regions embodied in the progressive rostral development of the telencephalon. This included the emergent limbic and paralimbic areas, and the insula. This phylogenetically ancient organization subserved the origin of consciousness as the primordial emotion, which signalled that the organisms existence was immediately threatened. Neuroimaging confirms major activations in regions of the basal brain during primordial emotions in humans. The behaviour of decorticate humans and animals is discussed in relation to the possible existence of primitive awareness.
   Neuroimaging of the primordial emotions reveals that rapid gratification of intention by a consummatory act such as ingestion causes precipitate decline of both the initiating sensation and the intention. There is contemporaneous rapid disappearance of particular regions of brain activation which suggests they may be part of the jointly sufficient and severally necessary activations and deactivations which correlate with consciousness [Crick, F. & Koch. C. (2003). A framework for consciousness. Nature Neuroscience, 6, 119-126]. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Academic Abstract In the present review, we propose a theory that seeks to recontextualize various existing theories as functions of people's perceptions of their consistency with those around them. This theory posits that people seek social consistency for both epistemic and relational needs and that social inconsistency is both negative and aversive, similar to the experience of cognitive dissonance. We further posit that the aversive nature of perceiving social inconsistency leads people to engage in various behaviors to mitigate or avoid these inconsistencies. When these behaviors fail, however, people experience chronic social inconsistency, which, much like chronic rejection, is associated with physical and mental health and well-being outcomes. Finally, we describe how mitigation and avoidance of social inconsistency underlie many seemingly unrelated theories, and we provide directions for how future research may expand on this theory. Public Abstract In the present review, we propose that people find inconsistency with those around them to be an unpleasant experience, as it threatens people's core need to belong. Because the threat of reduced belongingness evokes negative feelings, people are motivated to avoid inconsistency with others and to mitigate the negative feelings that are produced when it inevitably does arise. We outline several types of behaviors that can be implemented to avoid or mitigate these inconsistencies (e.g., validation, affirmation, distancing, etc.). When these behaviors cannot be implemented successfully, people experience chronic invalidation, which is associated with reduced physical and mental health and well-being outcomes. We discuss how invalidation may disproportionately affect individuals with minoritized identities. Furthermore, we discuss how belongingness could play a key role in radicalization into extremist groups.

AB  - Second language (L2) aptitude has been broadly defined as the rate and ease of initially acquiring a second language. Historically, L2 aptitude has been understood as a stable trait that predetermined L2 achievement, regardless of individual learners' efforts to acquire an L2. This traditional view of L2 aptitude as fixed and stable has led to it being a relatively neglected area of research within second language acquisition (SLA) studies. The little research that was in fact conducted was diagnostic in nature, and mostly used tests such as the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT) to select potentially gifted L2 learners. Given that six decades have passed since the publication of the MLAT, now is a good time to revisit the literature and investigate whether L2 aptitude continues to be viewed as an individual difference of little interest to SLA research. While summative literature reviews of L2 aptitude research have been written, few systematic reviews exist. This article conducts a systematic quantitative literature review (SQLR) to provide a principled, comprehensive and reproducible synthesis of research into L2 aptitude published over the last 60 years (1959-2019). In this SQLR, close to one hundred journal articles and PhD dissertations were examined to discern generalisations and limitations in the field. This SQLR identifies a shift in the rationale for L2 aptitude testing, in which a diagnostic focus has been replaced by an explanatory perspective. Furthermore, our article points to a renewed interest in L2 aptitude research, which has come to be characterised by a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the concept and its components.

AB  - Background: First described in 1955, night eating syndrome refers to an abnormal eating behavior clinically defined by the presence of evening hyperphagia (>25% of daily caloric intake) and/or nocturnal awaking with food ingestion occurring > 2 times per week. Aims: Although the syndrome is frequently comorbid with obesity, metabolic and psychiatric disorders, its etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, assessment and treatment still remain not fully understood. Methods: This review was conducted according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines; PubMed database was searched until 31 October 2020, using the key terms: 'Night Eating Syndrome' AND 'complications' OR 'diagnosis' OR 'drug therapy' OR 'epidemiology' OR 'etiology' OR 'physiology' OR 'physiopathology' OR 'psychology' OR 'therapy'. Results: From a total of 239 citations, 120 studies assessing night eating syndrome met the inclusion criteria to be included in the review. Conclusion: The inclusion of night eating syndrome into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 'Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders' category should drive the attention of clinician and researchers toward this syndrome that is still defined by evolving diagnostic criteria. The correct identification and assessment of NES could facilitate the detection and the diagnosis of this disorder, whose bio-psycho-social roots support its multifactorial nature. The significant rates of comorbid illnesses associated with NES and the overlapping symptoms with other eating disorders require a focused clinical attention. Treatment options for night eating syndrome include both pharmacological (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate and melatonergic drugs) and non-pharmachological approaches; the combination of such strategies within a multidisciplinary approach should be addressed in future, well-sized and long-term studies.

AB  - The ability of clinical trials to inform the care of chronic pain may be limited if only an unrepresentative subset of patients are allowed to enroll. We summarize and report new insights on published studies that report on how trial exclusions affect the generalizability of their results. We conducted a PubMed search on the following terms: (("eligibility criteria" AND generalizability) OR ("exclusion criteria" AND generalizability) OR "exclusion criteria"[ti] OR "eligibility criteria"[ti]) AND pain. We only considered studies relevant if they analyzed data on (1) the prevalence and nature of exclusion criteria or (2) the impact of exclusion criteria on sample representativeness or study results. The 4 articles that were identified reported differences in patients who were included and excluded in different clinical trials: excluded patients were older, less likely to have a paid job, had more functional limitations at baseline, and used strong opioids more often. The clinical significance of these differences remains unclear. The pain medicine literature has very few published studies on the prevalence and impact of exclusion criteria, and the outcomes of excluded patients are rarely tracked. The frequent use of psychosocial exclusions is especially compromising to generalizability because chronic pain commonly co-occurs with psychiatric comorbidities. Inclusion of more representative patients in research samples can reduce recruitment barriers and broaden the generalizability of findings in patients with chronic pain. We also call for more studies that examine the use of exclusion criteria in chronic pain trials to better understand their implications.

AB  - Recent FindingsIn the last decades, many neuroimaging studies have investigated the brain structural deficits associated with the pathophysiology of Bipolar Disorder (BD). Notably, the available literature identified the presence of selective brain structural abnormalities, in terms of both gray matter (GM) and white matter, known to be involved in emotion regulation and processing. Nonetheless, the complex and heterogeneous nature of BD has not yet allowed the identification of a clear biological signature of this disorder.Purpose of ReviewIn this context, this review aims to a) briefly summarize the evidence from structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies on BD in order to provide a clearer picture of the neural circuits involved in this disabling mental illness, and b) describe some critical clinical issues that need to be taken into account when studying BD, especially the history of psychosis and the link between BD and behavioral variant fronto-temporal dementia (bvFTD).SummaryEvidence from structural MRI studies on BD suggests ventricular, prefrontal and temporal abnormalities but remain largely inconsistent, possibly reflecting the disorder complexity. Moreover, the reviewed evidence showed that psychotic BD might represent a subtype of the disorder with specific and enhanced alterations of GM morphology. Finally, from the available MRI evidence exploring the relationship between BD and bvFTD emerged the need of a differential identification of biological markers to enable the early and accurate detection of the two disorders, ultimately guaranteeing a better prognosis and the employment of more targeted and effective treatments.

AB  - Background: The assumption that biodiversity and ecosystem services can help in efforts to tackle poverty is implicit in international targets set for biodiversity conservation (by the Convention on Biological Diversity) and for poverty reduction (enshrined in the Millennium Development Goals). The 2010 United Nations General Assembly further stressed the linkage, claiming: "preserving biodiversity is inseparable from the fight against poverty." Nevertheless the evidence-base on biodiversity - poverty links is not as robust as one might assume. Studies in the academic and "grey" literature have used diverse methods and metrics, different components of biodiversity and dimensions of poverty have been studied, and the scale of impact has rarely been assessed.
   Methods/Design: This systematic map protocol sets out the proposed methodology for exploring the primary question: Which components or attributes of biodiversity affect (positively or negatively) which dimensions of poverty? The overall aim of our review is to unpack the broad claims and assumptions that are made about biodiversity-poverty links such as those above, and provide researchers, policy-makers and practitioners with a methodical overview of the type and quantity of evidence. The online databases SCOPUS and Web of Science will be searched for relevant peer-reviewed literature using search terms and Boolean search operators. Relevant grey literature will be identified through the membership and resources of the Poverty and Conservation Learning Group. The literature searches will be followed by a title and abstract level search using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data will be extracted from the final list of papers using a questionnaire established through literature review and an expert workshop. A report and online database will be produced based on the results of the review.

AB  - Dopamine (DA)-serotonin interactions dealing with learning and memory functions have been apparent from experimental approaches over the past decade. However, since the former evidence showing that these cerebral neurotransmitter systems are involved in the regulation of the same cognitive processes, few experimental studies have been done to further clarify the nature of DA-serotonin interactions for cognitive processes sharing common brain structures. Nevertheless, a regulatory role of 5-HT/DA interactions in cognition and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the striatum as a neuroanatomical substrate for these DA/5-HT interactions, are now recognized. Experimental evidence indicates that pharmacological disruption of serotonin neurotransmission results in a facilitative effect on the processing of mnemonic information by cerebral regions under strong, functional DA modulation, such as the striatum and the PFC; on the other hand, increased serotonin neurotransmission appears to have a detrimental effect on cognitive functions integrated in these structures. These effects seem to occur through the interaction of different pre- and postsynaptic DA and serotonin receptor subtypes acting as opposite systems underlying cognitive abilities. Some studies, focused on DA-serotonin interactions underlying the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric diseases, which evolve with cognitive dysfunctions in human beings, have shown that drugs that are able to modify DA or serotonin neurotransmission may exert beneficial effects on cognitive functions, even though improvement of motor, mood and behavioural disturbances are the main objectives of pharmacological treatment of these diseases. The complete significance of DA-serotonin interactions in cognitive functions could be addressed by future experimental and clinical studies.

AB  - Much of the research on episodic memory in schizophrenia spectrum disorders has focused on memory deficits and how they relate to clinical measures such as outcome. Memory bias refers to the modulatory influence that state or trait psychopathology may exert on memory performance for specific categories of stimuli, often emotional in nature. For example, subjects suffering from depression frequently have better memory for negative stimuli than for neutral or positive ones. This dimension of memory function has received only scant attention in schizophrenia research but could provide fresh new insights into the relation between symptoms and neurocognition.
   This paper reviews the studies that have explored memory biases in individuals with schizophrenia. With respect to positive symptoms, we examine studies that have explored the link between persecutory delusions and memory bias for threatening information and between psychosis and a memory bias toward external source memory. Although relatively few studies have examined negative symptoms, we also review preliminary evidence indicating that flat affect and anhedonia may lead to some specific emotional memory biases. Finally, we present recent findings from our group delineating the relation between emotional valence for faces and memory bias toward novelty and familiarity, both in schizophrenia patients and in healthy control subjects.
   A better understanding of the biasing effects of psychopathology on memory in schizophrenia (but also on other cognitive functions, such as attention, attribution, and so forth) may provide a stronger association between positive and negative symptoms and memory function. Memory measures sensitive to such biases may turn out to be stronger predictors of clinical and functional outcome.

AB  - BackgroundHealth-related behaviors may change after retirement and induce changes in the mental health. This systematic review aimed to investigate the nature of changes in physical activity and leisure activities, as well as the relationship between physical activity, leisure, and psychological adjustment among retirees.MethodsSearch of papers was done in three electronic databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus without constraints on time, geographical regions, or languages in February 2022. The papers that had examined the relationship between physical activity and adjustment among retirees using observational design (cross-sectional or longitudinal) were included in the present study. To evaluate the methodological quality of cross-sectional studies, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist, and for longitudinal studies, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were used.ResultsThe search results identified 1458 records. Twenty-six papers were included in this review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The findings of most of these studies indicated a significant positive correlation between physical activity, leisure, and psychological adjustment in retirees. Retirees were mostly engaged in passive leisure activities such as reading, watching TV and movies, and less engaged in physical activities, sport, or physical exercise. General organized assessment of the total physical activity among retirees was not possible.ConclusionsBased on the study findings, it can be stated that there is a positive correlation between physical activity, leisure, and the retirees' adjustment. Usage of the same and valid measurement method specific to old age and retirement period can be useful in more precise assessment of physical activity and its association with adjustment among retirees.

AB  - The practices surrounding police training of complex motor skills, including the use of force, varies greatly around the world, and even over the course of an officer's career. As the nature of policing changes with society and the advancement of science and technology, so should the training practices that officers undertake at both central (i.e., police academy basic recruit training) and local (i.e., individual agency or precinct) levels. The following review is intended to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and applied practice to inform best practices for training complex motor skills that are unique and critical to law enforcement, including the use of lethal force. We begin by providing a basic understanding of the fundamental cognitive processes underlying motor learning, from novel skill acquisition to complex behaviors including situational awareness, and decision-making that precede and inform action. Motor learning, memory, and perception are then discussed within the context of occupationally relevant stress, with a review of evidence-based training practices that promote officer performance and physiological responses to stress during high-stakes encounters. A lack of applied research identifying the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying motor learning in police is inferred from a review of evidence from various clinical populations suffering from disorders of cognitive and motor systems, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and stroke. We conclude this review by identifying practical, organizational, and systemic challenges to implementing evidence-based practices in policing and provide recommendations for best practices that will promote training effectiveness and occupational safety of end-users (i.e., police trainers and officers).

AB  - Suicidality is a common and concerning issue across development, and there is a plethora of research on this topic among typically developing children and youth. Very little is known, however, about the nature of suicidality among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The purpose of the current study was to undertake a systematic literature review to assess the current state of the research literature to examine the prevalence of suicidality among individuals with ASD, related demographic and clinical profiles, and associated risk and protective factors. A literature search using key terms related to suicidality and ASD yielded 10 topical studies that were evaluated for the study objectives. Suicidality was present in 10.9-50% of the ASD samples identified in the systematic review. Further, several large-scale studies found that individuals with ASD comprised 7.3-15% of suicidal populations, a substantial subgroup. Risk factors were identified and included peer victimization, behavioral problems, being Black or Hispanic, being male, lower socioeconomic status, and lower level of education. Only one study reported on protective factors, and this is identified as a significant gap in the literature. Several methodological weaknesses were present in the current literature, such as lack of appropriate comparison groups and little to no use of empirically validated measures for ASD diagnosis and suicide assessment. Additional research is necessary to understand better how this unique population experiences and expresses suicidal tendencies. Recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Purpose Homosexuality is a clear risk factor for disordered eating in men; however, for women, research has yielded contradictory results. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association between sexual orientation and disordered eating in women. Methods PRISMA guidelines were used. Studies comparing disordered eating between lesbians and heterosexual women were identified using PsycNet database and Google Scholar. Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. Overall disordered eating, restricting, binging and purging were examined for heterosexual, lesbian, bisexual and 'mostly heterosexual' women. Results Whereas there was no significant difference in overall disordered eating between lesbians and heterosexual women, lesbians reported restricting less and binging more than heterosexual women. Bisexual women were more likely than lesbian women to restrict food intake and purge, and more likely than heterosexual women to have overall disordered eating and restrict food intake. "Mostly heterosexual" women were more likely than heterosexual women to restrict food intake, binge and purge. Conclusions Women of different sexual orientations show distinct patterns of disordered eating. Bisexual and "mostly heterosexual" women appear to be particularly at risk. Stress resulting from binegativity and rigid views of sexuality in a dichotomous society, rather than sexual orientation itself, may be associated with disordered eating in women. Findings should be viewed with caution because there were few studies with bisexual and "mostly heterosexual" women. This study elucidates the nature of the association between disordered eating and sexual orientation. Findings provide a possible explanation for previous inconsistencies, since opposing trends for different behaviors cancel each other out.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a leading cause of worldwide disability among mood disorders. Pathological mechanisms are still vastly unclear, and current treatments with conventional medications are often unsatisfactory in maintaining symptoms control and an adequate quality of life. Consequently, current research is focusing on shedding new light on disease pathogenesis, to improve therapeutic effectiveness. Recent evidence has suggested a prominent role of inflammation in mood disorders. Elevated levels of peripheral proinflammatory mediators have been reported in BD, as well as in other mood disorders, and people with systemic autoimmune diseases have an increased risk of developing BD. These immunological alterations are stable, and current medications are unable to alter peripheral concentrations even when clinical improvement is evident. These findings have also been replicated in the central nervous system (CNS) milieu, whereas genetic studies have shown that these immune alterations are not due to the disorder itself, being detectable before the illness onset. Moreover, these inflammatory modifications seem to be affected by and linked to other biomarkers of the disorder, such as alterations of white matter (WM) microstructure, metabolism, kynurenine pathway, and circadian rhythmicity. Finally, these immune variations seem to be useful as predictors of therapeutic responsiveness to medications, and in discriminating between clinically different outcomes. The objective of this review is to summarize available evidence on the connection between inflammation and BD, focusing on peripheral inflammatory markers and recent findings on their connection with other typical features of BD, to outline a general overview of the disorder. Moreover, it is meant to analyze the issues with data gathering and interpretation, given the partially contradictory and inconsistent nature of results.

AB  - Purpose Higher rates of psychosis have been reported in minority groups. Since individuals belonging to such groups are vulnerable to the experiences of discrimination, and in line with models proposing that social and life adversity may play a causal role in development and maintenance of psychotic experiences, it has been proposed that perceived discrimination may represent an important determinant of psychotic experiences. This paper reviews the literature examining the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychosis, examining whether discrimination is associated with an increased risk of psychosis, the severity of psychotic symptoms and whether there is an association with specific psychotic symptoms. Methods A systematic database search of PsycINFO, Embase and PubMed was conducted to identify quantitative cross-sectional and prospective studies that examined the association between discrimination and psychosis. Results Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, four of which used prospective designs and twenty used cross-sectional designs. The main findings indicated that discrimination may be associated with an increased risk of psychosis (too few studies to determine whether discrimination is associated with severity). Some studies found associations between discrimination and positive psychotic experiences and/or specific psychotic experiences such as paranoia. A small number of studies found that greater exposure to discrimination was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting psychotic experiences, tentatively indicating a dose-response relationship. Conclusions This review indicates that discrimination plays an important role in the experience of psychosis; however, future research is required to clarify the nature of this relationship. Avenues for further research and clinical implications are proposed.

KW  - neuroeconomics
AB  - In many studies of the interaction between cognitive control and emotion, the orbitofrontal cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mOFC/vmPFC) has been associated with an inhibitory function on limbic areas activated by emotionally arousing stimuli, such as the amygdala. This has led to the hypothesis of an inhibitory or regulatory role of mOFC/vmPFC. In studies of cognition and executive function, however, this area is deactivated by focused effort, raising the issue of the nature of the putative regulatory process associated with mOFC/vmPFC. This issue is here revisited in light of findings in the neuroeconomics field demonstrating the importance of mOFC/vmPFC to encoding the subjective value of stimuli or their economic utility. Many studies show that mOFC/vmPFC activity may affect response by activating personal preferences, instead of resorting to effortful control mechanisms typically associated with emotion regulation. Based on these findings, I argue that a simple automatic/controlled dichotomy is insufficient to describe the data on emotion and control of response adequately. Instead, I argue that the notion of subjective value from neuroeconomics studies and the notion of attentional orienting may play key roles in integrating emotion and cognition. mOFC/vmPFC may work together with the inferior parietal lobe, the cortical region associated with attentional orienting, to convey information about motivational priorities and facilitate processing of inputs that are behaviorally relevant. I also suggest that the dominant mode of function of this ventral network may be a distinct type of process with intermediate properties between the automatic and the controlled, and which may co-operate with effortful control processes in order to steer response.

AB  - Increasing periods of survival in cancer led to an increase in observations of psychological problems in patients and their relatives, causing an increase in studies addressing the psychological effects of cancer and subsequent cure. Children with cancer may experience medical procedures as traumatic, and their caretakers/medical staff as perpetrators. Their parents have been found to report higher rates of trauma-related symptomatology. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to provide a critical review of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) in parents of survivors of pediatric cancer and to compare the results with those reported from Turkey and Israel. PubMed search engine was used for the literature search and the results were reviewed. As a consequence of this search, it was observed that the prevalence of PTSS in parents varied between 12.0% and 80.0% while the prevalence of current PTSD in parents varied between 6.2% and 34.6%. Most of the studies assessing PTSS/PTSD in pediatric cancer survivors and their parents had small and heterogeneous samples and that most are cross-sectional in nature. Mothers may be especially affected. Educational status, living conditions and past-traumas may be important in samples from Turkey and Israel. Further studies are required to evaluate the relationship among various family members for PTSD/PTSS as well as to determine the prevalence and predictors of parental symptoms.

AB  - Background: A key challenge in studies that model outcomes, disease progression, and cost-effectiveness of existing and emerging dementia treatments is the lack of conversion criteria to translate, or 'crosswalk', scores on multiple measurement scales. Clinical status in dementia is commonly characterized in the cognitive, functional, and behavioral domains.
   Objective: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed dementia measure crosswalks in the three domains.
   Methods: We systematically reviewed published literature for crosswalks between scales used to measure cognitive, functional, or behavioral outcomes in Alzheimer's and related dementias. The search was conducted in PubMed, and additional crosswalks were identified through snowballing and expert input from dementia modelers.
   Results: Of the reviewed articles, 2,334 were identified through a PubMed search, 842 articles were sourced from backward and forward citation snowballing, and 8 additional articles were recommended through expert input. 31 papers were eligible for inclusion, listing 74 unique crosswalks. Of those, 62 (83.8%) were between endpoints of the cognitive domain and 12 (16.2%) were either between endpoints of the functional domain or were hybrid in nature. Among crosswalks exclusively in the cognitive domain, a majority involved the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (37 crosswalks) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and its variants (25 crosswalks). MMSE was directly compared to MoCA or MoCA variants in 16 crosswalks.
   Conclusion: Existing crosswalks between measures of dementia focus largely on a limited selection of outcome measures, particularly MMSE and MoCA. Few crosswalks exist in the functional domain, and no crosswalks were identified for solely behavioral measures.

AB  - Background: There is evidence in the literature that adverse early attachment experiences and subsequent attachment insecurities during adulthood would lead to pessimism, low self-esteem, hopelessness and, ultimately, to suicide risk.
   Subjects and methods: This paper aims to review finding on the link between attachment style and suicidality. We searched the literature using the database of the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)-MedLine/Pubmed system from January 1992 until December 2016. We started with 1992 because, as far as we know, there are no published studies exploring the relationship between suicide and insecure attachment before that year. We considered reports published on the relationship between attachment style and suicidality. We applied several combinations of the following search terms: attachment, adult attachment style and suicidality, suicide, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior or suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts. We selected only English language studies.
   Results: Research suggests that insecure attachment style, mostly anxious, and unresolved traumas are associated with an increased suicide risk. Few studies prospectively examined clinical course, comorbid psychiatric disorders, familial suicidality or other psychosocial factors.
   Conclusions: Further research is needed to highlight the nature of the link between attachment and suicidality. The presence of suicidal ideation and attempts might be a consequence of an underlying interaction between the emergence of psychiatrics symptoms, and the long-lasting presence of inadequate patterns of attachment. Within this context, Separation Anxiety Disorder, categorized in the DSM-5 as a condition not confined to childhood but as an anxiety disorder that may occur through the entire lifespan, might be the a key for the comprehension of this link. From a neurobiological point of view, the role of oxytocin remains unclear.

   Search Process. Using hey words in a literature-searching program, a comprehensive search was conducted on the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, HealthSTAR, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, SciSearch, EPIC, and ABI Inform.
   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. All data-based studies that appeared in peer reviewed journals in the English language. Theses, dissertations, or presentation abstracts that were not published in peer reviewed journals were excluded. The initial search identified 196 studies, but only 72 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.
   Data Extraction Methods. Summary tables were created that include design classification, subject size, results, and other hey information for each study.
   Data Synthesis. Both the nature of the findings and the overall quality of the literature were evaluated in an attempt to answer two questions: Do individuals or populations with high health risks have worse financial outcomes than individuals or populations with lore health risks? Do health promotion programs improve financial outcomes?
   Major Conclusions. There are good correlational data to suggest that high levels of stress, excessive body weight, and multiple risk factors are associated with increased health care costs and illness-related absenteeism. The associations between seat belt use, cholesterol, diet, hypertension, and alcohol abuse and absenteeism and health care expenditures are either mixed or unknown. Health promotion programs are associated with lower levels of absenteeism and health care costs, and fitness programs are associated with reduced health care costs.

KW  - loneliness
KW  - MINI-MENTAL-STATE
KW  - RISK
AB  - Background: Loneliness has been highlighted as a risk factor for dementia. However, the nature of the relationship between loneliness and cognitive function prior to onset of dementia is unclear.
   Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the relationship between loneliness and cognitive function in samples screened for dementia at study commencement.
   Methods: Five electronic databases (PubMed, PsycNET, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, Scopus) were searched from inception to August 31, 2021. A narrative review and random-effects meta-analysis were conducted on studies meeting search criteria. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020155539.
   Results: The sixteen studies that met inclusion criteria involved 30,267 individuals, with mean age ranging from 63.0 to 84.9 years. Studies varied in dementia screening criteria, measurement of loneliness and cognitive function, and statistical modeling approach. The narrative review indicated that loneliness was associated with poorer global cognition, episodic memory, working memory, visuospatial function, processing speed, and semantic verbal fluency. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that loneliness was negatively associated with global cognitive function (overall r = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.14, -0.02; n = 6). Due to lack of sufficient data and heterogeneity between studies, we were unable to explore associations with other cognitive domains or longitudinal associations.
   Conclusion: Loneliness is associated with subtle impairment across multiple cognitive domains in older adults who were screened for dementia. Better characterization of this relationship will provide important information about how loneliness contributes to the clinical and pathological sequalae of AD and be informative for risk reduction and early detection strategies.

AB  - Learning Objectives: After participating in this educational activity, the physician should be better able to
   1. Evaluate the relationship between reward processes, stress, and depression.
   2. Assess the characteristics of the three etiological models of stress and reward processes.
   3. Identify the biological basis for stress and reward processes.
   Adolescence is a peak period for the onset of depression, and it is also a time marked by substantial stress as well as neural development within the brain reward circuitry. In this review, we provide a selective overview of current animal and human research investigating the relationship among reward processes, stress, and depression. Three separate, but related, etiological models examine the differential roles that stress may play in relation to reward dysfunction and adolescent depression. First, the reward mediation model suggests that both acute and chronic stress contribute to reward deficits, which, in turn, potentiate depressive symptoms or increase the risk for depression. Second, in line with the stress generation perspective, it is plausible that premorbid reward-related dysfunction generates stress-in particular, interpersonal stress-which then leads to the manifestation of depressive symptoms. Third, consistent with a diathesis-stress model, the interaction between stress and premorbid reward dysfunction may contribute to the onset of depression. Given the equifinal nature of depression, these models could shed important light on different etiological pathways during adolescence, particularly as they may relate to understanding the heterogeneity of depression. To highlight the translational potential of these insights, a hypothetical case study is provided as a means of demonstrating the importance of targeting reward dysfunction in both assessment and treatment of adolescent depression.

AB  - Emerging evidence indicates that heat shock proteins (HSPs) are critical regulators in normal neural physiological function as well as in cell stress responses. The functions of HSPs represent an enormous and diverse range of cellular activities, far beyond the originally identified roles in protein folding and chaperoning. HSPs are now understood to be involved in processes such as synaptic transmission, autophagy, ER stress response, protein kinase and cell death signaling. In addition, manipulation of HSPs has robust effects on the fate of cells in neurological injury and disease states. The ongoing exploration of multiple HSP superfamilies has underscored the pluripotent nature of HSPs in the cellular context, and has demanded the recent revamping of the nomenclature referring to these families to reflect a re-organization based on structure and function. In keeping with this re-organization, we first discuss the HSP superfamilies in terms of protein structure, regulation, expression and distribution in the brain. We then explore major cellular functions of HSPs that are relevant to neural physiological states, and from there we discuss known and proposed HSP impacts on major neurological disease states. This review article presents a three-part discussion on the array of HSP families relevant to neuronal tissue, their cellular functions, and the exploration of therapeutic targets of these proteins in the context of neurological diseases.

AB  - Mitochondria are unique cell organelles, which exhibit multifactorial roles in numerous cell physiological processes, significantly preserving the integrity of neural synaptic interconnections, mediating ATP production, and regulating apoptotic signaling pathways and calcium homeostasis. Multiple neurological disorders occur as a consequence of impaired mitochondrial functioning, with greater sensitivity of dopaminergic (DA) neurons to mitochondrial dysfunction, due to oxidative nature and low mitochondrial mass, thus supporting the contribution of mitochondrial impairment in Parkinson's disorder (neuronal damage due to curbed dopamine levels). The pathophysiology of the second most common disorder, PD, is potentiated by various mitochondrial homeostasis regulating genes, as discussed in the review. The PD symptoms are known to be aggravated by multiple mitochondria-linked alterations, like reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, Ca2+ buffering, imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics (fission, fusion, mitophagy), biogenetic dysfunctions, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), protein aggregation, neurotoxins, and genetic mutations, which manifest the central involvement of unhealthy mitochondria in neurodegeneration, resulting in retarded DA neurons in region of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), causing PD. Furthermore, the review tends to target altered mitochondrial components, like oxidative stress, inflammation, biogenetic alterations, impaired dynamics, uncontrolled homeostasis, and genetic mutations, to provide a sustainable and reliable alternative in PD therapeutics and to overcome the pitfalls of conventional therapeutic agents. Therefore, the authors elaborate the relationship between PD pathogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunctions, followed by a suitable mitochondria-targeting therapeutic portfolio, as well as future considerations, aiding the researchers to investigate novel strategies to mitigate the severity of the disease.

AB  - Objective. To identify trends in the study of health risk in peer-reviewed and grey literature in Canadian Aboriginal populations from 1960 to 2007.
   Study design. Systematic literature review and analysis.
   Methods. Peer-reviewed literature was searched using 5 electronic library databases. The grey literature was searched using 3 online search engines, 4 agency websites and 2 online compiled databases. The search terms used were "Canada," synonyms for Canadian Aboriginal peoples and "risk." Citations were screened for relevance to Aboriginal populations and risks to aspects of human health.
   Results. Both literatures show an exponential growth in risk-focused study of Canadian Aboriginal health issues over time. There is a geographic foci in the North with the Prairies and the West under-represented. Risk is most commonly used in relation to general health, environmental, zoonotic infections and chronic diseases in the peer-reviewed literature, and general health or environment in the grey literature. Most publications in both literatures are on generalized Aboriginal populations. When specified, a larger proportion of the publications relate to First Nations people, followed by Inuit. Little literature exists on Metis health risks in Canada.
   Conclusions. There has been an increase in publications about Aboriginal health risk in Canada over time. Trends reflect a research focus on the North and an increased interest in environment and health issues. Greater attention to mental health, addictions and Metis health is required. The increasing use of a risk-based analytical focus has potential implications for understanding the nature of Aboriginal health today and in the future.

AB  - Objective: To review and give an overview of neuroimaging studies that look at the role of stress (hormones) on memory.
   Method: An overview will be given of imaging studies that looked at the role of stress (hormones) on memory. Stress is here defined as the acute provocation of the sympathetic adrenal medullar system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in experimental designs. Stress hormone levels can be raised endogenously in response to stimulus material (for example, pictures and films) or social evaluative threat situations (stress tasks). Other studies use the exogenous application of drugs to enhance or decrease stress hormone levels. Finally, we review studies oil chronic stress and memory.
   Results: Stress or emotional arousal, leading to increased noradrenaline or cortisol levels, led to better memory performance when it is applied during perception or encoding. Brain regions involved in this process were medial temporal lobe regions Such as amygdala and hippocampus, and several parts of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). High stress levels accompanied by high cortisol levels during retrieval led to impaired memory performance. Sex effects on memory as well as lateralization effects on brain activation were found.
   Conclusion: High stress levels during encoding and consolidation of emotional material involve increased amygdala and hippocampus activation. The role of the anterior cingulate cortex and other parts of the PFC during perception and encoding of arousing material appears to be a modulating one. However, additional research is needed to shed more light oil the nature of the brain changes during stress, especially during retrieval.

AB  - Background Researchers focused on mental health of conflict-affected children are increasingly interested in the concept of resilience. Knowledge on resilience may assist in developing interventions aimed at improving positive outcomes or reducing negative outcomes, termed promotive or protective interventions. Methods We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative studies focused on resilience and mental health in children and adolescents affected by armed conflict in low- and middle-income countries. Results Altogether 53 studies were identified: 15 qualitative and mixed methods studies and 38 quantitative, mostly cross-sectional studies focused on school-aged children and adolescents. Qualitative studies identified variation across socio-cultural settings of relevant resilience outcomes, and report contextually unique processes contributing to such outcomes. Quantitative studies focused on promotive and protective factors at different socio-ecological levels (individual, family-, peer-, school-, and community-levels). Generally, promotive and protective factors showed gender-, symptom-, and phase of conflict-specific effects on mental health outcomes. Conclusions Although limited by its predominantly cross-sectional nature and focus on protective outcomes, this body of knowledge supports a perspective of resilience as a complex dynamic process driven by time- and context-dependent variables, rather than the balance between risk- and protective factors with known impacts on mental health. Given the complexity of findings in this population, we conclude that resilience-focused interventions will need to be highly tailored to specific contexts, rather than the application of a universal model that may be expected to have similar effects on mental health across contexts.

AB  - Whilst facing a worldwide fast increase of food and environmental allergies, the medical community is also confronted with another inhomogeneous group of environment-associated disabling conditions, including multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, electric hypersensitivity, amalgam disease and others. These share the features of poly-symptomatic multi-organ cutaneous and systemic manifestations, with postulated inherited/acquired impaired metabolism of chemical/physical/nutritional xenobiotics, triggering adverse reactions at exposure levels far below toxicologically-relevant values, often in the absence of clear-cut allergologic and/or immunologic involvement. Due to the lack of proven pathogenic mechanisms generating measurable disease biomarkers, these environmental hypersensitivities are generally ignored by sanitary and social systems, as psychogenic or. medically unexplained symptoms.. The uncontrolled application of diagnostic and treatment protocols not corresponding to acceptable levels of validation, safety, and clinical efficacy, to a steadily increasing number of patients demanding assistance, occurs in many countries in the absence of evidence-based guidelines. Here we revise available information supporting the organic nature of these clinical conditions. Following intense research on gene polymorphisms of phase I/II detoxification enzyme genes, so far statistically inconclusive, epigenetic and metabolic factors are under investigation, in particular free radical/antioxidant homeostasis disturbances. The finding of relevant alterations of catalase, glutathione-transferase and peroxidase detoxifying activities significantly correlating with clinical manifestations of MCS, has recently registered some progress towards the identification of reliable biomarkers of disease onset, progression, and treatment outcomes.

AB  - With the present review, we intend to highlight the importance of considering the age- and development-dependent occurrence of comorbidity in ADHD and to outline distinct trajectories of symptom progression with possible impact on course and outcome of ADHD. The review will focus on introducing the concepts of "developmental epidemiology'' and "developmental comorbidity''. Psychiatric and non-psychiatric age- dependent comorbidity can be seen in the majority of children, adolescents and adults with ADHD, resulting in a severe impairment of everyday life with considerable functional and psychosocial problems. Concerning the temporal order of occurrence, psychiatric conditions may be present before the appearance of first definite ADHD symptoms ("precomorbidity'', such as temperament factors, sleep disturbance, autism spectrum disorders and atopic eczema). They may coincide with the time when ADHD symptoms reach a clinically significant level ("simultaneous comorbidity'': enuresis, encopresis, developmental dyslexia). The majority of comorbidity, however, appears after the onset of ADHD in the course of disease ("post-comorbidity'': tic disorder, depression and suicidality, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, conduct and substance use disorders, obesity and personality disorders). The aetio-pathophysiology of ADHD and its comorbid disorders and also the nature of comorbidity itself being highly heterogeneous, we additionally discuss possible models of comorbidity. In the future, longitudinal data on distinct patterns of symptom and comorbidity progression would help to refine disease classification systems, strengthen the power of future genetic studies and finally allow for more specific treatment strategies.

AB  - Environmental pollution caused by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has increased the challenge for the scientific communities. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), classified as POPs, are widely applied in various materials as brominated flame retardants (BFRs). Because of the nature of these chemical compounds including toxicity, stability, and capability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify, PBDEs have posed a great challenge and risk to human health and wildlife. Therefore, the side effects of exposure to PBDEs as ubiquitous pollutants in the environment on cancer progression were investigated using a systematic review (SR) survey. To achieve this goal, forty studies were considered after defining the search terms and inclusion criteria, and/or exclusion criteria; the eligible records were collected from the international bibliographic databases. Based on the findings of the reviewed records, environmental exposure to the BFRs including PBDEs has a positive association with different mechanisms that induce cancer progression. However, the findings of the reviewed studies were not totally consistent with the mode of action and side effects are yet to be fully elucidated. Several articles have reported that BFRs can be carcinogenic and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition via different mechanisms. The main mode of action involved in the environmental exposure to BFRs and the risk of cancer progression is endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress (OS). Generally, the imbalance of antioxidant mechanisms, reactive nitrogen species (RNSs) and reactive oxygen species (ROSs), during damage in cells, and stress caused OS, which increases tumorigenesis via multiple mechanisms, such as DNA damage, inflammation, and angiogenesis.

AB  - Traditionally, architectural practice has been dominated by the eye/sight. In recent decades, though, architects and designers have increasingly started to consider the other senses, namely sound, touch (including proprioception, kinesthesis, and the vestibular sense), smell, and on rare occasions, even taste in their work. As yet, there has been little recognition of the growing understanding of themultisensorynature of the human mind that has emerged from the field of cognitive neuroscience research. This review therefore provides a summary of the role of the human senses in architectural design practice, both when considered individually and, more importantly, when studied collectively. For it is only by recognizing the fundamentally multisensory nature of perception that one can really hope to explain a number of surprising crossmodal environmental or atmospheric interactions, such as between lighting colour and thermal comfort and between sound and the perceived safety of public space. At the same time, however, the contemporary focus on synaesthetic design needs to be reframed in terms of the crossmodal correspondences and multisensory integration, at least if the most is to be made of multisensory interactions and synergies that have been uncovered in recent years. Looking to the future, the hope is that architectural design practice will increasingly incorporate our growing understanding of the human senses, and how they influence one another. Such a multisensory approach will hopefully lead to the development of buildings and urban spaces that do a better job of promoting our social, cognitive, and emotional development, rather than hindering it, as has too often been the case previously.

AB  - Gulf War Illness is a chronic multisystem disorder affecting approximately a third of the Veterans of the Gulf War, manifesting with physical and mental health symptoms such as cognitive impairment, neurological abnormalities, and dysregulation of mood. Among the leading theories into the etiology of this multisystem disorder is environmental exposure to the various neurotoxins encountered in the Gulf Theatre, including organophosphates, nerve agents, pyridostigmine bromide, smoke from oil well fires, and depleted uranium. The relationship of toxin exposure and the pathogenesis of Gulf War Illness converges on the innate immune system: a nonspecific form of immunity ubiquitous in nature that acts to respond to both exogenous and endogenous insults. Activation of the innate immune system results in inflammation mediated by the release of cytokines. Cytokine mediated neuroinflammation has been demonstrated in a number of psychiatric conditions and may help explain the larger than expected population of Gulf War Veterans afflicted with a mood disorder. Several of the environmental toxins encountered by soldiers during the first Gulf War have been shown to cause upregulation of inflammatory mediators after chronic exposure, even at low levels. This act of inflammatory priming, by which repeated exposure to chronic subthreshold insults elicits robust responses, even after an extended period of latency, is integral in the connection of Gulf War Illness and comorbid mood disorders. Further developing the understanding of the relationship between environmental toxin exposure, innate immune activation, and pathogenesis of disease in the Gulf War Veterans population, may yield novel therapeutic targets, and a greater understanding of disease pathology and subsequently prevention.

To provide clinically relevant recommendations for the use of pharmacological treatments in depression derived from a literature review. Method Using our previous Clinical Practice Guidelines [Malhi etal. Clinical practice recommendations for bipolar disorder. Acta Psychiatr Scand 2009;119(Suppl. 439):2746] as a foundation, these clinician guidelines target key practical considerations when prescribing pharmacotherapy. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted using electronic database searches (PubMed, MEDLINE), and the findings have been synthesized and integrated alongside clinical experience. Results The pharmacotherapy of depression is an iterative process that often results in partial and non-response. Beyond the initiation of antidepressants, the options within widely used strategies, such as combining agents and switching between agents, are difficult to proscribe because of the paucity of pertinent research. However, there is some evidence for second-line strategies, and a non-prescriptive algorithm can be derived that is based broadly on principles rather than specific steps. Conclusion Depression is by its very nature a heterogeneous illness that is consequently difficult to treat. Invariably, situation-specific factors often play a significant role and must be considered, especially in the case of partial and non-response. Consulting with colleagues and trialling alternate treatment paradigms are essential strategies in the management of depression.

TI  - COGNITIVE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATES OF IMPAIRED SENTENCE PROCESSING IN PARKINSONS-DISEASE
AB  - Sentence comprehension is a complex process involving at least a grammatical processor and a procedural component that supports language computations. One type of cerebral architecture that may underlie sentence processing is a network of distributed brain regions. We report two experiments designed to evaluate the cognitive and physiological substrate of sentence processing difficulties in nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In the first experiment, patients answered simple questions about sentences that varied in their computational demands. Group and individual patient analyses indicated that PD patients are significantly compromised on this task, and that their difficulties become more prominent as the computational demands of the sentences increase. We manipulated the set of sentences to stress performance aspects of sentence processing. PD patients were compromised in their ability to detect errors in the presence and nature of a sentence's grammatical morphemes, suggesting a deficit in selective attention, but their ability to answer questions about a sentence was not affected by short-term memory factors. In the second experiment, positron emission tomography was used to correlate this pattern of sentence comprehension impairment with regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRgl) obtained at rest in a representative subset of these PD patients. Grammatical comprehension and attention in sentence processing correlated significantly with mesial frontal rCMRgl. Regression analyses confirmed the central role of left mesial frontal cortex, and identified a subsidiary role for left caudate in overall sentence comprehension, for left dorsolateral frontal cortex in grammatical processing, and for bilateral dorsolateral frontal cortex in attending to the presence of grammatical features. We conclude that compromised mesial frontal functioning underlies in part the sentence processing deficit of these patients, and these data illustrate one method for mapping portions of a sentence processing mechanism onto a distributed cerebral architecture.

AB  - The recently proposed Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) system defines psychopathologies as phenomena of multilevel neurobiological existence and assigns them to 5 behavioural domains characterizing a brain in action. We performed an analysis on this contemporary concept of psychopathologies in respect to a brain phylogeny and biological substrates of psychiatric diseases. We found that the RDoC system uses biological determinism to explain the pathogenesis of distinct psychiatric symptoms and emphasises exploration of endophenotypes but not of complex diseases. Therefore, as a possible framework for experimental studies it allows one to evade a major challenge of translational studies of strict disease-to-model correspondence. The system conforms with the concept of a normality and pathology continuum, therefore, supports basic studies. The units of analysis of the RDoC system appear as a novel matrix for model validation. The general regulation and arousal, positive valence, negative valence, and social interactions behavioural domains of the RDoC system show basic construct, network, and phenomenological homologies between human and experimental animals. The nature and complexity of the cognitive behavioural domain of the RDoC system deserve further clarification. These homologies in the 4 domains justifies the validity, reliably and translatability of animal models appearing as endophenotypes of the negative and positive affect, social interaction and general regulation and arousal systems' dysfunction.

AB  - Objective: Debate about the nature of somatoform disorders and their current diagnostic classification has been stimulated by the anticipation of new editions of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems diagnostic classifications. In the current paper, we review systematically the literature on the neuroimaging of somatoform disorders and related conditions with the aim of addressing two specific questions: Is there evidence of altered neural function or structure that is specifically associated with somatoform disorders? What conclusions can we draw from these findings about the etiology of somatoform disorders? Methods: Studies reporting neuroimaging findings in patients with a somatoform disorder or a functional somatic syndrome (such as fibromyalgia) were found using Pubmed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE database searches. Reported structural and functional neuroimaging findings were then extracted to form a narrative review. Results: A relatively mature literature on symptoms of pain and less developed literatures on conversion and fatigue symptoms were identified. The available evidence indicates that, when compared with nonclinical groups, somatoform diagnoses are associated with increased activity of limbic regions in response to painful stimuli and a generalized decrease in gray matter density; however, methodological considerations restrict the interpretation of these findings. Conclusions: Whereas the neuroimaging literature has provided evidence about the possible mechanisms underlying somatoform disorders, this is not yet sufficient to provide a basis for classification. By adopting a wider variety of experimental designs and a more dynamic approach to diagnosis, there is every reason to be hopeful that neuroimaging data will play a significant role in future taxonomies.

AB  - Available information about college student mental health has largely been anecdotal or based on information drawn from a single institution. This review examines ten studies published within the past 20 years that focused on college student mental health using data collected from multisite college or university counseling center clients or staff. This subset of research on college student mental health is important in view of the increased demands on counseling centers and the increased emphasis on evidence-based practice. Collectively, these studies suggest that the presenting concerns of college students are changing, that those in treatment are more distressed than those who are not, that clients who identify as ethnic minorities appear to evidence slightly more distress than their white counterparts, that matching client and counselors relative to ethnicity does not appear to improve outcome, and that counseling services seem to improve outcome. While each study makes a unique contribution to the literature, this body of literature suffers from a common set of limitations that stem from the difficulties associated with multisite research, research taking place in active clinical work, and the time-limited nature of data sets. Through our review and critique of these studies, we discuss the importance of establishing an infrastructure that helps researchers to elucidate trends, effective treatments, and risk factors that will be useful to clinicians treating this population. The Center for Collegiate Mental Health, a practice-research network focused on college student mental health, is described and preliminary findings from this entity are presented.

AB  - Substance use disorders in humans have significant social influences, both positive and negative. While prosocial behaviors promote group cooperation and are naturally rewarding, distressing social encounters, such as aggression exhibited by a conspecific, are aversive and can enhance the sensitivity to rewarding substances, promote the acquisition of drug-taking, and reinstate drug-seeking. On the other hand, withdrawal and prolonged abstinence from drugs of abuse can promote social avoidance and suppress social motivation, accentuating drug cravings and facilitating relapse. Understanding how complex social states and experiences modulate drug-seeking behaviors as well as the underlying circuit dynamics, such as those interacting with mesolimbic reward systems, will greatly facilitate progress on understanding triggers of drug use, drug relapse and the chronicity of substance use disorders. Here we discuss some of the common circuit mechanisms underlying social and addictive behaviors that may underlie their antagonistic functions. We also highlight key neurochemicals involved in social influences over addiction that are frequently identified in comorbid psychiatric conditions. Finally, we integrate these data with recent findings on (+/-)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) that suggest functional segregation and convergence of social and reward circuits that may be relevant to substance use disorder treatment through the competitive nature of these two types of reward. More studies focused on the relationship between social behavior and addictive behavior we hope will spur the development of treatment strategies aimed at breaking vicious addiction cycles.

AB  - Purpose: Investigating difficulties during activities of daily living is a fundamental first step for the development of vision-related intervention and rehabilitation strategies. One way to do this is through visual impairment simulations. The aim of this review is to synthesize and assess the types of simulation methods that have been used to simulate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in normally sighted participants, during activities of daily living (e.g., reading, cleaning, and cooking). Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in five databases and a critical analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various AMD simulation methods (following PRISMA guidelines). The review focuses on the suitability of each method for investigating activities of daily living, an assessment of clinical validation procedures, and an evaluation of the adaptation periods for participants. Results: Nineteen studies met the criteria for inclusion. Contact lenses, computer manipulations, gaze contingent displays, and simulation glasses were the main forms of AMD simulation identified. The use of validation and adaptation procedures were reported in approximately two-thirds and half of studies, respectively. Conclusions: Synthesis of the methodology demonstrated that the choice of simulation has been, and should continue to be, guided by the nature of the study. While simulations may never completely replicate vision loss experienced during AMD, consistency in simulation methodology is critical for generating realistic behavioral responses under vision impairment simulation and limiting the influence of confounding factors. Researchers could also come to a consensus regarding the length and form of adaptation by exploring what is an adequate amount of time and type of training required to acclimatize participants to vision impairment simulations.

AB  - There is an association between smoking and suicide, even though the direction and nature of this relationship remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between smoking and suicidal behaviours (ideation, planning, suicide attempts, and death by suicide). On 24 August 2020, we searched the PubMed, Cochrane library, Scopus, Web of Science, TRIP, and SCIENCE DIRECT databases for relevant articles on this topic. Twenty prospective cohort studies involving 2,457,864 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with never smokers, former and current smokers had an increased risk of death by suicide (relative risk [RR] = 1.31; 95% CI [1.13, 1.52] and RR = 2.41; 95% CI [2.08, 2.80], respectively), ideation (RR = 1.35; 95% CI [1.31, 1.39] and RR = 1.84; 95% CI [1.21, 2.78]), and attempted suicide (RR = 1.27; 95% CI [0.56, 2.87] and RR = 1.71; 95% CI [0.73, 3.97]). Moreover, compared to never smokers, current smoker women (RR = 2.51; 95% CI [2.06-3.04] had an increased risk of taking their own life (Q = 13,591.53; p < 0.001) than current smoker men (RR = 2.06; 95% CI [1.62-2.62]. Furthermore, smoking exposure (former and current smokers) was associated with a 1.74-fold increased risk (95% CI [1.54, 1.96]) of suicidal behaviour (death by suicide, ideation, planning, or attempts). Thus, because of the prospective relationship between smoking and suicidal behaviours, smoking should be included in suicide risk scales as a useful and easy item to evaluate suicide risk.

AB  - Iron is a crucial transition metal for life and is the most abundant transition metal in the brain. However, iron's biological utility as an effective redox cycling metal also endows it with the potential to catalyze production of noxious free radicals. This "Janus-faced" nature of iron demands a tight regulation of cellular its metabolism. This regulation is crucial in the CNS, where iron plays myriad keystone roles in CNS processes, including mitochondrial energy transduction, enzyme catalysis, mitochondrial function, myelination, neurotransmitter anabolism and catabolism. Aberrations in brain iron homeostasis can elevate levels of this redox-active metal, leading to mislocalization of the metal and catastrophic oxidative damage to sensitive cellular and subcellular structures. Iron dyshomeostasis has been strongly linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as other major neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the growing societal burden of AD, no disease-modifying therapy exists, necessitating continued investment into both drug-development and the fundamental science investigating the disease-causing mechanisms. Targeting iron dyshomeostasis in the brain represents a rational approach to treat the underlying disease. Here we provide an update on known and emerging iron-associated mechanisms involved in AD. We conclude with an overview of evidence suggesting that, in addition to apoptosis, neuronal loss in AD involves "ferroptosis", a newly discovered iron- and lipid-peroxidation-dependent form of regulated necrosis. The ferroptosis field is rapidly progressing and may provide key insights for future drug-development with disease-modifying potential in AD.

AB  - Educators are increasingly being encouraged to implement evidence-based interventions and practices to address the social, emotional, and behavioral needs of young children who exhibit problem behavior in early childhood settings. Given the nature of social-emotional learning during the early childhood years and the lack of a common set of core evidence-based practices within the early childhood literature, selection of instructional practices that foster positive social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes for children in early childhood settings can be difficult. The purpose of this paper is to report findings from a study designed to identify common practice elements found in comprehensive intervention models (i.e., manualized interventions that include a number of components) or discrete practices (i.e., a specific behavior or action) designed to target social, emotional, and behavioral learning of young children who exhibit problem behavior. We conducted a systematic review of early childhood classroom interventions that had been evaluated in randomized group designs, quasi-experimental designs, and single-case experimental designs. A total of 49 published articles were identified, and an iterative process was used to identify common practice elements. The practice elements were subsequently reviewed by experts in social-emotional and behavioral interventions for young children. Twenty-four practice elements were identified and classified into content (the goal or general principle that guides a practice element) and delivery (the way in which a teacher provides instruction to the child) categories. We discuss implications that the identification of these practice elements found in the early childhood literature has for efforts to implement models and practices.

AB  - This paper provides an assessment of the toxicological basis of the hormetic dose response relationship including issues relating to its reproducibility, frequency. and generalizability across biological models, endpoints measured and chemical class/physical stressors and implications for risk assessment. The quantitative features of the hormetic dose response are described and placed within toxicological context that considers study design, temporal assessment, mechanism, and experimental model/population heterogeneity. Particular emphasis is placed on an historical evaluation of why the field of toxicology rejected hormesis in favor of dose response models such as the threshold model for assessing non-carcinogens and linear no threshold (LNT) models for assessing carcinogens, The paper argues that such decisions were principally based Oil complex historical factors that emerged from the intense and protracted conflict between what is now called traditional medicine and homeopathy and the overly dominating influence of regulatory agencies on the toxicological intellectual agenda. Such regulatory agency influence emphasized hazard/risk assessment goals such as the derivation of no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) and the lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) which were derived principally from high dose studies using few doses, a feature which restricted perceptions and distorted judgments or several generations of toxicologists concerning the nature of the dose response continuum. Such historical and technical blind spots lead the field of toxicology to not only reject an established do,.,e response model (hormesis), but also the model that was more common and fundamental than those that the field accepted.

AB  - Objective: Bereavement is associated with increased risk for morbidity and all-cause mortality across epidemiological, meta-analytic, and case-control studies. The body of research examining the association between bereavement and immune function, beginning in 1977, has yet to be reviewed. The current systematic review clarifies these findings, identifies limitations of the diverse literature, and suggests a model and directions for future research.
   Methods: The PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were used to synthesize 41 years of research. Compared with a meta-analysis, a systematic review is appropriate given the heterogeneous nature of the studies. We used the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Study Quality Assessment Tool to assess the quality of select studies.
   Results: Thirty-three publications met inclusion criteria. Most studies support the association between bereavement and maladaptive changes in immune parameters in adults, with mixed findings on bereavement-related changes in cellular immunity. A handful of recent, good-quality studies show bereaved people demonstrate higher levels of systemic inflammation, maladaptive immune cell gene expression, and lower antibody response to vaccination compared with nonbereaved controls. Individual differences in psychological response to bereavement (e. g., depression, grief) seem to influence the association between bereavement and immune function.
   Conclusions: Research examining the association between bereavement and biomarkers of immune function is heterogeneous inmethods and quality. Despite these limitations, there is evidence supporting maladaptive changes in immune function after bereavement. The research area would benefit from longitudinal research with larger sample sizes, advanced immunological methods, and incorporating measures of psychological responses to bereavement. The field is poised to refine and scale up its investigation of this common and important phenomenon.

AB  - This narrative review highlights key issues in men's mental health and identifies approaches to research, policy and practice that respond to men's styles of coping. Issues discussed are: 1) the high incidence of male suicide (80% of suicide deaths in Canada, with a peak in the mid-50 s age group) accompanied by low public awareness; 2) the perplexing nature of male depression, manifesting in forms that are poorly recognised by current diagnostic approaches and thus poorly treated; 3) the risky use of alcohol among men, again common and taking a huge toll on mental and physical health; 4) the characteristic ways in which men manage psychological suffering, the coping strengths to be recognised, and the gaps to be addressed; 5) the underutilization of mental health services by men, and the implication for clinical outcomes; and 6) male-specific approaches to service provision designed to improve men's accessing of care, with an emphasis on Canadian programs. The main conclusion is that a high proportion of men in Western society have acquired psychological coping strategies that are often dysfunctional. There is a need for men to learn more adaptive coping approaches long before they reach a crisis point. Recommendations are made to address men's mental health through: healthcare policy that facilitates access; research on tailoring interventions to men; population-level initiatives to improve the capacity of men to cope with psychological distress; and clinical practice that is sensitive to the expression of mental health problems in men and that responds in a relevant manner.

KW  - communication disorders
KW  - language disorders
KW  - right cerebral hemisphere
KW  - psychotic disorders
KW  - mood disorders
AB  - The article is a review of literature on language and communication difficulties in the course of psychotic disorders and mood disorders. Disorders related to non-linguistic aspects of statements, i.e. understanding of discourse, humour, irony, metaphors, as well as prosodic aspects of statements are described. Language problems are caused by improper functioning of the right cerebral hemisphere. In the course of psychotic disorders the most severe difficulties refer to generation and maintenance of the discourse and prosodic aspects of statements. Furthermore, problems with integration of information, related to understanding of jokes and sarcasm, are observed. Non-linguistic nature of statements is not consistent with the uttered contents, which causes communication disorders with the environment. In patients with schizophrenia the dynamics of communication changes depends on the duration of the disease as well as applied pharmacotherapy. Besides, differences are observed between schizophrenic women and men in their capabilities to read emotions. In the course of mood disorders the language and communication deficits are more discreet and seldom observed. The most extensively described language problems are disturbances in emotional prosody which significantly affects the correct perception of verbally communicated information. In addition, difficulties with understanding of metaphors and grasping of jokes and irony are described, besides a disturbed capability within understanding of discourse was found. The study compared also communication dysfunctions in the course of psychotic disorders and mood disorders. Similarly as in psychotic disorders, in mood disorders the language difficulties occur within understanding of discourse as well as the capabilities to grasp the jokes, irony and sarcasm.

AB  - Optimal early development in most species is dependent upon a stable relationship between the mother and her infant. The research described here focuses on the reciprocal nature of this dyad in rodents and humans, with respect to the regulation of responsiveness to stress in both mother and offspring. Dietary influences are critical not only to regulate infant growth but also to modulate the response of the neuroendocrine system to stress and, possibly, to influence some aspects of brain development. In particular, we discuss the role of leptin, a protein produced in the adipose tissue and present in maternal milk, that reduces responses to stress in the infant. We suggest that leptin acts on both central (hypothalamus and hippocampus) and peripheral (pituitary, adrenal gland) targets in the infant to reduce exposure to glucocorticoids and enhance hippocampal development during a sensitive period of brain development. There is also evidence to support the reverse regulatory influence, in which maternal state is profoundly affected by stimulation from the young. During the period of lactation, mothers exhibit lower neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to several types of stressors, except possibly those representing a threat to the infant. This ability to "filter" relevant from irrelevant stimuli while caring for their young might be viewed as adaptive for the mother-infant dyad, and the inability to filter adequately stressful stimuli could at least in part be associated with the development of postpartum depression.

AB  - Purpose This is the first comprehensive review of empirical research that investigated the association between receipt of child welfare services and adult mental health outcomes. The review summarised the results of studies about mental health outcomes of adults with a history of child welfare involvement. Methods A scoping review methodology was used to search five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, IBSS, Social Policy and Practice). Studies were included if they examined any child welfare exposure (including receipt of services while remaining at home/being placed in care) and adult mental health status. Results In total 4591 records were retrieved, of which 55 met the eligibility criteria. Overall, receipt of child welfare services was associated with an increased risk of adult mental ill-health, suicide attempt and completed suicide. Results regarding potential moderating factors, such as gender and care-related experiences, were mixed. Relatively few studies investigated the reasons for requiring child welfare services, the experience of abuse or neglect or the adult outcomes of child welfare service users who remained in their own homes. Mental ill-health was defined and measured heterogeneously and details about the nature and type of welfare service utilisation were lacking. Conclusion There is a need for detailed, longitudinal studies to better understand the relative contribution of pre-existing adversity versus experiences during and after exposure to child welfare services on adult mental health outcomes. More standardised measures of mental ill-health and greater detail from authors on specific care exposure are also needed.

KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - Question
   The context for the implementation of evidence-based psychological treatments (EBPTs) often differs from the context in which the treatment was developed, which necessitates adaptations. In this systematic review we build on, and add to, prior approaches by examining the method used to guide such adaptations. In particular, we sought to elucidate the extent to which an empirical process is used.
   Study selection and analysis
   We focused on publications describing adaptations made to EBPTs for adults diagnosed with a mental illness. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science from database inception to July 2018. Two raters independently coded the articles for the method used to conduct the adaptation, the reason for and nature of the adaptation, and who made the adaptation.
   Findings
   The search produced 20 194 citations, which yielded 152 articles after screening. The most commonly used methods for planned adaptations were literature review (57.7%), clinical intuition (47.0%) and theory (38.9%). The use of data from stakeholder interviews ranked fourth (21.5%) and the use of other types of data (eg, pilot study, experiment, survey, interview) ranked last at fifth (12.1%). Few publications reporting ad hoc adaptations were identified (n=3).
   Conclusions
   This review highlights a need to (a) educate providers and researchers to carefully consider the methods used for the treatment adaptation process, and to use empirical methods where possible and where appropriate, (b) improve the quality of reporting of stakeholder interviews and (c) develop reporting standards that articulate optimal methods for conducting treatment adaptations.

AB  - Background "Active aging" is an inclusive term and has been defined from a variety of aspects in different domains throughout the literature. The aim of this review was to identify those aspects that play significant roles in building this concept using an ecological approach. Methods In this study, seven online databases, including JSTOR, Pub-Med, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ProQuest, EBSCO, and Scopus, were searched from 2002 to 2018 for both qualitative and quantitative articles published in English. Two reviewers independently found the related articles using the search terms "active aging" and "built environment" and included both "ageing" and "aging". Results Of 1500 records which passed the screening stage, 92 were eligible for inclusion in the review. A total of 15 subthemes were derived: (1) personal characteristics, (2) behavioral attitude, (3) land use, (4) access, (5) physical form, (6) cityscape/city image, (7) public open spaces, (8) housing, (9) social environment, (10) cultural Environment, (11) economic environment, (12) good governance, (13) physical health, (14) mental health, and (15) social health. Ecological themes of active aging can be defined as the 5P model: person, processes, place, prime, and policymaking. Conclusions The results of this study can shed light on different aspects of active aging. Also, the results emphasized the significance of the multidimensional nature of active aging, micro (person), meso (process), and macro systems (place and policymaking), based on health (prime) environments. Moreover, the results were based on the relationships between the person and the environment at the individual, interpersonal, and environmental levels, which can be used to conduct future studies and develop policies on aging populations.

AB  - Exposure to stress during the early postnatal period (i.e., early life stress, ES) can impact brain physiology and modify individual variability in adult social behavior. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) are two centrally released neuropeptides that are involved in shaping essential social behaviors, like aggression, social recognition, and social motivation. AVP and OXT modulate activity in brain regions important for the establishment of social behavior, and may be particularly sensitive to ES. In this review, we discuss whether ES alters the characteristics of the AVP- and OXT- systems in rodents, and whether these changes are associated with later alterations in aggression, social recognition, and social motivation. We have integrated causal studies indicating that (1) ES affects AVP/OXT, and (2) that changing AVP/OXT in affected regions alters social behavior. Although there is encouraging evidence that ES causes AVP- and OXT-system changes, and that these may mediate social behavior, a comprehensive understanding of the exact nature of AVP- and OXT changes and whether they are causal in establishing these behavioral disturbances needs further investigation. As there are indications that ES alters AVP- and OXT characteristics in humans as well, and that these may interact with adult predisposition to psychopathology with social dysfunction, future rodent studies may lay ground for a better understanding of such changes in humans. Ultimately, this may assist in developing therapeutic strategies to target ES effects on social behavior.

AB  - Background:
   Depression and cognitive impairment often coexist in older adults. The relation between depression and cognitive impairment is complex. The objective of this article is to review recent literature on cognitive impairment in older adults with depression and provide clinicians an update.
   Methods:
   We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Psych Info for the articles published in the English language related to late-life depression (LLD)/geriatric depression and cognitive impairment. We considered original research articles, relevant systematic reviews, chapters, and important conceptual articles published in the last 9 years (2011-2019). We selected relevant articles for this narrative review.
   Conclusion:
   The concept pseudodementia, indicating depression with cognitive impairment mimicking dementia, is now seen only as a historical concept. The current literature strongly agrees with fact that cognitive deficits often exist in LLD. The cognitive deficits in depression were initially seen as trait marker; however, some recent studies suggest that cognitive deficits persist even in the remission phase. There is heterogeneity among the studies in terms of the nature of the cognitive deficits, but higher number of studies reported impairment in attention and executive function. LLD with cognitive deficits is at a higher risk of progression to dementia. In older adults, depression with cognitive impairments requires a comprehensive evaluation. Electroencephalography, event-related potentials, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, amyloid positron emission tomography, and CSF amyloid will supplement clinical evaluation in differentiating functional depressive disorder with cognitive impairment from depression with an underlying degenerative condition.

AB  - Recent years have seen increased interest in neuroergonomics, which investigates the brain activities of people engaged in diverse physical and cognitive activities at work and in everyday life. The present work extends upon prior assessments of the state of this art. However, here we narrow our focus specifically to studies that use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity, correlates, and effects during physical activity. The review uses systematically selected, openly published works derived from a guided search through peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. Identified studies were then categorized by the type of physical activity and evaluated considering methodological and chronological aspects via statistical and content-based analyses. From the identified works (n = 110), a specific number (n = 38) focused on less mobile muscular activities, while an additional group (n = 22) featured both physical and cognitive tasks. The remainder (n = 50) investigated various physical exercises and sporting activities and thus were here identified as a miscellaneous grouping. Most of the physical activities were isometric exertions, moving parts of upper and lower limbs, or walking and cycling. These primary categories were sub-categorized based on movement patterns, the use of the event-related potentials (ERP) technique, the use of recording methods along with EEG and considering mental effects. Further information on subjects' gender, EEG recording devices, data processing, and artifact correction methods and citations was extracted. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the findings from various studies, statistical analyses were not performed. These were thus included in a descriptive fashion. Finally, contemporary research gaps were pointed out, and future research prospects to address those gaps were discussed.

AB  - Broad neuropsychological deficits have been consistently demonstrated in well-established bipolar disorder. The aim of the current study was to systematically review neuropsychological studies in first-episode bipolar disorders to determine the breadth, extent and predictors of cognitive dysfunction at this early stage of illness through meta-analytic procedures. Electronic databases were searched for studies published between January 1980 and December 2013. Twelve studies met eligibility criteria (N = 341, mean age = 28.2 years), and pooled effect sizes (ES) were calculated across eight cognitive domains. Moderator analyses were conducted to identify predictors of between-study heterogeneity. Controlling for known confounds, medium to large deficits (ES >= 0.5) in psychomotor speed, attention and working memory, and cognitive flexibility were identified, whereas smaller deficits (ES 0.20-0.49) were found in the domains of verbal learning and memory, attentional switching, and verbal fluency. A medium to large deficit in response inhibition was only detected in non-euthymic cases. Visual learning and memory functioning was not significantly worse in cases compared with controls. Overall, first-episode bipolar disorders are associated with widespread cognitive dysfunction. Since euthymia was not associated with superior cognitive performance in most domains, these results indicate that even in the earliest stages of disease, cognitive deficits are not mood-state dependent. The current findings have important implications for whether cognitive impairments represent neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative processes. Future studies need to more clearly characterise the presence of psychotic features, and the nature and number of previous mood episodes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heavy metals (HM) are among the elements that are rare in nature and threaten human health, animals, and the environment. Fix sources including (power plants, industries, homes) and mobile sources include (cars and motorcycles) are the main sources production and emission of HM. It is important to understand the main information about sources of emission, chemical processes (reactions, oxidation, and leaching), and how they precipitate. The aim of this study was to evaluation an increased risk of leukemia due to exposure to HM. In this article narrative, the first literature search was performed with 580 articles according to different databases: Elsevier, PubMed, Web of science, Spring, and Google Scholar databases. 70 articles were included in the analysis process. Finally, 8 full-text articles were selected in this research. The search was restricted to English-language papers published between 2000 and 2021. In final stage literature, there is a notable health effect (carcinogenic) because of exposure to heavy metals. According to the results of this research natural procedures and human activities (industrial processes, car exhaust, and cigarette smoke) are the most important of ways that heavy metals can enter the natural cycle. Air, food, soil, water, and groundwater are the main sources of heavy metals that can cause severe disorders in the human body. After entering the body through ingestion heavy metals produce stable bio-toxic compounds. These compounds by disrupting biological processes, interrupt the body's functions and cause various cancers in the human body. The results of this study can help to politicians for make comprehensive decisions to solve the problem and increase public awareness of the use of protective equipment.

AB  - In nature, animals need to adapt to constant changes in their environment. Learning and memory are cognitive capabilities that allow this to happen. Extinction, the reduction of a certain behavior or learning previously established, refers to a very particular and interesting type of learning that has been the basis of a series of therapies to diminish non-adaptive behaviors. In recent years, the exploration of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this type of learning has received increasing attention. Hebbian plasticity (the activity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission), and homeostatic plasticity (the homeostatic regulation of plasticity) constitute processes intimately associated with memory formation and maintenance. Particularly, long-term depression (LTD) has been proposed as the underlying mechanism of extinction, while the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) has been widely related to both the extinction process and LTD. In this review, we focus on the available evidence that sustains CaN modulation of LTD and its association with extinction. Beyond the classic view, we also examine the interconnection among extinction, Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, as well as emergent evidence of the participation of kinases and long-term potentiation (LTP) on extinction learning, highlighting the importance of the balance between kinases and phosphatases in the expression of extinction. Finally, we also integrate data that shows the association between extinction and less-studied phenomena, such as synaptic silencing and engram formation that open new perspectives in the field.

AB  - Knowledge of the behavioral ecology of marmosets carried out in their natural habitat associated with the advent of a non-invasive technique for measuring steroid hormones in feces has made a significant contribution to understanding their social relationships and sexual strategies. These studies showed that they are mainly monogamous, live in relatively stable social groups according to a social hierarchy in which females compete and males cooperate, and form social bonds similar to humans, which makes this species a potential animal model to study disorders related to social stress. In addition, laboratory studies observed the expression of behaviors similar to those in nature and deepened the descriptions of their social and reproductive strategies. They also characterized their responses to the challenge using behavioral, cognitive, physiological, and genetic approaches that were sexually dimorphic and influenced by age and social context. These findings, added to some advantages which indicate good adaptation to captivity and the benefits of the birth of twins, small size, and life cycle in comparison to primates of the Old World, led to their use as animal models for validating psychiatric diseases such as major depression. Juvenile marmosets have recently been used to develop a depression model and to test a psychedelic brew called Ayahuasca from the Amazon rainforest as an alternative treatment for major depression, for which positive results have been found which encourage further studies in adolescents. Therefore, we will review the experimental evidence obtained so far and discuss the extension of the marmoset as an animal model for depression.

AB  - Jurisdictions in Canada, notably in Ontario and Quebec, are proposing a laudable goal of increasing publicly funded access to psychotherapy. Ontario and Quebec will likely follow the lead of the Increasing Access to Psychotherapy (IAPT) program in the United Kingdom and train psychotherapists to provide cognitive-behavioural therapy. Results from IAPT provide some important lessons about taking an approach that prefers one brand of psychotherapy. We argue that such policy decisions are based on a medical model approach to psychotherapy that makes erroneous assumptions about what psychotherapy is, what is the nature of the evidence, and how training and services should be delivered. In this article, we review critically these assumptions and the state of the art of the research about what makes psychotherapy work. Psychotherapy is effective and preferable to antidepressant medication. Differences between psychotherapies account for a small proportion of variance in patient outcomes. The largest known predictors of patient outcomes are patient factors (coping style, resistance/reactance, interpersonal problems, culture) and therapeutic relationship factors (therapeutic alliance). Also notable are therapist factors (facilitative interpersonal skills, empathy, and managing countertransference), and practices like progress monitoring. Canadian jurisdictions should note that training therapists to adapt treatment and interpersonal stances to patient characteristics, to develop and maintain the therapeutic relationship, to enhance therapist facilitative interpersonal skills, and to engage in progress monitoring has a greater chance of achieving a reduction in the burden caused by depression and anxiety among their citizens than focusing on delivering a particular brand of psychotherapy.

AB  - The nuclear symmetry energy characterizes the variation of the binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio of a nuclear system is varied. This is one of the most important features of nuclear physics in general, since it is just related to the two component nature of the nuclear systems. As such it is one of the most relevant physical parameters that affect the physics of many phenomena and nuclear processes. This review paper presents a survey of the role and relevance of the nuclear symmetry energy in different fields of research and of the accuracy of its determination from the phenomenology and from the microscopic many-body theory. In recent years, a great interest was devoted not only to the Nuclear Matter symmetry energy at saturation density but also to its whole density dependence, which is an essential ingredient for our understanding of many phenomena. We analyze the nuclear symmetry energy in different realms of nuclear physics and astrophysics. In particular we consider the nuclear symmetry energy in relation to nuclear structure, astrophysics of Neutron Stars and supernovae, and heavy ion collision experiments, trying to elucidate the connections of these different fields on the basis of the symmetry energy peculiarities. The interplay between experimental and observational data and theoretical developments is stressed. The expected future developments and improvements are schematically addressed, together with most demanded experimental and theoretical advances for the next few years. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a devastating mental illness. Although its etiology is still largely unknown, strides have been taken throughout the last several decades to elucidate the nature of the neuropathology behind this disorder. The advent of neuroimaging technologies such as computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have progressed knowledge about the macroscopic brain changes that occur in schizophrenia, including the characteristic enlarged ventricle size and reductions in gray matter volume, whole-brain volume, and white matter anisotropy. Although this review presents a broad outline of current and historical neuropathological research, the focus is primarily on the quantitative neuropathology of the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia, which may underlie many of the larger scale changes observed. The reduced neuropil hypothesis has been suggested as a microanatomical explanation to account for these macroscopic changes, although the present review finds that evidence does not always support this. A quantitative meta-analytic summary of these studies, focused on neuron density, provides support for the finding of increased neuron density in schizophrenia, with variation dependent on age. This is consistent with neuroimaging data and implicates an altered aging trajectory as a factor in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Combined with evidence from other neuroanatomical studies reviewed here, as well as studies in childhood-onset schizophrenia, the evidence converges on a progressive neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia related to altered neuroplasticity. The evidence also supports a particular vulnerability of inhibitory cortical circuits with markers of interneurons showing some of the more consistent reductions in schizophrenia. (C) 2015 IBRO.

AB  - Although the term environmental stress is used across multiple fields in biology, the inherent ambiguity associated with its definition has caused confusion when attempting to understand organismal responses to environmental change. Here I provide a brief summary of existing definitions of the term stress, and the related concepts of homeostasis and allostasis, and attempt to unify them to develop a general framework for understanding how organisms respond to environmental stressors. I suggest that viewing stressors as environmental changes that cause reductions in performance or fitness provides the broadest and most useful conception of the phenomenon of stress. I examine this framework in the context of animals that have evolved in highly variable environments, using the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, as a case study. Consistent with the extreme environmental variation that they experience in their salt marsh habitats, killifish have substantial capacity for both short-term resistance and long-term plasticity in the face of changing temperature, salinity and oxygenation. There is inter-population variation in the sensitivity of killifish to environmental stressors, and in their ability to acclimate, suggesting that local adaptation can shape the stress response even in organisms that are broadly tolerant and highly plastic. Whole-organism differences between populations in stressor sensitivity and phenotypic plasticity are reflected at the biochemical and molecular levels in killifish, emphasizing the integrative nature of the response to environmental stressors. Examination of this empirical example highlights the utility of using an evolutionary perspective on stressors, stress and stress responses.

AB  - The concept of expressed emotion (EE) has been extended to the study of staff-patient relationships in schizophrenia. A comprehensive review of the literature identified a total of 27 studies investigating EE in this group published between 1990 and 2008. The article aims to assess whether the concept of EE is a useful and valid measure of the quality of professional caregiver and patient relationships, given that staff may be less emotionally invested in relationships than relatives. In doing so, it summarizes methods of measuring EE, the nature of professional EE compared with familial EE, associations between high EE and patient outcomes, associations between EE and both patient and staff variables, and intervention studies to reduce staff high EE. The available evidence suggests that the Camberwell Family Interview is an acceptable measure of EE in staff-patient relationships, although the Five Minute Speech Sample may provide a less resource intensive alternative. However, in contrast to familial research, neither the EE status on the Camberwell Family Interview nor the Five Minute Speech Sample show a robust relationship with outcomes. The presence or absence of a positive staff-patient relationship may have more predictive validity in this group. There is relatively consistent evidence of associations between staff criticism and poorer patient social functioning. Consistent with findings in familial research, staff attributions may play a key role in driving critical responses, and it may be possible to reduce staff high EE by modifying negative appraisals.

AB  - Postpartum depression is one of the most prevalent psychopathologies. Its prevalence is estimated to be between 10% and 15%. Despite its multifactorial etiology, it is known that genetics play an important role in the genesis of this disorder. This paper reviews epidemiological evidence supporting the role of genetics in postpartum depression (PPD). The main objectives of this review are to determine which genes and polymorphisms are associated with PPD and discuss how this association may occur. In addition, this paper explores whether these genes are somehow related to or even the same as those linked to Major Depression (MD). To identify gaps in the current knowledge that require investigation, a systematic review was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, LILACS and SciELO using the index terms "postpartum depression" and "genetics". Literature searches for articles in peer-reviewed journals were made until April 2014. PPD was indexed 56 times with genetics. The inclusion criteria were articles in Portuguese, Spanish or English that were available by institutional means or sent by authors upon request; this search resulted in 20 papers. Genes and polymorphisms traditionally related to MD, which are those involved in the serotonin, catecholamine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tryptophan metabolism, have been the most studied, and some have been related to PPD. The results are conflicting and some depend on epigenetics, which makes the data incipient. Further studies are required to determine the genes that are involved in PPD and establish the nature of the relationship between these genes and PPD.

AB  - The present commentary explored the intersecting nature of the COVID-19 and HIV pandemics to identify a shared research agenda using a syndemic approach. The research agenda posits the following questions. Questions around HIV infection, transmission, and diagnosis include: (i) molecular, genetic, clinical, and environmental assessments of COVID-19 in people living with HIV, (ii) alternative options for facility-based HIV testing services such as self- and home-based HIV testing, and (iii) COVID-19 related sexual violence and mental health on HIV transmission and early diagnosis. These and related questions could be assessed using Biopsychosocial and socio-ecological models. Questions around HIV treatment include: (i) the effect of COVID-19 on HIV treatment services, (ii) alternative options for facility-based treatment provision such as community-based antiretroviral therapy groups, and (iii) equitable distribution of treatment and vaccines for COVID-19, if successful. Bickman's logic model and the social determinants of health framework could guide these issues. The impact of stigma, the role of leveraging lessons on sustained intra-behavioral change, the role of medical mistrust and conspiracy beliefs, and the role of digital health on integrated management of HIV care and spectrum of care of COVID-19 need assessment using several frameworks including Goffman's stigma framework, Luhmann's Trust theory, and Gidden's theory of structuration. In conclusion, the potential research agenda of this commentary encompasses a variety of research fields and disciplinary areas-clinicians, laboratory scientists, public health practitioners, health economists, and psychologists-, and suggests several theoretical frameworks to guide examination of complex issues comprehensively.

AB  - Background: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is an important public health challenge. In recent years, there has been a greater awareness concerning this phenomenon, its causes and consequences. Due to the relational nature of IPV, attachment theory (Bowlby, 1988) appears a useful framework to read the phenomenon and to better understand its components and its dynamics to provide more precise and tailored interventions in the future.
   Purpose: To summarize our knowledge of the research concerning IPV and attachment with an aim to better design and implement future research.
   Methods: Computer database researches were conducted using the following databases: Psychinfo, Psycharticle, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed (all years to the 01/02/2018). Search terms were compiled into two concepts for all database namely Attachment and IPV.
   Results: After removing the duplicates, a total of 3,598 records was screened, resulting in the identification of 319 full-text articles to be further scrutinized. Upon closer examination, there was consensus that 113 of those studies met the study inclusion criteria. Data was organized considering specifically studies concerning (1) IPV victimization and attachment, (2) IPV perpetration and attachment (both these sections were articulated in Physical, Psychological, and Sexual IPV), and (3) New research (comprising same-sex couples, IPV and attachment in couple contexts and IPV profiles and attachment among perpetrators).
   Conclusion: A number of studies failed to find significant associations between insecure attachment and IPV victimization or perpetration. Additional research is needed to provide a greater understanding of different IPV forms and to aid in the development of prevention and treatment interventions.

AB  - Social interactions come with the fundamental problem of trying to understand others' mental and affective states while under the overpowering influence of one's own concurrent thoughts and feelings. The ability to distinguish between simultaneous representations of others' current experiences as well as our own is crucial to navigate our complex social environments successfully. The developmental building blocks of this ability and how this is given rise to by functional and structural brain development remains poorly understood. In this review, I outline some of the key findings on the role of self-other distinction in understanding others' mental as well as emotional states in children and adults. I will begin by clarifying the crucial role for self-other distinction in avoiding egocentric attributions of one's own cognitive as well as affective states to others in adults and outline the underlying neural circuitry in overcoming such egocentricity. This will provide the basis for a discussion of the emergence of self-other distinction in early childhood as well as developmental changes therein throughout childhood and into adulthood. I will demonstrate that self-other distinction of cognitive and emotional states is already dissociable early in development. Concomitantly, I will show that processes of self-other distinction in cognitive and affective domains rely on adjacent but distinct neural circuitry each with unique connectivity profiles, presumably related to the nature of the distinction that needs to be made.

AB  - Background: Case management is the established model for care provision in mental health and is delivered within current care philosophies of person-centred and recovery-oriented care. The fact that people with a mental illness may be forced to receive care and treatment in the community poses challenges for clinicians aiming to engage in approaches that promote shared decision-making and self-determination. This review sought to gain an in-depth understanding of stakeholders' perspectives and experiences of care planning for consumers' on CTOs.
   Methods: An integrative review method allowed for inclusion of a broad range of studies from diverse empirical sources. Systematic searches were conducted across six databases. Following appraisal, findings from included papers were coded into groups and presented against a framework of case management.
   Results: Forty-eight papers were included in the review. Empirical studies came from seven countries, with the majority reporting on qualitative methods. Many similarities were reported across studies. Positive gains from CTOs were usually associated with the nature of support received, highlighting the importance of the therapeutic relationship in care planning. Key gaps in care planning included a lack of connection between CTO, treatment and consumer goals and lack of implementation of focussed interventions.
   Conclusions: Current case management processes could be better utilised for consumers on CTOs, with exploration of how this could be achieved warranted. Workers need to be sensitive to the 'control and care' dynamic in the care planning relationship, with person-centred approaches requiring core and advanced practitioner and communication skills, including empathy and trust.

AB  - Numerous psychiatric disorders whose cognitive dysfunction links to functional outcome have neurodevelopmental origins including schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder. Treatments are needed for these cognitive deficits, which require development using animal models. Models of neurodevelopmental disorders are as varied and diverse as the disorders themselves, recreating some but not all aspects of the disorder. This variety may in part underlie why purported procognitive treatments translated from these models have failed to restore functioning in the targeted patient populations. Further complications arise from environmental factors used in these models that can contribute to numerous disorders, perhaps only impacting specific domains, while diagnostic boundaries define individual disorders, limiting translational efficacy. The Research Domain Criteria project seeks to 'develop new ways to classify mental disorders based on behavioral dimensions and neurobiological measures' in hopes of facilitating translational research by remaining agnostic toward diagnostic borders derived from clinical presentation in humans. Models could therefore recreate biosignatures of cognitive dysfunction irrespective of disease state. This review highlights work within the field of neurodevelopmental models of psychiatric disorders tested in cross-species translational cognitive paradigms that directly inform this newly developing research strategy. By expounding on this approach, the hopes are that a fuller understanding of each model may be attainable in terms of the cognitive profile elicited by each manipulation. Hence, conclusions may begin to be drawn on the nature of cognitive neuropathology on neurodevelopmental and other disorders, increasing the chances of procognitive treatment development for individuals affected in specific cognitive domains.

AB  - The visual sense has outstanding significance for human perception and behavior, and visual attention plays a central role in the processing of the sensory input. There by, multiple low- and high-level factors contribute to the guidance of attention. The present review focuses on two neglected high level factors: emotion and personality. The review starts with an over view of different models of attention, providing a conceptual framework and illustrating the nature of low and high-level factors in visual attention. Then, the ambiguous concept of emotion is described, and recommendations are made for the experimental practice. In the following, we present several studies showing the influence of emotion on overt attention, whereby the distinction between internally and externally located emotional impacts are emphasized. We also provide evidence showing that emotional stimuli influence perceptual processing outside of the focus of attention, whereby results in this field are mixed. Then, we present some detached studies showing the reversed causal effect: attention can also affect emotional responses. The final section on emotion-attention interactions addresses the interplay on the neuronal level, which has been neglected for a long time in neuroscience. In this context, several conceptual recommendations for future research are made. Finally, based on findings showing inter-individual differences in human sensitivity to emotional items, we introduce the wide range of time-independent personality traits that also influence attention, and in this context we try to raise awareness of the consideration of inter-individual differences in the field of neuroscience.

AB  - Humans synchronize with one another to foster successful interactions. Here, we use a multimodal data fusion approach with the aim of elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms by which interpersonal neural synchro-nization (INS) occurs. Our meta-analysis of 22 functional magnetic resonance imaging and 69 near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning experiments (740 and 3721 subjects) revealed robust brain regional correlates of INS in the right temporoparietal junction and left ventral prefrontal cortex. Integrating this meta-analytic in-formation with public databases, biobehavioral and brain-functional association analyses suggested that INS involves sensory-integrative hubs with functional connections to mentalizing and attention networks. On the molecular and genetic levels, we found INS to be associated with GABAergic neurotransmission and layer IV/V neuronal circuits, protracted developmental gene expression patterns, and disorders of neurodevelopment. Although limited by the indirect nature of phenotypic-molecular association analyses, our findings generate new testable hypotheses on the neurobiological basis of INS.

AB  - It is well known that dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis is involved in Alzheimeris disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of toxic aggregates of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) and neurofibrillary tangles of tau. Alteration of calcium signaling has been linked to A beta and tau pathologies, although the understanding of underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms is far from clear.
   This review summarizes the functional inhibition of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) by A beta and tau, and its modulation by calmodulin and the ionic nature of phospholipids. The data obtained until now in our laboratory suggest that PMCA injury linked to Al) and tau can be significantly involved in the cascade of events leading to intracellular calcium overload associated to AD.

First, two typical clusters of theories of close relationships, the attachment theory and the social network theory, are compared and discussed with regard to their fundamental but controversial assumptions regarding the scope of lifelong development. Second, previous research into close relationships among mature adults is reviewed. Third, a new social network model, the affective relationships model, and its assessment instrument are proposed. This model describes the nature of individual close relationships consisting of multiple significant others, and condenses the complexity of each social network by typological classifications. Fourth, new evidence based on the model is reviewed. Finally, fundamental assumptions about close relationships and emerging topics for future studies are discussed. Copyright (C) 2005 S.

AB  - Mitochondria are responsible for the generation of ATP to fuel muscle contraction, Hypermetabolic stresses imposed upon muscles can lead to mitochondrial proliferation, but the resulting mitochondria greatly resemble their progenitors, During the mitochondrial biogenesis that accompanies phenotypic adaptation, the stoichiometric relationships between functional elements are preserved through shared sensitivities of respiratory genes to specific transcription factors, Although the properties of muscle mitochondria are generally thought to be highly conserved across species, there are many examples of mitochondrial differences between muscle types, species and developmental states and even within single cells, In this review, we discuss (1) the nature and regulation of gene families that allow coordinated expression of genes for mitochondrial products and (2) the regulatory mechanisms by which mitochondrial differences can arise over physiological and evolutionary time.

AB  - Emotional labor has been an area of burgeoning research interest in occupational health psychology in recent years. Emotional labor was conceptualized in the early 1980s by sociologist Arlie Hochschild (1983) as occupational requirements that alienate workers from their emotions. Almost 2 decades later, a model was published in Journal of Occupational Health Psychology (JOHP) that viewed emotional labor through a psychological lens, as emotion regulation strategies that differentially relate to performance and wellbeing. For this anniversary issue of JOHP, we review the emotional labor as emotion regulation model, its contributions, limitations, and the state of the evidence for its propositions. At the heart of our article, we present a revised model of emotional labor as emotion regulation, that incorporates recent findings and represents a multilevel and dynamic nature of emotional labor as emotion regulation.

AB  - This article compares the ability to track individuals lacking mental states with the ability to track intentional agents. It explains why reference to individuals raises the problem of explaining how cognitive agents track unique individuals and in what sense reference is based on procedures of perceptual-motor and epistemic tracking. We suggest applying the notion of singular-files from theories in perception and semantics to the problem of tracking intentional agents. In order to elucidate the nature of agent-files, three views of the relation between object- and agent-tracking are distinguished: the Independence, Deflationary and Organism-Dependence Views. The correct view is argued to be the latter, which states that perceptual and epistemic tracking of a unique human organism requires tracking both its spatio-temporal object-properties and its agent-properties.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in adults involving non-demyelinating motor disorders. About 90% of ALS cases are sporadic, while 10-12% of cases are due to some genetic reasons. Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAR, c9orf72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) and VAPB genes are commonly found in ALS patients. Therefore, the mechanism of ALS development involves oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, glutamate excitotoxicity and aggregation of proteins, neuro-inflammation and defective RNA function. Cholesterol and LDL/HDL levels are also associated with ALS development. As a result, sterols could be a suitable biomarker for this ailment. The main mechanisms of ALS development are reticulum stress, neuroinflammation and RNA metabolism. The multi-nature development of ALS makes it more challenging to pinpoint a treatment.

AB  - The goal of achieving a universally acceptable and empirically sound diagnostic manual in psychiatry remains an ongoing challenge. From the time of its production to the present day, DSM-5 has been criticized for its diagnostic criteria, timeline, scope, clinical and research utility, and scientific validity. The level of such criticism ranges from constructive and scholarly to destructive and impractical. Deluged by the vastness of such levels of criticism, it becomes difficult for both mental health professionals and consumers to sort the nature of such arguments. It is prudent that professionals should become educated about the historical perspectives and the scientific limitations that are barriers in the development of a consensual diagnostic manual without ignoring and while appreciating the practical and educational benefits of the imperfect DSM-5. This article serves this purpose by analyzing the major controversies surrounding DSM-5. [Psy-chiatr Ann. 2022;52(4):161-169.]

AB  - Sex differences in intelligence is among the most politically volatile topics in contemporary psychology. Although no single finding has unanimous support, conclusions from multiple studies suggest that females, on average, score higher on tasks that require rapid access to and use of phonological and semantic information in long-term memory, production and comprehension of complex prose, fine motor skills, and perceptual speed. Males, on average, score higher on tasks that require transformations in visual-spatial working memory, motor skills involved in aiming spatiotemporal responding, and fluid reasoning, especially in abstract mathematical and scientific domains. Males, however are also overrepresented in the low-ability end of several distributions, including mental retardation, attention disorders, dyslexia, stuttering, and delayed speech. A psychobiosocial model that is based an the inextricable links between the biological bases of intelligence and environmental events is proposed as an alternative to nature-nurture dichotomies. Societal implications and applications to teaching and learning are suggested.

AB  - Asylum-seeking and refugee women currently residing in Europe face unique challenges in the perinatal period. A range of social support interventions have been developed to address these challenges. However, little is known about which women value and why. A critical interpretive synthesis was undertaken using peer reviewed and grey literature to explore the nature, context and impact of these perinatal social support interventions on the wellbeing of asylum-seeking and refugee women. Four types of interventions were identified which had varying impacts on women's experiences. The impacts of the interventions were synthesised into five themes: Alleviation of being alone, Safety and trust, Practical knowledge and learning, being cared for and emotional support, and increased confidence in and beyond the intervention. The interventions which were most valued by women were those using a community-based befriending/peer support approach as these provided the most holistic approach to addressing women's needs.

AB  - Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been considered as a disorder of the motor neuron (MN) cell body, recent evidences show the non-cell-autonomous pathogenic nature of the disease. Axonal degeneration, loss of peripheral axons and destruction of nerve terminals are early events in the disease pathogenic cascade, anticipating MN degeneration, and the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, although ALS and peripheral axonal neuropathies should be differentiated in clinical practice, they also share damage to common molecular pathways, including axonal transport, RNA metabolism and proteostasis. Thus, an extensive evaluation of the molecular events occurring in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) could be fundamental to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of ALS, favoring the discovery of potential disease biomarkers, and new therapeutic targets.

KW  - ORIGIN
AB  - The ongoing incidence of schizophrenia is considered a paradox, as the disorder has genetic basis yet confers survival handicaps. Researchers have not reached consensus regarding theories explaining this contradiction. Major evolutionary theories hypothesize that schizophrenia is: (1) a byproduct of other evolutionary processes, (2) linked to survival advantages that counteract disadvantages, (3) associated with processes such as shamanism conferring advantages to groups, (4) a consequence of modern environments, (5) a result of random processes, such as mutations. A null hypothesis argues that philosophical or methodological problems render evolutionary paradigms inappropriate. These arguments are reviewed in light of an experience-centered approach, which regards experiential accounts as data. A ritual healing theory, derived from this orientation, has bearing on evolutionary theories pertaining to schizophrenia. This theory explains the nature of shamanism, which has features coinciding with schizophrenia. The ritual healing theory is supported by folklore, medical, and anthropological evidence, is amenable to empirical evaluation, and has clinical applications.

AB  - Bullying is a relationship problem in which power and aggression are used to cause distress to a vulnerable person. To assess and address bullying and victimization, we need to understand the nature of the problem, how the problem changes with age and differs for boys and girls, the relevant risk factors (those individual or environmental indicators that may lead to bullying and victimization), and the protective factors that buffer the impact of risk. For children involved in bullying, we need to assess its extent and the associated social, emotional, psychological, educational, and physical problems. Bullying is a systemic problem; therefore, assessments of bullying need to extend beyond the individual child to encompass the family, peer group, school, and community. We recommend that assessments at each of these levels reflect the scientific research on bullying and victimization. With attention to the problems associated with bullying, we can work collectively to make schools and communities safer for children and youth.

Investigations have concentrated on physical factors, and it is only recently that psychological factors have been examined. Work and personal factors have also been considered. Occupational stress has been found to be correlated with symptoms of the sick building syndrome, but much of the research has been of a cross-sectional nature, and it does not indicate whether stress is an active element or an outcome. There is a clear need for further research in this area to examine stress, personality and physical factors associated with the sick building syndrome longitudinally. There is also a clear need to assess the validity of the historical and self-report methods used to assess the sick building syndrome.

AB  - Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID), also known as body integrity dysphoria and xenomelia is a rare chronic psychiatric condition characterized by an intense and persistent desire to have one or both healthy limbs amputated or paralyzed. Affected individuals usually experience discomfort with being able-bodied.
   This disorder often causes significant distress and decreased quality of life, with patients believing they would be happier living as an amputee, sometimes mutilating themselves. Though very rare, most sufferers fail to complain to clinicians due to the embarrassing nature of their bizarre desire. As a result, the disorder is infrequently studied and lacks standardized diagnostic criteria and formal guidelines for psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy, underscoring the need for investigation and extensive empirical research.
   This study reviews the current knowledge and management of BIID to encourage recognition by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Disease (ICD).

AB  - Aggression management in psychiatric wards has been a difficult but important issue. Classical methods that have been used in aggression management in the past have a repressive-compelling nature and can cause emotional / physical harm. This has led to the emergence of alternative methods that provide flexibility for the management of aggression. Alternative methods consider the patient's feelings and what is wanted to be expressed. It recommends working with the patient to solve the problem, and in this way aims to reduce the potential harm to patients and health workers. In this article, the de-escalation model in the simple form, developed by Len Bowers (2014) as one of the alternative de-escalation methods, is explained. This model is thought to be a guide for clinical psychiatric nurses in creating a therapeutic environment focused on preventing aggression in psychiatric wards due to its ease of application, low cost, and solution-oriented approach.

AB  - The present paper argues that the development of a new methodology in studying the brain has resulted in a change of our views on the way it works, has seen the emergence of new ideas, and a considerable modification of traditionally accepted theories. The most significant are neuroplasticity, negative activity network (NAT), the nature of aphasic disorders, and the approach to the localization of brain functions. New brain imaging techniques have confirmed also the ability to change the neuronal circuits by mental force. Moreover, new techniques have brought about a rise in new methods for both the diagnosis and rehabilitation of individuals with various brain disorders. Most valuable in this respect has proved to be neurofeedback. We have concentrated on the most important contributions of Prof. Pachalska in the implementation and development of these new ideas on brain functioning. We also emphasize the fact that her theoretical considerations are firmly based upon her extensive (forty years) work with brain damaged patients.

AB  - Motor skills are among the most basic and prevalent types of knowledge that individuals must acquire over the life span, and observational learning is one of the primary ways in which individuals acquire new knowledge and skills. Observational learning of a motor skill involves: (1) observation of the model, which allows one to imitate and understand a modeled demonstration, and (2) self-observation, which allows one to actively regulate one's own learning and performance of a motor skill. Few, if any, theoretical treatments of observational learning examine how self-regulation influences observational learning of motor skill. The text examines observation of the modeled performance, including three moderators of observational learning: The properties of the model, the nature of the task, and observer determinants. Observer determinants are examined at length, especially self-regulation of learning (including the effects of perceived self-efficacy, goal setting, and expertise). (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - The developing normal brain shows a remarkable capacity for plastic change in response to a wide range of experiences including sensory and motor experience, psychoactive drugs, parent-child relationships, peer relationships, stress, gonadal hormones, intestinal flora, diet, and injury. The effects of injury vary with the precise age-at-injury, with the general result being that injury during cell migration and neuronal maturation has a poor functional outcome, whereas similar injury during synaptogenesis has a far better outcome. A variety of factors influence functional outcome including the nature of the behavior in question and the age at behavioral assessment as well as pre- and postinjury experiences. Here, we review the phases of brain development, how factors influence brain, and behavioral development in both the normal and perturbed brain, and propose mechanisms that may underlie these effects.

AB  - During the past few years, there has been a dramatic increase in research examining the role of memory in imagination and future thinking. This work has revealed striking similarities between remembering the past and imagining or simulating the future, including the finding that a common brain network underlies both memory and imagination. Here, we discuss a number of key points that have emerged during recent years, focusing in particular on the importance of distinguishing between temporal and nontemporal factors in analyses of memory and imagination, the nature of differences between remembering the past and imagining the future, the identification of component processes that comprise the default network supporting memory-based simulations, and the finding that this network can couple flexibly with other networks to support complex goal-directed simulations. This growing area of research has broadened our conception of memory by highlighting the many ways in which memory supports adaptive functioning.

AB  - Because immunological defence against pathogens is costly and merely reactive, human anti-pathogen defence is also characterized by proactive behavioural mechanisms that inhibit contact with pathogens in the first place. This behavioural immune system comprises psychological processes that infer infection risk from perceptual cues, and that respond to these perceptual cues through the activation of aversive emotions, cognitions and behavioural impulses. These processes are engaged flexibly, producing context-contingent variation in the nature and magnitude of aversive responses. These processes have important implications for human social cognition and social behaviour-including implications for social gregariousness, person perception, intergroup prejudice, mate preferences, sexual behaviour and conformity. Empirical evidence bearing on these many implications is reviewed and discussed. This review also identifies important directions for future research on the human behavioural immune system-including the need for enquiry into underlying mechanisms, additional behavioural consequences and implications for human health and well-being.

KW  - accountability
KW  - task experience
AB  - Auditors contend with an array of management personalities during the course of an audit engagement. Some clients by their nature are more likeable, while others create a stressful or unpleasant environment. We summarize two related research studies that examine whether and how a client's likeability influences auditors' fraud likelihood judgments. Results indicate that more likeable (dislikeable) clients cause lower (higher) auditor judgments of fraud likelihood. Results also indicate this bias operates indirectly by influencing the evaluation of evidence statements made by the client that relate to management pressures or attitudes rather than operating as a global bias on all evidence. Requiring an explanation for the judgment mitigates this bias, but only for experienced auditors. For inexperienced auditors and experienced non-audit CPAs, a prompt to "consider the opposite" mitigates the bias. These findings suggest that education and training can clarify relevant and irrelevant evidence cues in fraud judgments.

AB  - Purpose of Review Genetic testing for mental illness is likely to become increasingly prevalent as the science behind it is refined. This article identifies anticipated ethical challenges for patients, psychiatrists, and genetic counselors and makes recommendations for addressing them.
   Recent Findings Many of the ethical challenges of psychiatric genetic testing are likely to stem from failures to comprehend the nature and implications of test results. Recent studies have identified gaps in the knowledge base of psychiatrists and genetic counselors, which limit their abilities to provide patients with appropriate education. A small number of studies have demonstrated the value of counseling in empowering patients to deal with relevant genetic information.
   Summary Psychiatrists and other health professionals must be able to assist patients and families in making informed decisions about genetic testing and interpreting test results. Filling their knowledge gaps on these issues will be a critical step towards meeting these responsibilities.

This review explores new trends and prominent issues associated with injection drug use. The dynamic nature of injection drug use is underlined by examining its recent trends and changing patterns in Canada and other "high-income countries.'' Three research topics that could further contribute to the development of comprehensive prevention and intervention strategies aimed at people who inject drugs are also discussed: risk behaviours associated with the injection of prescription opioids, binge injection drug use, and mental health problems as determinants of injection risk behaviours.

The proposed model is composed of a representational component subserved by posterior brain regions (temporal and parietal) and an application/execution component subserved by prefrontal regions. Information processed in posterior regions is relayed through a limbic-paralimbic system, which is essential for the implementation of theory of mind processes. In addition to its clinical implications, the proposed model accounts for (1) the ability to mentalize about both the self and others, (2) the nature of the anatomic connections of the various brain regions and their functional correlates, and (3) theories pertaining to the inferencing mechanisms used during mental representation/attribution.

AB  - RECENT decades have seen a marked expansion in knowledge regarding human neurophysiology, and psychiatry is currently challenged with the task of integrating this information with a psychodynamic understanding of emotional life. In this paper we review portions of the relevant literature regarding the basic brain functions of affect, memory, and attachment, and we consider the implications of these data for integrated psychobiologic conceptualizations of emotional dysfunction and its treatment. In particular, data from these three areas of study point to the possibility that implicit memory of the early attachment relationship, communicated via the language of affect, is an enduring neural structure that influences both emotional self-regulation and behavior related to relatedness. Finally, we consider the implications of this proposition for the nature of psychotherapy, which from a psychobiologic view might be profitably conceptualized as a directed attachment relationship whose purpose is the revision of the implicit emotional memory of attachment.

AB  - Construction workers are at an elevated risk of heat stress, due to the strenuous nature of the work, high temperature work condition, and a changing climate. An increasing number of workers are at risk, as the industry's growth has been fueled by high demand and vast numbers of immigrant workers entering into the U.S., the Middle East and Asia to meet the demand. The risk of heat-related illnesses is increased by the fact that little to no regulations are present and/or enforced to protect these workers. This review recognizes the issues by summarizing epidemiological studies both in the U.S. and internationally. These studies have assessed the severity with which construction workers are affected by heat stress, risk factors and co-morbidities associated with heat-related illnesses in the construction industry, vulnerable populations, and efforts in implementing preventive measures.

AB  - X-ray topography-a well-known diffraction imaging method-is widely used for the characterization of extended crystal defects like dislocations. Herein, the progress toward the quantification besides the number and nature of dislocations is given. The diffracted images include additional information about tilt and strain, which can be measured in real-time, thanks to the improved digital detection systems. This allows not only the fast mapping of huge samples like 450 mm diameter Si wafers, the in situ observation of the dislocation, or crack dynamics at high temperatures, but also the stress analysis in electronic devices in operando. In addition to typical white X-ray beam methods like stacks of section topographs, the monochromatic diffraction laminography allows a 3D representation of the dislocation arrays. The merits and limitations of X-ray topography are demonstrated by semiconductor materials as an example.

AB  - Biological systems differ from the inanimate world in their behaviors ranging from simple movements to coordinated purposeful actions by large groups of muscles, to perception of the world based on signals of different modalities, to cognitive acts, and to the role of self-imposed constraints such as laws of ethics. Respectively, depending on the behavior of interest, studies of biological objects based on laws of nature (physics) have to deal with different salient sets of variables and parameters. Understanding is a high-level concept, and its analysis has been linked to other high-level concepts such as "mental model" and "meaning". Attempts to analyze understanding based on laws of nature are an example of the top-down approach. Studies of the neural control of movements represent an opposite, bottom-up approach, which starts at the interface with classical physics of the inanimate world and operates with traditional concepts such as forces, coordinates, etc. There are common features shared by the two approaches. In particular, both assume organizations of large groups of elements into task-specific groups, which can be described with only a handful of salient variables. Both assume optimality criteria that allow the emergence of families of solutions to typical tasks. Both assume predictive processes reflected in anticipatory adjustments to actions (motor and non-motor). Both recognize the importance of generating dynamically stable solutions. The recent progress in studies of the neural control of movements has led to a theory of hierarchical control with spatial referent coordinates for the effectors. This theory, in combination with the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis, allows quantifying the stability of actions with respect to salient variables. This approach has been used in the analysis of motor learning, changes in movements with typical and atypical development and with aging, and impaired actions by patients with various neurological disorders. It has been developed to address issues of kinesthetic perception. There seems to be hope that the two counter-directional approaches will meet and result in a single theoretical scheme encompassing biological phenomena from figuring out the best next move in a chess position to activating motor units appropriate for implementing that move on the chessboard.

AB  - Background Delusions are a common transdiagnostic feature of psychotic disorders, and their treatment remains suboptimal. Despite the pressing need to better understand the nature, meaning, and course of these symptoms, research into the lived experience of delusional phenomena in psychosis is scarce. Thus, we aimed to explore the lived experience and subjective apprehension of delusions in help-seeking individuals with psychosis, regardless of diagnosis and thematic content of the delusion.
   Methods In our systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science for qualitative studies published in English from database inception, with the last search on Sept 9, 2021. Grey literature search and hand-searching of relevant journals were also done. Studies were eligible if they provided an analysis of lived experience of delusions or predelusional phenomena presented from the perspective of individuals (age 14-65 years) who had developed a clinical high-risk stage of psychosis, or a diagnosable affective or non-affective psychotic disorder (as clinically defined, self-reported, or assessed within the primary study). Studies with only a subset of relevant participants were eligible only if data for the population of interest were reported separately. Studies that did not discriminate between the experience of delusion and other positive symptoms (eg, hallucinations) were included only if data for delusions were reported separately or could be extracted. First-person accounts (and author interpretations) discussing changes in the sense of self, lived world, and meaning in relation to delusions were extracted and synthesised using a novel thematic synthesis approach informed by a critical realist stance and a phenomenological theoretical framework. Analytic themes were developed into a new overarching framework for understanding the emergence of delusional phenomena. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020222104.
   Findings Of the 3265 records screened, 2115 were identified after duplicate removal. Of these, 1982 were excluded after title and abstract screening and 106 after full-text eligibility assessment. Of the 27 studies entering quality assessment, 24 eligible studies were included in the qualitative evidence synthesis, representing the perspectives of 373 help-seeking individuals with lived experience of delusions in the context of psychosis. Gender was reported as male (n=210), female (n=110), transgender (n=1), or not reported (n=52). Only 13 studies reported ethnicity, with White being predominant. The age of most participants ranged from 15 to 65 years. We found no eligible studies investigating subclinical or predelusional experiences in at-risk mental state populations through qualitative methods. Most studies were undertaken in western, educated, industrialised, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies, and most included participants had received or self-reported a diagnosis within the schizophrenia spectrum. Studies differed in relation to whether they focused on one kind or theme of delusion or delusional phenomena more generally as a unified category. Three superordinate themes relating to experiential changes and meanings in delusion were identified: (1) a radical rearrangement of the lived world dominated by intense emotions; (2) doubting, losing, and finding oneself again within delusional realities; and (3) searching for meaning, belonging, and coherence beyond mere dysfunction. Based on the review findings and thematic synthesis, we propose the Emergence Model of Delusion to advance understanding of delusional phenomena in psychosis.
   Interpretation Delusions are best understood as strongly individualised and inherently complex phenomena emerging from a dynamic interplay between interdependent subpersonal, personal, interpersonal, and sociocultural processes. Integrative approaches to research on delusion, which consider their potential adaptiveness and favour explanatory pluralism, might be advantageous. Effective clinical care for individuals with psychosis might need adapting to match more closely, and take account of, the subjective experience and meaning of delusions as they are lived through, which might also help redress power imbalances and enduring epistemic injustices in mental health.

AB  - What is the nature of feeling hurt? This question is answered by systematically reviewing and integrating theories and empirical findings on feeling hurt using Lazarus' theory of emotion. Following this approach, feeling hurt is constituted by a primary appraisal of an illegitimate devaluation and by a secondary appraisal of low controllability. This appraisal pattern activates an action tendency to withdraw from an interaction. This theory leads to several hypotheses for the appraisal (e.g., that an increase in appraisals of controllability should turn hurt into anger) on facial, bodily, and behavioral expressions as well as on the communicative function of feeling hurt. Furthermore, important conceptual distinctions between a broad and a narrow concept of feeling hurt as well as between feeling hurt as an emotion and a long-term emotional episode of hurt are introduced. Finally, feeling hurt is compared with humiliation, shame, guilt, disappointment, sadness, and anger.

AB  - Simple SummaryThe cytoskeleton is a network of protein fibres within cells that provide structure and support intracellular transport. Focal adhesions are protein complexes associated with the outer cell membrane that are found at the ends of specialised actin fibres of this cytoskeleton. They mediate cell adhesion by connecting the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, a protein and sugar network that surrounds cells in tissues. Focal adhesions also translate forces on actin fibres into forces contributing to cell migration. Cell adhesion and migration are crucial to diverse biological processes such as embryonic development, proper functioning of the immune system or the metastasis of cancer cells. Advances in fluorescence microscopy and data analysis methods provided a more detailed understanding of the dynamic ways in which proteins bind and dissociate from focal adhesions and how they are organised within these protein complexes. In this review, we provide an overview of the advances in the current scientific understanding of focal adhesions and summarize relevant imaging techniques. One of the key insights is that focal adhesion proteins are organised into three layers parallel to the cell membrane. We discuss the relevance of this layered nature for the functioning of focal adhesion.The cytoskeleton provides structure to cells and supports intracellular transport. Actin fibres are crucial to both functions. Focal Adhesions (FAs) are large macromolecular multiprotein assemblies at the ends of specialised actin fibres linking these to the extracellular matrix. FAs translate forces on actin fibres into forces contributing to cell migration. This review will discuss recent insights into FA protein dynamics and their organisation within FAs, made possible by advances in fluorescence imaging techniques and data analysis methods. Over the last decade, evidence has accumulated that FAs are composed of three layers parallel to the plasma membrane. We focus on some of the most frequently investigated proteins, two from each layer, paxillin and FAK (bottom, integrin signalling layer), vinculin and talin (middle, force transduction layer) and zyxin and VASP (top, actin regulatory layer). Finally, we discuss the potential impact of this layered nature on different aspects of FA behaviour.

AB  - Across the world, recent decades have witnessed large scale and rapid urbanization. Centralized wastewater treatment is typically considered the most desirable solution to meet domestic wastewater treatment needs in growing urban centers. These rely on extensive-and often expensive-infrastructure and treatment solutions that require expert engineering management to ensure effective operation. It is argued that the urban sustainability challenge of inadequate sanitation, deteriorating water quality, and rising water stress are best met through poly-centric and integrated approaches that include nature-based solutions, community-scale and community-managed systems. Today's objectives are to create climate-resilient, enduring, self-governing systems-as well as systems that close the loop, encouraging resource re-use and recycling. This policy review informs on wastewater discharge (and related) standards for sewage treatment plants within the context of present-day India. With its booming urban population, highly visible and impactful pollution, water quality and insecurity challenges, India provides huge opportunities for creative approaches to urban sanitation-but to fully exploit these opportunities will require new policy and regulatory thinking. The current regulatory developments are undergoing frequent changes with observed inconsistencies over the last years leading to a growing confusion in the sector. Examined questions include: How clear are policy objectives and regulations? What are reasons for observed inconsistencies in current pollution control regulations and what are their implications? How well-aligned are standards and regulation with these objectives? How forward-looking? Are solutions sufficiently responsive to the urban sustainability challenge? In particular, this review considers whether regulatory approaches disadvantage decentralized and innovative approaches that could offer resilient, community-based systems-even within the megacities of the twenty-first century. This study further draws on examples from other emerging economies-and contextualizes these examples with the situation in Western Europe, where a single set of targets has let to diverse solutions. Standards and regulations need to be reimagined for this evolving urban context which might require it to become more nuanced, more holistic, more dynamic, more transparent, more participative, and more contextual. Enforcement mechanisms will need to incorporate phased/graded approaches to compliance-to suit various contexts that could include water reuse for different application areas.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have received global concern due to its widespread contamination, ingestion in aquatic organisms and the ability to cross the biological barrier. However, our understanding of its bioaccumulation, toxicity, and interaction with other environmental pollutants is limited. Zebrafish is increasingly used to study the bioaccumulation and toxicity of environmental contaminants because of their small size, ease of breed, short life cycle and inexpensive maintenance. The transparent nature of zebrafish embryo and larvae provides excellent experimental advantages over other model organisms in studying the localization of fluorescent-labeled MPs/NPs particles. Zebrafish outplays the traditional rodent models with the availability of transgenic lines, high-throughput sequencing and genetic similarities to humans. All these characteristics provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the toxicity of MPs/NPs and associated contaminants. This review summarizes the existing literature on MPs/NPs research in zebrafish and suggests a path forward for future research.

AB  - The link between disruptions in emotional/motivational systems and chronic functional impairments in individuals with schizophrenia has been well substantiated. However, attempts to delineate the exact nature of these disruptions have been complicated by the reality that schizophrenia is a markedly heterogeneous disorder. In this article, we integrate findings from schizophrenia, neuroscience, and basic psychology literatures to advance the hypothesis that emotional deficits occur via two separate, mutually exclusive pathways: "ambivalence" - characterized by intact hedonic and abnormally co-activated negative emotion systems, and "apathy" - characterized by anhedonia and relatively sparse negative emotion. Further examination of how negative affect manifests differently across patients will be an important focus of future research, particularly given that the "downstream" social and occupational consequences of these abnormalities may appear similar but reflect dramatically divergent etiologies.

AB  - The rural health care system has changed dramatically over the past decade because of a general transformation of health care financing, the introduction of new technologies, and the clustering of health services into systems and networks. Despite these changes, resources for rural health systems remain relatively insufficient. Many rural communities continue to experience shortages of physicians, and the proportion of rural hospitals under financial stress is much greater than that of urban hospitals. The health care conditions of selected rural areas compare unfavorably with the rest of the nation. The marker and governmental policies have attempted to address some of these disparities by encouraging network development and telemedicine and by changing the rules for Medicare payments to providers. The public health infrastructure in rural America is not well understood but is potentially the most fragile aspect of the rural health care continuum.

AB  - The peptide transmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and its receptor, the type 3 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR3, GRM3), are prevalent and widely distributed in the mammalian nervous system. Drugs that inhibit the inactivation of synaptically released NAAG have procognitive activity in object recognition and other behavioral models. These inhibitors also reverse cognitive deficits in animal models of clinical disorders. Antagonists of mGluR3 block these actions and mice that are null mutant for this receptor are insensitive to the actions of these procognitive drugs. A positive allosteric modulator of this receptor also has procognitive activity. While some data suggest that drugs acting on mGluR3 achieve their procognitive action by increasing arousal during acquisition training, exploration of the procognitive efficacy of NAAG is in its early stages and thus substantial opportunities exist to define the breadth and nature of this activity.

AB  - Micro-expression (ME) recognition has attracted numerous interests within the computer vision circle in different contexts particularly, localization, magnification, and recognition. Challenges in these areas remain relevant due to the nature of ME's split-second transition with minute intensity levels. In this paper, a comprehensive state-of-the-art analysis of ME recognition and detection challenges are provided. Contemporary solutions are categorized into low-level, mid-level, and high-level solutions with a review of their characteristics and performances. This paper also provides possible extensions to basic methods, highlight, and predict emerging trends. A thorough analysis of mainstream ME datasets is also provided by elucidating each of their advantages and limitations. This survey gives readers an understanding of ME recognition and an appreciation of future research direction in ME recognition systems.

AB  - Although our sensory experience is mostly multisensory in nature, research on working memory representations has focused mainly on examining the senses in isolation. Results from the multisensory processing literature make it clear that the senses interact on a more intimate manner than previously assumed. These interactions raise questions regarding the manner in which multisensory information is maintained in working memory. We discuss the current status of research on multisensory processing and the implications of these findings on our theoretical understanding of working memory. To do so, we focus on reviewing working memory research conducted from a multisensory perspective, and discuss the relation between working memory, attention, and multisensory processing in the context of the predictive coding framework. We argue that a multisensory approach to the study of working memory is indispensable to achieve a realistic understanding of how working memory processes maintain and manipulate information.

HSPB2/MKBP (myotonic dystrophy kinase-bind-protein) retains the structural motif of the a-crystallin family of HSPs but shows a unique nature compared with canonical family members, characterized by gene allocation, specific binding partners in skeletal muscle, and unique stress responsiveness. MKBP may be involved in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy and contribute to the neuropathology in both Alzheimer's disease and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Dutch type.

AB  - A review was made of the literature on Huntington's disease, including the clinical neurology, recent advances in pathophysiology and genetic mechanisms and psychopathology. It can be concluded that research on the latter is scarce, although the subject is relevant because of the co-occurrence of psychiatric, neurological and genetic phenomena, which may lead to novel concepts in the understanding of brain function. So far, attempts to provide a comprehensive and pragmatic description of the psychopathology of Huntington's disease have been disappointing, probably due to the limitations of the DSM classification system in this disorder. Future research should focus not only on this classification system, but also on neuropsychological functioning, because of the degenerative nature of the disease. Systematic and controlled studies should be performed on the treatment of psychiatric abnormalities in Huntington's disease before any conclusions can be drawn.

AB  - Based on the tenets of parental investment theory, the authors postulate that there was greater pressure to inhibit potentially maladaptive emotional, social, and sexual responses on prehistoric women than men in some contexts. resulting in enhanced inhibitory abilities in women in some domains. They reviewed studies whose researchers examined gender differences on social, behavioral, and cognitive tasks involving inhibition and found gender differences favoring female humans most consistent for social tasks (e.g., control of emotions), somewhat less pronounced for behavioral tasks (e.g., delay of gratification), and weak and inconsistent for cognitive tasks (e.g., conceptual tempo). This pattern was interrupted as being consistent with the position that gender differences in inhibition are relatively domain specific in nature, with women demonstrating greater abilities on tasks related to reproduction and childrearing, which is consistent with parental investment theory.

AB  - Causal knowledge plays a crucial role in human thought, but the nature of causal representation and inference remains a puzzle. Can human causal inference be captured by relations of probabilistic dependency, or does it draw on richer forms of representation? This article explores this question by reviewing research in reasoning, decision making, various forms of judgment, and attribution. We endorse causal Bayesian networks as the best normative framework and as a productive guide to theory building. However, it is incomplete as an account of causal thinking. On the basis of a range of experimental work, we identify three hallmarks of causal reasoning-the role of mechanism, narrative, and mental simulation-all of which go beyond mere probabilistic knowledge. We propose that the hallmarks are closely related. Mental simulations are representations over time of mechanisms. When multiple actors are involved, these simulations are aggregated into narratives.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the balance of the autonomic nervous system and is associated with cognitive functions. However, its relationship with the process related to making a decision is unclear. This systematic review aims to analyze the relationship between HRV and decision-making. A qualitative analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA-Statement. Fifteen studies were included, with a total of 1051 healthy participants. Our results show an association between higher vagally mediated HRV and better decision-making performance, especially under risk and uncertainty. At the same time, a lower HRV is associated with lower performance in developing good decisions. This systematic review highlights the influence of the autonomic nervous system in decision-making processes. HRV could be considered a biomarker of making decisions. However, the nature of this relationship is still difficult to clarify, and further studies are needed.

AB  - Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are the most common developmental disorders present in humans. Combined, they affect between 3 and 5% of the population. Additionally, they can be found together in the same individual thereby complicating treatment.
   The causative factors (genes, epigenetic and environmental) are quite varied and likely interact so as to further complicate the assessment of an individual patient. Nonetheless, much valuable information has been gained by identifying candidate genes for ID or ASD. Understanding the etiology of either ID or ASD is of utmost importance for families. It allows a determination of the risk of recurrence, the possibility of other comorbidity medical problems, the molecular and cellular nature of the pathobiology and hopefully potential therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The question of whether to view psychopathology as categorical or dimensional continues to provoke debate. We review the many facets of this argument. These include the pragmatics of measurement; the needs of clinical practice; our ability to distinguish categories from dimensions empirically; methods of analysis appropriate to each and how they relate; and the potential theoretical biases associated with each approach. We conclude that much of the debate is misconceived in that we do not observe pathology directly; rather, we observe its properties. The same pathology can have some properties that are most easily understood using a dimensional conceptualization while at the same time having other properties that are best understood categorically. We suggest replacing Meehl's analogy involving qualitatively distinct species with an alternative analogy with the "duality" of light, a phenomenon with both wave- and particle-like properties.

AB  - Although numerous efforts have been made to deepen our understanding of the etiology of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), no explanation of its origins, nor of its consequences, has yet found a consensus within the scientific community. This study performs a theoretical review of various research studies and provides a reflection on the role of emotions in the origin of the disorder, at the neuroanatomical and functional level. To this end, theoretical models (single and multiple origin) and applied studies are reviewed in order to broaden the perspective on the relevance of the executive system in ADHD; it is suggested that this construct is not only composed and activated by cognitive processes and functions, but also includes elements of an emotional and motivational nature. Consequently, it is shown that ADHD is involved in social development and in a person's ability to adapt to the environment.

AB  - Representations of space in mind are crucial for navigation, facilitating processes such as remembering landmark locations, understanding spatial relationships between objects, and integrating routes. A significant problem, however, is the lack of consensus on how these representations are encoded and stored in memory. Specifically, the nature of egocentric and allocentric frames of reference in human memory is widely debated. Yet, in recent investigations of the spatial domain across the lifespan, these distinctions in mnemonic spatial frames of reference have identified age-related impairments. In this review, we survey the ways in which different terms related to spatial representations in memory have been operationalized in past aging research and suggest a taxonomy to provide a common language for future investigations and theoretical discussion.

KW  - BEREAVEMENT REACTIONS
KW  - DEPRESSION
KW  - WIDOWHOOD
AB  - The psychoanalytic model of mourning, while useful in its depiction of a certain type of process, may not be valid as a general model. The author of this paper reviews the development of the standard psychoanalytic model of mourning and offers a critique from several perspectives. First, the psychoanalytic literature and data from clinical practice fails to confirm basic components of mourning theory. Second some non-analytic research is at odds with several of the model's key assumptions, and historical studies have shown how individuals in western culture have mourned differently over time. Finally, from a cross-cultural perspective it is also clear that there is infinite variety in people's responses to death, in how they mourn, and in the nature of their internalisation of the lost object. In closing, a perspective on bereavement is proposed that, rather than being process-oriented, understands mourning to be an adaptive response to specific task demands arising from loss which must be dealt with regardless of individual, culture or historical era.

AB  - Evidence suggests that individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate emotion-processing deficits. However, the nature and extent of emotion abnormalities in individuals considered at risk for schizophrenia have not been previously summarized. This article provides a review of the recent literature pertaining to emotion processing in 3 at-risk populations: those at familial high risk, those with schizotypal characteristics, and those in the putative prodrome to psychosis. Studies are reviewed across the components of emotion perception, experience, and expression. Further, we discuss investigations into psychophysiology, brain structure, and brain function that employ emotion probes. Review of the literature suggests that individuals at high risk demonstrate similar abnormalities to those with schizophrenia but at an attenuated level. The most robust findings in at-risk groups are in the areas of reduced emotion perception, self-reported anhedonia, and increased negative affect. We conclude with an agenda for future research.

AB  - What is the source of the perception of excessive fatigue in the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)? Studies of physiological response to aerobic activity, of muscle pathology and muscle function in CFS, are reviewed, and suggest that the subjective report of fatigue is not due to any peripheral impairment. In addition, current technological methods such as electroencephalography have failed to uncover the nature of any abnormality in the central motor unit. A physiological model which proposes that patients with CFS possess a reduced threshold for sensory fatigue signals is rejected, because it fails to account for recent findings. Instead, it is suggested that the perception of fatigue in CFS is enhanced by idiosyncrasies in cognitive processing. The implications of this view to our understanding of the perpetuation of CFS as a whole are explored. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Whether there are common features inherent to the psychology of Indigenous peoples around the globe has been the subject of much debate. We argue that Indigenous peoples share the experience of colonization and its social and psychological consequences. We develop this argument across four sections: (a) the global history of colonization and social inequalities; (b) aspects concerning identity and group processes, including the intergenerational transmission of shared values, the connection with nature, and the promotion of social change; (c) prejudice and discrimination toward Indigenous peoples and the role of psychological processes to improve relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples; and (d) the impact of historical trauma and colonialism on dimensions including cognition, mental health, and the well-being of Indigenous peoples as well as the basis for successful interventions that integrate Indigenous knowledge. Finally, we address future challenges for research on these topics.

This paper compares different designs of biomimetic robotic fishes performing Body and/or Caudal Fin (BCF) swimming locomotion, and stresses how the designs evolve. The general trend is to utilize a simpler and more robust mechanism to make biomimetic robotic fishes mimic their counterparts in nature better, at the same time, to exhibit better swimming performances. Representative studies are given and discussed. Challenges of current studies are summarized and future research directions are presented. With state-of-the-art engineering and biological technologies, the biomimetic robotic fishes have great potentials in some areas where the conventional screw propellers are not applicable, like narrow space navigation and eco-friendly environment monitoring.

AB  - Some research has examined emotional intelligence among gifted individuals, but these individual studies have provided mixed results. The present meta-analysis aimed to clarify the nature of the relationship between emotional intelligence and giftedness. Hedge's unbiased g was used as the effect size metric, and a 3-level multilevel meta-analytic approach was applied, due to the dependency among the effect sizes obtained from the same study. The analyses used 81 effect sizes, from 17 published studies, and indicated that there was a significant difference between gifted and non-gifted participants in terms of emotional intelligence in favor of gifted individuals (g = 0.120, p = .023, 95% CI [0.031, 0.208]). The moderator analyses revealed that gifted individuals tended to be more emotionally intelligent when emotional intelligence is measured based on ability, but not trait models. The implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.

AB  - When good things happen, individuals will often retell this good news to others, a process termed capitalization. In so doing, individuals sharing their good news (i.e., capitalizers) boost their mood and relationships with the person(s) to whom they retell their news (i.e., responders). Most extant research has focused on the benefits for the capitalizers. Capitalization, however, is a social process that affects both capitalizers and responders, and research has only begun to explore the benefits of capitalization for responders. In this article, we provide a fresh perspective on the state of this literature by proposing the interpersonal model of capitalization (InterCAP). We illustrate how InterCAP (a) integrates and organizes existing research and theory, (b) formally emphasizes the interpersonal and iterative nature of the capitalization process, and (c) identifies gaps in current knowledge. We conclude by offering recommendations for integrating InterCAP with other theoretical models and suggestions for future research.

AB  - Mapping numbers onto space is a common cognitive representation that has been explored in both behavioral and neuroimaging contexts. Empirical work probing the diverse nature of these spatial-numerical associations (SNAs) has led researchers to question 1) how the human brain links numbers with space, and 2) whether this link is biologically vs. culturally determined. We review the existing literature on the development of SNAs and situate that empirical work within cognitive and neuroscientific theoretical frameworks. We propose that an evolutionarily-ancient frontal-parietal circuit broadly tuned to multiple magnitude dimensions provides the phylogenetic substrate for SNAs, while enculturation and sensorimotor experience shape their specific profiles. We then use this perspective to discuss educational implications and highlight promising avenues for future research.

AB  - Social interactions are characterized by distinct forms of interdependence, each of which has unique effects on how behavior unfolds within the interaction. Despite this, little is known about the psychological mechanisms that allow people to detect and respond to the nature of interdependence in any given interaction. We propose that interdependence theory provides clues regarding the structure of interdependence in the human ancestral past. In turn, evolutionary psychology offers a framework for understanding the types of information processing mechanisms that could have been shaped under these recurring conditions. We synthesize and extend these two perspectives to introduce a new theory: functional interdependence theory (FIT). FIT can generate testable hypotheses about the function and structure of the psychological mechanisms for inferring interdependence. This new perspective offers insight into how people initiate and maintain cooperative relationships, select social partners and allies, and identify opportunities to signal social motives.

AB  - The well-respected tradition of research on concepts uses cross-cultural comparisons to explore which aspects of conceptual behavior are universal versus culturally variable. This work continues, but it is being supplemented by intensified efforts to study how conceptual systems and cultural systems interact to modify and support each other. For example, cultural studies within the framework of domain specificity (e.g., folkphysics, folkpsychology, folkbiology) are beginning to query the domains themselves and offer alternative organizing principles (e.g., folksociology, folkecology). Findings highlight the multifaceted nature of both concepts and culture: Individuals adopt distinct conceptual construals in accordance with culturally infused systems such as language and discourse, knowledge and beliefs, and epistemological orientations. This picture complicates questions about cognitive universality or variability, suggesting that researchers may productively adopt a systems-level approach to conceptual organization and cultural epistemologies. Related implications for diversity in cognitive science are discussed.

AB  - Although responses are sometimes easy to predict, at other times responding seems highly variable, unpredictable, or even random. The inability to predict is generally attributed to ignorance of controlling variables, but this article is a review of research showing that the highest levels of behavioral variability may result from identifiable reinforcers contingent on such variability. That is, variability is an operant. Discriminative stimuli and reinforcers control it, resulting in low or high variability, depending on the contingencies. Schedule-of-reinforcement effects are orderly, and choosing to vary or repeat is lawfully governed by relative reinforcement frequencies. The operant nature of variability has important implications. For example, learning, exploring, creating, and problem solving may partly depend on it. Abnormal levels of variability, including those found in psychopathologies such as autism, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, may be modified through reinforcement. Operant variability may also help to explain some of the unique attributes of voluntary action.

AB  - Motor imagery has been studied using subjective, behavioural and physiological methods and this paper reviews theoretical and practical issues from all three viewpoints. Attempts to measure motor imagery on a subjective scale have met with limited success but alternative methods are proposed. Research on mental practice suggests a number of different processes may be needed to explain the variety and variability of effects obtained. Recent studies of spatial and motor working memory signify the importance of a primarily visuo-spatial component in which actions are consciously represented together with a more properly motoric component which must be activated to generate either images or overt actions. Finally the question of whether motor imagery is primarily perceptual or motoric in character does not have a simple neurophysiological answer due to the highly distributed nature of motor control. Nevertheless some of the key mechanisms serving both spatial and motoric components have been provisionally identified.

TI  - RELINQUISHING CUSTODY AS A REQUISITE FOR RECEIVING SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISORDERS - A REVIEW
AB  - A review of the literature was conducted to assess the extent and nature of the practice of requiring parents to transfer custody in order to receive public funding for intensive services needed by their child/adolescent who had a serious emotional disorder. The review focused on the legal and policy basis of this practice as well as its social and psychological impact on child and family. We conclude that the practice of transfer of custody as a requirement for receiving financial aid occurs in a majority of states, though the actual extent of this practice is not known. The major factor influencing the use of transfer of custody appears to be the absence of an appropriate and adequate system of services for children and adolescents with serious emotional disorders. We recommend that the practice of requiring custody transfer for the sole purpose of receiving services be abolished and offer several suggestions for improving access to services.

AB  - An emerging focus on the geometry of representational structures is advancing a variety of areas in social perception, including social categorization, emotion perception, and trait impressions. Here, we review recent studies adopting a representational geometry approach, and argue that important advances in social perception can be gained by triangulating on the structure of representations via three levels of analysis: neuroimaging, behavioral measures, and computational modeling. Among other uses, this approach permits broad and comprehensive tests of how bottom-up facial features and visual processes as well as top-down social cognitive factors and conceptual processes shape perceptions of social categories, emotion, and personality traits. Although such work is only in its infancy, a focus on corroborating representational geometry across modalities is allowing researchers to use multiple levels of analysis to constrain theoretical models in social perception. This approach holds promise to further our understanding of the multiply determined nature of social perception and its neural basis.

AB  - This is a review of recent advances in our understanding of the sensory modalities of touch, temperature sensitivity, and pain. Most of the research described is psychophysical or perceptual in nature, but physiological and imaging studies are included when they sharpen issues or reveal underlying mechanisms. Coverage of touch research comprises the subjects of acuity, vibrotaction and texture perception, perception of location and movement, tactile attention, and cross-modal phenomena. For pain, the covered topics are central sensitization, pain-touch and pain-pain interactions, placebo effects, the role of attention and emotion in pain, and the genetics of pain. For touch, the topics are arranged roughly in order of increasing cognitive involvement, but such an ordering is not feasible for pain, where attitudes and expectations can substantially affect even the most "sensory" of judgments.

AB  - Music cognition depends on the existence and deployment of processes for detecting, storing and organizing musical materials according to underlying structural features. Common cultural experiences develop these processes to a certain degree, but specifically designed and supported learning environments are required to achieve the levels of expertise required to perform western art music. Certain motivational and social factors are therefore implicated in the maintenance of activities that promote skill-acquisition, such as practice. Expert musical performance is not just a matter of technical motor skill, it also requires the ability to generate expressively different performances of the same piece of music according to the nature of intended structural and emotional communication. This review examines these abilities and describes how some of them have been shown to have lawful relationships to objective musical and extra-musical parameters. Psychological research is thus engaged in a process of demystifying musical expertise, a process that helps to improve upon culturally prevalent. but ultimately non-explanatory, notions of inborn 'talent'.

AB  - Trust and reciprocity are cornerstones of human nature, both at the levels of close interpersonal relationships and economic/societal structures. Being able to both place trust in others and decide whether to reciprocate trust placed in us is rooted in implicit and explicit processes that guide expectations of others, help reduce social uncertainty, and build relationships. This review will highlight neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity, through the lens of implicit and explicit social appraisal and learning processes. Significant consideration will be given to the neural underpinnings of these implicit and explicit processes, and special focus will center on the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms facilitating the integration of implicit and explicit signals supporting trust and reciprocity. Finally, this review will conclude with a discussion of how we can leverage findings regarding the neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity to better inform our understanding of mental health disorders characterized by social dysfunction.

AB  - Conclusions about secondary control have been hindered by researchers' disparate interpretations of the construct. The current review offers it definition that reflects commonality among researchers and the spirit of the original article (F. Rothbaum, J. R. Weisz, & S. S. Snyder, 1982): Secondary control refers to the process by which People adjust some aspect of the self and accept circumstances as they are. The authors also identify a "fit versus control" dimension, along which secondary control research can be classified and reviewed. The authors conclude that fit-focused secondary control is adaptive for coping, is relatively preferred in interdependent cultural contexts, and may serve the motivation for relatedness. Control-focused definitions lead to different interpretations of the function and cultural nature of secondary control. The proposed definition and dimension should enable researchers to articulate assumptions about the function and correlates of secondary control.

AB  - During the recognition of faces, the incoming perceptual information is matched against mental representations of familiar faces stored in memory. Face space models describe an abstract concept of face representations and their mental organization, in which facial representations are located on various characteristic dimensions, depending on their specific facial characteristics. However, these models are defined just as incompletely as the general understanding of face recognition. We took two phenomena from face processing to better understand face recognition, and so the nature of face space: face adaptation and face priming. The face literature has mainly focused on face adaptation, largely neglecting face priming when trying to integrate outcomes regarding face recognition into the face space framework. Consequently, the present paper aims to review both phenomena and their contributions to face recognition, representation, and face space.

AB  - Regulation of cell volume is an essential function of most mammalian cells. In the cells of the central nervous system, maintenance of cell osmolarity and, hence, volume, is particularly crucial because of the restrictive nature of the skull. Cell volume regulation involves a variety of pathways, with considerable differences between cell types. One common pathway activated during hypo-osmotic stress involves chloride (Cl-) channels. However, hypo-osmotically stimulated anion permeability can be regulated by a diverse array of second messengers. Although neuronal swelling can occur in a number of pathological and nonpathological conditions, our understanding of neuronal volume regulation is limited. This article summarizes our current understanding of the role of anion channels during neuronal volume regulation.

AB  - A reconceptualization of stigma is presented that changes the emphasis from the devaluation of an individual's identity to the process by which individuals who satisfy certain criteria come to be excluded from various kinds of social interactions. The authors propose that phenomena currently placed under the general rubric of stigma involve a set of distinct psychological systems designed by natural selection to solve specific problems associated with sociality. In particular, the authors suggest that human beings possess cognitive adaptations designed to cause them to avoid poor social exchange partners, join cooperative groups (for purposes of between-group competition and exploitation), and avoid contact with those who are differentially likely to carry communicable pathogens. The evolutionary view contributes to the current conceptualization of stigma by providing an account of the ultimate function of stigmatization and helping to explain its consensual nature.

AB  - This article reviews the peer-reviewed and grey literature published from January 1985 to November 2022 that has quantitatively evaluated the effects of personalized budgets for people with disabilities (PwDs), in terms of a range of benefit and cost outcomes. Benefit metrics of interest comprised measures of well-being, service satisfaction and use, quality of life, health, and unmet needs. A search was conducted using the PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, ASSIA, and Social Care Online databases. Based on inclusion criteria and a quality assessment using the Downs and Black Checklist, a final count of 23 studies were identified for in-depth review. Given the heterogeneous nature of the studies, a narrative synthesis, rather than a formal meta-analysis, was undertaken. Taking the relatively scarce and often methodologically limited evidence base at face value, the findings suggest that-overall-personalized budget users tend to benefit in terms of well-being and service satisfaction outcomes, with the exception of mixed effects for people with mental health conditions. Only a minority of studies have investigated the cost-effectiveness or costs-only of personalized budgets, finding mixed results. Two out of the three cost-effectiveness studies find personal budgets to be more cost-effective than alternative options, meaning that the possibly higher costs of personalized budgets may be more than outweighed by additional benefits. Some evidence looking at service use and/or costs only also points to significant reductions in certain service use areas, which at least hints at the potential that personalized budgeting may-in some cases-entail reduced costs. Further research is needed to explore the generalizability of these conclusions and to better capture and understand the factors driving the observed heterogeneity in some of the results.

AB  - Nanotechnology is one of the promising techniques and shares wide ranges of applications almost in every field of life. Nanomaterials are getting continuous attractions due to specific physical and chemical properties and being applied as multifunctional material. The use of nanomaterials/nanoparticles in agriculture sector for crop improvement and protection against various environmental threats have attained greater significance. Size and nature of nanoparticles, mode of application, environmental conditions, rhizospheric and phyllospheric environment, and plant species are major factors that influence the action of nanoparticles. The mode or method of nanoparticle applications to plants is attaining greater attentions. Recently, different methods for nanoparticle applications (seed priming, foliar, and root application) are being used to improve crop growth. It is of quite worth that which method is suitable for nanoparticle application, and how nanoparticles can possibly translocate to various plant tissues from root to shoot or vice versa. These information's are poorly understood and need more investigations to explore the comprehensive mechanism by which nanoparticles make their possible entry through different plant organs and how they transport to regulate various physiological and molecular functions in plant cells. Therefore, this study comprehensively provides the knowledge of nanoparticles uptake via seed priming, foliar exposure, and root application, and their possible translocation mechanism within plants influenced by various factors that has not clearly presented. This study will provide new insights to find out an actual uptake and translocation mechanism of nanoparticles that may help researchers to develop nanoparticle-based new strategies for plants to cope with various environmental challenges. This study also focuses on different soil factors or above ground factors that are involved in nanoparticles uptake and translocation and ultimately their functioning in plants.

AB  - Background: There is renewed focus on the complement system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In addition to providing aetiological insights, consistently dysregulated complement proteins in serum or plasma may have clinical utility as biomarkers.
   Methods: We performed a systematic literature review searching PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO for studies measuring complement system activity or complement protein concentrations in serum or plasma from patients with schizophrenia compared to controls. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled effect estimates (Hedges' g standardised mean difference [SMD]) for complement proteins whose concentrations were measured in three or more studies. The review was pre-registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42018109012).
   Results: Database searching identified 1146 records. Fifty-eight full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 24 studies included. Seven studies measured complement system activity. Activity of the classical pathway did not differ between cases and controls in four of six studies, and conflicting results were noted in two studies of alternative pathway activity. Twenty studies quantified complement protein concentrations of which complement components 3 (C3) and 4 (C4) were measured in more than three studies. Meta-analyses showed no evidence of significant differences between cases and controls for 11 studies of C3 (SMD 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.29-0.36) and 10 studies of C4 (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.21-0.41).
   Conclusions: Serological studies provide mixed evidence regarding dysregulation of the complement system in schizophrenia. Larger studies of a longitudinal nature, focusing on early phenotypes, could provide further insights regarding the potential role of the complement system in psychotic disorders.

AB  - Background: There have been significant changes in the nature of psychiatric patient populations and patterns of drug prescribing in mood disorders since serum lithium monitoring was introduced. It seems opportune to review current guidelines for target lithium concentration given the decline in lithium monotherapy and increase in the numbers of older people and those with comorbid physical disease administered lithium.
   Method: A review was made of the literature of lithium monitoring and target serum concentration in mood disorders, older people, and comorbid physical illness.
   Results: Current guidelines, which generally recommend a target serum concentration of 0.5/0.6 to 1.1/1.2 mmol/L, have a number of limitations. A target lithium level of >0.8 mmol/L is inappropriate given poor tolerability, and adequate efficacy when combination lithium-antipsychotic therapy is used at this or lower levels. Guidelines have largely failed to match specific clinical indications to serum levels, and to consider comorbid physical illness factors known to be associated with lithium toxicity.
   Conclusion: For most patients, a target serum lithium concentration range of 0.5-0.8 mmol/L, varying according to clinical indication, age and concurrent physical status, seems most appropriate in enhancing efficacy and minimizing adverse effects. The lower end of this range (0.5-0.6 mmol/L) is recommended for patients 50 years and over; those with diabetes insipidus, renal impairment or thyroid dysfunction; those administered diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/COX-2 inhibitors; and in the prophylaxis of bipolar depression and management of acute unipolar depression. The higher end of this range (0.7-0.8 mmol/L) is recommended in the management of acute mania and prophylaxis of mania.

AB  - Background: There is a paucity of literature that addresses the health vulnerabilities of readymade garment (RMG) workers in South and Southeast Asian regions. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to identify the distinctive types of health vulnerabilities along with the causes and consequences of these vulnerabilities of the RMG workers in South and Southeast Asian regions.
   Methods: Systematic review search methods were applied utilising the PRISMA protocol. Literature published between July 2007 to June 2017 on health vulnerabilities of the RMG workers of South and Southeast Asian countries were identified through electronic databases and manual searches.
   Results: A total number of 19 studies (16 quantitative studies, 3 mixed-method studies) were included from the primary 17,001 papers identified. The quality of these studies was assessed by using the EPHPP (effective public health practice project) and the CASP (critical appraisal skills programme) tools. From the identified studies, 14 were considered 'strong,' with the remainder assessed as 'moderate' quality. The findings reported in these studies suggest that RMG workers of South and Southeast Asian countries are prone to several health vulnerabilities which include physical and psychological issues. Further, many of these health vulnerabilities arise from the nature of the RMG workplace, and include unhygienic and unsafe working environments, hazardous conditions of the factories, and lack of safety equipment.
   Conclusions: This systematic review suggests that RMG workers' health vulnerabilities are an emerging area of inquiry that needs to be better understood and solutions identified. Little is currently known about the distinctive types of health vulnerabilities of the RMG workers of these countries, other than Bangladesh and India, due to the lack of robust studies in other South and Southeast Asian countries. Although the health vulnerabilities of the Bangladeshi and Indian RMG workers have been previously highlighted, the health vulnerabilities arising from sudden disasters in the sector remain a neglected issue.

AB  - Neurological disorders significantly impact the world's economy due to their often chronic and life-threatening nature afflicting individuals which, in turn, creates a global disease burden. The Group of Twenty (G20) member nations, which represent the largest economies globally, should come together to formulate a plan on how to overcome this burden. The Neuroscience-20 (N20) initiative of the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) is at the vanguard of this global collaboration to comprehensively raise awareness about brain, spine, and mental disorders worldwide. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the various brain initiatives worldwide and highlight the need for cooperation and recommend ways to bring down costs associated with the discovery and treatment of neurological disorders. Our systematic search revealed that the cost of neurological and psychiatric disorders to the world economy by 2030 is roughly $16T. The cost to the economy of the United States is $1.5T annually and growing given the impact of COVID-19. We also discovered there is a shortfall of effective collaboration between nations and a lack of resources in developing countries. Current statistical analyses on the cost of neurological disorders to the world economy strongly suggest that there is a great need for investment in neurotechnology and innovation or fast-tracking therapeutics and diagnostics to curb these costs. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, SBMT, through this paper, intends to showcase the importance of worldwide collaborations to reduce the population's economic and health burden, specifically regarding neurological/brain, spine, and mental disorders.

AB  - Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and chronic tic disorders (CTD) including Tourette Syndrome (TS) are often comorbid conditions. While some patients present with distinct symptoms of CTD and/or OCD, a subset of patients demonstrate a unique overlap of symptoms, known as Tourettic OCD (TOCD), in which tics, compulsions, and their preceding premonitory urges are overlapping and tightly intertwined. The specific behaviors seen in TOCD are typically complex tic-like behaviors although with a compulsive and partially anxious nature reminiscent of OCD. TOCD is not classified within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5) as an independent diagnostic entity, but mounting evidence suggests that TOCD is an intermediate neuropsychiatric disorder distinct from either TS or OCD alone and as such represents a unique phenomenology. In this review of TOCD we discuss clinical, genetic, environmental, neurodevelopmental, and neurocircuit-based research to better characterize our current understanding of this disorder. TOCD is characterized by earlier age of onset, male predominance, and specific symptom clusters such as lower tendency toward compulsions related to checking, cleaning, and reassurance seeking and higher tendency toward compulsions such as rubbing, tapping, or touching associated with symmetry concerns or thoughts of exactness. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging suggests that TOCD symptoms may arise from involvement of an intermediate neurocircuitry distinct from classic OCD or classic CTD. Small cumulative contributions from multiple genetic loci have been implicated, as have environmental factors such as infection and perinatal trauma. In addition, this review addresses the treatment of TOCD which is especially complex and often treatment resistant and requires pharmacology and behavioral therapy in multiple modalities. Given the distressing impact of TOCD on patients' functioning, the goal of this review is to raise awareness of this distinct entity toward the goal of improving standards of care.

AB  - Background Because emotional symptoms are common in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and associate with much morbidity, some consider it to be a core feature rather than an associated trait. Others argue that emotional symptoms are too nonspecific for use as diagnostic criteria. This debate has been difficult to resolve due, in part, to the many terms used to describe emotional symptoms in ADHD and to concerns about overlap with mood disorders. Methods We sought to clarify the nature of emotional symptoms in ADHD by reviewing conceptual and measurement issues and by examining the evidence base regarding specificity of such symptoms for ADHD. We reviewed the various terms used to define emotional symptoms in ADHD, clarify how these symptoms are demarcated from mood disorders, and assess the possibility that symptoms of emotional impulsivity and deficient emotional self-regulation should be considered as core symptoms. We addressed psychiatric comorbidities, the effects of ADHD treatments on associated emotional dysregulation, and the utility of current rating scales to assess emotional symptoms associated with ADHD. Results Emotional symptoms are common and persistent in youth and adults with ADHD. Although emotional symptoms are common in other psychiatric disorders, emotional impulsivity (EI), and deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) may be sufficiently specific for ADHD to function as diagnostic criteria. Conclusions Emotional symptoms in ADHD cause clinically significant impairments. Although there is a solid theoretical rationale for considering EI and DESR to be core symptoms of ADHD, there is no consensus about how to define these constructs sin a manner that would be specific to the disorder. An instrument to measure EI and DESR which demarcates them from irritability and other emotional symptoms could improve the accuracy of diagnostic criteria for ADHD.

AB  - Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms have been hypothesized to result from altered brain connectivity. The 'disconnectivity' hypothesis has been used to explain characteristic impairments in socio-emotional function, observed clinically in ASD. Here, we review the evidence for impaired white matter connectivity as a neural substrate for socio-emotional dysfunction in ASD. A review of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies, and focused discussion of relevant post-mortem, structural, and functional neuroimaging studies, is provided.
   Methods: Studies were identified using a sensitive search strategy in MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO article databases using the OvidSP database interface. Search terms included database subject headings for the concepts of pervasive developmental disorders, and DTI. Seventy-two published DTI studies examining white matter microstructure in ASD were reviewed. A comprehensive discussion of DTI studies that examined white matter tracts linking socio-emotional structures is presented.
   Results: Several DTI studies reported microstructural differences indicative of developmental alterations in white matter organization, and potentially myelination, in ASD. Altered structure within long-range white matter tracts linking socio-emotional processing regions was implicated. While alterations of the uncinate fasciculus and frontal and temporal thalamic projections have been associated with social symptoms in ASD, few studies examined association of tract microstructure with core impairment in this disorder.
   Conclusions: The uncinate fasciculus and frontal and temporal thalamic projections mediate limbic connectivity and integrate structures responsible for complex socio-emotional functioning. Impaired development of limbic connectivity may represent one neural substrate contributing to ASD social impairments. Future efforts to further elucidate the nature of atypical white matter development, and its relationship to core symptoms, may offer new insights into etiological mechanisms contributing to ASD impairments and uncover novel opportunities for targeted intervention.

AB  - Background: Long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications (LAIs) are an evidence-based treatment option for people with severe mental illness. While women with severe mental illness who are prescribed LAIs can become pregnant, there is a dearth of research examining the safety of these medication formulations during pregnancy. Objective: This article summarizes available literature on the use of LAIs in pregnancy to help inform clinical decisions and guide future research. Methods: PubMed literature searches were completed using combinations of keywords including "antipsychotic" and "long-acting injectable" or "depot," or generic or brand names of LAIs with "pregnancy." Pregnancy outcomes were compared across studies. Results: Twelve relevant case reports of 13 pregnancies were identified. Six cases did not report any negative birth or infant outcomes, including prematurity, infants being born small for gestational age, congenital anomalies, and extrapyramidal symptoms. No cases reported abnormal Apgar scores, infants being born large for gestational age, or negative long-term developmental outcomes after exposure to LAIs during pregnancy. Cesarean section rate was comparable to the general population. Specific adverse outcomes included one infant with multiple congenital anomalies, 3 infants with minor congenital anomalies, and one infant with possible extrapyramidal symptoms. One infant was born prematurely, one infant was born small for gestational age, and 2 infants were born both prematurely and small for gestational age. Conclusions: There is little research specifically examining the use of LAIs in pregnancy, so risks must be extrapolated from studies on oral antipsychotics in pregnancy. While the few published case reports examining LAIs in pregnancy somewhat align with research examining oral antipsychotics, these findings are inconclusive due to the inherently limited nature of case reports. Further investigation into the use of LAIs in pregnancy is warranted. (Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry 2022; 63:53-60)

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an extraordinary disorder that usually strikes when individuals are in the prime of their lives, as was the case for the influential 20th century musician Woody Guthrie. HD demonstrates the exceptionally fine line between life and death in such 'genetic diseases', as the only difference between those who suffer horribly and die slowly of this disease is often just a handful of extra tandem repeats (beyond the normal polymorphic range) in a genome that constitutes over 3 billion paired nucleotides of DNA. Furthermore, HD presents as a complex and heterogenous combination of psychiatric, cognitive and motor symptoms, so can appear as an unholy trinity of `three disorders in one'. The autosomal dominant nature of the disorder is also extremely challenging for affected families, as a 'flip of a coin' dictates which children inherit the mutation from their affected parent, and the gene-negative family members bear the burden of caring for the other half of the family that is affected. In this review, we will focus on one of the earliest, and most devastating, symptoms associated with HD, depression, which has been reported to affect approximately half of gene-positive HD family members. We will discuss the pathogenesis of HD, and depressive symptoms in particular, including molecular and cellular mechanisms, and potential genetic and environmental modifiers. This expanding understanding of HD pathogenesis may not only lead to novel therapeutic options for HD families, but may also provide insights into depression in the wider population, which has the greatest burden of disease of any disorder and an enormous unmet need for new therapies.

AB  - Reports of the association between cardiovascular risk factors and depression in later life are inconsistent; to establish the nature of their association seems important for prevention and treatment of late-life depression. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for relevant cohort or case control studies over the last 22 years; 1097 were retrieved; 26 met inclusion criteria. Separate meta-analyses were performed for Risk Factor Composite Scores (RFCS) combining different subsets of risk factors, Framingham Stroke Risk Score, and single factors. We found a positive association (odds ratio [OR]: 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-1.75) between RFCS and late-life depression. There was no association between Framingham Stroke Risk Score (OR: 1.25; 95% CI:.99-1.57), hypertension (OR: 1.14; 95% CI:.94-1.40), or dyslipidemia (OR: 1.08; 95% CI:.91-1.28) and late-life depression. The association with smoking was weak (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.00-1.81), whereas positive associations were found with diabetes (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.30-1.76), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.52-2.04), and stroke (OR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.61-2.77). Moderate to high heterogeneity was found in the results for RFCS, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and stroke, whereas publication bias was detected for RFCS and diabetes. We therefore found convincing evidence of a strong relationship between key diseases and depression (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke) and between composite vascular risk and depression but not between some vascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia) and depression. More evidence is needed to be accumulated from large longitudinal epidemiological studies, particularly if complemented by neuroimaging.

AB  - There is now compelling evidence that motor imagery (MI) and actual movement share common neural substrate. However, the question of how MI inhibits the transmission of motor commands into the efferent pathways in order to prevent any movement is largely unresolved. Similarly, little is known about the nature of the electromyographic activity that is apparent during MI. In addressing these gaps in the literature, the present paper argues that MI includes motor execution commands for muscle contractions which are blocked at some level of the motor system by inhibitory mechanisms. We first assemble data from neuroimaging studies that demonstrate that the neural networks mediating MI and motor performance are not totally overlapping, thereby highlighting potential differences between MI and actual motor execution. We then review MI data indicating the presence of subliminal muscular activity reflecting the intrinsic characteristics of the motor command as well as increased corticomotor excitability. The third section not only considers the inhibitory mechanisms involved during MI but also examines how the brain resolves the problem of issuing the motor command for action while supervising motor inhibition when people engage in voluntary movement during MI. The last part of the paper draws on imagery research in clinical contexts to suggest that some patients move while imagining an action, although they are not aware of such movements. In particular, experimental data from amputees as well as from patients with Parkinson's disease are discussed. We also review recent studies based on comparing brain activity in tetraplegic patients with that from healthy matched controls that provide insights into inhibitory processes during MI. We conclude by arguing that based on available evidence, a multifactorial explanation of motor inhibition during MI is warranted.

AB  - It is not uncommon for immigration-seekers to be actively involved in taking various language tests for immigration purposes. Given the large-scale and high-stakes nature those language tests possess, the validity issues (e.g., appropriate score-based interpretations and decisions) associated with them are of great importance as test scores may play a gate-keeping role in immigration. Though interest in investigating the validity of language tests for immigration purposes is becoming prevalent, there has to be a systematic review of the research foci and results of this body of research. To address this need, the current paper critically reviewed 11 validation studies on language assessment for immigration over the last two decades to identify what has been focused on and what has been overlooked in the empirical research and to discuss current research interests and future research trends. Assessment Use Argument (AUA) framework of Bachman and Palmer (2010), comprising four inferences (i.e., assessment records, interpretations, decisions, and consequences), was adopted to collect and examine evidence of test validity. Results showed the consequences inference received the most investigations focusing on immigration-seekers' and policymakers' perceptions on test consequences, while the decisions inference was the least probed stressing immigration-seekers' attitude towards the impartiality of decision-making. It is recommended that further studies could explore more kinds of stakeholders (e.g., test developers) in terms of their perceptions on the test and investigate more about the fairness of decision-making based on test scores. Additionally, the current AUA framework includes only positive and negative consequences that an assessment may engender but does not take compounded consequences into account. It is suggested that further research could enrich the framework. The paper sheds some light on the field of language assessment for immigration and brings about theoretical, practical, and political implications for different kinds of stakeholders (e.g., researchers, test developers, and policymakers).

AB  - Background: There is inconsistency in the literature regarding the nature of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functionality in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Purpose: The review aimed to investigate HPA axis functionality via the diurnal profile of cortisol as it relates to PTSD.
   Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature from June 2017 - March 2019 in accordance with The PRISMA Statement in the following four databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect and PsycINFO with Full Text. The search strategy was limited to articles in English language, published in peer-reviewed journals within the last decade and human studies. Search terms included "post-traumatic stress disorder" OR "PTSD", AND "hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis" OR "HPA axis" AND "diurnal cortisol" OR "cortisol". PTSD sufferers of all trauma types, genders and socioeconomic statuses were included provided there was a "healthy" control group and an inclusion of reporting on inter-group measurements of diurnal cortisol profiles as a portrayal of HPA axis functionality.
   Results: A total of 10 studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The association between HPA axis functionality and PTSD was evaluated by the measurement of salivary and/or plasma cortisol concentrations. Only two studies demonstrated an association between PTSD and diurnal cortisol when compared with respective control groups while three studies found no associations. The remaining five studies found partial, mostly negative associations between PTSD and diurnal cortisol.
   Conclusion: Despite some indications of an association between PTSD and dysregulated HPA axis functionality as demonstrated by diurnal cortisol output, the current review has revealed mixed findings. As such, a complete understanding of HPA axis dysregulation as it relates to PTSD remains unestablished. Given the findings, further investigation into the relationship between PTSD trauma-exposed and non-PTSD trauma-exposed individuals and diurnal cortisol is warranted.

TI  - Patients' attitudes to general practice registrars: a review of the literature
KW  - consultation
KW  - continuity of care
KW  - older patients
KW  - patient preference
KW  - trainee
AB  - With the population ageing, it is imperative for training practices to provide general practice registrars (GPRs) with sound experience in managing the health problems of older persons, especially chronic conditions. However, it is reported that a significant proportion of these patients will be resistant to consulting registrars, with concerns regarding disruption of continuity of care being a significant factor. The challenge for training practices is to identify approaches to engage registrars in the management of older patients whilst maintaining patient satisfaction. This paper presents a review of the literature on patient attitudes to GPRs to better understand the nature and magnitude of the challenge, and to identify important research gaps.
   Major electronic medical literature databases were searched for relevant articles using search terms including general practice, registrar, doctor-patient relationship, patient attitudes and elderly, for the period from January 1980 to March 2009. The studies were analysed by methodology, content and theme.
   A total of 15 studies were identified that directly addressed patients' attitudes to GPRs. Whilst there appeared to be an overall high acceptance of registrars by patients, increasing patient age was associated with more negative attitudes towards registrars, reduced trust and decreased satisfaction with communication. Presentations for chronic or emotional problems were associated with reduced willingness to consult registrars. Patients generally appreciated an ongoing involvement with their usual GP.
   These findings have implications for training practices and research directions. Demonstrating continuity of care through shared chronic disease management between supervisors and registrars is a possible model that meets registrars' training and patients' continuity needs. There is a need for quality research on the type and magnitude of problems affecting GPR encounters with older patients and, based on results from these studies, to create and assess models of registrar training involving older patients, that meet patients' needs for continuity of care.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects a quarter of adolescents and young adults and is associated with the greatest global burden of disease in this population. There is a growing literature, mostly in adults, showing that significant neurocognitive impairments are common in MDD. It remains unclear whether these impairments are pre-existing trait markers of MDD, state-related impairments that fluctuate with depressive symptoms, or 'scar' impairments that worsen with illness progression. The aim of this study is to provide a conceptual framework for understanding MDD and neurocognitive impairment in adolescence and young adulthood (ages 12-25 years).
   Method: Examination of the evidence for neurocognitive deficits as trait, state, and scar features of MDD according to different study designs (family studies, premorbid studies, current depression, remitted depression, and longitudinal studies with repeated assessment) was conducted.
   Results: The few premorbid and family studies conducted in youth provide equivocal evidence for neurocognitive impairments as trait markers of MDD. The presence of state-based neurocognitive impairment remains unclear as evidence comes mostly from cross-sectional studies. There are a limited, but growing number of longitudinal studies with repeated neurocognitive assessment in youth. Studies that examined neurocognition prior to the onset of MDD and with long-term follow-up provide tentative evidence for neurocognitive scarring.
   Conclusion: Neurocognitive impairment is a feature of MDD in adolescents and young adults. To better understand the nature, timing, and pattern of impairment, longitudinal studies that examine neurocognition before and after the development of full-threshold MDD, including following recurrence are needed. This knowledge will have important implications for mechanisms, prevention, and treatment of MDD in youth.

AB  - Background: Limited medical evidence for managing post-stroke fatigue leads stroke survivors to seek information through other sources. This scoping review aimed to identify and assess the range and quality of web-based recommendations for managing post-stroke fatigue.
   Methods: Publicly accessible websites providing advice for post-stroke fatigue management were considered for review using the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology. Using the search term "fatigue stroke", the first two pages of results from each search engine (Google, Yahoo, and Bing) were assessed against predetermined criteria. Findings were reported in accordance with PRISMA-ScR checklist. Quality and readability were also assessed.
   Results: Fifty-seven websites were identified; 16 primary and 11 linked websites met the inclusion criteria and demonstrated moderate to high quality and high readability. Primary websites were curated by non-government organizations (n = 10/16), companies (n = 4/16) or were media and blog websites (n = 2/16). Additional resources were provided on linked websites. All websites provided non-pharmacological advice, with four also describing pharmacological management. Many websites included advice related to physical activity modification (n = 18/27) and energy conservation strategies (e.g. activity prioritization, planning, pacing) (n = 26/27). Direction to seek health professional advice appeared frequently (n = 16/27).
   Conclusions: The quality of publicly available web-based advice for people with post-stroke fatigue was moderate to high in most websites, with high readability. Energy conservation strategies and physical activity modification appear frequently. The general nature of the advice provided on most websites is supported by direction to healthcare professionals (i.e., clinical referral) who may assist in the practical individualization of strategies for managing post-stroke fatigue.

AB  - Excessive alcohol use is often associated with accelerated cognitive decline, and extensive research using animal models of human alcohol consumption has been conducted into potential mechanisms for this relationship. Within this literature there is considerable variability in the types of models used. For example, alcohol administration style (voluntary/forced), length and schedule of exposure and abstinence period are often substantially different between studies. In this review, we evaluate recent research into alcohol-induced cognitive decline according to methodology of alcohol access, as well as cognitive behavioral task employed. Our aim was to query whether the nature and severity of deficits observed may be impacted by the schedule and type of alcohol administration. We furthermore examined whether there is any apparent relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and the severity of the deficit, as well as the potential impact of abstinence length, and other factors such as age of administration, and sex of subject. Over the past five years, researchers have overwhelmingly used non-voluntary methods of intake, however deficits are still found where intake is voluntary. Magnitude of intake and type of task seem most closely related to the likelihood of producing a deficit, however even this did not follow a consistent pattern. We highlight the importance of using systematic and clear reporting styles to facilitate consistency across the literature in this regard. We hope that this analysis will provide important insights into how experimental protocols might influence findings, and how different patterns of consumption are more or less likely to produce an addiction-vulnerable cognitive phenotype in animal models.

AB  - While in the early identification and intervention of psychosis-specific instruments and risk criteria have been generated and validated, research into indicated preventive strategies for bipolar I disorder (BD I) has only recently gained momentum. As the first signs of BD I often start before adulthood, such efforts are especially important in the vulnerable pediatric population. Data are summarized regarding the presence and nature of potentially prodromal, that is, subsyndromal, symptoms prior to BD I, defined by first-episode mania, focusing on pediatric patients.
   Research indicates the possibility of early identification of youth at clinical high risk for BD. Support for this proposition comes from retrospective studies of BD I patients, as well as prospective studies of community samples, offspring of BD I subjects, youth with depressive disorders, and patients at high risk for psychosis or with bipolar spectrum disorders without lifetime history of mania. These data provide essential insight into potential signs and symptoms that may enable presyndromal identification of BD I in youth. However, except for offspring studies, broader prospective approaches that focus on youth at clinical high risk for BD I and on developing specific interviews and (or) rating scales and risk criteria are mostly missing, or in their early stage. More work is needed to determine valid and sufficiently specific clinical high-risk criteria, to distinguish risk factors, endophenotypes, and comorbidities from prodromal symptomatology, and to develop phase-specific interventions that titrate the risk of intervention to the risk of transition to mania and to functional impairment or distress. Moreover, studies are needed that determine potential differences in prodromal symptoms and trajectories between children, adolescents, and adults, and the best phase-specific interventions.

AB  - In recent years, increasing attention has been given for reclamation and reuse of water (wastewater and stormwater) in the context of augmenting water supplies. Constructed wetland (CW) systems make use of natural substrates, plants, and microbes for decontamination of wastewater and stormwater. These nature-based water treatment systems are cost-effective and sustainable. This review critically analyzes the recent advances on the application of CW systems for removal of total suspended solids (TSS), various chemical (nutrients including total nitrogen and total phosphorus, heavy metals, and organics) and microbial pollutants (Escherichia coli, enterococci, fecal coliforms, etc.) in wastewater and stormwater. Furthermore, the influence of key factors including CW configurations, substrates, vegetation, ambient temperature/seasonal changes, oxygen levels and hydraulic retention time on the performance of CW systems are discussed. Insights into various pollutant removal mechanisms, microbial diversity and modeling (kinetics, hydrological and mechanistic) are provided. CW systems show good performance for removal of diverse pollutants from wastewater and stormwater. The pollutant removal mechanisms include physical (sedimentation and filtration), chemical (sorption, complexation and precipitation) and biological (biodegradation, microbial transformation and microbial/plant assimilation) processes. The dominant microbial communities enriched in CW systems include nitrifiers, denitrifiers and organic biodegraders. The key knowledge gaps in the development of multifunctional CW systems are highlighted. We believe that this critical review would help urban planners, environmental engineers and managers with implementation of innovative strategies for wastewater and stormwater reclamation and reuse to alleviate water stress in urban areas and to contribute to environmental sustainability. Moreover, this review would help to optimize the performance of CW systems as well as to develop regulatory guidelines for installation, operation and maintenance of CW systems.

AB  - Behavioral neuroscience is using mon and more gene knockout techniques to produce animals with a specific deletion. These studies have their precedent in nature. A mutation may result in a limited genetic defect, as seen in the vasopressin (VP) deficiency in the Brattleboro rat. The mutation is in a single pair of autosomal loci, and the sequences of VP gene from wild-type and homozygous Brattleboro rats are identical except for a single nucleotide deletion in the second exon. The deletion results in the synthesis of an altered VP precursor that is unable to enter the secretory pathway. The genetic disturbance results in a central diabetes insipidus comparable to that found in humans. Starting with our work during the early 1970s we found that the genetic defect in the availability of VP causes deficits in central nervous system (CNS) functions. Behavioral processes from cognition to drug tolerance appeared to be disturbed by the absence of VP, but not all behaviors are affected. The specificity of the absence of VP in causing behavioral deficits is shown in many cases. However, certain deficits are due to genetic factors other than the deletion of the VP gene. The picture is further complicated by differences in testing conditions, the absence of proper controls, i.e. heterozygous and wild-type Brattleboro rats, sex, compensation phenomena, and the absence of neuropeptides co-localized with VP. Interestingly, an age dependent spontaneous shunt to a heterozygous phenotype in vasopressinergic neurons might also compensate for the disturbance. Accordingly, findings in knockout animals should be interpreted with caution. One should realize that brain functions are modulated by multiple neuropeptides and that neuropeptides possess multiple CNS effects.

AB  - Objective: Since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, many case reports and case series dealt with new-onset psychotic disorders in patients either infected with SARS-CoV-2 or thematically linked to the pandemic, but without an infection. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive collection of these reports to illustrate the nature of these psychoses. Methods: We conducted a literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, using search terms regarding first-episode psychotic disorders in the context of corona. Results: 96 case reports or case series covering 146 patients (62 without and 84 with SARS-CoV-2 infection) were found. Compared to patients without infection, patients with infection showed significantly more often visual hallucinations (28.6% vs 8.1%), confusion (36.9% vs 11.3%), an acute onset of illness (88.5% vs 59.6%) and less often depression (13.1% vs 35.5%) and a delusional content related to the pandemic (29.5% vs 78.3%). Both groups had an equally favourable outcome with a duration of psychosis <= 2 weeks in half and full remission in two-thirds of patients. In patients with infection, signs of inflammation were reported in 78.3% and increased CRP in 58.6%. While reports on patients with infection are continuously published, no report about patients without infection was found after July 2020. Conclusion: Cases without infection were considered reactive and originated all from the first wave of the corona pandemic. In cases with infection, inflammation was considered as the main pathogenetic factor but was not found in all patients. Diagnosis was impeded by the overlap of psychosis with delirium.

AB  - BackgroundThe scarcity of evidence-based research on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among Syrian refugees has hampered efforts to address the high burden of these diseases in host countries. The objective of this study is to examine published research on NCDs among Syrian refugees in order to inform future research, practice, programs, and policy. .MethodsUsing the scoping review framework proposed by Arksey et al., 17 different databases were searched to identify studies reporting on NCDs among Syrian refugees. The number of relevant documents found was 34, with the earliest going back to 20132 years after the beginning of the Syrian conflict.ResultsThe majority of these documents were descriptive in nature and only two studies addressed the effectiveness of interventions in the management of NCDs. No studies investigated the prevention of these diseases. Furthermore, only 7 studies addressed the host community and only one research article, conducted in Lebanon, included subjects from the host community. The increasing number of documents over the past 5years illustrates a growing interest in studying NCDs among Syrian refugees. Examination of the papers showed high prevalence of NCDs among Syrian refugees as well as unmet healthcare needs.ConclusionThe findings of this review highlighted the dire need for further research on the burden of NCDs among Syrian refugees. Future studies should diversify research design to include interventions, address the host community in addition to the refugees, tackle prevention as well as treatment of NCDs, and explore strategies to enhance the resilience of the host country's health system while ensuring quality of care for NCDs. The increasing momentum for research found in this review presents an opportunity to fill current knowledge gaps, which could result in preventing, controlling and ultimately reducing the burden of NCDs among Syrian refugees and their host communities.

AB  - An ever-growing literature has aimed to determine how individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ from their typically developing (TD) peers on measures of multisensory integration (MSI) and to ascertain the degree to which differences in MSI are associated with the broad range of symptoms associated with ASD. Findings, however, have been highly variable across the studies carried out to date. The present work systematically reviews and quantitatively synthesizes the large literature on audiovisual MSI in individuals with ASD to evaluate the cumulative evidence for (a) group differences between individuals with ASD and TD peers, (b) correlations between MSI and autism symptoms in individuals with ASD and (c) study level factors that may moderate findings (Le., explain differential effects) observed across studies. To identify eligible studies, a comprehensive search strategy was employed using the ProQuest search engine, PubMed database, forwards and backwards citation searches, direct author contact, and hand-searching of select conference proceedings. A significant between-group difference in MSI was evident in the literature, with individuals with ASD demonstrating worse audiovisual integration on average across studies compared to TD controls. This effect was moderated by mean participant age, such that between-group differences were more pronounced in younger samples. The mean correlation between MSI and autism and related symptomatology was also significant, indicating that increased audiovisual integration in individuals with ASD is associated with better language/communication abilities and/or reduced autism symptom severity in the extant literature. This effect was moderated by whether the stimuli were linguistic versus non-linguistic in nature, such that correlation magnitudes tended to be significantly greater when linguistic stimuli were utilized in the measure of MSI. Limitations and future directions for primary and meta-analytic research are discussed.

AB  - Problem, research strategy, and findings: Colleges and universities have been planning their campuses for centuries, yet scholars have conducted little empirical research regarding the nature of campus planning in the United States. We review recent scholarship on campus planning, discovering that it is dominated by case studies (sometimes in edited collections) and some comparative studies. In this review we organize the literature into 3 geographic scales: the campus per se (or campus park), the campus-community interface, and the larger campus district. The literature addresses 5 topics: land use, design, sustainability, economic development, and collaboration. Most of the studies focus on research-oriented universities in metropolitan locations. The literature emphasizes how campus master planning can support student learning, how design and building guidelines can make a campus more cohesive, and how campuses are adopting sustainable development and operations. At the campus-community interface, the research documents how some colleges and universities have expanded beyond their traditional boundaries, invested in local economic development, and worked with their communities to improve transportation and reduce environmental impacts. Studies of campus district planning emphasize community adoption of development regulations and code enforcement procedures to reduce the impact of students living in nearby neighborhoods. The literature stresses the importance of partnerships, collaboration, and enhanced communications between the university and the community.Takeaway for practice: University planners should continue to focus on site design that reinforces student learning and environmental sustainability and on community interface planning that supports economic development and reduces environmental impacts. City planners should expand campus district planning to address a broad array of issues and opportunities. Both university and city planners should facilitate collaboration between their institutions. Scholars should study a wide range of colleges and universities, including 2-year as well as 4-year institutions and those in nonurban settings.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review research on how people use the Internet for suicide-related reasons and its influence on users. This review summarises the main findings and conclusions of existing work, the nature of studies that have been conducted, their strengths and limitations, and directions for future research.
   Method: An online search was conducted through PsycINFO, PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE and CINAHL databases for papers published between 1991 and 2014. Papers were included if they examined how the Internet was used for suicide-related reasons, the influence of suicide-related Internet use, and if they presented primary data, including case studies of Internet-related suicide attempts and completions.
   Results: Findings of significant relationships between suicide-related search trends and rates of suicide suggest that search trends may be useful in monitoring suicide risk in a population. Studies that examine online communications between people who are suicidal can further our understanding of individuals' suicidal experiences. While engaging in suicide-related Internet use was associated with higher levels of suicidal ideation, evidence of its influence on suicidal ideation over time was mixed. There is a lack of studies directly recruiting suicidal Internet users. Only case studies examined the influence of suicide-related Internet use on suicidal behaviours, while no studies assessed the influence of pro-suicide or suicide prevention websites. Online professional services can be useful to suicide prevention and intervention efforts, but require more work in order to demonstrate their efficacy.
   Conclusions: Research has shown that individuals use the Internet to search for suicide-related information and to discuss suicide-related problems with one another. However, the causal link between suicide-related Internet use and suicidal thoughts and behaviours is still unclear. More research is needed, particularly involving direct contact with Internet users, in order to understand the impact of both informal and professionally moderated suicide-related Internet use.

TI  - The Faerie King's 'Kunstkammer': Imperial discourse and the wondrous in 'Sir Orfeo'
KW  - BONIFACE-VIII
KW  - STATUE
KW  - LAW
AB  - The meaning and composition of the figures that litter the forecourt of the Faerie King's palace in the Auchinleck Manuscript version of Sir Orfeo have been the topic of considerable debate. This article suggests that the full effect of this Kunstkammer can only be understood in the light of the persistent, mistrustful distaste for sculpture in the round, which is rooted in patristic writings and popular belief, but also informed by contemporary ideological clashes between the Papacy, the Holy Roman Empire and the English state. The numinous power of this outdoor sculptural gallery - which seems measureless to man and includes Orfeo's wife - is palpable, but whereas Orfeo feels wonder, the modern reader's response tends to be refracted through the lens of organic body horror, or a seemingly obscure sense of Das Unheimliche. It is, however, in combination with a number of other telling features of the Faerie King's framing of himself, an important part of a series of demonic simulacra referring simultaneously to both the pretensions of the devil and the pretensions of more earthly powers - imperial and papal. All the artifice of the Faerie King's seat creates a deep disquietude, arising from the ultimate nature of its causation. It is not created out of love as is God's creation made manifest in the poet's vision of Winchester, but as an assertion of power by which the beautiful is sundered from the good in the spectacula, or works and pomps, of this tyrannical, demonic usurper. The Faerie King's crown ofone stone, with its conscious debt to the orphan stone motif, even the tabernacular niche in which he sits, recall the imperial and the papal in contexts which stress the overreaching corruptibility of power in the recent past of the Auchinleck narrator.

AB  - The devastating nature and lack of effective treatments associated with neurodegenerative diseases have stimulated a worldwide search for the elucidation of their molecular basis to which mouse models have made a major contribution. In combination with transgenic and knockout technologies, large-scale mouse mutagenesis is a powerful approach for the identification of new genes and associated signalling pathways controlling neuronal cell death and survival. Here we review the characterization of the robotic mouse, a novel model of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia isolated from an ENU-mutagenesis programme, which develops adult-onset region-specific Purkinje cell loss and cataracts, and displays defects in early T-cell maturation and general growth retardation. The mutated protein, AM, is a member of the AF4/LAF4/FMR2 (ALF) family of putative transcription factors previously implicated in childhood leukaemia and FRAXE mental retardation. The mutation, which lies in a highly conserved region among the ALF family members, significantly reduces the binding affinity of Af4 to the E3 ubiquitin-ligase Siah-1a, isolated with Siah-2 as interacting proteins in the brain. This leads to a markedly slower turnover of mutant AM by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and consequently to its abnormal accumulation in the robotic mouse. Importantly, the conservation of the Siah-binding domain of AM in all other family members reveals that Siah-mediated proteasomal degradation is a common regulatory mechanism that controls the levels, and thereby the function, of the ALF family. The robotic mouse represents a unique model in which to study the newly revealed role of Af4 in the maintenance of vital functions of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and further the understanding of its implication in lymphopoeisis.

AB  - Adverse factors such as stress or inflammation in the neonatal period can affect the development of certain brain structures and have negative delayed effects throughout the lifespan of an individual, by reducing cognitive abilities and increasing the risk of psychopathologies. One possible reason for these delayed effects is the neuroinflammation caused by neonatal immune activation (NIA). Neuroinflammation can lead to disturbances of neurotransmission and to reprogramming of astroglial and microglial brain cells; when combined, the two problems can cause changes in the cytoarchitecture of individual regions of the brain. In addition, neuroinflammation may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and processes of oxidative stress, thereby resulting in higher stress reactivity. In our review, we tried to answer the questions of whether depressive-like behavior develops after NIA in rodents and what the molecular mechanisms associated with these disorders are. Most studies indicate that NIA does not induce depressive-like behavior in a steady state. Nonetheless, adult males (but not females or adolescents of both sexes) with experience of NIA exhibit marked depressive-like behavior when exposed to aversive conditions. Analyses of molecular changes have shown that NIA leads to an increase in the amount of activated microglia and astroglia in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, an increase in oxidative-stress parameters, a change in stress reactivity of the HPA axis, and an imbalance of cytokines in various regions of the brain, but not in blood plasma, thus confirming the local nature of the inflammation. Therefore, NIA causes depressive-like behavior in adult males under aversive testing conditions, which are accompanied by local inflammation and have sex- and age-specific effects.

AB  - Many theories have been put forward that propose that developmental dyslexia is caused by low-level neural, cognitive, or perceptual deficits. For example, statistical learning is a cognitive mechanism that allows the learner to detect a probabilistic pattern in a stream of stimuli and to generalise the knowledge of this pattern to similar stimuli. The link between statistical learning and reading ability is indirect, with intermediate skills, such as knowledge of frequently co-occurring letters, likely being causally dependent on statistical learning skills and, in turn, causing individual variation in reading ability. We discuss theoretical issues regarding what a link between statistical learning and reading ability actually means and review the evidence for such a deficit. We then describe and simulate the "noisy chain hypothesis", where each intermediary link between a proposed cause and the end-state of reading ability reduces the correlation coefficient between the low-level deficit and the end-state outcome of reading. We draw the following conclusions: (1) Empirically, there is evidence for a correlation between statistical learning ability and reading ability, but there is no evidence to suggest that this relationship is causal, (2) theoretically, focussing on a complete causal chain between a distal cause and developmental dyslexia, rather than the two endpoints of the distal cause and reading ability only, is necessary for understanding the underlying processes, (3) statistically, the indirect nature of the link between statistical learning and reading ability means that the magnitude of the correlation is diluted by other influencing variables, yielding most studies to date underpowered, and (4) practically, it is unclear what can be gained from invoking the concept of statistical learning in teaching children to read.

AB  - Background: Ketamine has been shown to produce a rapid and robust antidepressant effect. Though numerous routes of administration have been studied, subcutaneous (SC) has proven to be a convenient and cost-effective route making its use particularly relevant in developing countries. Here we provide a systematic review covering the use of SC racemic ketamine and esketamine in depression, including its efficacy, safety and tolerability.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out, from inception through March, 2021, using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science, with no limits of language. After identifying 159 potentially relevant articles, 12 articles were selected after applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria. These comprised two randomized clinical trials, five case-reports and five retrospective studies. Given the small number of studies found and their heterogeneous nature, a meta-analysis was not considered appropriate. Here we provide a synthesis of these data including participant characteristics, dose range, efficacy, safety/ tolerability. Risk of bias was accessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.
   Results: SC Ketamine was administered to unipolar and bipolar patients a single or multiple doses, weekly or twice-weekly, a dose-titration approach was made in major studies, dose ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/Kg of racemic ketamine and 0.5-1 mg/Kg of esketamine. Across all studies, SC ketamine showed a rapid and robust antidepressant effect, with response/ remission rates from 50 to 100% following both single or multiple doses, with transitory side effects.
   Conclusion: SC racemic ketamine and esketamine in depression is a promising strategy showing beneficial efficacy and tolerability. Future studies exploring the SC route, its cost-effectiveness, and a direct comparison with IV and intranasal (IN) protocols are warranted.

AB  - The subthalamic nucleus (STN) houses a dense cluster of glutamatergic neurons that play a central role in the functional dynamics of the basal ganglia, a group of subcortical structures involved in the control of motor behaviors. Numerous anatomical, electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral studies have reported that serotonergic neurons from the midbrain raphe nuclei modulate the activity of STN neurons. Here, we describe this serotonergic innervation and the nature of the regulation exerted by serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) on STN neuron activity. This regulation can occur either directly within the STN or at distal sites, including other structures of the basal ganglia or cortex. The effect of 5-HT on STN neuronal activity involves several 5-HT receptor subtypes, including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2C and 5-HT4 receptors, which have garnered the highest attention on this topic. The multiple regulatory effects exerted by 5-HT are thought to be modified under pathological conditions, altering the activity of the STN, or due to the benefits and side effects of treatments used for Parkinson's disease, notably the dopamine precursor L-DOPA and high-frequency STN stimulation. Originally understood as a motor center, the STN is also associated with decision making and participates in mood regulation and cognitive performance, two domains of personality that are also regulated by 5-HT. The literature concerning the link between 5-HT and STN is already important, and the functional overlap is evident, but this link is still not entirely understood. The understanding of this link between 5-HT and STN should be increased due to the possible importance of this regulation in the control of fronto-STN loops and inherent motor and non-motor behaviors.

AB  - Background: Panic disorder, a relatively common anxiety disorder, is often associated to agoraphobia and may be disabling. Its neurobiological underpinnings are unknown, despite the proliferation of models and hypotheses concerning it; investigating its correlates could provide the means for better understanding its pathophysiology. Recent structural neuroimaging techniques may contribute to the identification of possible brain morphological alterations that could be possibly related to the clinical expression of panic disorder.
   Methods: Through careful major database searches, using terms keen to panic, agoraphobia, structural magnetic neuroimaging and the like, we identified papers published in peer-review journals and reporting data on the brain structure of patients with panic disorder. Included papers were used comparatively to speculate about the nature of reported brain structural alterations.
   Results: Anxiety, which is the core feature of the disorder, correlates with the function of the amygdala, which showed a smaller volume in patients, as compared to healthy subjects. Data also showed a volumetric decrease of the anterior cingulate along with increased fractional anisotropy, and increase of some brainstem nuclei, particularly of the rostral pons. Other structures with reported volumetric correlates of panic disorder are the hippocampus and the parahippocampal cortices, the insula, the putamen, and the pituitary gland. Volumetric changes in the anterior cingulate, frontal, orbitofrontal, insular, and temporal cortices have also been described in structural neuroimaging studies. Major methodological limitations are considered in context.
   Conclusions: Several data point to the existence of structural neuroanatomical alterations in panic disorder, consisting in significant volumetric reductions or increases in different brain areas. White matter alterations were shown also in the only diffusion tensor imaging study performed to date. Available data do not allow us to conclude about the possible progression of these alterations.

AB  - The cognitive basis of utterance interpretation is an area that continues to provoke intense theoretical debate among pragmatists. That utterance interpretation involves some type of mind-reading or theory of mind (ToM) is indisputable. However, theorists are divided on the exact nature of this ToM-based mechanism. In this paper, it is argued that the only type of ToM-based mechanism that can adequately represent the cognitive basis of utterance interpretation is one which reflects the rational, intentional, holistic character of interpretation. Such a ToM-based mechanism is supported on conceptual and empirical grounds. Empirical support for this view derives from the study of children and adults with pragmatic disorders. Specifically, three types of clinical case are considered. In the first case, evidence is advanced which indicates that individuals with pragmatic disorders exhibit deficits in reasoning and the use of inferences. These deficits compromise the ability of children and adults with pragmatic disorders to comply with the rational dimension of utterance interpretation. In the second case, evidence is presented which suggests that subjects with pragmatic disorders struggle with the intentional dimension of utterance interpretation. This dimension extends beyond the recognition of communicative intentions to include the attribution of a range of cognitive and affective mental states that play a role in utterance interpretation. In the third case, evidence is presented that children and adults with pragmatic disorders struggle with the holistic character of utterance interpretation. This serves to distort the contexts in which utterances are processed for their implicated meanings. The paper concludes with some thoughts about the role of theorizing in relation to utterance interpretation.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder involving recurring (hypo)manic and depressive episodes. The inherently temporal nature of BD has inspired its conceptualization using dynamical systems theory, which is a mathematical framework for understanding systems that evolve over time. In this paper, we provide a critical review of the dynamical systems models of BD. Owing to the heterogeneity of methodological and experimental designs in computational modeling, we designed a structured approach that parallels the appraisal of animal models by their face, predictive, and construct validity. This tool, the validity appraisal guide for computational models (VAG-CM), is not an absolute measure of validity, but rather a guide for a more objective appraisal of models in this review. We identified 26 studies published before November 18, 2021 that proposed generative dynamical systems models of time-varying signals in BD. Two raters independently applied the VAG-CM to the included studies, obtaining a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.55 (95% CI [0.45, 0.64]) prior to establishing consensus ratings. Consensus VAG-CM ratings revealed three model/study clusters: data-driven models with face validity, theory-driven models with predictive validity, and theory-driven models lacking all forms of validity. We conclude that future modeling studies should employ a hybrid approach that first operationalizes BD features of interest using empirical data to achieve face validity, followed by explanations of those features using generative models with components that are homologous to physiological or psychological systems involved in BD, to achieve construct validity. Such models would be best developed alongside long-term prospective cohort studies involving a collection of multimodal time-series data. We also encourage future studies to extend, modify, and evaluate the VAG-CM approach for a wider breadth of computational modeling studies and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected everyone in a hit or miss manner. Since it began, evidence of the neuro-invasive potential of the virus has been intensifying significantly. Several pathways have been hypothesized to elucidate the neurotropic nature of SARS-CoV2. It is the need of the hour to collect vital information.ObjectiveTo evaluate and correlate the neuro-radiological and neurological manifestations in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV2.To identify neuro-invasive pathways of COVID infection.MethodsRelevant studies were identified through four databases-the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science. These were searched using relevant keywords-"COVID-19," "SARS-CoV2," "neurological manifestations," "neuroimaging," "CT," and "MRI." Relevant articles were screened according to a pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria from December 2019 to August 2020.ResultsOur review included a total of 63 full text publications with 584 patients, composed mainly of observational studies, case reports, and case series. The most common neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 were altered mental status, stroke, and paralysis. About 17.85% patients who underwent neuroimaging were found to be having ischemic changes suggestive of a stroke. This was followed by hemorrhagic changes as the second most common finding. The most commonly involved vessel was the Middle Cerebral Artery. Besides stroke, we found that SARS-CoV2 could be the cause for new-onset seizures, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, encephalitis, and many other severe neurological diseases.ConclusionThe information that we have obtained so far will prove dynamic to healthcare providers working against the COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary to be aware of these atypical neurological findings for the early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 infected patients. However, to completely understand the connection between SARS-CoV2 and the nervous system, further research is necessary.

AB  - Background: COVID 19 is still presenting a clear and dynamic global threat. The United Kingdom remains one of the hardest hit countries from the pandemic. In January 2021 parliament announced that the UK will be entering a full national lockdown. This paper explores what effect lockdown measures had on rates of deliberate self-harm presentations to one NHS trust in Manchester UK.
   Methods: This paper compared the number of cases of deliberate self-harm which presented to the emergency department of Manchester Royal Infirmary for March-May in 2018, 2019 and 2020. This was achieved by utilising coding from emergency department data and reviewing hospital records surrounding each case.
   Results: 2018 recorded a total of 101 admissions as a result of DSH with all causes admissions of 8,514 making the proportions of admissions due to self-harm 1.19%. In 2019, 9,038 patients were admitted, of these, 130 (1.44%) were identified as DSH. In 2020 the total number of admissions fell to 5,676 with 118 admitted due to self-harm, representing 2.08% of admissions. The absolute number of admissions remained stable however the proportion of admissions due to self-harm was significantly higher in 2020 (p < 0.001). Other significant findings include a higher proportion of male admissions compared to females in 2020 (58.5%) and a decrease in the normal of cases relating to paracetamol overdose in 2020.
   Discussion: The findings demonstrated by this study do not indicate that lockdown is an absolute risk for DSH behaviours however it does illustrate the stable nature of these cases despite and dramatic decline in all cause admissions. The rate of increase of deliberate self-harm accelerated significantly between March and May in 2020. Steps must be taken to avoid a similar situation following the 2021 lockdown and beyond - focus on improving access to certain virtual services may help to achieve this goal.

AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by the development of a negative emotional state that develops after a history of long-term exposure to opioids. OUD represents a true challenge for treatment and relapse prevention. Human research has amply documented emotional disruption in individuals with an opioid substance use disorder, at both behavioral and brain activity levels; however, brain mechanisms underlying this particular facet of OUD are only partially understood. Animal research has been instrumental in elucidating genes and circuits that adapt to long-term opioid use or are modified by acute withdrawal, but research on long-term consequences of opioid exposure and their relevance to the negative affect of OUD remains scarce. In this article, we review the literature with a focus on two questions: 1) Do we have behavioral models in rodents, and what do they tell us? and 2) What do we know about the neuronal populations involved? Behavioral rodent models have successfully recapitulated behavioral signs of the OUD-related negative affect, and several neurotransmitter systems were identified (i.e., serotonin, dynorphin, corticotropin-releasing factor, oxytocin). Circuit mechanisms driving the negative mood of prolonged abstinence likely involve the 5 main reward-aversion brain centers (i.e., nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, habenula, and raphe nucleus), all of which express mu opioid receptors and directly respond to opioids. Future work will identify the nature of these mu opioid receptor-expressing neurons throughout reward-aversion networks, characterize their adapted phenotype in opioid abstinent animals, and hopefully position these primary events in the broader picture of mu opioid receptor-associated brain aversion networks.

AB  - Social cognition refers to processes used to monitor and interpret social signals from others, to decipher their state of mind, emotional status and intentions, and select appropriate social behaviour. Social cognition is sophisticated in humans, being embedded with verbal language and enacted in a complex cultural environment. Its disruption characterises the entire course of schizophrenia and is correlated with poor functional outcome. Further, deficits in social cognition are related to impairment in other cognitive domains, positive symptoms (paranoia and delusions) and negative symptoms (social withdrawal and reduced motivation). In light of the significance and inadequate management of social cognition deficits, there is a need for translatable experimental procedures for their study, and identification of effective pharmacotherapy. No single paradigm captures the multi-dimensional nature of social cognition, and procedures for assessing ability to infer mental states are not well-developed for experimental therapeutic settings. Accordingly, a recent CNTRICS meeting prioritised procedures for measuring a specific construct: "acquisition and recognition of affective (emotional) states", coupled to individual recognition. Two complementary paradigms for refinement were identified: social recognition/preference in rodents, and visual tracking of social scenes in non-human primates (NHPs). Social recognition is disrupted in genetic, developmental or pharmacological disease models for schizophrenia, and performance in both procedures is improved by the neuropeptide oxytocin. The present article surveys a broad range of procedures for studying social cognition in rodents and NHPs, discusses advantages and drawbacks, and focuses on development of social recognition/preference and gaze-following paradigms for improved study of social cognition deficits in schizophrenia and their potential treatment.

AB  - Antipsychotic drug treatment plays a central role in the care of patients with schizophrenia. The chronic nature of the illness means that most patients are likely to require long-term antipsychotic medication to alleviate symptoms and to prevent recurrence of an acute psychotic episode. Unfortunately, a high proportion of patients with schizophrenia do not comply with medication and this has profound consequences in terms of the number and severity of relapse episodes, rehospitalization rates, worsening of residual symptoms and social costs, including substance misuse, homelessness and the burden on carers. Ensuring that antipsychotic treatment is acceptable to the patient is fundamental to managing adherence. Side-effects, particularly mental and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), are the cause of much distress to patients and dissatisfaction with treatment, so a treatment regimen with a low side effect profile will help to improve adherence to the treatment. Such regimens have unmasked many of the other side-effects of treatment that were previously viewed as subsidiary to EPS; but the physical and psychological consequences of side-effects suck as antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction or weight gain are highly distressing to the patient, and as likely as EPS to trigger non-adherence to medication Consequently, careful selection of antipsychotic agent and nose regimens is essential to maximize the efficacy of the antipsychotic and to minimize the overall burden of side-effects. Satisfaction also depends very much on the extent to which the patient understands the treatment and its side-effects. Therefore, a close therapeutic alliance between the patient and the psychiatrist must underpin all attempts to increase the acceptability of treatment. This will allow the clinician to determine how the illness and its treatment are affecting all aspects of the life of the patient, and then to tailor the treatment continuously to obtain the best possible outcome for the patient.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether common important health conditions and their treatments increase risks of occupational injury.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases from inception to November 2006 employing terms for occupational injury, medications, and a broad range of diseases and impairments. Papers related solely to driving, alcohol, or substance abuse were excluded, as were studies that did not allow analysis of injury risk. For each paper that was retrieved we abstracted standard information on the population, design, exposure(s), outcome(s), response rates, confounders and effect estimates; and rated the quality of information provided.
   Results: We found 38 relevant papers (33 study populations): 16 studies were of cross-sectional design, 13 were case-control and 4 were prospective. The overall quality was rated as excellent for only two studies. Most commonly investigated were problems of hearing (15 studies), mental health (11 studies) and vision (10 studies).
   For impaired hearing, neurotic illness, diabetes, epilepsy and use of sedating medication there were moderate positive associations with occupational injury (odds ratios 1.5-2.0), but there were major gaps in the evidence base. Studies covering vision did not present risks by category of eye disease; no evidence was found on psychotic illness; for diabetes, epilepsy and cardiovascular disease there were remarkably few papers; studies seldom distinguished risks by sub-category of external cause or anatomical site and nature of injury; and exposures and outcomes were mostly ascertained by self-report at a single time point, with a lack of clarity about exposure timings.
   Conclusion: Improved research is needed to define the risks of occupational injury arising from common health complaints and treatments. Such research should delineate exposures and outcomes in more detail, and ensure by design that the former precede the latter.

KW  - VIEW
AB  - Research in the field of neuropsychoimmunology has enabled the researchers to show that cytokines target the brain to organize a "sickness response," which is fever, activation of hypothalamuspituitary -adrenal axis and behavioural alterations that develop in sick individuals. Perypheral cytokines do not act directly on the brain; they trigger the production of cytokines in the brain parenchima itself, with a possible relay at the interface between internal milieeu and the brain, which are endothelial cells and circumventricular organs.
   The affective and behavioural changes that develop during influenza are the product of a transient brain inflammatory response induced by the same proinflammatory cytokines that are produced in the bronchial tree. The cytokine pattern is distal to this phenomenon while the receptor molecules that decipher the molecular nature of microbial pathogens (pathogens associated molecular patterns PAMPs) at the membrane level of cells is a proximal factor. PAMPs are recognized by specialized receptors on innate immune cells that belong to the TOLL/ IL-1 like receptor family. These receptors are phylogenetically old. the brain uses these receptors to defend itself against something different (several forms of brain injury that have nothing to do with infectious pathogens) from infectious pathogens. Assuming that the factors that activate these receptors involve endogenous substances derived by cell death (cell death by-products) is the concept at the origin of the danger theory.
   Evidence in favor of a citokines role in mediating mood disorders and cognitive disturbances in patients receiving cytokine immunotherapy is fast growing (capuron e dantzer 2003). Several items of data support the role for cytokines in mediating a variety of non -specific symptoms that develop in patients suffering from diseases with an inflammatory component (cad, immunorheumatolic, neuropathologies). These non-specific neurovegetative and psychiatric symptoms represent just another facet of the inflammatory process and they are not necessarily derived from a direct causeeffect chain.

AB  - What makes us different from one another? Why does one person jump out of airplanes for fun while another prefers to stay home and read? Why are some babies born with a predisposition to become anxious? Questions about individual differences in temperament have engaged the minds of scientists, psychologists, and philosophers for centuries. Recent technological advances in neuroimaging and genetics provide an unprecedented opportunity to answer these questions. Here we review the literature on the neurobiology of one of the most basic individual differences-the tendency to approach or avoid novelty. This trait, called inhibited temperament, is innate, heritable, and observed across species. Importantly, inhibited temperament also confers risk for psychiatric disease. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of inhibited temperament, including neuroimaging and genetic studies in human and non-human primates. We conducted a meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings in inhibited humans that points to alterations in a fronto-limbic-basal ganglia circuit; these findings provide the basis of a model of inhibited temperament neurocircuitry. Lesion and neuroimaging studies in non-human primate models of inhibited temperament highlight roles for the amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsal prefrontal cortex. Genetic studies highlight a role for genes that regulate neurotransmitter function, such as the serotonin transporter polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR), as well as genes that regulate stress response, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Together these studies provide a foundation of knowledge about the genetic and neural substrates of this most basic of temperament traits. Future studies using novel imaging methods and genetic approaches promise to expand upon these biological bases of inhibited temperament and inform our understanding of risk for psychiatric disease.

AB  - Environments are shifting rapidly in the Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions as a result of climate change and other external stressors, and this has a substantial impact on the health of northern populations. Thus, there is a need for integrated surveillance systems designed to monitor the impacts of climate change on human health outcomes as part of broader adaptation strategies in these regions. This review aimed to identify, describe, and synthesize literature on integrated surveillance systems in Circumpolar Arctic and Subarctic regions, that are used for research or practice. Following a systematic realist review approach, relevant articles were identified using search strings developed for MEDLINE (R) and Web of Science databases, and screened by two independent reviewers. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were retained for descriptive quantitative analysis, as well as thematic qualitative analysis, using a realist lens. Of the 3431 articles retrieved in the database searches, 85 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Thematic analysis identified components of integrated surveillance systems that were categorized into three main groups: structural, processual, and relational components. These components were linked to surveillance attributes and activities that supported the operations and management of integrated surveillance. This review advances understandings of the distinct contributions of integrated surveillance systems and data to discerning the nature of changes in climate and environmental conditions that affect population health outcomes and determinants in the Circumpolar North. Findings from this review can be used to inform the planning, design, and evaluation of integrated surveillance systems that support evidence-based public health research and practice in the context of increasing climate change and the need for adaptation.

AB  - Purpose While early access to appropriate care can minimise the sequelae of mental illnesses, little is known about how youths come to access mental healthcare. We therefore conducted a systematic review to synthesise literature on the pathways to care of youths across a range of mental health problems.
   Methods Studies were identified through searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, HealthSTAR and CINAHL), supplemented by backward and forward mapping and hand searching. We included studies on the pathways to mental healthcare of individuals aged 11-30 years. Two reviewers independently screened articles and extracted data.
   Results Forty-five studies from 26 countries met eligibility criteria. The majority of these studies were from settings that offered services for the early stages of psychosis, and others included inpatient and outpatient settings targeting wide-ranging mental health problems. Generally, youths' pathways to mental healthcare were complex, involved diverse contacts, and, sometimes, undue treatment delays. Across contexts, family/carers, general practitioners and emergency rooms featured prominently in care pathways. There was little standardization in the measurement of pathways.
   Conclusions Except in psychosis, youths' pathways to mental healthcare remain understudied. Pathways to care research may need to be reconceptualised to account for the often transient and overlapping nature of youth mental health presentations, and the possibility that what constitutes optimal care may vary. Despite these complexities, additional research, using standardized methodology, can yield a greater understanding of the help-seeking behaviours of youths and those acting on their behalf; service responses to help-seeking; and the determinants of pathways. This understanding is critical to inform ongoing initatives to transform youth mental healthcare.

KW  - COMMON FACTORS
KW  - PSYCHOTHERAPY
AB  - Background: In a highly technical civilization like ours, in which the interest in human communication transcends academic barriers and clinical practice, it seems necessary to look back to Ruesch's work in psychiatry. The main reason of it rests upon the idea that he was one of the few truly outstanding clinicians, researchers, and theoretical in the field of normal and abnormal communication. In fact, he did not only present a wealth of observational and clinical data; more importantly, he used these data to formulate creative hypotheses about the conflict between man and other human beings.
   Aim/Objective: The main purpose of this article is to pay tribute to Dr. Jurgen Ruesch (1909-1995), distinguished psychiatrist, communications experts and psychotherapist. For that reason, here we want to pay tribute to the enormous value of his work for the promotion of mental health and the clinical assessment of normal and pathological communication behavior.
   Methods: In working out his theoretical stance toward communication, all Ruesch's works here have been reviewed. In line with this, the author also mentions similarities between Ruesch and other psychiatric/psychotherapeutic authors. Also similarities have been established between Ruesch and Frank on non specific factors in psychotherapy, and tensions within contemporary training of psychiatrists, almost predicted by Ruesch.
   Results and Conclusions: While some of Ruesch's ideas about the nature and origins of communication has been discounted, many of his preoccupations are now part of the mainstream, and it is to here that we should look for evidence of his legacy. In fact, he has been the author of rich and fruitful ideas, which are essential to clinical understanding of mental diseases and their treatments. It is not surprising, therefore, that Ruesch's burning interest in the clinical assessment of normal and pathological communicative behavior finds a significant echo in today's proliferation of books, papers, and conferences on communication. For all that, we should honor him.

AB  - Objective: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists in the treatment of major depression.
   Method: Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and other databases were conducted for placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinicaltrials of NMDA antagonists in the treatment of depression. Primary outcomes were rates of treatment response and transient remission of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included change in depression symptom severity and the frequency and severity of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects.
   Results for each NMDA antagonist were combined in meta-analyses, reporting odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes. Results: Ketamine (seven trials encompassing 147 ketamine-treated participants) produced a rapid, yet transient, antidepressant effect, with odds ratios for response and transient remission of symptoms at 24 hours equaling 9.87(4.37-22.29) and 14.47 (2.67-78.49), respectively, accompanied by brief psychotomimetic and dissociative effects. Ketamine augmentation of ECT (five trials encompassing 89 ketamine-treated participants) significantly reduced depressive symptoms following an initialtreatment (Hedges' g=0.933) but not at the conclusion of the ECT course. Other NMDA antagonists failed to consistently demonstrate efficacy; however, two partial agonists at the NMDA coagonist site, D-cycloserine and rapastinel, significantly reduced depressive symptoms without psychotomimetic or dissociative effects.
   Conclusions: The antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, and perhaps D-cycloserine and rapastinel, holds promise for future glutamate-modulating strategies; however, the in-effectiveness of other NMDA antagonists suggests that any forthcoming advances will depend on improving our understanding of ketamine's mechanism of action. The fleeting nature of ketamine's therapeutic benefit, coupled with its potential for abuse and neurotoxicity, suggest that its use in the clinical setting warrants caution.

AB  - Mental imagery, or the ability to simulate in the mind information that is not currently perceived by the senses, has attracted considerable research interest in psychology since the early 1970's. Within the past two decades, research in this field-as in cognitive psychology more generally-has been dominated by neuroscientific methods that typically involve comparisons between imagery performance of participants from clinical populations with those who exhibit apparently normal cognitive functioning. Although this approach has been valuable in identifying key neural substrates of visual imagery, it has been less successful in understanding the possible mechanisms underlying another simulation process, namely, motor imagery or the mental rehearsal of actions without engaging in the actual movements involved. In order to address this oversight, a "strength-based" approach has been postulated which is concerned with understanding those on the high ability end of the imagery performance spectrum. Guided by the expert performance approach and principles of ecological validity, converging methods have the potential to enable imagery researchers to investigate the neural "signature" of elite performers, for example. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explain the origin, nature, and implications of the strength-based approach to mental imagery. Following a brief explanation of the background to this latter approach, we highlight some important theoretical advances yielded by recent research on mental practice, mental travel, and meta-imagery processes in expert athletes and dancers. Next, we consider the methodological implications of using a strength based approach to investigate imagery processes. The implications for the field of motor cognition are outlined and specific research questions, in dynamic imagery, imagery perspective, measurement, multi-sensory imagery, and metacognition that may benefit from this approach in the future are sketched briefly.

AB  - Depression is one of the most common and debilitating psychiatric disorders and is a leading cause of suicide. Most people who become depressed will have multiple episodes, and some depressions are chronic. Persons with bipolar disorder will also have manic or hypomanic episodes. Given the recurrent nature of the disorder, it is important no just to treat the acute episode, but also to protect against its return and the onset of subsequent episodes.
   Several types of interventions have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression. The antidepressant medications are relatively safe and work for many patients, but there is no evidence that they reduce risk of recurrence once their use is terminated. The different medication classes are roughly comparable in efficacy, although some are easier to tolerate than are others. About half of all patients will respond to a given medication, and many of those who do not will respond to some other agent or to a combination of medications. Electro-convulsive therapy is particularly effective for the most severe and resistant depressions, but raises concerns about possible deleterious effects on memory and cognition. It is rarely used until a number of different medications have been tried.
   Although it is still unclear whether traditional psychodynamic approaches are effective in treating depression, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has fared well in controlled comparisons with medications and other types of psychotherapies. It also appears to have a delayed effect that improves the quality of social relationships and interpersonal skills. It has been shown to reduce acute distress and to prevent relapse and recurrence so long as it is continued or maintained. Treatment combining IPT with medication retains the quick results of pharmacotherapy and the greater interpersonal breadth of IPT, as well as boosting response in patients who are otherwise more difficult to treat. The main problem is that IPT has only recently entered clinical practice and is not widely available to those in need.
   Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) also appears to be efficacious in treating depression, and recent studies suggest that it can work for even severe depressions in the hands of experienced therapists. Not only can CBT relieve acute distress, but it also appears to reduce risk for the return of symptoms as long as it is continued or maintained. Moreover, it appears to have an enduring effect that reduces risk for relapse or recurrence long after treatment is over. Combined treatment with medication and CBT appears to be as efficacious as treatment with medication alone and to retain the enduring effects of CBT. There also are indications that the same strategies used to reduce risk in psychiatric patients following successful treatment can be used to prevent the initial onset of depression in persons at risk. More purely behavioral interventions have been studied less than the cognitive therapies, but have performed well in recent trials and exhibit many of the benefits of cognitive therapy.
   Mood stabilizers like lithium or the anticonvulsants form the core treatment for bipolar disorder, but there is a growing recognition that the outcomes produced by modern pharmacology are not sufficient. Both IPT and CBT show promise as adjuncts to medication with such patients. The same is true for family-focused therapy, which is designed to reduce inter-personal conflict in the family. Clearly, more needs to be done with respect to treatment of the bipolar disorders.
   Good medical management of depression can be hard to find, and the empirically supported psychotherapies are still not widely practiced. As a consequence, many patients do not have access to adequate treatment. Moreover, not everyone responds to the existing interventions, and not enough is known about what to do for people who are not helped by treatment. Although great strides have been made over the past few decades, much remains to be done with respect to the treatment of depression and the bipolar disorders.

AB  - Flexible behavior requires guidance not only by sensations that are available immediately but also by relevant mental contents carried forward through working memory. Therefore, selective-attention functions that modulate the contents of working memory to guide behavior (inside-out) are just as important as those operating on sensory signals to generate internal contents (outside-in). We review the burgeoning literature on selective attention in the inside-out direction and underscore its functional, flexible, and future-focused nature.We discuss in turn the purpose (why), targets (what), sources (when), and mechanisms (how) of selective attention inside working memory, using visual working memory as a model. We show how the study of internal selective attention brings new insights concerning the core cognitive processes of attention and working memory and how considering selective attention and working memory together paves the way for a rich and integrated understanding of how mind serves behavior.

AB  - Moscarello and Penzo propose that mutually inhibitory circuits within the central nucleus of the amygdala implement a 'winner-takes-all' mechanism that guides transitions across defensive modes defined by threat-imminence theory.
   In nature, animals display defensive behaviors that reflect the spatiotemporal distance of threats. Laboratory-based paradigms that elicit specific defensive responses in rodents have provided valuable insight into the brain mechanisms that mediate the construction of defensive modes with varying degrees of threat imminence. In this Review, we discuss accumulating evidence that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) plays a key role in this process. Specifically, we propose that the mutually inhibitory circuits of the CeA use a winner-takes-all strategy that supports transitioning across defensive modes and the execution of specific defensive behaviors to previously formed threat associations. Our proposal provides a conceptual framework in which seemingly divergent observations regarding CeA function can be interpreted and identifies various areas of priority for future research.

AB  - Purpose of Review This review examines the literature on technology-facilitated sexual violence (TFSV). The prevalence, perpetrators, harms, and victims of a selection of types of TFSV are covered. Particularly, the topics of image-based sexual abuse, video voyeurism, sending of unsolicited sexual images, and the use of technology to facilitate in-person sexual violence are discussed. Recent Findings The literature suggests that the types of TFSV discussed are prevalent and the impacts far-reaching. There is emerging evidence outlining the characteristics associated with and motivations behind these acts of TFSV. The impacts of TFSV victimization can be diverse and damaging. Many questions about TFSV are unanswered, highlighting the need for more empirical investigations. Technology can be used to facilitate sexual violence through several means. It is clear that there is the potential for the impact on victims to be extensive; thus, it is critical that more work be done to understand the extent and nature of TFSV and the individuals who perpetrate this type of violence.

AB  - Early adversity (EA) impairs myelin development in a manner that persists later in life across diverse mammalian species including humans, non-human primates, and rodents. These observations, coupled with the highly conserved nature of myelin development suggest that animal models can provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which EA impairs myelin development later in life and the impact of these changes on network connectivity, cognition, and behavior. However, this area of translational research has received relatively little attention and no comprehensive review is currently available to address these issues. This is particularly important given some recent mechanistic studies in rodents and the availability of new agents to increase myelination. The goals of this review are to highlight the need for additional pre-clinical work in this area and to provide specific examples that demonstrate the potential of this work to generate novel therapeutic interventions that are highly needed.

AB  - Fear is considered an integral part of the brain's defensive mechanism that evolved to protect animals and humans from predation and other ecological threats. Hence, it is logical to study fear from the perspective of antipredator-survival behaviors and circuits by sampling a range of threatening situations that organisms are likely to encounter in the wild. In the past several decades, however, mainstream fear research has focused on the importance of associative learning; that is, how animals become frightened of innocuous cues as consequences of their contingent pairing with aversive events. While significant discoveries have been made, contemporary fear models derived from learning studies are likely to provide only a partial picture of the brain's fear system because they cannot simulate the dynamic range of risky situations in nature that require various adaptive actions and decisions. This review considers two different approaches to study fear, grounded on behaviorism and ethology and examines their contributions in revealing the naturalistic workings of fear in guiding and shaping behavior as animals make real-world choices.

AB  - Computer-based instruction (CBI) is becoming increasingly popular in the classroom, particularly because the latest technological advancements allow for visually rich and interactive environments. While the inherent nature of CB's is often thought to engage learners, research examining the role of motivation in learning with these environments has resulted in mixed findings. These findings are further complicated by unique design characteristics of distinct CBIs. This literature review synthesizes research that has examined the role of theoretically-grounded constructs of motivation in the context of three popular CBIs, multimedia, hypermedia, and hypertext. Specifically, this literature review considered empirical studies that examined the effect of these CB's on motivation, in addition to the effect of motivation on learning outcomes and the learning process within the context of these environments. The literature review concludes with a theoretical consideration of previous research and a discussion of a framework for future directions. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article I analyse the extent to which there has been a shift in the cultural turn in legal scholarship and specifically from visual to what I call material jurisprudence, that is from visual to material ways of knowing law. I do so through an analysis of Desmond Manderson's edited collection, Law and the Visual: Representations, Technologies, Critique (2018a), and Katherine Biber's monograph, In Crime's Archive: The Cultural Afterlife of Evidence (2018b). Inspired by the material turn in the arts and humanities I apply a material lens as defined by historians of emotions (Downes et al. 2018) working within this turn to these books. Using this lens, I analyse the extent to which the authors conceptualise and analyse their primary sources in material terms. In so doing it is my intention to encourage scholars of visual jurisprudence to consider the multisensorial nature of law by considering the material as a constitutive part or instead of the visual as has happened elsewhere in the arts, humanities and social sciences, as well as to do so with greater specificity and depth.

AB  - False belief understanding was investigated in maltreated (N = 203), low socioeconomic status (SUS) nonmaltreated (N = 143), and middle SES nonmaltreated (N = 172) 3- to 8-year-old children. Contrasts among the three groups provided an opportunity to examine the impact of family contextual influences on theory of mind development. Specifically, child maltreatment served as an "experiment of nature" in order to elucidate theory of mind abilities. Two false belief tasks and language assessments were administered. Among children with a verbal mental age of 49 months or greater, maltreatment was related to delays in the development of theory of mind, beyond the influence of chronological age and SES. The occurrence of maltreatment during the toddler period, onset during the toddler years, and physical abuse were features of maltreatment associated with delay in the development of theory of mind. Findings are discussed in terms of the influence of harsh caregiving on the development of theory of mind. Implications for the understanding of normal developmental processes are highlighted.

AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a functionally and morphologically complex cellular organelle largely responsible for a variety of crucial functions, including protein folding, maturation and degradation. Furthermore, the ER plays an essential role in lipid biosynthesis, dynamic Ca2+ storage, and detoxification. Malfunctions in ER-related processes are responsible for the genesis and progression of many diseases, such as heart failure, cancer, neurodegeneration and metabolic disorders. To fulfill many of its vital functions, the ER relies on a sufficient energy supply in the form of adenosine-5 '-triphosphate (ATP), the main cellular energy source. Despite landmark discoveries and clarification of the functional principles of ER-resident proteins and key ER-related processes, the mechanism underlying ER ATP transport remains somewhat enigmatic. Here we summarize ER-related ATP-consuming processes and outline our knowledge about the nature and function of the ER energy supply.

AB  - Binding various features of an event together and maintaining these connections in memory is an essential component of episodic memories. Previous theories make contradictory predictions about the effects of emotional arousal on memory binding. In this article, I review evidence for both arousal-impaired and arousal-enhanced memory binding and explain these contradictory findings using an object-based framework. According to this framework, emotionally arousing objects attract attention that enhances binding of their constituent features. In contrast, the emotional arousal associated with one object either impairs or has no effect on the associations between that object and other distinct objects or background contextual information. After initial encoding, the attention-grabbing nature of emotionally arousing objects can lead to interference in working memory, making it more difficult to maintain other bound representations. These contrasting effects of arousal on memory binding should help predict which aspects of emotional memories are likely to be accurate and which aspects are likely to be misremembered.

AB  - San Duanmu's "Phonology of Standard Chinese" is the first book-length English-language treatise on the synchronic sound system of Mandarin Chinese in twenty years. The author incorporates linguistic theories developed since the 1970s, such as autosegmental phonology, feature geometry, and optimality theory, to give an updated and much more accurate account of the segmental and supra-segmental units of Standard Chinese, while at the same time constructing an original model of stress, tone, and syllable structure. He provides in the process unique insights to age-old controversies such as missing combinations in the Mandarin syllabary, the nature of the Mandarin third tone and Tone 3 Sandhi, and why Chinese morphology is sensitive to the number of syllables in an expression. Duanmu's work is a marriage of Western phonetic/phonological science and Chinese laboratory and survey data - one that constitutes a substantial advance in our understanding of the structure of Modern Standard Chinese.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been the focus of extensive research with regard to the phenotypic plasticity this system shows in response to environmental influences on mammalian development. This review proposes that the mesolimbic dopamine system is similarly reactive to indicators of environmental adversity during development. Physical, physiological, and toxicological stressors encountered during perinatal development have been routinely demonstrated to affect dopamine neurophysiology, most likely through consequent exposure to maternal glucocorticoids or a reduction in oxygen supply. However, findings remain inconsistent with regard to the nature of impact these events have on the dopamine system. Both hyper- and hypo-dopaminergic changes have been noted. This review argues that the directionality of change is a function of chronicity and severity of the insult, and that both resultant phenotypes are adaptive developmental responses, despite their potential for conferring vulnerability for psychopathology in humans.

AB  - The transition from quiet wakeful rest to sleep represents a period over which attention to the external environment fades. Neuroimaging methodologies have provided much information on the shift in neural activity patterns in sleep, but the dynamic restructuring of human brain networks in the transitional period from wake to sleep remains poorly understood. Analysis of electrophysiological measures and functional network connectivity of these early transitional states shows subtle shifts in network architecture that are consistent with reduced external attentiveness and increased internal and self-referential processing. Further, descent to sleep is accompanied by the loss of connectivity in anterior and posterior portions of the default-mode network and more locally organized global network architecture. These data clarify the complex and dynamic nature of the transitional period between wake and sleep and suggest the need for more studies investigating the dynamics of these processes.

AB  - Cellular health depends on the integrity and functionality of the proteome. Each cell is equipped with a protein quality control machinery that maintains protein homeostasis (proteostasis) by helping proteins adopt and keep their native structure, and ensuring the degradation of damaged proteins. Postmitotic cells such as neurons are especially vulnerable to disturbances of proteostasis. Defects of protein quality control occur in aging and have been linked to several disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact nature and time course of such disturbances in the context of brain diseases remain poorly understood. Sensors that allow visualization and quantitative analysis of proteostasis capacity in neurons are essential for gaining a better understanding of disease mechanisms and for testing potential therapies. Here, I provide an overview of available biosensors for assessing the functionality of the neuronal proteostasis network, point out the advantages and limitations of different sensors, and outline their potential for biological discoveries and translational applications.

AB  - Contemporary literature on consciousness, with some exceptions, rarely considers the olfactory system. In this article the characteristics of olfactory consciousness, viewed from the standpoint of the phenomenal (P)/access (A) distinction, are examined relative to the major senses. The review details several qualitative differences in both olfactory P consciousness (shifts in the felt location, universal synesthesia-like and affect-rich experiences, and misperceptions) and A consciousness (recovery from habituation, capacity for conscious processing, access to semantic and episodic memory, learning, attention, and in the serial-unitary nature of olfactory percepts). The basis for these differences is argued to arise from the functions that the olfactory system performs and from the unique neural architecture needed to instantiate them. These data suggest, at a minimum, that P and A consciousness are uniquely configured in olfaction and an argument can be made that the P and A distinction may not hold for this sensory system.

AB  - Even though the idea that schizophrenia is a neurobehavioral syndrome has become a mainstream position, there is no consensus on the precise nature of the cognitive and neuropsychological impairment. Research on cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia has been directed toward discriminating stable dysfunctions (traits) from symptom-linked (state) deficits. A longitudinal study design is the only one that can provide answers to the question of the stability of psychological functions, This article reviews 15 studies with a followup of at least a year. The main conclusion drawn from these studies is that after the onset of schizophrenia, cognitive deficits are relatively stable over long periods. No support for a decline in cognitive functions is found. Thus, schizophrenia does not appear to be a degenerative process, but rather a static encephalopathy. Whether or not the cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia can be remediated is still an open question that needs to be examined.

AB  - Emotion concepts are important. They help us to understand, experience and predict human behaviour. Emotion concepts also link the realm of the abstract with the realm of bodily experience and actions. Accordingly, the key question is how such concepts are created, represented and used. Embodied cognition theories hold that concepts are grounded in neural systems that produce experiential and motor states. Concepts are also contextually situated and thus engage sensorimotor resources in a dynamic, flexible way. Finally, on that framework, conceptual understanding unfolds in time, reflecting embodied as well as linguistic and cultural influences. In this article, we review empirical work on emotion concepts and show how it highlights their grounded, yet dynamic and context-sensitive nature. The conclusions are consistent with recent developments in embodied cognition that allow concepts to be linked to sensorimotor systems, yet be flexibly sensitive to current representational and action needs.

AB  - Hypoosmolality and hyperosmolality are relatively common clinical problems. Many different factors contribute to the substantial morbidity and mortality known to occur during states of altered osmotic homeostasis. The brain is particularly vulnerable to disturbances of body fluid osmolality. The most serious complications are associated with pathological changes in brain volume: brain edema during hypoosmolar states and brain dehydration during hyperosmolar states. Studies in animals have elucidated many of the mechanisms involved with brain adaptation to osmotic stresses, and indicate that it is a complex process involving transient changes in water content and sustained changes in electrolyte and organic osmolyte contents. Appreciation of the nature of the adaptation process, and conversely the deadaptation processes that occur after recovery from hypoosmolality and hyperosmolality, enables a better understanding of the marked variations in neurological sequelae that characterize hyperosmolar and hypoosmolar states, and provides a basis for more rational therapies.

AB  - What is the function of disgust? Whereas traditional models have suggested that disgust serves to protect the self or neutralize reminders of our animal nature, an evolutionary perspective suggests that disgust functions to solve 3 qualitatively different adaptive problems related to pathogen avoidance, mate choice, and social interaction. The authors investigated this 3-domain model of disgust across 4 studies and examined how sensitivity to these functional domains relates to individual differences in other psychological constructs. Consistent with their predictions, factor analyses demonstrated that disgust sensitivity partitions into domains related to pathogens, sexuality, and morality. Further, sensitivity to the 3 domains showed predictable differentiation based on sex, perceived vulnerability to disease, psychopathic tendencies, and Big 5 personality traits. In exploring these 3 domains of disgust, the authors introduce a new measure of disgust sensitivity. Appreciation of the functional heterogeneity of disgust has important implications for research on individual differences in disgust sensitivity, emotion, clinical impairments, and neuroscience.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) have gained increasing concern due to their persistent characteristics, wide distribution, biotoxicity, and bioaccumulative properties. The current remediation technologies for PFOA and PFOS are primarily focused on physical and chemical techniques. Phytoremediation has provided promising alternatives to traditional cleanup technologies due to their low operational costs, low maintenance requirements, end-use value, and aesthetic nature. In this review, uptake, translocation, and toxic effects of PFOS and PFOA are summarized and discussed. Several potential hyperaccumulators of PFOS and PFOA are provided according to the existing data. Biomass, chlorophyll, soluble protein, enzyme activities, oxidative stress, and other variables are assessed for potential indicator of PFOS/PFOA biotoxicity. The various studies on multiple scales are compared for identifying the threshold values. Several important implications and recommendations for future research are proposed at the end. This review provides an overview of current studies on plant uptake of PFOS and PFOA from the perspective of phytoremediation.

AB  - Objective:  The authors were aware of a high level of aggression in their centre and felt that a systematic review of incidents of aggression could be of benefit to both staff and residents. Metho& A retrospective review of all incidents over a one year period was performed. Data involving the resident and the incident itself were analysed. An ICD 9 psychiatric diagnosis was attributed to each resident where possible. Results: The results show a large number of incidents, mostly of a minor nature. In almost half the incidents the nurse was the victim. There was a lower number of incidents in January and February. Forty one of the 45 residents involved in incidents had a psychiatric diagnosis. Conclusion: There is a general trend for moving from residential settings to the community. Our results suggest that as time goes on our centre will contain more residents with a psychiatric diagnosis who have a potential for aggression. We suggest ways of coping with this aggression and produce an incident form for recording aggressive incidents.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious challenge for societies around the globe as entire populations have fallen victim to the infectious spread and have taken up social distancing. In many countries, people have had to self-isolate and to be confined to their homes for several weeks to months to prevent the spread of the virus. Social distancing measures have had both negative and positive impacts on various aspects of economies, lifestyles, education, transportation, food supply, health, social life, and mental wellbeing. On other hands, due to reduced population movements and the decline in human activities, gas emissions decreased and the ozone layer improved; this had a positive impact on Earth's weather and environment. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has negative effects on human activities and positive impacts on nature. This study discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different life aspects including the economy, social life, health, education, and the environment.

AB  - The nature of mental illness remains a conundrum. Traditional disease categories are increasingly suspected to misrepresent the causes underlying mental disturbance. Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease. This primer aims to introduce clinicians and researchers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing machine intelligence into psychiatric practice.

AB  - From the perspective of terror management theory, the human body is problematic because it serves as a perpetual reminder of the inevitability of death. Human beings confront this problem through the development of cultural worldviews that imbue reality-and the body as part of that reality-with abstract symbolic meaning. This fanciful flight from death is in turn the psychological impetus for distancing from other animals and the need to regulate behaviors that remind us of our physical nature. This analysis is applied to questions concerning why people are embarrassed and disgusted by their bodies' functions; why sex is such a common source of problems, difficulties, regulations, and ritualizations; why sex tends to be associated with romantic love; and why cultures value physical attractiveness and objectify women. This article then briefly considers implications of this analysis for understanding psychological problems related to the physical body and cultural variations in the need to separate oneself from the natural world.

AB  - We propose a new approach for examining self-related aspects and phenomena. The approach includes (1) a taxonomy and (2) an emphasis on multiple levels of mechanisms. The taxonomy categorizes approximately eighty self-related phenomena according to three primary functions involving the self: representing, effecting, and changing. The representing self encompasses the ways in which people depict themselves, either to themselves or to others (e.g., self-concepts, self-presentation). The effecting self concerns ways in which people facilitate or limit their own traits and behaviors (e.g., self-enhancement, self-regulation). The changing self is less time-limited than the effecting self; it concerns phenomena that involve lasting alterations in how people represent and control themselves (e.g., self-expansion, self-development). Each self-related phenomenon within these three categories may be examined at four levels of interacting mechanisms (social, individual, neural, and molecular). We illustrate our approach by focusing on seven self-related phenomena.

AB  - The position advanced in this paper is that the bedrock of emotional feelings is contained within the evolved emotional action apparatus of mammalian brains. This dual-aspect monism approach to brain-mind functions, which asserts that emotional feelings may reflect the neurodynamics of brain systems that generate instinctual emotional behaviors, saves us from various conceptual conundrums. In coarse form, primary process affective consciousness seems to be fundamentally an unconditional "gift of nature" rather than an acquired skill, even though those systems facilitate skill acquisition via various felt reinforcements. Affective consciousness, being a comparatively intrinsic function of the brain, shared homologously by all mammalian species, should be the easiest variant of consciousness to study in animals. This is not to deny that some secondary processes (e.g., awareness of feelings in the generation of behavioral choices) cannot be evaluated in animals with sufficiently clever behavioral learning procedures, as with place-preference procedures and the analysis of changes in learned behaviors after one has induced re-valuation of incentives. Rather, the claim is that a direct neuroscientific study of primary process emotional/affective states is best achieved through the study of the intrinsic ("instinctual"), albeit experientially refined, emotional action tendencies of other animals. In this view, core emotional feelings may reflect the neurodynamic attractor landscapes of a variety of extended trans-diencephalic, limbic emotional action systems-including SEEKING, FEAR, RAGE, LUST, CARE, PANIC, and PLAY. Through a study of these brain systems, the neural infrastructure of human and animal affective consciousness may be revealed. Emotional feelings are instantiated in large-scale neurodynamics that can be most effectively monitored via the ethological analysis of emotional action tendencies and the accompanying brain neurochemical/electrical changes. The intrinsic coherence of such emotional responses is demonstrated by the fact that they can be provoked by electrical and chemical stimulation of specific brain zones-effects that are affectively laden. For substantive progress in this emerging research arena, animal brain researchers need to discuss affective brain functions more openly. Secondary awareness processes, because of their more conditional, contextually situated nature, are more difficult to understand in any neuroscientific detail. In other words, the information-processing brain functions, critical for cognitive consciousness, are harder to study in other animals than the more homologous emotional/motivational affective state functions of the brain.

AB  - Humans have mental time in our mind, apart from physical time that is a part of system that governs the physical world, and memory is our key cognitive ability for recognizing the passage of time. Recent studies have suggested that the memory system of several nonhuman animals may have an incidental nature, which is also a feature of episodic memory. In addition, apes, which are phylogenetically close to humans, have an ability to remember a single past event. In the case of humans, preverbal infants under the age of two are able to retain long-term memory of a single event and apply it to predict a future event. Thus, nonhuman animals and preverbal human infants both have their own specific mental time travel abilities, and there is a phylogenetic and ontogenic basis of full-fledged mental time travel that can be found in human adults.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder featuring obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors performed in the context of rigid rituals). There is strong evidence for a neurobiological basis of this disorder, involving limbic cortical regions and related basal ganglion areas. However, more research is needed to lift the veil on the precise nature of that involvement and the way it drives the clinical expression of OCD. Altered cognitive functions may underlie the symptoms and thus draw a link between the clinical expression of the disorder and its neurobiological etiology. Our extensive review demonstrates that OCD patients do present a broad range of neuropsychological dysfunctions across all cognitive domains (memory, attention, flexibility, inhibition, verbal fluency, planning, decision-making), but some methodological issues temper this observation. Thus, future research should have a more integrative approach to cognitive functioning, gathering contributions of both experimental psychology and more fundamental neurosciences.

AB  - Objective: Patients with eating disorders (EDs) are often difficult to treat. Despite recent advances in treatment, a significant percentage of patients remain treatment refractory. This paper reviews variables that contribute to these difficulties and recent strategies that focus on increasing patient motivation for treatment.
   Method: The authors relate their clinical experience and synthesize the literature examining aspects of patients with EDs that may contribute to their treatment resistance anal therapist variables that may contribute to negative nontherapeutic reactions.
   Results: Patient variables include the nature of the symptoms that patients experience, issues of trust, the not uncommon failure of ambulatory treatments, anal issues related to comorbidity. Aspects of clinicians include lack of understanding of the biopsychosocial pathophysiology of these conditions and lack of experience and appreciation for the countertransferential reactions that these patients evoke in caregivers.
   Conclusions: Improving understanding of the reasons for treatment refractoriness in patients with EDs is critical to improving their care. New interventions aimed at enhancing motivation may facilitate this process.

AB  - Several first-line chemotherapeutic agents, including taxanes, platinum agents and proteasome inhibitors, are associated with the dose-limiting side effect of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN predominantly manifests as sensory symptoms, which are likely due to drug accumulation within peripheral nervous tissues rather than the central nervous system. No treatment is currently available to prevent or reverse CIPN. The causal mechanisms underlying CIPN are not yet fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a major factor contributing to the development and maintenance of CIPN. This chapter will provide an overview of both clinical and preclinical data supporting this hypothesis. We will review the studies reporting the nature of mitochondrial dysfunction evoked by chemotherapy in terms of changes in mitochondrial morphology, bioenergetics and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Furthermore, we will discuss the in vivo effects of pharmacological interventions that counteract chemotherapy-evoked mitochondrial dysfunction and ameliorate pain-like behavior.

AB  - People are objectified when they are treated as a means to a goal. The most common example is when women are sexually objectified and reduced to their physical appearance, sexuality, or individual body parts. In such instances, people are used in the same way as objects and are evaluated according to their instrumentality to the others' goals. The aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of objectification. We will (a) outline basic principles of means-goal relations during goal pursuit, (b) review research in which people are means to goals, (c) explain objectification according to a means-goal psychology in which people serve as means to goals, and (d) explain the implications of our account for the consequences of objectification. Specifically, we argue objectification is inevitable and that the consequences of objectification, including its morality, depend on the goal to which a person serves and whether the objectified person wants to serve that goal.

TI  - MICROGENETIC APPROACH TO THOUGHT AND MEMORY
AB  - In neuropsychology, disorders of memory and thinking are usually treated as independent problems mediated by different neural substrates. This paper describes the process of thinking from a microgenetic standpoint, and to this end, takes up some aspects of thought that are often neglected in other accounts, such as the relation of conscious thought to unconscious process, the relation to memory, and to the self, agency and causation. The argument is that thought, memory, language and feeling are generated by a common process, with language "grafted" to the axis of act and object development. The apparent separation of these capacities is due to a difference in the configural nature of the core construct, the primary path of its micro-temporal development (action, perception), the dominant segment in the phase-transition and the emphasis in the mental state underlying the final content on visual or verbal imagery, i.e. introspection or imagination. It is hoped that this approach will provide an antidote to the increasing modularization of content and neglect of formative process anterior to content, and recapture the generality out of which an act of cognition develops.

AB  - Although first mentions about calcium disturbances in psychiatric diseases appeared more than 30 years ago, the most recent genomic and proteomic findings confirmed a significant role of Ca2+ and Ca2+-regulated pathways in development of neuropathological processes, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Moreover, last decades have shown that due to multifactorial nature of both diseases, impairment in neuronal calcium homeostasis may depend not only on disturbed Ca2+-ATPase entry system, but also on altered extrusion system. A pivotal role in Ca2+ clearance mechanism is played by plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), the enzyme responsible for returning the elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+ back to the resting state. In this paper we summarize the current knowledge about the role of PMCA in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia pathologies, as well as the contribution of several proteins that by interaction with PMCA modify signal transduction mechanisms.

AB  - A number of theories have proposed the involvement of different brain structures and neurotransmitters in order to explain the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. However, there is no clear consensus as to the mechanisms through which the brain structures and their various neurotransmitters interact to produce theses phases.
   Perhaps the problem is related to the fact sleep is a very fragile state, easily modified or influenced by a variety of substances or experimental manipulations. In this paper, we describe the evidence of two different groups of factors that induce important changes on the sleep-wake cycle.
   The endogenous factors: neurotransmitters; hormone; peptides; and some substances of lipidic nature and exogenous factors: stress, food intake, learning, sleep deprivation, sensorial stimulation, exercise and temperature on the regulation the sleep-wake cycle.
   Likewise, we propose a hypothesis which attempts to reconcile the fact that endogenous and exogenous factors have similar effects. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.

   Criteria for inclusion and exclusion of articles - The world literature since 1977 was surveyed to obtain an overview of the current research effort on injury epidemiology and prevention. Articles were cited to illustrate the breadth and nature of work published on the topic with special reference to the prevention of home and traffic injuries.
   Conclusions - There has been a recent upsurge of interest in injury prevention, although much of the work has been descriptive rather than analytical or evaluative. The implementation of existing knowledge has been patchy. To meet the information needs of effective injury prevention, several elements of an international research agenda are proposed. These include: the achievement of a consensus on terminology, definition, and classification; clarification of the roles of social deprivation, gender, risk taking behaviour, personality, stress, alcohol, drugs, chronic illness, and disability in the aetiology of injury; the development of multi-agency models of good injury prevention practice; the evaluation of counter-measures; the development and evaluation of routine injury surveillance systems.

AB  - Addiction is a disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and consumption observed in 20-30% of users. An addicted individual will favor drug reward over natural rewards, despite major negative consequences. Mechanistic research on rodents modeling core components of the disease has identified altered synaptic transmission as the functional substrate of pathological behavior. While the initial version of a circuit model for addiction focused on early drug adaptive behaviors observed in all individuals, it fell short of accounting for the stochastic nature of the transition to compulsion. The model builds on the initial pharmacological effect common to all addictive drugs-an increase in dopamine levels in the mesolimbic system. Here, we consolidate this early model by integrating circuits underlying compulsion and negative reinforcement. We discuss the genetic and epigenetic correlates of individual vulnerability. Many recent data converge on a gain-of-function explanation for circuit remodeling, revealing blueprints for novel addiction therapies.

AB  - ADHD is an impairing psychological disorder that predominantly affects children, but also adults to a lesser extent. As a result, a considerable amount of research has been completed in recent years to better understand the nature of the disorder to best treat individuals experiencing symptoms of ADHD. Especially with the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) (DSM-V) on the horizon, substantial empirical work has been analyzing current ADHD diagnostic criteria and what upcoming changes should be made. Among child and adult populations, adjusting or completely eradicating the age of onset criterion is well supported. With specifically adult populations, amending symptoms to be more developmentally and environmentally appropriate also appears necessary. Even though research additionally questions the state of ADHD subtypes (with both child and adult populations) and other general diagnostic issues (model for diagnosis and level of impairment), continued research is needed to better clarify what other changes should be made in the DSM-V and beyond.

AB  - Personality, from an evolutionary perspective, represents a meta-category of the output of a suite of species-typical, relatively domain-specific, evolved psychological mechanisms designed in response to the social adaptive problems recurrently faced by our ancestors. This conceptualization of human personality provides for novel and valuable reinterpretations of several areas of personality psychology including personality consistency, individual differences in personality, sex differences and similarities, and contextual determinants of personality. Explaining human personality from an evolutionary perspective has led to discoveries about the function of social information conveyed through standings on the Big-Five personality dimensions and discoveries in topics such as social anxiety, jealousy, altruism, aggression, psychopathology, mate preferences, and desire for sexual variety. We argue that limitations of the application of evolutionary theory to personality science are surmountable and that, despite these limitations, large strides have been and will continue to be made through a union of personality science and evolutionary science.

AB  - The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has deleterious effects on children. Our research observed mothers' conversations with their 5-7-year-old children about the conflict during shared book reading (SBR) of a fiction book, indirectly depicting the conflict. Using a mixed-methods study, we compared the SBR of secular and religious Israeli Jewish mothers. We videotaped the SBR interactions and interviewed the mothers about the nature of their SBR conversations with their child and their perceptions of political socialization of children. The main findings showed that despite their tendency to perceive the conflict differently, secular and religious mothers shared the book similarly. Most of them preferred to talk about the conflict as little as possible with their child but appreciated the opportunity that the book provided them to discuss it in an age appropriate manner. Our discussion focuses on the potential of SBR to assist parents in explaining the conflict to young children.

AB  - Over the last few decades, evidence has been emerging that the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia can involve perturbations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Variations in the manifestation of these effects could be related to the differences in clinical symptoms between affected individuals as well as to differences in treatment response. Such effects can also arise from the complex interaction between genes and environmental factors. Here, we review the effects of maternal stress on abnormalities in HPA axis regulation and the development of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Studies in this area may prove critical for increasing our understanding of the multi-dimensional nature of schizophrenia. Further research in this area could ultimately lead to the development of improved diagnostics and novel therapeutic approaches for treating this debilitating psychiatric condition.

AB  - The nature of abstract and concrete semantics and differences between them have remained a debated issue in psycholinguistic and cognitive studies for decades. Most of the available behavioral and neuroimaging studies reveal distinctions between these two types of semantics, typically associated with a so-called "concreteness effect." Many attempts have been made to explain these differences using various approaches, from purely theoretical linguistic and cognitive frameworks to neuroimaging experiments. In this brief overview, we will try to provide a snapshot of these diverse views and relationships between them and highlight the crucial issues preventing this problem from being solved. We will argue that one potentially beneficial way forward is to identify the neural mechanisms underpinning acquisition of the different types of semantics (e.g., by using neurostimulation techniques to establish causal relationships), which may help explain the distinctions found between the processing of concrete and abstract semantics.

AB  - Computational psychiatry aims to apply mathematical and computational techniques to help improve psychiatric care. To achieve this, the phenomena under scrutiny should be within the scope of formal methods. As emotions play an important role across many psychiatric disorders, such computational methods must encompass emotions. Here, we consider formal valuation accounts of emotions. We focus on the fact that the flexibility of emotional responses and the nature of appraisals suggest the need for a model-based valuation framework for emotions. However, resource limitations make plain model-based valuation impossible and require metareasoning strategies to apportion cognitive resources adaptively. We argue that emotions may implement such metareasoning approximations by restricting the range of behaviors and states considered. We consider the processes that guide the deployment of the approximations, discerning between innate, model-free, heuristic, and model-based controllers. A formal valuation and metareasoning framework may thus provide a principled approach to examining emotions.

AB  - The primal affects are intrinsic brain value systems that unconditionally and automatically inform animals how they are faring in survival. They serve an essential function in emotional learning. The positive affects index "comfort zones" that support survival, while negative affects inform animals of circumstances that may impair survival. Affective feelings come in several varieties, including sensory, homeostatic, and emotional (which I focus on here). Primary-process emotional feelings arise from ancient caudal and medial subcortical regions, and were among the first subjective experiences to exist on the face of the earth. Without them, higher forms of conscious "awareness" may not have emerged in primate brain evolution. Because of homologous "instinctual" neural infrastructures, we can utilize animal brain research to reveal the nature of primary-process human affects. Since all vertebrates appear to have some capacity for primal affective feelings, the implications for animal-welfare and how we ethically treat other animals are vast. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The General Factor of Personality (GFP) is a higher-order factor causing lower -order personality traits to show consistent correlations in a socially desirable direction. The literature on the GFP reveals that there are various scientific interpretations of this construct. One interpretation is that it is a substantive factor reflecting general social effectiveness and exerting a broad influence on behavior. Another interpretation is that it merely reflects methodological or statistical artifacts and has no further relevance for personality research. We review the empirical literature on the nature of the GFP, its possible links to evolutionary processes, and its relation to other constructs overlapping with social effectiveness. We conclude that the substantive interpretation of the GFP is the most plausible, whereas the notion that it is a psychologically meaningless methodological artifact would be rather difficult to uphold.

AB  - In cognitive science, we are currently witnessing a 'pragmatic turn', away from the traditional representation-centered framework towards a paradigm that focuses on understanding cognition as 'enactive', as skillful activity that involves ongoing interaction with the external world. The key premise of this view is that cognition should not be understood as providing models of the world, but as subserving action and being grounded in sensorimotor coupling. Accordingly, cognitive processes and their underlying neural activity patterns should be studied primarily with respect to their role in action generation. We suggest that such an action-oriented paradigm is not only conceptually viable, but already supported by much experimental evidence. Numerous findings either overtly demonstrate the action-relatedness of cognition or can be re-interpreted in this new framework. We argue that new vistas on the functional relevance and the presumed 'representational' nature of neural processes are likely to emerge from this paradigm.

AB  - The selective localization of protein synthetic machinery at postsynaptic sites makes it possible for the synthesis of particular proteins to be regulated by synaptic signals. Here we consider how the structure of the machinery constrains synthetic capacity and the evidence that mRNA translation is locally controlled by synaptic signals.
   Since the discovery of protein synthetic machinery at synaptic sites on dendrites (Steward and Levy, 1982), substantial progress has been made in identifying dendritic mRNAs and in showing that dendritic protein synthesis is critical for persistent synaptic modifications like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Although many pieces of the puzzle have been identified, major questions remain. Here we focus on one of the unknowns: how translational activity at synapses is regulated and whether regulation involves upregulation or downregulation of overall translation or differential regulation of the translation of particular transcripts. It is useful to begin by considering constraints imposed by the nature of the protein synthetic machinery at synapses.

AB  - Predator odors are non-intrusive and naturalistic stressors of high ethological relevance in animals. Upon exposure to a predator or its associated cues, robust physiological and molecular anti-predator defensive strategies are elicited thereby allowing prey species to recognize, avoid and defend against a possible predation threat. In this review, we will discuss the nature of neuroendocrine stress responses upon exposure to predator odors. Predator odors can have a profound effect on the endocrine system, including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and induction of stress hormones such as corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone. On a neural level, short-term exposure to predator odors leads to induction of the c-fos gene, while induction of Delta FosB in a different brain region is detected under chronic predation stress. Future research should aim to elucidate the relationships between neuroendocrine and behavioral outputs to gage the different levels of anti-predator responses in prey species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nanoparticles are the materials with at least two dimensions between 1 and 100 nm. Mostly these nanoparticles are natural products but their tremendous commercial use has boosted the artificial synthesis of these particles (engineered nanoparticles). Accelerated production and use of these engineered nanopartides may cause their release in the environment and facilitate the frequent interactions with biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystems. Despite remarkable commercial benefits, their presence in the nature may cause hazardous biological effects. Therefore, detail understanding of their sources, release interaction with environment, and possible risk assessment would provide a basis for safer use of engineered nanoparticles with minimal or no hazardous impact on environment. Keeping all these points in mind the present review provides updated information on various aspects, e.g. sources, different types, synthesis, interaction with environment, possible strategies for risk management of engineered nanoparticles.

AB  - It is becoming increasingly appreciated that affective influences can contribute strongly to goal-oriented cognition and behavior. However, much work is still needed to properly characterize these influences and the mechanisms by which they contribute to cognitive processing. An important question concerns the nature of emotional manipulations (i.e., direct induction of affectively valenced subjective experience) versus motivational manipulations (e.g., delivery of performance-contingent rewards and punishments) and their impact on cognitive control. Empirical evidence suggests that both kinds of manipulations can influence cognitive control in a systematic fashion, but investigations of both have largely been conducted independently of one another. Likewise, some theoretical accounts suggest that emotion and motivation may modulate cognitive control via common neural mechanisms, while others suggest the possibility of dissociable influences. Here, we provide an analysis and synthesis of these various accounts, suggesting potentially fruitful new research directions to test competing hypotheses.

AB  - This article addresses the debate between emotion-expression and motive-communication approaches to facial movements, focusing on Ekman's (1972) and Fridlund's (1994) contrasting models and their historical antecedents. Available evidence suggests that the presence of others either reduces or increases facial responses, depending on the quality and strength of the emotional manipulation and on the nature of the relationship between interactants. Although both display rules and social motives provide viable explanations of audience "inhibition" effects, some audience facilitation effects are less easily accommodated within an emotion-expression perspective. In particular, emotion is not a sufficient condition for a corresponding "expression," even discounting explicit regulation,and,apparently, "spontaneous" facial movements may be facilitated by the presence of others. Further, there is no direct evidence that any particular facial movement provides an unambiguous expression of a specific emotion. However, information communicated by facial movements is not necessarily extrinsic to emotion. Facial movements not only transmit emotion-relevant information but also contribute to ongoing processes of emotional action in accordance with pragmatic theories.

AB  - In recent years, womens' roles have changed dramatically, prompting researchers to examine the impact of these changes on the development of women and children. In this article, we examine three major changes that women have experienced over the past several decades: increased participation in the paid labor force, changes in domestic labor and child-care patterns, and increased numbers of female-headed single-parent families. For each, we first describe the nature of the changes that have occurred over the last 50 years. We then review research concerning the effects of these changes on the development of women and children. Finally, we discuss the implications for social policy that stem from this research. It is broadly concluded that research informed by a developmental-contextual perspective may contribute importantly to the development of social policies focused on promoting the well-being of women and children.

AB  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a general diagnosis for those exhibiting long-lasting neurobehavioral and cognitive deficiencies as a result of fetal alcohol exposure. It is among the most common causes of mental deficits today. Those impacted are left to rely on advances in our understanding of the nature of early alcohol-induced disorders toward human therapies. Research findings over the last decade have developed a model where ethanol-induced neurodegeneration impacts early neural circuit development, thereby perpetuating subsequent integration and plasticity in vulnerable brain regions. Here we review our current knowledge of FASD neuropathology based on discoveries of long-lasting neurophysiological effects of acute developmental ethanol exposure in animal models. We discuss the important balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition in normal neural network function, and relate the significance of that balance to human FASD as well as related disease states. Finally, we postulate that excitation/inhibition imbalance caused by early ethanol-induced neurodegeneration results in perturbed local and regional network signaling and therefore neurobehavioral pathology.

AB  - Early breast cancer affects one in every nine women along with their families. Advances in screening and biomedical interventions have changed the face of breast cancer from a terminal condition to a chronic disease with biopsychosocial features. The present review surveyed the nature and extent of psychological morbidity experienced by the breast cancer survivor and her spouse during the post-treatment phase, with particular focus on the impact of disease on the marital relationship. Interpersonal processes shown to unfold in couples facing breast cancer, as well as risk factors associated with greater psychological morbidity, were reviewed. Moreover, interpersonal processes central to coping with chronic illness and adjustment were reconceptualized from the point of view of attachment theory. Attachment theory was also used as the grounding framework for an empirically supported couples-based intervention, Emotionally Focused Therapy, which is advanced as a potentially useful treatment option for couples experiencing unremitting psychological and relational distress following diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer.

AB  - M. J. Lerner (1980) proposed that people need to believe in a just world; thus, evidence that the world is not just is threatening, and people have a number of strategies for reducing such threats. Early research on this idea, and on just-world theory more broadly, was reviewed in early publications (e.g., M. J. Lerner, 1980; M. J. Lerner & D. T. Miller, 1978). In the present article, focus is directed on the post-1980 experimental research on this theory. First, 2 conceptualizations of the term belief in a just world are described, the typical experimental paradigms are explained, and a general overview of the post-1980 experiments is provided. Second, problems with this literature are discussed, including the unsystematic nature of the research. Third, important developments that have occurred, despite the problems reviewed, are described. Finally, theoretical challenges that researchers should address if this area of inquiry is to advance in the future are discussed.

AB  - Genetic syndrome groups at high risk of autism comorbidity, like Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome, have been presented as useful models for understanding risk and protective factors involved in the emergence of autistic traits. Yet despite reaching clinical thresholds, these 'syndromic' forms of autism appear to differ in significant ways from the idiopathic or 'non-syndromic' autism profile. We explore alternative mechanistic explanations for these differences and propose a developmental interpretation of syndromic autism that takes into account the character of the genetic disorder. This interpretation anticipates syndrome-specific autism phenotypes, since the neurocognitive and behavioural expression of the autism is coloured by syndromically defined atypicalities. To uncover the true nature of comorbidities and of autism per se, we argue that it is key to extend definitions of autism to include the perceptual and neurocognitive characteristics of the disorder and then apply this multilevel conceptualisation to the study of syndromic autism profiles.

AB  - The current rapid rate of human-driven environmental change presents wild populations with novel conditions and stresses. Theory and experimental evidence for evolutionary rescue present a promising case for species facing environmental change persisting via adaptation. Here, we assess the potential for evolutionary rescue in wild vertebrates. Available information on evolutionary rescue was rare and restricted to abundant and highly fecund species that faced severe intentional anthropogenic selective pressures. However, examples from adaptive tracking in common species and genetic rescues in species of conservation concern provide convincing evidence in favour of the mechanisms of evolutionary rescue. We conclude that low population size, long generation times and limited genetic variability will result in evolutionary rescue occurring rarely for endangered species without intervention. Owing to the risks presented by current environmental change and the possibility of evolutionary rescue in nature, we suggest means to study evolutionary rescue by mapping genotype -> phenotype -> demography -> fitness relationships, and priorities for applying evolutionary rescue to wild populations.

AB  - A burgeoning world population means a greater demand for food and agricultural products. Unfortunately, the concurrent progress in applied science and technology can also result in dangers for agricultural land. One such danger is the increase in types and amounts of heavy metals in the soil, which affect the plant growth. Accumulation of heavy metals like Cd, Ni, Cu, Fe etc. results in ecosystem disturbance, agricultural land spoiling, and biodiversity problems. Heavy metal stress results in the synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxalate (ACC), an ethylene precursor, which raises ethylene levels in plants, which inhibits plant growth. This is severe problem for plants, but nature here provides a solution. Agricultural lands have a large number of microorganisms specially bacteria. Bacteria such as Rhizobacteria produce an enzyme ACC deaminase (ACCD) that converts ACC into ammonia and alpha-ketobutyrate thus reducing the amount of ACC and lowering the ethylene levels.

AB  - Objective: Evidence related to overlapping clinical and genetic risk factors in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) have raised concerns about the validity of 'Kraepelinian dichotomy'. As controversies mainly arise in mixed psychoses that occupy the intermediate zone between schizophrenia and BD, investigating neurobiological markers of mixed psychoses may be relevant to understanding the nature of psychotic disorders.
   Method: In this article, we review studies comparing magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and electrophysiological findings in mixed psychoses with each other, as well as with more prototypical cases of schizophrenia and BD.
   Results: The evidence reviewed suggests that mixed psychoses may be associated with different genetic and neurobiological markers compared with prototypical forms of schizophrenia and BD.
   Conclusion: These findings may be compatible with more sophisticated versions of dimensional and continuum models or, alternatively, they may suggest that there is an intermediate third category between prototypical schizophrenia and BD.

AB  - Neuronal cytotoxic edema is the morphological correlate of the near-complete neuronal battery breakdown called spreading depolarization, or conversely, spreading depolarization is the electrophysiological correlate of the initial, still reversible phase of neuronal cytotoxic edema. Cytotoxic edema and spreading depolarization are thus different modalities of the same process, which represents a metastable universal reference state in the gray matter of the brain close to Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium. Different but merging sections of the spreading-depolarization continuum from short duration waves to intermediate duration waves to terminal waves occur in a plethora of clinical conditions, including migraine aura, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, development of brain death, and the dying process during cardio circulatory arrest. Thus, spreading depolarization represents a prime and simultaneously the most neglected pathophysiological process in acute neurology. Aristides Leao postulated as early as the 1940s that the pathophysiological process in neurons underlying migraine aura is of the same nature as the pathophysiological process in neurons that occurs in response to cerebral circulatory arrest, because he assumed that spreading depolarization occurs in both conditions. With this in mind, it is not surprising that patients with migraine with aura have about a twofold increased risk of stroke, as some spreading depolarizations leading to the patient percept of migraine aura could be caused by cerebral ischemia. However, it is in the nature of spreading depolarization that it can have different etiologies and not all spreading depolarizations arise because of ischemia. Spreading depolarization is observed as a negative direct current (DC) shift and associated with different changes in spontaneous brain activity in the alternating current (AC) band of the electrocorticogram. These are non-spreading depression and spreading activity depression and epileptiform activity. The same spreading depolarization wave may be associated with different activity changes in adjacent brain regions. Here, we review the basal mechanism underlying spreading depolarization and the associated activity changes. Using original recordings in animals and patients, we illustrate that the associated changes in spontaneous activity are by no means trivial, but pose unsolved mechanistic puzzles and require proper scientific analysis.

AB  - Many neuro-imaging studies have provided evidence that the parietal cortex plays a key role in reasoning based on mental models, which are supposed to be of abstract spatial nature. However, these studies have also shown concurrent activation in vision-related cortical areas which have often been interpreted as evidence for the role of visual mental imagery in reasoning. The aim of the paper is to resolve the inconsistencies in the previous literature on reasoning and imagery and to develop a neurally and cognitively plausible theory of human relational reasoning. The main assumption is that visual brain areas are only involved if the problem information is easy to visualize and when this information must be processed and maintained in visual working memory. A regular reasoning process, however, does not involve visual images but more abstract spatial representations-spatial mental models-held in parietal cortices. Only these spatial representations are crucial for the genuine reasoning processes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that takes about a decade to develop, making early diagnosis possible. Clinically, the diagnosis of AD is complicated, costly, and inaccurate, so it is urgent to find specific biomarkers. Due to its multifactorial nature, a panel of biomarkers for the multiple pathologies of AD, such as cerebral amyloidogenesis, neuronal dysfunction, synapse loss, oxidative stress, and inflammation, are most promising for accurate diagnosis. Highly sensitive and high-throughput proteomic techniques can be applied to develop a panel of novel biomarkers for AD. In this review, we discuss the metabolism and diagnostic performance of the well-established core candidate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (beta-amyloid, total tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau). Meanwhile, novel promising CSF biomarkers, especially those identified by proteomics, updated in the last five years are also extensively discussed. Furthermore, we provide perspectives on how biomarker discovery for AD is evolving.

KW  - Social buffering
AB  - Survival of altricial infants, including humans and rats, depends on attachment to the caregiver a process that requires infants to recognize, learn, and remember their attachment figure. The demands of a dynamic environment combined with a maturing organism require frequent neurobehavioral reorganization. This restructuring of behavior and its supporting neural circuitry can be viewed through the unique lens of attachment learning in rats in which preference learning is enhanced and aversion learning is attenuated. Behavioral restructuring is well adapted to securing the crucial infant-caregiver relationship regardless of the quality of care. With maturation and the end of the infant-caregiver attachment learning period, the complex interplay of neural structures, hormones, and social behavior coordinates the developing rat's eventual transition to life outside of the nest. Nevertheless, early-life environmental and physiological stressors can alter the resilient nature of this system, particularly with respect to the amygdala, and these changes may provide important clues to understanding the lasting effects of early stress.

AB  - Goals are mental representations that vary in accessibility and operate within goal systems. The implicit nature of goal activation and pursuit is shown here to make goals effective not merely at overturning the influence of an activated stereotype on how people respond to members of stereotyped groups, but effective at implicitly controlling the activation of stereotypes in the first place. In a set of experiments examining chronic egalitarian goals, faces and names of members of stereotyped groups presented as target stimuli led to the inhibition of stereotypes, as well as to the heightened accessibility of egalitarian goals. A separate set of experiments illustrate a similar ability of individuals to control stereotype activation when egalitarian goals are temporarily triggered within a context, rather than being chronically held. Goals that require one to inhibit stereotypic associations to a target can lead to the intended, yet implicit, control of stereotype activation, even when one is not aware the goal is active or being pursued or being regulated.

AB  - Apoptosis triggered by exogenous and endogenous stimuli such as ultraviolet radiation, oxidative stress, and genotoxic chemicals is a crucial phenomenon within biological systems. DNA damage activates and stabilizes p53 in nucleus and cytoplasm and regulates other proteins that stimulate intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Apoptosis is morphologically distinct from that of necrosis and both the phenomena depend on the types, developmental stages, physiological environment of tissues and the nature of death signal. Malfunctioning of apoptotic pathway may cause human diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. Recently, potent apoptosis-inducing compounds associated with human health have been recorded that prevent tumor promotion, progression, and the occurrence of cellular inflammatory responses. Certain photosensitizing drugs are being employed in photodynamic therapy to induce apoptosis for the treatment of cancer and non-cancerous cells. This review emphasizes the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis, associated diseases and certain therapeutic agents implicated in the elimination of malignant cells.

TI  - John Gardner's Transatlantic Shadow
KW  - POWERS
AB  - In Rethinking Criminal Law Theory, Francois Tanguay-Renaud and James Stribopoulos present a collection of papers by Canadian thinkers on a number of issues pertaining to criminal law. In this review essay, the author examines three contributions to the collection-by Malcolm Thorburn, Francois Tanguay-Renaud and Annalise Acorn-all of which engage with the work of John Gardner. Thorburn's paper continues his debate with Gardner over the nature of police powers, self-defence and justificatory defences in general. Tanguay-Renaud addresses the use of defences in "private emergencies". Though Tanguay-Renaud accepts much of Gardner's approach to criminal defences, the former's treatment of "epistemic justifications" breaks down the latter's division between justification and excuse-a distinction Gardner thought was important in his debate with Thorburn. Finally, Acorn weighs in on a debate between Gardner and Ronnie Mackay on whether stigma should be attached to claims of diminished responsibility and mental disorder. Throughout this review, the author's primary aim is to expose some of the fault lines in the debates, rather than to take sides.

AB  - Concepts are the elementary units of reason and linguistic meaning. They are conventional and relatively stable. As such, they must somehow be the result of neural activity in the brain. The questions are: Where? and How? A common philosophical position is that all concepts-even concepts about action and perception-are symbolic and abstract, and therefore must be implemented outside the brain's sensory-motor system. We will argue against this position using (1) neuroscientific evidence; (2) results from neural computation; and (3) results about the nature of concepts from cognitive linguistics. We will propose that the sensory-motor system has the right kind of structure to characterise both sensory-motor and more abstract concepts. Central to this picture are the neural theory of language and the theory of cogs, according to which, brain structures in the sensory-motor regions are exploited to characterise the so-called "abstract" concepts that constitute the meanings of grammatical constructions and general inference patterns.

AB  - Insects play many important roles in nature due to their diversity, ecological role, and impact on agriculture or human health. They are directly influenced by environmental changes and in particular anthropic activities that constitute an important driver of change in the environmental characteristics. Insects face numerous anthropogenic stressors and have evolved various detoxication mechanisms to survive and/or resist to these compounds. Recent studies highligted the pressure exerted by xenobiotics on insect life-cycle and the important role of insect-associated bacterial microbiota in the insect responses to environmental changes. Stressor exposure can have various impacts on the composition and structure of insect microbiota that in turn may influence insect biology. Moreover, bacterial communities associated with insects can be directly or indirectly involved in detoxification processes with the selection of certain microorganisms capable of degrading xenobiotics. Further studies are needed to assess the role of insect-associated microbiota as key contributor to the xenobiotic metabolism and thus as a driver for insect adaptation to polluted habitats.

AB  - Maturation of long-running birth cohort studies has fostered a life course approach to adult health, function, and disease and related to conceptual frameworks. Using broad concepts of human development including physical, cognitive, and emotional function, birth cohorts provide insights into the processes across the life course and between generations that link to adult outcomes. We discuss findings on the determinants and health consequences of lifetime trajectories of body size, cognitive and emotional function, and socioeconomic position. Findings from the studies suggest that, for some adult health outcomes, explanations will be incomplete unless exposures and processes from across the life course are taken into account. New birth cohort studies are poised to delineate further the nature and timing of life course relationships in contemporary generations of children.

AB  - Scientists have long studied the actions that impact basic survival in various domains of life, such as defense, foraging, reproduction, thermoregulation, and so on, as to reveal the nature of emotion. Each domain is characterized by a repertoire of distinct actions, and each action is presumed to be caused by a dedicated neural circuit, called a survival circuit. Survival circuits are said to be triggered by sensory events in the world, producing a range of actions from obligatory, stereotypic reflexes to more flexible, deliberate responses. In this paper, we consider recent evidence from behavioral ecology that even so-called 'reflexes' are better understood as purposeful, flexible actions that unfold across a range of temporal trajectories. They are highly context-dependent and tailored to the requirements of the situation. We then consider the neuroscience of motor control which suggests that motor actions are assembled by neural populations, not triggered by simple circuits. Finally, we consider the value of these suggestions for understanding both species-general and species-specific contributions to emotion.

AB  - Research on similarity constructs (e.g., dyadic similarity, personality stability, judgment agreement and accuracy) frequently find them to be associated with positive outcomes. However, a methodological pitfall associated with common overall similarity indices, which we term the normative-desirability confound (NDC), will regularly result in similarity constructs apparently having more positive effects than they do in reality. In essence, when an individual is estimated to be similar to another person by common indices, this will strongly indicate that the individual has desirable characteristics. Consequently, the correlates of overall similarity indices can often be interpreted as indicating the beneficial effects of having desirable characteristics, without needing to attribute any additional salutary effect to similarity. We show that this confound is present in overall similarity estimates for a wide range of constructs (e.g., personality traits, attitudes, emotions, behaviors, values), how it can be accounted for, and discuss larger implications for our understanding of similarity constructs.

Far less is known about the nature and course of psychobiological risk factors for PTSD during the acute aftermath of trauma. In this review, we summarize data from prospective studies focusing on the relationships among sympathetic nervous system activity, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function, coping strategies and PTSD symptoms during the early recovery (or non-recovery) phase. Findings from pertinent studies are integrated to inform psychobiological profiles of PTSD-risk in children and adults in the context of existing models of PTSD-onset and maintenance. Data regarding bidirectional relations between coping strategies and stress hormones is reviewed. Limitations of existing literature and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis silvestris catus) have been domesticated through different processes. Dogs were the first domesticated animals, cooperating with humans by hunting and guarding. In contrast, cats were domesticated as predators of rodents and lived near human habitations when humans began to settle and farm. Although the domestication of dogs followed a different path from that of cats, and they have ancestors of a different nature, both have been broadly integrated into-and profoundly impacted-human society. The coexistence between dogs/cats and humans is based on non-verbal communication. This review focuses on "gaze," which is an important signal for humans and describes the communicative function of dogs' and cats' eye-gaze behavior with humans. We discuss how the function of the gaze goes beyond communication to mutual emotional connection, namely "bond" formation. Finally, we present a research approach to multimodal interactions between dogs/cats and humans that participate in communication and bond formation.

Recent Findings Globally, there is considerable variability in measures of association between mental health disorders and suicide and a growing debate over methodological approaches to this research. A high suicide incidence makes the US an outlier, and the decentralized nature of US administrative data poses a unique challenge to data linkage that could otherwise advance this research.

This review paper provides a brief historical overview of the study of pupillometry in cognitive science. The physiology of pupillary responses is introduced, leading to an outline of early pupillometry work, which began with the seminal work of Hess and Polt in the 1960s. The paper then presents a broad review of contemporary research in cognitive sciences that relies on pupillometry. This review is organized around five general domains, namely perception, language processing, memory and decision making, emotion and cognition, and cognitive development. In order to illustrate the nature of the method, and the challenges of analysis, the next section of the review details the process of compiling, processing, and analyzing data from a simple, typical pupillometry study.

KW  - 20TH-CENTURY
AB  - Unlike other medical disciplines, psychiatry abounds in conceptual models. All of them are legitimate as there is no conclusive evidence that either is more proper than others in terms of its capacity to explicate the very nature of mental disorders and make possible more efficacious treatment of those with mental illness. There are two major sources of the existence of numerous models in psychiatry: difficulties in discerning the role played by the biological and the psychological in the genesis and treatment of individual mental disorders, and want of a widely accepted theory of the mind-body relationship. The conceptual divide in psychiatry has numerous negative effects: scarce communication or no communication between the advocates of different approaches; overrating of the benefits of the concept one clings to; lack of interest in other approaches; confusion of clients when confronted with different explanation of the origin of their troubles and most appropriate treatment; tarnished image of psychiatry. There have been several attempts to correct conceptual cacophony in psychiatry. None of them proved successful.

AB  - The ongoing steady nature of consciousness in everyday life implies that the underlying neural activity possesses a high level of stability. The prolonged cognitive events of sustained attention, imagery, and working memory also imply high stability of underlying neural activity. This paper proposes that stabilization of neural activity is produced by apical dendrite activity in pyramidal neurons within recurrent corticothalamic circuits, and proposes that the wave activities of apical dendrites that stabilize ongoing activity constitute the subjective impressions of an attended object and the entire sensory background. The cortical minicolumm, as the functional unit of the cortex, is separated into an axis consisting of layer 5 pyramidal neurons and a surrounding shell consisting of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. It is proposed that apical dendrites of the axis generate sensory impressions, and basal dendrites of the shell process the brief-lasting input-output identifications of objects that give rise to ideas.

AB  - The literature suggests that the moral sense is based on innate abilities. In fact, it has been shown that children show the capacity for moral discernment, emotions and prosocial motivations from an early age. However, the moral sense is a complex construct of an evolutionary and social nature that evolves under the influence of interpersonal relationships. The emergence and development of moral sense is a challenge that has prompted many research studies with the aim of achieving a clear comprehension of moral development. However, success has been scarce, and studies relevant to this subject are limited. Thus, a systematic review of studies relevant to this topic was conducted to clearly establish how moral sense emerges and develops. An Ovid search was conducted to retrieve relevant items for this systematic review. The databases that were electronically visited are Cross-reference, Google Scholar and PubMed. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were imposed on the retrieved items to retain only relevant resources. Twenty-six studies were found valid for inclusion in this systematic review. The results of these studies were presented differently: In order to effectively analyze the selected papers and bring out the results more clearly, a categorization of the approaches adopted in the studies was carried out. The approaches identified were: "Natural Moral Sense, " "Social Relationships and Moral Development, " and "Environmental Factors and Moral Development. " The evidence that emerged from the analysis of the papers was collected to produce a general basic model that explains moral development while also serving as a link between the various studies. First, moral sense is found to be innate in humans; individuals can naturally respond morally to various dilemmas. As seen among children and young infants, moral sense naturally exists. Second, it can be socially nurtured through social interactions and exposure to various environmental factors. Various research studies were reviewed in this systematic review to obtain a consensus on how moral sense emerges and develops. From the systematic review, the moral sense is found to be innate. However, moral development is fostered by social interactions and environmental factors.

AB  - Due to the continuous rise of global temperatures and heatwaves worldwide as a result of climate change, concerns for the health and safety of working populations have increased. Workers in the food production chain, particularly farmworkers, are especially vulnerable to heat stress due to the strenuous nature of their work, which is performed primarily outdoors under poor working conditions. At the cross-section of climate change and farmworkers' health, a scoping review was undertaken to summarize the existing knowledge regarding the health impacts associated with climate change and heat stress, guide future research toward better understanding current and future climate change risks, and inform policies to protect the health and safety of agricultural workers. A systematic search of 5 electronic databases and gray literature websites was conducted to identify relevant literature published up until December 2021. A total of 9045 records were retrieved from the searches, of which 92 articles were included in the final review. The majority of the reviewed articles focused on heat-related illnesses (n = 57) and kidney diseases (n = 28). The risk factors identified in the reviewed studies included gender, dehydration, heat strain, wearing inappropriate clothing, workload, piece-rate payment, job decision latitude, and hot environmental conditions. On the other hand, various protective and preventive factors were identified including drinking water, changing work hours and schedule of activities, wearing appropriate clothing, reducing soda consumption, taking breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas, and increasing electrolyte consumption in addition to improving access to medical care. This review also identified various factors that are unique to vulnerable agricultural populations, including migrant and child farmworkers. Our findings call for an urgent need to expand future research on vulnerable agricultural communities including migrant workers so as to develop effective policies and interventions that can protect these communities from the effects of heat stress.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is a crucial health risk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The smaller size fractions, <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5; fine particles) and <= 0.1 mu m (PM0.1: ultrafine particles), show the highest bioactivity but acquiring sufficient mass for in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies is challenging. We review the suitability of available instrumentation to collect the PM mass required for these assessments. Five different microenvironments representing the diverse exposure conditions in urban environments are considered in order to establish the typical PM concentrations present. The highest concentrations of PM2.5 and PM0.1 were found near traffic (i.e. roadsides and traffic intersections), followed by indoor environments, parks and behind roadside vegetation. We identify key factors to consider when selecting sampling instrumentation. These include PM concentration on-site (low concentrations increase sampling time), nature of sampling sites (e.g. indoors; noise and space will be an issue), equipment handling and power supply. Physicochemical characterisation requires micro- to milli-gram quantities of PM and it may increase according to the processing methods (e.g. digestion or sonication). Toxicological assessments of PM involve numerous mechanisms (e.g. inflammatory processes and oxidative stress) requiring significant amounts of PM to obtain accurate results. Optimising air sampling techniques are therefore important for the appropriate collection medium/filter which have innate physical properties and the potential to interact with samples. An evaluation of methods and instrumentation used for airborne virus collection condudes that samplers operating cyclone sampling techniques (using centrifugal forces) are effective in collecting airborne viruses. We highlight that predictive modelling can help to identify pollution hotspots in an urban environment for the efficient collection of PM mass. This review provides guidance to prepare and plan efficient sampling campaigns to collect sufficient PM mass for various purposes in a reasonable timeframe. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Event-related potential studies of post-traumatic stress disorder: a critical review and synthesis
AB  - Despite the sparseness of the currently available data, there is accumulating evidence of information processing impairment in post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD). Studies of event-related potentials (ERPs) are the main tool in real time examination of information processing. In this paper, we sought to critically review the ERP evidence of information processing abnormalities in patients with PTSD. We also examined the evidence supporting the existence of a relationship between ERP abnormalities and symptom profiles or severity in PTSD patients. An extensive Medline search was performed. Keywords included PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder, electrophysiology or EEG, electrophysiology, P50, P100, N100, P2, P200, P3, P300, sensory gating, CNV (contingent negative variation) and MMN (mismatch negativity). We limited the review to ERP adult human studies with control groups which were reported in the English language. After applying our inclusion-exclusion review criteria, 36 studies were included. Subjects exposed to wide ranges of military and civilian traumas were studied in these reports. Presented stimuli were both auditory and visual. The most widely studied components included P300, P50 gating, N100 and P200. Most of the studies reported increased P300 response to trauma-related stimuli in PTSD patients. A smaller group of studies reported dampening of responses or no change in responses to trauma-related and/or unrelated stimuli. P50 studies were strongly suggestive of impaired gating in patients with PTSD. In conclusion, the majority of reports support evidence of information processing abnormalities in patients with PTSD diagnosis. The predominance of evidence suggests presence of mid-latency and late ERP components differences in PTSD patients in comparison to healthy controls. Heterogeneity of assessment methods used contributes to difficulties in reaching firm conclusions regarding the nature of these differences. We suggest that future ERP-PTSD studies utilize standardized assessment scales that provide detailed information regarding the symptom clusters and the degree of symptom severity. This would allow assessment of electrophysiological indices-clinical symptoms relationships. Based on the available data, we suggest that ERP abnormalities in PTSD are possibly affected by the level of illness severity. If supported by future research, ERP studies may be used for both initial assessment and treatment follow-up.

AB  - Background Assessment of mental health in schools has garnered increased interest in recent years. Children spend a large proportion of their waking hours in schools. Teachers can act as gatekeepers by playing a key role in identifying children with mental health difficulties in the classroom and making the necessary onward referrals to external services. The prevalence of mental health difficulties, their impact on schooling (and beyond) and the importance of early intervention means that it is incumbent on schools to identify and support potentially affected children. Aims Previous reviews focused on mental health interventions in schools; however, this review focuses on the assessment of mental health in schools and on teachers' perceptions of this, as such a review is still lacking. Therefore, the study fills a gap in the existing literature while also providing new, highly relevant evidence that may inform policy making in this area. Composition of studies included in this review This review included 19 studies. Five studied teachers exclusively at primary/elementary level, and seven focused on secondary level, while six included both primary and secondary teachers. Three studies employed mixed methods, ten were primarily qualitative studies, and five were primarily quantitative. Methods Bronfenbrenner's (The ecology of human development: Experiments by nature and design, Harvard University Press, 1979) framework, adapted by Harvest (How can EPs best support secondary school staff to work effectively with children and young people who experience social, emotional and mental health difficulties? 2018), which includes the mature version of the theory (Tudge et al., 2009, J. Fam. Theory Rev., 1, 198), was used to analyse the literature. Results Results found that lack of training in assessment of mental health and 'role conflict' were key barriers; some teachers attributed this to their lack of knowledge, skills and confidence in the area. Conclusion Implications for practice and research are discussed in relation to the importance of sustained training both pre-service and in-service.

AB  - Child-to-parent violence is a form of family violence that is still a well-kept secret. Abused parents can be victims of different types of abuse. Children can use both physical and psychological violence such as financial threats to take control of the home. In this situation, parents often no longer dare to contradict their children by fear of triggering uncontrollable violence. Although the phenomenon recently drew the attention of the media, there is still little knowledge about its prevalence and clinical characteristics. Most families remain isolated for a long time and, even in case of consulting in a mental health setting, disclosure of the nature of the difficulties is often delayed. This article presents the specificities of these children and their clinical characteristics. It also studies the victimized parents, the entire family, and their relation to the external environment. When observing these young offenders oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are frequently found. The diagnosis of "conduct disorder confined to family context" defined in the ICD 10 is the most appropriate to describe them. But it is regrettable that there has currently been no study to validate it and to determine its specificity. Compared with other young children who have "classic" disruptive disorders, children involved in violence against their parents have more difficulties with affect regulation, impulse control, and interpersonal skills. These children also frequently have low self-esteem and difficulties interacting with their peers. They may be isolated and bullied. They feel more sadness than these other young people and use violence as a way to express their emotions. Within the family both girls and boys commit violence against their parents. Girls will mostly use psychological violence but can also be involved in physical aggression. The first victim of child-to-parent violence is the mother. As mothers are often more present at home and seen by their children as weaker than the father, they are seen as an "easy target". If the "classic" conduct disorder is most frequently encountered in low social status families, intra familial disruptive behavior can be observed in families from all socio economic status. With respect to the parent-child relationship in those families, there are some relevant specificities. First, the quality of communication is bad, parents and children are not intimate and the tension is permanent. Furthermore, children do not respect their parents' authority. They perceive parenting style as permissive and negligent without enough support and control, and they may want to restore a coherent authority in the family. It is important to mention that potential vulnerability factors such as older age, a history of mental illness and social isolation have been described in parents of these children. Thereby, victimized parents have all the more difficulty to stand up against their children or to cleverly adapt their authority to their behavior. Other types of inappropriate education can be the origin of the child-to-parent violence. There is a direct correlation between the high frequency of punishments and violent attitude of the children towards their parents. So, the family dynamic is characterized by an inversion of the family hierarchy, the parents' fear of violent behavior from their child, and shame expressed by the parents with regards to the nature of familial relationships.
   Their fear and their shame will contribute to ensuring that their child's behavior is kept secret. Finally, several factors can therefore be at the source of the development of child-to-parent violence; this study aims to raise awareness of clinicians of this impairing and frequently hidden condition. Due to the absence of specific studies, management of intra-familial disruptive disorder is likely to be less than optimal and heterogeneous. The development of a group of targeted parental psychoeducation is a promising management technique. We will describe the basic principles of active parental control, a programme using techniques of non-violent resistance to help parents cope with violence and control children's behavior. The results of this programme are still being evaluated, but preliminary results seem promising since the parents included in the pilot group have described a significant improvement in the feeling of parental competence and, notably, self-control.

AB  - Background: Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted infection that can have serious consequences. It is universally agreed that screening for chlamydia infection should be offered to sexually active young women. We undertook a literature review to document the views, attitudes and opinions of women about being screened, tested and diagnosed with Chlamydia trachomatis.
   Methods: Online databases ( MEDLINE, Meditext, PsycINFO, Web of Science) and reference lists searched up to August 2005. Search terms: chlamydia, attitude, attitude to health, interview, qualitative, women. Eligibility criteria: about chlamydia, included women, involved interviews/surveys/focus groups, looked at women's views/opinions/attitudes, published in English. Thematic analysis identified the main and recurrent themes emerging from the literature. We compared our thematic analysis with the Theory of Planned Behaviour to provide a model that could assist in planning chlamydia screening programs.
   Results: From 561 identified articles, 25 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were reviewed. 22: USA, UK; 3: Holland, Sweden, Australia. Major themes identified: need for knowledge and information, choice and support; concerns about confidentiality, cost, fear, anxiety and stigma. Women are more likely to find chlamydia screening/testing acceptable if they think chlamydia is a serious, common condition which can cause infertility and if they understand that chlamydia infection can be asymptomatic. Women want a range of options for chlamydia testing including urine tests, self-administered swabs, pelvic exams and clinician-collected swabs, home-testing and community-based testing. Tests should be free, easy and quick. Women want support for dealing with the implications of a chlamydia diagnosis, they feel chlamydia diagnoses need to be normalised and destigmatised and they want assistance with partner notification. Women need to know that their confidentiality will be maintained.
   Conclusion: Our review found that women from various countries and ethnic backgrounds share similar views regarding chlamydia screening, testing and diagnosis. The acknowledged importance of women's views in planning an effective chlamydia screening program is expanded in this review which details the nature and complexity of such views and considers their likely impact.

AB  - Hysterical conversion disorders represent "functional" or unexplained neurological deficits such as paralysis or somatosensory losses that are not explained by organic lesions in the nervous system, but arise in the context of "psychogenic" stress or emotional conflicts. After more than a century of both clinical and theoretical interest, the exact nature of such emotional disorders responsible for hysterical symptoms, and their functional consequences on neural systems in the brain, still remain largely unknown. However, several recent studies have used functional brain imaging techniques (such as EEG, fMRI, PET, or SPECT) in the attempt to identify specific neural correlates associated with hysterical conversion symptoms. This article presents a general overview of these findings and of previous neuropsychologically based accounts of hysteria. Functional neuroimaging has revealed selective decreases in the activity of frontal and subcortical circuits involved in motor control during hysterical paralysis, decreases in somatosensory cortices during hysterical anesthesia, or decreases in visual cortex during hysterical blindness. Such changes are usually not accompanied by any significant changes in elementary stages of sensory or motor processing as measured by evoked potentials, although some changes in later stages of integration (such as P300 responses) have been reported. On the other hand, several neuroimaging results have shown increased activation in limbic regions, such as cingulate or orbitofrontal cortex during conversion symptoms affecting different sensory or motor modalities. Taken together, these data generally do not support previous proposals that hysteria might involve an exclusion of sensorimotor representations from awareness through attentional processes. They rather seem to point to a modulation of such representations by primary affective or stress-related factors, perhaps involving primitive reflexive mechanisms of protection and alertness that are partly independent of conscious control, and mediated by dynamic modulatory interactions between limbic and sensorimotor networks. A better understanding of the neuropsychobiological bases of hysterical conversion disorder might therefore be obtained by future imaging studies that compare different conversion symptoms and employ functional connectivity analyses. This should not only lead to improve clinical management of these patients, but also provide new insights on the brain mechanisms of self-awareness.

AB  - The first psychotic episode is classically viewed as a critical period which management is important in determining the long-term outcome of the schizophrenia (SCZ). For this reason, the duration of untreated illness (DUI), defined as the interval between the onset of the psychiatric disorder and the administration of the first pharmacological treatment, is a clinical variable that has been increasingly investigated due to its potentially modifiable nature and its value as a predictor of outcome.
   DUI is poorly applicable and highly unreliable in psychosis. The present critical review examines the impact of DUI and its more operative definition of "duration of untreated psychosis" (DUP) in the course and outcome of SCZ, focusing on its epidemiologic, clinical, prognostic factors. Length of DUP has been identified as positively related to a worst treatment response, symptom control and overall functional outcome in SCZ. Negative symptoms appear to be prominently related to longer DUP. Neuroimaging correlates of DUP have not been clearly outlined: few of the studies considering first-episode patients and DUP showed structural abnormalities. A low proportion of significant associations were found mostly in cerebellum and occipital lobe of patients with longer DUP. Also, evidence of an inverse correlation between cognitive alterations and DUP is not conclusive.
   DUI and DUP are multidimensional constructs that imply both intrinsic, illness related (e.g. subtle symptoms at onset) and extrinsic factors (e.g. access to mental health services), so that from its study sprouted in the last decades First-Episode Units, aimed at providing secondary prevention in SCZ such as providing a timely diagnosis and treatment to patients experiencing their first psychotic episode. Early intervention seems to ensure a shortened DUP, especially for people presenting with brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, and, ultimately, ensure a more favorable prognosis for patients affected by SCZ.

AB  - Depression is the principal cause of illness and disability in the world. Studies charting the prevalence of depression among children and adolescents report high percentages of youngsters in both groups with depressive symptoms. This review analyzes the construct and explanatory theories of depression and offers a succinct overview of the main evaluation instruments used to measure this disorder in children and adolescents, as well as the prevention programs developed for the school environment and the different types of clinical treatment provided. The analysis reveals that in mental classifications, the child depression construct is no different from the adult one, and that multiple explanatory theories must be taken into account in order to arrive at a full understanding of depression. Consequently, both treatment and prevention should also be multifactorial in nature. Although universal programs may be more appropriate due to their broad scope of application, the results are inconclusive and fail to demonstrate any solid long-term efficacy. In conclusion, we can state that: (1) There are biological factors (such as tryptophan-a building block for serotonin-depletion, for example) which strongly influence the appearance of depressive disorders; (2) Currently, negative interpersonal relations and relations with one's environment, coupled with social-cultural changes, may explain the increase observed in the prevalence of depression; (3) Many instruments can be used to evaluate depression, but it is necessary to continue to adapt tests for diagnosing the condition at an early age; (4) Prevention programs should be developed for and implemented at an early age; and (5) The majority of treatments are becoming increasingly rigorous and effective. Given that initial manifestations of depression may occur from a very early age, further and more in-depth research is required into the biological, psychological and social factors that, in an interrelated manner, may explain the appearance, development, and treatment of depression.

AB  - In recent years, technical and procedural advances have brought functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to the field of murine neuroscience. Due to its unique capacity to measure functional activity non-invasively, across the entire brain, fMRI allows for the direct comparison of large-scale murine and human brain functions. This opens an avenue for bidirectional translational strategies to address fundamental questions ranging from neurological disorders to the nature of consciousness. The key challenges of murine fMRI are: (1) to generate and maintain functional brain states that approximate those of calm and relaxed human volunteers, while (2) preserving neurovascular coupling and physiological baseline conditions. Low-dose anesthetic protocols are commonly applied in murine functional brain studies to prevent stress and facilitate a calm and relaxed condition among animals. Yet, current mono-anesthesia has been shown to impair neural transmission and hemodynamic integrity. By linking the current state of murine electrophysiology, Ca2+ imaging and fMRI of anesthetic effects to findings from human studies, this systematic review proposes general principles to design, apply and monitor anesthetic protocols in a more sophisticated way. The further development of balanced multimodal anesthesia, combining two or more drugs with complementary modes of action helps to shape and maintain specific brain states and relevant aspects of murine physiology. Functional connectivity and its dynamic repertoire as assessed by fMRI can be used to make inferences about cortical states and provide additional information about whole-brain functional dynamics. Based on this, a simple and comprehensive functional neurosignature pattern can be determined for use in defining brain states and anesthetic depth in rest and in response to stimuli. Such a signature can be evaluated and shared between labs to indicate the brain state of a mouse during experiments, an important step toward translating findings across species.

AB  - The acute thermal tolerance of ectotherms has been measured in a variety of ways; these include assays where organisms are shifted abruptly to stressful temperatures and assays where organisms experience temperatures that are ramped more slowly to stressful levels. Ramping assays are thought to be more relevant to natural conditions where sudden abrupt shifts are unlikely to occur often, but it has been argued that thermal limits established under ramping conditions are underestimates of true thermal limits because stresses due to starvation and/or desiccation can arise under ramping. These confounding effects might also impact the variance and heritability of thermal tolerance. We argue here that ramping assays are useful in capturing aspects of ecological relevance even though there is potential for confounding effects of other stresses that can also influence thermal limits in nature. Moreover, we show that the levels of desiccation and starvation experienced by ectotherms in ramping assays will often be minor unless the assays involve small animals and last for many hours. Empirical data illustrate that the combined effects of food and humidity on thermal limits under ramping and sudden shifts to stressful conditions are unpredictable; in Drosophila melanogaster the presence of food decreased rather than increased thermal limits, whereas in Ceratitis capitata they had little impact. The literature provides examples where thermal limits are increased under ramping presumably because of the potential for physiological changes leading to acclimation. It is unclear whether heritabilities and population differentiation will necessarily be lower under ramping because of confounding effects. Although it is important to clearly define experimental methods, particularly when undertaking comparative assessments, and to understand potential confounding effects, thermotolerance assays based on ramping remain an important tool for understanding and predicting species responses to environmental change. An important area for further development is to identify the impact of rates of temperature change under field and laboratory conditions.

AB  - Most acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions are accompanied by neuro inflammation; yet the exact nature of the inflammatory processes and whether they modify disease progression is not well understood. In this review, we discuss the key epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence implicating inflammatory processes in the progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic (DA) nigrostriatal pathway and their potential contribution to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Given that interplay between genetics and environment are likely to contribute to risk for development of idiopathic PD, recent data showing interactions between products of genes linked to heritable PD that function to protect DA neurons against oxidative or proteolytic stress and inflammation pathways will be discussed. Cellular mechanisms activated or enhanced by inflammatory processes that may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, or apoptosis of dopaminergic (DA) neurons will be reviewed, with special emphasis on turner necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta) signaling pathways. Epigenetic factors which have the potential to trigger neuroinflammation, including environmental exposures and age-associated chronic inflammatory conditions, will be discussed as possible 'second-hit' triggers that may affect disease onset or progression of idiopathic PD. If inflammatory processes have an active role in nigrostriatal pathway degeneration, then evidence should exist to indicate that such processes begin in the early stages of disease and that they contribute to neuronal dysfunction and/or hasten neurodegeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Therapeutically, if anti-inflammatory interventions can be shown to rescue nigral DA neurons from degeneration and lower PD risk, then timely use of anti-inflammatory therapies should be investigated further in well-designed clinical trials for their ability to prevent or delay the progressive loss of nigral DA neurons in genetically susceptible populations.

AB  - Somatic symptoms have been conceptualized in many different ways in literature. Current classifications mainly focus on the numbers of symptoms, with relative neglect of the underlying psychopathology. Researchers have emphasized the importance of a number of experiential, perceptual and cognitive-behavioural aspects of somatization. This review focuses on existing literature on the role of somatosensory amplification, attribution styles, and illness behaviour in somatization. Evidence suggests that somatosensory amplification is neither sensitive nor specific to somatizing states, and that other factors like anxiety, depression, neuroticism, alexithymia may also have an influence. Attribution research supports the existence of multiple causal attributions, which are related to the numbers of somatic symptoms. While somatizing patients have more organic attributions, depressed patients have more psychological attributions. A global somatic attribution style is associated with the number of obscure somatic symptoms, while a psychological attribution style is associated with both-psychological and somatic- symptoms of depression and anxiety. There are conflicting findings with respect to the role of normalizing attributions in reducing physician recognition of anxiety and depression. Specific symptom attributions appear to explain physician recognition of psychological distress, but global attribution styles do not appear to explain any further variance in physician recognition beyond that explained by specific causal attributions. Illness behaviour has been studied in two distinct ways in literature. Research focusing on attendance rates as a form of illness behaviour suggests that somatization is associated with high levels of health care utilization. There is also some evidence that health care utilization, amplification and attributions styles may be interrelated among somatizing patients. More structured ways to assess illness behaviour have found high levels of abnormal illness behaviour in this population. Overall, research appears to suggest a complex ( and as yet unclear) relationship between somatic symptoms and underlying cognitions/illness behaviours. While it is clear that somatization is closely related to a number of perceptual and cognitive-behavioural factors, the precise nature of these relationships are yet to be elucidated.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains an urgent global public health priority, causing 1.5 million deaths worldwide in 2018. There is evidence that psychosocial factors modulate immune function; however, how this may influence TB risk or BCG vaccine response, and whether this pathway can be modified through social protection, has not been investigated. This paper aims to: a) systematically review evidence of how psychosocial factors influence the expression of biomarkers of immunity, and b) apply this general evidence to propose plausible TB-specific pathways for future study.
   Methods: Papers reporting on the impact of psychosocial stressors on immune biomarkers in relation to infectious disease risk were identified through a search of the databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health and PsycEXTRA alongside reference list and citation searching of key papers. Data extraction and critical appraisal were carried out using a standardised form. The findings were tabulated and synthesised narratively by infectious disease category, and used to propose plausible mechanisms for how psychosocial exposures might influence immune outcomes relevant to TB and BCG response.
   Results: 27,026 citations were identified, of which 51 met the inclusion criteria. The literature provides evidence of a relationship between psychosocial factors and immune biomarkers. While the direction and strength of associations is heterogenous, some overarching patterns emerged: adverse psychosocial factors (e.g. stress) were generally associated with compromised vaccine response and higher antibody titres to herpesviruses, and vice versa for positive psychosocial factors (e.g. social support).
   Conclusions: The evidence identifies pathways linking psychosocial factors and immune response: co-viral infection and immune suppression, both of which are potentially relevant to TB and BCG response. However, the heterogeneity in the strength and nature of the impact of psychosocial factors on immune function, and lack of research on the implications of this relationship for TB, underscore the need for TB-specific research.

AB  - Background The developmental taxonomic theory proposes that there are two subtypes of antisocial behaviour. The first is a neurodevelopmental disorder which emerges in early childhood and follows a life-course persistent course, whereas the second emerges in adolescence, remits in early adulthood and reflects peer processes such as mimicry of antisocial peers. The aim of this review was to evaluate the developmental taxonomic theory in the light of recent empirical research.
   Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature review comparing these subtypes of antisocial behaviour based on searches on PubMed and other scientific databases covering the period from 1993 to 2013. We focused on research encompassing psychiatric epidemiology, personality assessment, neuropsychology, neuroendocrinology, genetics, and structural and functional neuroimaging. Sixty one empirical studies were identified that investigated one of these forms of antisocial behaviour separately or explicitly compared childhood-onset and adolescence-onset forms of antisocial behaviour.
   Results Empirical research provides support for the hypothesis that life-course persistent antisocial behaviour is a neurodevelopmental disorder which emerges in the transactions between individual vulnerabilities and environmental adversity. In contrast to the developmental taxonomic theory, however, empirical findings suggest that severe antisocial behaviour that emerges in adolescence frequently has a negative prognosis and is rarely limited to the adolescent period. In addition, both forms of antisocial behaviour are associated with emotion processing deficits, changes in brain structure and function, alterations in cortisol secretion, and atypical personality traits (such as increased callous-unemotional traits).
   Conclusions We conclude that the developmental taxonomic theory is in need of revision, as differences between life-course persistent and adolescence-onset forms of antisocial behaviour appear to be quantitative, rather than qualitative, in nature. In addition, evidence is accumulating that adolescence-onset antisocial behaviour may also be a neurodevelopmental disorder. To account for the similarities between these groups, despite the differences in their age-of-onset, we propose that the quality of the child's early environment moderates the relationship between individual vulnerabilities and the age-of-onset of antisocial behaviour.

AB  - Affect and emotion are essential aspects of human life. These states or feelings signal personally relevant things or situations and color our memories and thoughts. Within the area of affective or emotion processing, evaluation-the assessment of the valence associated with a stimulus or event (i.e., its positivity or negativity)-is considered a fundamental process, representing an early and crucial stage in constructivist emotion theories. Valence evaluation is assumed to occur automatically when encountering a stimulus. But does this really apply always, even if we simply see a word? And if so, what exactly is processed or activated in memory? One approach to investigating this evaluative process uses behavioral priming paradigms and, first and foremost, the evaluative priming paradigm and its variants. In the present review, we delineate the insights gained from this paradigm about the relation of affect and emotion to cognition and language. Specifically, we reviewed the empirical evidence base with regard to this issue as well as the proposed theoretical models of valence evaluation, specifically with regard to the nature of the representations activated via such paradigms. It will become clear that affect and emotion are foremost (and, perhaps, even exclusively) triggered by evaluative priming paradigms in the sense that semantic affective knowledge is activated. This knowledge should be modeled as being active in working memory rather than in long-term memory as was assumed in former models. The emerging evidence concerning the processing of more specific emotion aspects gives rise to the assumption that the activation of these semantic aspects is related to their social importance. In that sense, the fast and (conditionally) automatic activation of valence and other emotion aspects in evaluative priming paradigms reveals something about affect and emotion: Valence and specific emotion aspects are so important for our daily life that encountering almost any stimulus entails the automatic activation of the associated valence and other emotion aspects in memory, when the context requires it.

AB  - Background: Post-deinstitutionalisation, mental health supported accommodation services have been implemented widely. The available research evidence is heterogeneous in nature and resistant to synthesis attempts, leaving researchers and policy makers with no clear summary what works and for whom. In this context, we undertook a comprehensive systematic review of quantitative studies in order to synthesise the current evidence on mental health and psychosocial outcomes for individuals residing in mental health supported accommodation services.
   Methods: Using a combination of electronic database searches, hand searches, forward-backward snowballing and article recommendations from an expert panel, 115 papers were identified for review. Data extraction and quality assessments were conducted, and 33 articles were excluded due to low quality, leaving 82 papers in the final review. Variation in terminology and service characteristics made the comparison of service models unfeasible. As such, findings were presented according to the following sub-groups: 'Homeless', 'Deinstitutionalisation' and 'General Severe Mental Illness (SMI)'.
   Results: Results were mixed, reflecting the heterogeneity of the supported accommodation literature, in terms of research quality, experimental design, population, service types and outcomes assessed. There is some evidence that supported accommodation is effective across a range of psychosocial outcomes. The most robust evidence supports the effectiveness of the permanent supported accommodation model for homeless SMI in generating improvements in housing retention and stability, and appropriate use of clinical services over time, and for other forms of supported accommodation for deinstitutionalised populations in reducing hospitalisation rates and improving appropriate service use. The evidence base for general SMI populations is less developed, and requires further research.
   Conclusions: A lack of high-quality experimental studies, definitional inconsistency and poor reporting continue to stymie our ability to identify effective supported accommodation models and practices. The authors recommend improved reporting standards and the prioritisation of experimental studies that compare outcomes across different service models.

AB  - Introduction: Functional amnesia refers to various forms of amnesia, which have no direct organic brain basis. Psychological stress and trauma were etiologically linked to its development across various cultures.
   Methods: We have studied several patients With functional amnesia, employing neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. Herein we provide a review of the current understanding of the phenomenology, neuropsychology and neurobiology of functional amnesia, which we illustrate by reference to five own case descriptions and other cases presented in the literature.
   Results: Functional amnesia is mostly of retrograde nature and presents in the form of a memory blockade or repression to recollect episodic-autobiographical events, which may cover the whole past life. Sometimes, the recollection impairment is localized to certain time epochs. In comparison to functional retrograde amnesia, functional isolated anterograde amnesia is much rarer and data on its neurobiology are scant. In patients with functional amnesia with pronounced retrograde episodic-autobiographical memory impairments, we identified changes in brain metabolism, above all reductions in the temporo-frontal regions of the right hemisphere. Recently, even subtle structural changes in the white matter of the (right) frontal cortex were described in functional retrograde amnesia by other researchers
   Conclusions: The disruption in recollection in functional amnesia is often accompanied by changes in personality dimensions, pertaining to cognition (self-related processing, theory of mind), autonoetic consciousness and affectivity. This suggests that functional amnesia is a multifaceted condition. We hypothesize that the recollection deficit in functional retrograde amnesia primarily reflects a desynchronization between a frontal lobe system, important for autonoetic consciousness, and a temporo-amygdalar system, important for evaluation and emotions. Despite assumptions that functional amnesia can always be reversed, several cases of functional amnesia were found to follow a chronic course, suggesting a need for longitudinal prospective studies to quantify possible global cognitive deterioration over time and its neural underpinnings.

AB  - Aims and method Drawing on empirical studies and literature reviews, this paper aims to clarify and qualify the relevance of resilience to youth experiencing political conflict. It focuses on the discordance between expectations of widespread dysfunction among conflict-affected youth and a body of empirical evidence that does not confirm these expectations. Findings The expectation for widespread dysfunction appears exaggerated, relying as it does on low correlations and on presumptions of universal response to adversity. Such a position ignores cultural differences in understanding and responding to adversity, and in the specific case of political conflict, it does not account for the critical role of ideologies and meaning systems that underlie the political conflict and shape a young people's interpretation of the conflict, and their exposure, participation, and processing of experiences. With respect to empirical evidence, the findings must be viewed as tentative given the primitive nature of research designs: namely, concentration on violence exposure as the primary risk factor, at the expense of recognizing war's impact on the broader ecology of youth's lives, including disruptions to key economic, social, and political resources; priority given to psychopathology in the assessment of youth functioning, rather than holistic assessments that would include social and institutional functioning and fit with cultural and normative expectations and transitions; and heavy reliance on cross-sectional, rather than longitudinal, studies. Conclusions Researchers and practitioners interested in employing resilience as a guiding construct will face such questions: Is resilience predicated on evidence of competent functioning across the breadth of risks associated with political conflict, across most or all domains of functioning, and/or across time? In reality, youth resilience amidst political conflict is likely a complex package of better and poorer functioning that varies over time and in direct relationship to social, economic, and political opportunities. Addressing this complexity will complicate the definition of resilience, but it confronts the ambiguities and limitations of work in cross-cultural contexts.

AB  - Previous studies of psychosocial work factors have indicated their importance for workers' health. However, to what extent health problems can be attributed to the nature of the work environment or other psychosocial factors is not clear. No previous systematic review has used inclusion criteria based on specific medical evaluation of work-related health outcomes and the use of validated instruments for the assessment of the psychosocial (work) environment.
   The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence assessing the relationship between the psychosocial work environment and workers' health based on studies that used standardized and validated instruments to assess the psychosocial work environment and that focused on medically confirmed health outcomes. A systematic review of the literature was carried out by searching the databases PubMed, B-ON, Science Direct, Psycarticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection and the search engine (Google Scholar) using appropriate words for studies published from 2004 to 2014. This review follows the recommendations of the Statement for Reporting Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). Studies were included in the review if data on psychosocial validated assessment method(s) for the study population and specific medical evaluation of health-related work outcome(s) were presented.
   In total, the search strategy yielded 10,623 references, of which 10 studies (seven prospective cohort and three cross-sectional) met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (7/10) observed an adverse effect of poor psychosocial work factors on workers' health: 3 on sickness absence, 4 on cardiovascular diseases. The other 3 studies reported detrimental effects on sleep and on disease-associated biomarkers. A more consistent effect was observed in studies of higher methodological quality that used a prospective design jointly with the use of validated instruments for the assessment of the psychosocial (work) environment and clinical evaluation.
   More prospective studies are needed to assess the evidence of work-related psychosocial factors on workers' health.

AB  - Background Hikikomori is a phenomenon describing people who exhibit behaviors of self-secluding themselves at home for long durations of time and usually only having face-to-face social interactions with none other than family. Existing interventions for hikikomori are inconclusive and the majority are absent in using a theoretical framework to guide its components. Therefore, applicability of the psychosocial recovery framework of Connectedness, Hope and Optimism, Identity, Meaning in Life, and Empowerment (CHIME) towards hikikomori care was reviewed. Method Five databases were searched in April 2020 with the search formula from a published systematic review on hikikomori combined with search terms specific to domains of the CHIME framework. Articles included in the review were of the English language, of all publication years, peer-reviewed, quantitative or qualitative research studies and case studies, included study designs that were observational or interventional in nature, and involved populations of socially withdrawn youth. Results CHIME's comprehensive structure and organized approach could guide researchers or service providers in determining areas needing assessments, measurement, and areas of focus. It is suggested that the CHIME framework is applicable after modifying a specific dimension-'meaning of mental illness experiences' into 'meaning of the hikikomori experience'. Thematic overlap occurred between the domains of connectedness, identity, and meaning. Yet, additional dimensions or domains such as trust building, non-linearity, and spatiality can be included for addressing specific limitations in this application, which would help towards catering services to help hikikomori in recovery or in increasing quality-of-life of those individuals' while entrapped in this withdrawn lifestyle. Conclusion CHIME framework could be applicable towards hikikomori care after applying the suggested modifications. Additionally, many knowledge gaps were found in literature during this review that warrants further investigation to improve hikikomori care.

AB  - Objectives After the outbreak of a new viral disease in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, COVID-19 in a very short time and rapidly became a global pandemic. Through a systematic review, the present paper investigated the requirements of Mental Health Services during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   Methods A comprehensive search was conducted through PubMed and NLM Gateway (for MEDLINE), Institute of Scientific Information (ISI), and Scopus. PsychINFO and CINAHL data banks were also searched. The primary roots for the development of the search strategy developed based on the keywords of "Covid", "mental health", "care", "services". All relevant studies were included without any limitation of publication time or the papers' language as it was not possible to conduct a formal systematic review given the nature of the publications. Instead, it was decided to conduct a mixed systematic and complementary narrative review covering different interested domains.
   Results Out of 80 papers, after excluding duplications, 58 articles were selected for the refinement process. Three refining steps based on the titles, abstracts, and full texts led to data extraction from 4 eligible papers. Considering the importance of the problem, related findings, key points, and research findings were summarized and presented in terms of critical components of infrastructure and resources, including policy for at-risk groups, different approaches to mental health service delivery, indirect contexts for mental health service delivery, follow-up attitudes, and complementary research. The results of the study indicate that many studies considered the consequences of physical aspects and diagnostic symptoms. Thus, aspects of mental health have been either less focused or even neglected. In mental health consequences, immediate attention and intensive programs to assess mental health, preparation for support and treatment, and prevention services are emphasized.
   Conclusion During the implementation of mental health interventions, to improve services and to consider the limitations and challenges of implementing programs, it is necessary to pay attention to the attitudes of target groups and their preferences.

AB  - Objective: We lack evidence that routine screening for depression in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) improves patient outcome. This lack has challenged the advisory issued by the American Heart Association (AHA) to routinely screen for depression in CHD patients. We assess the AHA advisory in the context of well-established criteria of screening for diseases.
   Methods: Using principles and criteria for screening developed by the World Health Organization and the United Kingdom National Screening Committee, we generated criteria pertinent to screening for depression in CHD patients. To find publications relevant to these criteria and clinical setting, we performed a broadly based literature search on "depression and CHD," supplemented by more focused literature searches.
   Results: Evidence for an association between depression and CHD is strong. Despite this, the AHA advisory has several limitations. It did not account for the complexity of the association between depression and CHD. It acknowledged there was no evidence that screening for depression leads to improved outcomes in cardiovascular populations but still recommended routine screening without providing an alternative evidence-based explanation. It ignored the paucity of literature about the safety and cost-effectiveness of routine screening for depression in CHD and failed to define the nature and extent of resources needed to implement such a program effectively.
   Conclusion: We conclude that the AHA advisory is premature. We must first demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of screening and define the resources necessary for its implementation and monitoring. Meanwhile, organizations representing cardiologists, psychiatrists, and general practitioners must coordinate efforts to manage depression and CHD through collaborative care, and work with the policy makers to develop the necessary infrastructure and services delivery system needed to optimize the outcome of depressed and at-risk-for-depression patients suffering from CHD.

AB  - The search for what causes schizophrenia has been onerous. This research has included extensive assessment of a variety of genetic and environmental factors using ever emerging high-resolution technologies and traditional understanding of the biology of the brain. These efforts have identified a large number of schizophrenia-associated genes, some of which are altered by mutational and epi-mutational mechanisms in a threshold liability model of schizophrenia development. The results, however, have limited predictability and the actual cause of the disease remains unknown. This current state asks for conceptualizing the problem differently in light of novel insights into the nature of mutations, the biology of the brain and the fine precision and resolution of emerging technologies. There is mounting evidence that mutations acquired during postzygotic development are more common than germline mutations. Also, the postzygotic somatic mutations including epimutations (PZMs), which often lead to somatic mosaicism, are relatively common in the mammalian brain in comparison to most other tissues and PZMs are more common in patients with neurodevelopmental mental disorders, including schizophrenia. Further, previously inaccessible, detection of PZMs is becoming feasible with the advent of novel technologies that include single-cell genomics and epigenomics and the use of exquisite experimental designs including use of monozygotic twins discordant for the disease. These developments allow us to propose a working hypothesis and expand the threshold liability model of schizophrenia that already encompasses familial genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors to include somatic de novo PZMs. Further, we offer a test for this expanded model using currently available genome sequences and methylome data on monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia (MZD) and their parents. The results of this analysis argue that PZMs play a significant role in the development of schizophrenia and explain extensive heterogeneity seen across patients. It also offers the potential to convincingly link PZMs to both nervous system health and disease, an area that has remained challenging to study and relatively under explored.

AB  - Objectives: Australia and New Zealand have some of the highest rates of compulsory community treatment order use worldwide. There are also concerns that people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds may have higher rates of community treatment orders. We therefore assessed the health service, clinical and psychosocial outcomes of compulsory community treatment and explored if culturally and linguistically diverse, indigenous status or other factors predicted community treatment orders. Methods: We searched the following databases from inception to January 2020: PubMed/Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We included any study conducted in Australia or New Zealand that compared people on community treatment orders for severe mental illness with controls receiving voluntary psychiatric treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessing study quality using Joanna Briggs Institute scales. Results: A total of 31 publications from 12 studies met inclusion criteria, of which 24 publications could be included in a meta-analysis. Only one was from New Zealand. People who were male, single and not engaged in work, study or home duties were significantly more likely to be subject to a community treatment order. In addition, those from a culturally and linguistically diverse or migrant background were nearly 40% more likely to be on an order. Indigenous status was not associated with community treatment order use in Australia and there were no New Zealand data. Community treatment orders did not reduce readmission rates or bed-days at 12-month follow-up. There was evidence of increased benefit in the longer-term but only after a minimum of 2 years of use. Finally, people on community treatment orders had a lower mortality rate, possibly related to increased community contacts. Conclusion: People from culturally and linguistically diverse or migrant backgrounds are more likely to be placed on a community treatment order. However, the evidence for effectiveness remains inconclusive and limited to orders of at least 2 years' duration. The restrictive nature of community treatment orders may not be outweighed by the inconclusive evidence for beneficial outcomes.

AB  - Objective: In clinical settings, there is substantial evidence both clinically and empirically to suggest that approximately 50% of individuals with borderline personality disorder experience auditory verbal hallucinations. However, there is limited research investigating the phenomenology of these voices. The aim of this study was to review and compare our current understanding of auditory verbal hallucinations in borderline personality disorder with auditory verbal hallucinations in patients with a psychotic disorder, to critically analyse existing studies investigating auditory verbal hallucinations in borderline personality disorder and to identify gaps in current knowledge, which will help direct future research.
   Method: The literature was searched using the electronic database Scopus, PubMed and MEDLINE. Relevant studies were included if they were written in English, were empirical studies specifically addressing auditory verbal hallucinations and borderline personality disorder, were peer reviewed, used only adult humans and sample comprising borderline personality disorder as the primary diagnosis, and included a comparison group with a primary psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia.
   Results: Our search strategy revealed a total of 16 articles investigating the phenomenology of auditory verbal hallucinations in borderline personality disorder. Some studies provided evidence to suggest that the voice experiences in borderline personality disorder are similar to those experienced by people with schizophrenia, for example, occur inside the head, and often involved persecutory voices. Other studies revealed some differences between schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder voice experiences, with the borderline personality disorder voices sounding more derogatory and self-critical in nature and the voice-hearers' response to the voices were more emotionally resistive. Furthermore, in one study, the schizophrenia group's voices resulted in more disruption in daily functioning. These studies are, however, limited in number and do not provide definitive evidence of these differences.
   Conclusion: The limited research examining auditory verbal hallucinations experiences in borderline personality disorder poses a significant diagnostic and treatment challenge. A deeper understanding of the precise phenomenological characteristics will help us in terms of diagnostic distinction as well as inform treatments.

AB  - Background: Severe mental illnesses (SMI) may be independently associated with cardiovascular risk factors and the metabolic syndrome. We aimed to systematically assess studies that compared diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and metabolic syndrome in people with and without SMI.
   Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL & PsycINFO. We hand searched reference lists of key articles. We employed three search main themes: SMI, cardiovascular disease, and each cardiovascular risk factor. We selected cross-sectional, case control, cohort or intervention studies comparing one or more risk factor in both SMI and a reference group. We excluded studies without any reference group. We extracted data on: study design, cardiovascular risk factor(s) and their measurement, diagnosis of SMI, study setting, sampling method, nature of comparison group and data on key risk factors.
   Results: Of 14592 citations, 134 papers met criteria and 36 were finally included. 26 reported on diabetes, 12 hypertension, 11 dyslipidaemia, and 4 metabolic syndrome. Most studies were cross sectional, small and several lacked comparison data suitable for extraction. Meta-analysis was possible for diabetes, cholesterol and hypertension; revealing a pooled risk ratio of 1.70 (1.21 to 2.37) for diabetes and 1.11 (0.91 to 1.35) of hypertension. Restricting SMI to schizophreniform illnesses yielded a pooled risk ratio for diabetes of 1.87 (1.68 to 2.09). Total cholesterol was not higher in people with SMI (Standardized Mean Difference -0.10 (-0.55 to 0.36)) and there were inconsistent data on HDL, LDL and triglycerides with some, but not all, reporting lower levels of HDL cholesterol and raised triglyceride levels. Metabolic syndrome appeared more common in SMI.
   Conclusion: Diabetes (but not hypertension) is more common in SMI. Data on other risk factors were limited by poor quality or inconsistent research findings, but a small number of studies show greater prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in SMI.

AB  - About half of the patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) become non-adherent during long-term treatment, a rate largely similar to other chronic illnesses and one that has remained unchanged over the years. Non-adherence in BD is a complex phenomenon determined by a multitude of influences. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the key determinants of non-adherence in BD. Initial research on non-adherence in BD mostly limited itself to examining demographic, clinical and medication-related factors impacting adherence. However, because of inconsistent results and failure of these studies to address the complexities of adherence behaviour, demographic and illness-related factors were alone unable to explain or predict non-adherence in BD. This prompted a shift to a more patient-centred approach of viewing non-adherence. The central element of this approach includes an emphasis on patients' decisions regarding their own treatment based on their personal beliefs, life circumstances and their perceptions of benefits and disadvantages of treatment. Patients' decision-making processes are influenced by the nature of their relationship with clinicians and the health-care system and by people in their immediate environment. The primacy of the patient's perspective on non-adherence is in keeping with the current theoretical models and concordance-based approaches to adherence behaviour in BD. Research over the past two decades has further endorsed the critical role of patients' attitudes and beliefs regarding medications, the importance of a collaborative treatment-alliance, the influence of the family, and the significance of other patient-related factors such as knowledge, stigma, patient satisfaction and access to treatment in determining non-adherence in BD. Though simply moving from an illness-centred to a patient-centred approach is unlikely to solve the problem of non-adherence in BD, such an approach is more likely to lead to a better understanding of non-adherence and more likely to yield effective solutions to tackle this common and distressing problem afflicting patients with BD.

KW  - literature review
KW  - IPCC
KW  - NCDs
KW  - infectious diseases
KW  - malnutrition
KW  - respiratory diseases
AB  - Background: Climate change has been recognized as both one of the biggest threats and the biggest opportunities for global health in the 21st century. This trend review seeks to assess and characterize the amount and type of scientific literature on the link between climate change and human health.
   Design: We tracked the use of climate-related terms and their co-occurrence with health terms during the 25 years since the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, from 1990 to 2014, in two scientific databases and in the IPCC reports. We investigated the trends in the number of publications about health and climate change through time, by nature of the health impact under study, and by geographic area. We compared the scientific production in the health field with that of other sectors on which climate change has an impact.
   Results: The number of publications was extremely low in both databases from 1990 (325 and 1,004, respectively) until around 2006 (1,332 and 4,319, respectively), which has since then increased exponentially in recent years (6,079 and 17,395, respectively, in 2014). However, the number of climate change papers regarding health is still about half that of other sectors. Certain health impacts, particularly malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), remain substantially understudied. Approximately two-thirds of all published studies were carried out in OECD countries (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), predominantly in Europe and North America.
   Conclusions: There is a clear need for further research on the links between climate change and health. This pertains particularly to research in and by those countries in which health will be mostly affected and capacity to adapt is least. Specific undertreated topics such as NCDs, malnutrition, and mental health should gain the priority they deserve. Funding agencies are invited to take note of and establish calls for proposals accordingly. Raising the interest in this research area in young scientists remains a challenge and should lead to innovative courses for large audiences, such as Massive Open Online Courses.

AB  - Speech sound perception is one of the most fascinating tasks performed by the human brain. It involves a mapping from continuous acoustic waveforms onto the discrete phonological units computed to store words in the mental lexicon. In this article, we review the magnetoencephalographic studies that have explored the timing and morphology of the Ni m component to investigate how vowels and consonants are computed and represented within the auditory cortex. The neurons that are involved in the Nlm act to construct a sensory memory of the stimulus due to spatially and temporally distributed activation patterns within the auditory cortex. Indeed, localization of auditory fields maps in animals and humans suggested two levels of sound coding, a tonotopy dimension for spectral properties and a tonochrony dimension for temporal properties of sounds. When the stimulus is a complex speech sound, tonotopy and tonochrony data may give important information to assess whether the speech sound parsing and decoding are generated by pure bottom-up reflection of acoustic differences or whether they are additionally affected by top-down processes related to phonological categories. Hints supporting pure bottom-up processing coexist with hints supporting top-down abstract phoneme representation. Actually. N1 m data (amplitude, latency, source generators, and hemispheric distribution) are limited and do not help to disentangle the issue. The nature of these limitations is discussed. Moreover, neurophysiological studies on animals and neuroimaging studies on humans have been taken into consideration. We compare also the N1m findings with the investigation of the magnetic mismatch negativity (MMNm) component and with the analogous electrical components, the N1 and the MMN. We conclude that N1 seems more sensitive to capture lateralization and hierarchical processes than N1 m, although the data are very preliminary. Finally, we suggest that MEG data should be integrated with EEG data in the light of the neural oscillations framework

AB  - Phytoplank ton are the base of the Antarctic food web, sustain the wealth and diversity of life for which Antarctica is renowned, and play a critical role in biogeochemical cycles that mediate global climate. Over the vast expanse of the Southern Ocean (SO), the climate is variously predicted to experience increased warming, strengthening wind, acidification, shallowing mixed layer depths, increased light (and UV), changes in upwelling and nutrient replenishment, declining sea ice, reduced salinity, and the southward migration of ocean fronts. These changes are expected to alter the structure and function of phytoplankton communities in the SO. The diverse environments contained within the vast expanse of the SO will be impacted differently by climate change; causing the identity and the magnitude of environmental factors driving biotic change to vary within and among bioregions. Predicting the net effect of multiple climate-induced stressors over a range of environments is complex. Yet understanding the response of SO phytoplankton to climate change is vital if we are to predict the future states of the ecosystem, estimate the impacts on fisheries and endangered species, and accurately predict the effects of physical and biotic change in the SO on global climate. This review looks at the major environmental factors that define the structure and function of phytoplankton communities in the SO, examines the forecast changes in the SO environment, predicts the likely effect of these changes on phytoplankton, and considers the ramifications for trophodynamics and feedbacks to global climate change. Predictions strongly suggest that all regions of the SO will experience changes in phytoplankton productivity and community composition with climate change. The nature, and even the sign, of these changes varies within and among regions and will depend upon the magnitude and sequence in which these environmental changes are imposed. It is likely that predicted changes to phytoplankton communities will affect SO biogeochemistry, carbon export, and nutrition for higher trophic levels.

AB  - The contribution a biofuel production to sustainable development in rural areas requires policy and practice that understands the opportunities and risks faced by smallholder farmers. Potential opportunities for smallholders include access to markets, access to employment, local infrastructure developments and spill over effects such as new agronomic knowledge. Potential threats include loss of land entitlements, social exclusion, environmental degradation, dependency upon the biofuel industry and diminished food security. Although a multitude of issues is acknowledged, many studies are focused on specific issues and knowledge remains fragmented. Further, much of the indicator-based literature does not acknowledge the importance of case-specificity nor the link between the processes and circumstances that drive indicator results. This article reviews indicator assessments of biofuel production involving smallholders and highlights the importance of holistically considering a range of social, economic and environmental criteria. Further this review stresses the need to link drivers with indicators. Drivers include decisions and circumstances of a biophysical, socio-economic and governance nature with relevance at field, farm and higher levels. The link between drivers and indicators is crucial to justify indicators and to identify the scope for policy to influence progress against indicators. A conceptual model is provided that summarises important processes determining sustainability of biofuel production involving smallholders. This model can also be used as a starting point for more detailed analysis capturing and quantifying relationships between specific drivers and indicators on a case-by-case basis. This type of analysis is particularly valuable in regions where biofuel policy and developments are unfolding and multiple stakeholders (e.g. smallholders, companies, NGOs and governments) are involved. We highlight that regulation and certification of biofuel production often needs to be complemented with improvements in governance structures and, that policy targeting smallholder involvement with biofuel production should account for a diversity of smallholder characteristics.

AB  - The current international patent system emerged within certain economic, political and social conditions in specific territories and periods. It has its historical roots in the Statute of Venice (1474), the Statute of Monopolies (1624), the United States Patent Law (1790), the French Patent Law (1791) and the Paris Convention (1883). Over time, these laws shaped a new model, which currently prevails. To strengthen the analysis of this article, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (1994), as well as free trade twentieth century agreements are integrated into the discussion. It is worth noting that each amendment stressed the economic relevance of the patent and its use to benefit certain economic elites through the creation of monopolies. Consequently, the debate on the purposes and nature of the international patent system has also been constant from its emergence to the present. This article provides basic elements for reflection about the origin, purposes and scope of national patent models implemented in Latin America within the global trend of scientific-technological innovation for development.

AB  - Academic motivation researchers sometimes struggle to decipher the distinctive characteristics of what appear to be highly analogous constructs. In this article, we discuss important similarities between self-concept and self-efficacy as well as some notable differences. Both constructs share many similarities such as centrality of perceived competence in construct definition; use of mastery experience, social comparison, and reflected appraisals as major information sources; and a domain-specific and multidimensional nature. Both predict motivation, emotion, and performance to varying degrees. However, there are also important differences. These differences include integration vs. separation of cognition and affect, heavily normative vs. goal-referenced evaluation of competence, aggregated vs. context-specific judgment, hierarchical vs. loosely hierarchical structure, past vs. future orientation, and relative temporal stability vs. malleability. We argue that self-efficacy acts as an active precursor of self-concept development and suggest that self-concept research separate out its multiple components and subprocesses and invest more effort toward making students less preoccupied with normative ability comparisons in school.

AB  - Purpose of the Review In this review, we focus on overlapping features of ADHD and anxiety disorders, and will discuss how an anxiety disorder comorbidity leads to diagnostic and treatment challenges in patients with ADHD, in consideration of the accumulated available knowledge. Recent Findings The presence of overlapping symptoms, changes in the diagnostic criteria, and the use of divergent diagnostic tools and informant effects can complicate the diagnosis of this comorbidity. Due to the ongoing debate about the etiology, psychopathology, and diagnostic features of the association between ADHD and anxiety disorders, choosing appropriate treatment options emerges as a challenge. A novel methodology, standardized interview tools, and new statistical analysis methods are needed to define the phenotype of this co-occurrence more clearly. It is important to uncover the developmental nature of this comorbidity with follow-up studies that may explain the etiology and underlying neurobiological basis, and ultimately lead to more effective treatment approaches.

AB  - The most common eating disorder in the elderly in both community and hospital settings is food refusal. This may lead to weight loss and malnutrition with all the adverse consequences on independence and function. The management of disorders of eating in the elderly is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, requiring the combined skills of the medical and nursing staff. The causes are often multifactorial and require careful and repeated assessment of the patient's social, psychological, and medical history. Approach to treatment involves these factors, as well as ethical and cultural considerations. Eating is the most basic biological drive for survival in nature. In human societies there are additional cultural and social aspects that may override this instinct, as in the case of hunger strikes for political motives. In the elderly, food is one of the major sources of possible pleasure and it is the challenge for health providers to try and give this enjoyment to their patients for as long as possible.

AB  - In this article, we are concerned with the role of colors in reading written texts. It has been argued that colored overlays applied above written texts positively influence both reading fluency and reading speed. These effects would be particularly evident for those individuals affected by the so called Meares-Irlen syndrome, i.e., who experience eyestrain and/or visual distortions e.g., color, shape, or movement illusions while reading. This condition would interest the 12-14% of the general population and up to the 46% of the dyslexic population. Thus, colored overlays have been largely employed as a remedy for some aspects of the difficulties in reading experienced by dyslexic individuals, as fluency and speed. Despite the wide use of colored overlays, how they exert their effects has not been made clear yet. Also, according to some researchers, the results supporting the efficacy of colored overlays as a tool for helping readers are at least controversial. Furthermore, the very nature of the Meares-Wen syndrome has been questioned. Here we provide a concise, critical review of the literature.

AB  - Researchers have argued that to understand more fully political orientation, non-reactive measures similar to those used in the broader implicit attitudes literature should be explored. Recently, the nature of the relation between explicitly and implicitly measured attitudes has been a topic of considerable discussion, with researchers stressing the importance of when explicit and implicit measures are related and when they are not. In the present research. the relation between explicit and implicit political orientation, and the potential moderating role of political sophistication was investigated. Participants (N = 116) completed an explicit measure of political orientation, a liberal-conservative Implicit Association Test (IAT), and a test of political knowledge. Results showed that explicit and implicit political orientation scores were moderately correlated (r = .48) with each other. Moreover, results from regression analyses showed that the association between explicit and implicit political orientation was moderated by political knowledge scores, such that the positive association was stronger among participants with a greater knowledge of politics.

AB  - The development of children with disabilities and the adaptation of their families present an array of challenges to researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and parents. For some, the diverse developmental pathways followed by children with disabilities provide important opportunities to expand our knowledge about human variation. For others, the diagnosis of an impairment calls for the formulation of an intervention strategy to promote more positive outcomes. Central to both is the need for greater understanding of how children with disabilities and their families change over time, and why some do better than others. The Early Intervention Collaborative Study (EICS) was initiated in 1985 to address these complex and compelling issues.
   The EICS is an ongoing, nonexperimental, longitudinal investigation designed originally to address three interrelated goals: (a) to analyze individual differences in the development of children with disabilities and in the adaptation of their families over time, (b) to generate related conceptual models of child and family development that integrate research on children with and without special needs, and (c) to contribute to the knowledge base that informs social policy and the delivery of intervention services. From its onset, the design of the study has been guided by models of human development that are ecological, contextual, and transactional (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Lerner, 1996; Sameroff & Chandler, 1975) and by an interest in the concepts of vulnerability and resilience (Rutter, 2000; Werner, 2000).
   The first phase of the investigation, which was described in a previous SRCD Monograph (Shonkoff, Hauser-Cram, Krauss, & Upshur, 1992), focused on the development of 190 infants and their parents during their initial year of participation in a community-based early intervention program. The findings presented in this second Monograph were generated from the continuing sample of 183 participants who were assessed at five points in time, from their entry into an early intervention program during the infant or toddler years through the child's 10th birthday. This investigation represents the largest and longest running study of children with a range of developmental disabilities and their parents ever undertaken in the United States. The richness and the longitudinal nature of these data provide a wealth of opportunities to analyze the interactive nature of child and family adaptation and, most important, to study developmental change over time.
   The findings presented in this Monograph can be used to inform both theory and practice. In the process of bridging these two domains, the study builds on two complementary historical contexts and addresses two converging agendas for the future.

AB  - The major genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the lipid binding and transporting carrier protein apolipoprotein E, epsilon 4 allele (ApoE4). One of the unsolved mysteries of AD is how the presence of ApoE4 elicits this age-associated, currently incurable neurodegenerative disease. Recently, we showed that ApoE4 acts as a transcription factor and binds to the promoters of genes involved in a range of processes linked to aging and AD disease pathogenesis. These findings point to novel therapeutic strategies for AD and aging, resulting in an extension of human healthspan, the disease-free and functional period of life. Here, we review the effects and implications of the putative transcriptional role of ApoE4 and propose a model of Alzheimer's disease that focuses on the transcriptional nature of ApoE4 and its downstream effects, with the aim that this knowledge will help to define the role ApoE4 plays as a risk factor for AD, aging, and other processes such as inflammation and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - The Human Rights Review Tribunal of New Zealand recently determined that it has the power to award damages for loss of dignity in cases where the person whose rights have been breached does not have the mental capacity to understand that this is the case, or the impact of that breach on their dignity. In defining the meaning of dignity, determining how to assess its loss (by way of an objective rather than subjective test) and categorising the nature of damages for loss of dignity as vindicatory rather than compensatory, the Tribunal broke new ground. However, after analysing the Tribunal's decision, and considering relevant case law, this article concludes that the Tribunal's decision was flawed, and that the legislation only allows for the award of compensatory damages. Legislative change would be required to expand the scope of remedies available to include vindicatory damages.

AB  - We review the recent literature on cyberbullying and its effects on victimised youth, identifying key points. We conclude that cyberbullying, while following many of the underlying dynamics of more traditional forms of bullying, features some unique qualities that can both magnify the damage caused and make it more difficult to detect. These features include the pervasive, never-ending nature of cyberbullying and the ability to quickly reach large audiences. The potential for anonymity and the related distance afforded by screens and devices compared to in-person interaction allow the cruelty of cyberbullying to go unchecked. Despite the perceived anonymity of cyberbullying, cyberbullying can be perpetrated by friends, who often have intimate knowledge about the victimised youth that can be devastating when made public. Given the difficulty schools face in preventing or even detecting cyberbullying, health care providers are an important ally, due to their knowledge of the youth, the sense of trust they bring to youth, and their independence from the school setting. We conclude by calling for routine screening of bullying by health care providers who deal with paediatric populations.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) without cure remains as a serious health issue in the modern society. The major neuropathological alterations in AD are characterized by chronic neuroinflammation and neuronal loss due to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau, plaques of beta-amyloid (A beta) and various metabolic dysfunctions. Due to the multifaceted nature of AD pathology and our limited understanding on its etiology, AD is difficult to be treated with currently available pharmaceuticals. This unmet need, however, could be met with stem cell technology that can be engineered to replace neuronal loss in AD patients. Although stem cell therapy for AD is only in its development stages, it has vast potential uses ranging from replacement therapy to disease modelling and drug development. Current progress with stem cells in animal model studies offers promising results for the new prospective treatment for AD. This review will discuss the characteristics of AD, current progress in stem cell therapy and remaining challenges and promises in its development.

AB  - Background and Methods: Psychiatric diagnosis is dependent on the identification of mental symptoms. On the assumption that they are 'natural kinds', the latter are routinely entered as correlational variables in empirical research. Published work on the philosophy of psychiatry has tended to concentrate on the concept of mental disorder or on individual symptoms but has given less attention to mental symptoms as a class. This paper deals specifically with the epistemology of mental symptoms, that is, with focusing on the nature of mental symptoms as a class of 'objects' and how the clinician gets to know them. In order to do this, mental symptoms can be explored from various perspectives, namely: (i) as types of objects, (ii) as structures, (iii) as definitions, (iv) as pockets of meanings, (v) as comprising constituents, (vi) as attractors in specific dialogical contexts, etc. In this paper, on account of space constraints, we deal only with the former 4 perspectives. Results and Conclusion: Our analysis shows mental symptoms to be unstable constructs with implications for both correlational research and further theoretical exploration. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

AB  - Chromium (Cr) is the seventh most abundant chemical element in the Earth's crust, and Cr(III) and Cr(VI) are common stable valence states of Cr. Several Cr-containing substances, such as FeOCr2O3 and stainless-steel products, exist in nature and in life. However, Cr(VI) is toxic to soil, microorganisms, and plants and poses a serious threat to human health through direct and indirect exposure. By collecting published journal literature, we found that Cr(VI) can cause acute and chronic toxicity in organisms and has carcinogenic effects, and the mechanisms causing these toxicity include endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy and apoptosis. However, the relationship between these mechanisms remains unclear. Many methods have been researched to purify chromium, but each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, this review summarizes the hazards of chromium and the mechanisms of chromium toxicity after entering cells and provides a number of methods for chromium contamination management, providing a direction for the next step in chromium toxicology and contamination decontamination research.

AB  - Personality is typically defined as the consistent set of traits, attitudes, emotions, and behaviors that people have. For several decades, a majority of researchers have tacitly agreed that the gold standard for measuring personality was with self-report questionnaires. Surveys are fast, inexpensive, and display beautiful psychometric properties. A considerable problem with this method, however, is that self-reports reflect only one aspect of personality - people's explicit theories of what they think they are like. We propose a complementary model that draws on a big data solution: the analysis of the words people use. Language use is relatively reliable over time, internally consistent, and differs considerably between people. Language-based measures of personality can be useful for capturing/modeling lower-level personality processes that are more closely associated with important objective behavioral outcomes than traditional personality measures. Additionally, the increasing availability of language data and advances in both statistical methods and technological power are rapidly creating new opportunities for the study of personality at 'big data' scale. Such opportunities allow researchers to not only better understand the fundamental nature of personality, but at a scale never before imagined in psychological research.

AB  - Stroke is one of the major healthcare challenges prevailing across the globe due to its significant rate of mortality and morbidity. Stroke is multifactorial in nature and involves several cellular and molecular signaling cascades that make the pathogenesis complex and treatment difficult. For a deeper understanding of the diverse pathological mechanisms and molecular & cellular cascades during stroke, animal modeling serves as a reliable and an effective tool. This also helps to develop and critically analyse various neuroprotective strategies for the mitigation of this devastating disease. Animal modeling for stroke has been revolutionized with the development of newer and more relevant models or approaches that mimic the clinical setting of stroke to a greater extent. This review analyses experimental models of stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and their reliability in stroke situation. Besides this, the review also stresses upon the use of various preclinical models to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms that operate during stroke and to elucidate new, safe and effective neuroprotective agents to combat this life threatening healthcare concern.

AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD), molecular changes are observed not only in patients' neurons but also in peripheral cells, such as blood lymphocytes. These include changes in the level of oxidative stress markers, mitochondria impairment, and aberrant cell cycle regulation in AD blood lymphocytes. While the concepts of early causes of AD are currently highly controversial, these findings provide support for the cell cycle hypothesis of AD pathomechanism and emphasize the systemic nature of the disease. Moreover, because of difficulties in studying dynamic processes in the human brain, lymphocytes seem to be useful for readout of AD molecular mechanisms. In addition, lymphocytes as easily accessible human cells have potential diagnostic value. We summarize current perspectives for the development of new therapeutic strategies based on oxidative stress and cell cycle dysregulation in AD, and for diagnostic methodologies involving new markers in AD lymphocytes.

AB  - Plastic based products are ubiquitous due to their tremendous utility in our daily lives. However, the limited biodegradable nature of plastics has recently raised pollution concerns globally, especially micro- and nanoplastics. These anthropogenic pollutants are eithermanufactured specifically in the small size range for various commercial applications or formed due to fragmentation of macro plastics in the environment. Micro- and nanoplastics are currently widespread in the oceans, freshwater bodies, land and even present in our food. The biological effects ofmicro- and nanoplastics on aquatic organisms arewell documented but their impacts onmammalian system have not been rigorously investigated. This review discusses the potential routes of exposure to micro- and nanoplastics, biological effects of these particles inmammalian cells, factors influencing toxicity, and the probable mechanisms of cytotoxicity. In general, small size, positive charge, high dose, and presence of toxic additives or pollutants in themicro/nanoplastics appear to induce cellular toxicity through oxidative stress, membrane damage, immune response and genotoxicity. Understanding the cellular fate and toxicity of these materialsmay help extrapolate risks to mammals. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An integrative framework is proposed for understanding bow multiple biological and psychological systems are regulated in the context of adult attachment relationships, dysregulated by separation and loss experiences, and, potentially, re-regulated through individual recovery efforts. Evidence is reviewed for a coregulatory model of normative attachment, defined as a pattern of interwoven physiology between romantic partners that results from the conditioning of biological reward systems and the emergence of felt security within adult pair bonds. The loss of coregulation can portend a state of biobehavioral dysregulation, ranging from diffuse psychophysiological arousal and disorganization to a full-blown (and highly organized) stress response. The major task for successful recovery is adopting a self-regulatory strategy that attenuates the dysregulating effects of the attachment disruption. Research evidence is reviewed across multiple levels of analysis, and the article concludes with a series of testable research questions on the interconnected nature of attachment, loss, and recovery processes.

AB  - Purpose of review
   PWS is a severe developmental disability for which there is no known treatment. The oxytocin system is currently a primary target for intervention. The aim of this article is to review the evidence for the efficacy of intranasal oxytocin in PWS.
   Recent findings
   To date, there have been five clinical trials of oxytocin in PWS. Four of these studies reported that oxytocin improved behaviors. However, each of these studies suffered important limitations that likely influenced the findings. For example, one study did not include a control group. Another study did not statistically analyze the effects of oxytocin on behavior. The final two studies used study-specific measures for which psychometric properties have not been assessed.
   Summary
   Because of these limitations, the most appropriate conclusion to draw from the existing studies is that there is currently no convincing evidence that intranasal oxytocin improves symptoms of PWS. However, this does not mean that oxytocin is not involved in PWS. Rather, it suggests that further work is needed to understand the nature of the PWS oxytocin abnormality.

AB  - The goal of this article is to delineate training implications regarding harmful effects associated with psychotherapy. The authors strongly recommend that trainees be made aware of (and encouraged to examine carefully) the potentially harmful treatments that have been recently identified (Lilienfeld, 2007). Consistent with a broad perspective on evidence-based practice, it is also argued that additional guidelines for the prevention and repair of harmful impacts can be derived from psychotherapy research on process (technique and relationship) and participant (client and therapist) variables. For example, rigid adherence to the application of psychotherapy techniques can be a potentially harmful therapist behavior that necessitates careful training on the nature and flexible use of interventions. Furthermore, the authors suggest that trainers and supervisors tentatively consider training implications linked to clinical observations and theoretical assertions, such as the premature use of clinical interpretations, with the assumption that more confidence in such therapeutic guidelines can be gained when they are supported by multiple knowledge sources (empirical, clinical, conceptual). Finally, training implications related to the monitoring of harmful effects in terms of treatment outcome and process are demarcated.

AB  - Self-motion perception is a key element guiding pilots' behavior. Its importance is mostly revealed when impaired, leading in most cases to spatial disorientation which is still today a major factor of accidents occurrence. Self-motion perception is known as mainly based on visuo-vestibular integration and can be modulated by the physical properties of the environment with which humans interact. For instance, several studies have shown that the respective weight of visual and vestibular information depends on their reliability. More recently, it has been suggested that the internal state of an operator can also modulate multisensory integration. Interestingly, the systems' automation can interfere with this internal state through the loss of the intentional nature of movements (i.e., loss of agency) and the modulation of associated predictive mechanisms. In this context, one of the new challenges is to better understand the relationship between automation and self-motion perception. The present review explains how linking the concepts of agency and self-motion is a first approach to address this issue.

AB  - Our research team was asked to consider the relationship of the neuroscience of sensorimotor control to the language of emotions and feelings. Actions are the principal means for the communication of emotions and feelings in both humans and other animals, and the allostatic mechanisms controlling action also apply to the regulation of emotional states by the self and others. We consider how motor control of hierarchically organised, feedback-based, goal-directed action has evolved in humans, within a context of consciousness, appraisal and cultural learning, to serve emotions and feelings. In our linguistic analysis, we found that many emotion and feelings words could be assigned to stages in the sensorimotor learning process, but the assignment was often arbitrary. The embodied nature of emotional communication means that action words are frequently used, but that the meanings or senses of the word depend on its contextual use, just as the relationship of an action to an emotion is also contextually dependent.

AB  - In recent year, animal models have been growingly used to increase our knowledge about the toxicity of PM and underlying mechanisms leading to cardiovascular diseases. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge and findings of studies investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in rats and mice. The six main areas covered in this review include: I) nature of particulate matter and toxicity mechanisms, II) systemic inflammation, III) heart rate and heart rate variability, IV) histopathological effects, V) atherosclerosis, VI) thrombosis, and VI) myocardial infarction. This review showed that animal model studies have been successful to bring new insights into the mechanisms underlying PM-induced cardiovascular diseases. However, there are some areas that the exact mechanisms are still unclear. In conclusion, investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in vivo or interpreting the results should attempt to justify the role of different PM compositions, which may vastly affect the overall cytotoxicity of particles.

AB  - Many types of social attachments can be observed in nature. We discuss the neurobiology of two types (1) intraspecific (with a partner) and (2) parental (with the offspring). Stimuli related to copulation facilitate the first, whereas pregnancy, parturition and lactation facilitate the second. Both types develop as consequence of cohabitation. These events seem to stimulate similar neural pathways that increase (1) social recognition, (2) motivation, reward; and (3) decrease fear/anxiety. Subregions of the amygdala and cortex facilitate social recognition and also disinhibition to decrease rejection responses. The interrelationship between MeA, BNST, LS may mediate the activation of NAcc via the mPOA to increase motivation and reward. Cortical areas such as the ACC discriminate between stimuli. The interaction between OT and D2-type receptors in NAcc shell facilitates intraspecific attachment, but D1-type appears to facilitate parental attachment. This difference may be important for maternal females to direct their attention, motivation and expression of attachment toward the appropriate target. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evolutionary psychologists explore the adaptive function of traits and behaviors that characterize modern Homo sapiens. However, evolutionary psychologists have yet to incorporate the phylogenetic relationship between modern Homo sapiens and humans' hominid and pongid relatives (both living and extinct) into their theorizing. By considering the specific timing of evolutionary events and the role of evolutionary constraint, researchers using the phylogenetic approach can generate new predictions regarding mating phenomena and derive new explanations for existing evolutionary psychological findings. Especially useful is the concept of the adaptive workaround-an adaptation that manages the maladaptive elements of a pre-existing evolutionary constraint. The current review organizes 7 features of human mating into their phylogenetic context and presents evidence that 2 adaptive workarounds played a critical role as Homo sapiens's mating psychology evolved. These adaptive workarounds function in part to mute or refocus the effects of older, previously evolved adaptations and highlight the layered nature of humans' mating psychology.

KW  - LIF SINGLE-CRYSTALS

AB  - The theoretical and experimental studies of the dislocation nature at the initial stage of plastic deformation - the yield drop and the incubation period - are reviewed. The role of dislocations in the loss of plastic stability and the localization of deformations in high-temperature tests at (epsilon over dot) = const and sigma = const is analyzed. It is established that the appearance of the localized mode corresponds to the formation of the yield drop on sigma(epsilon) curves and the incubation period on creep curves epsilon(t). The use of the macroscopic parameters of high-temperature stress-strain curves and the analysis of the equation (epsilon over dot) = b rho v show that nucleation and the development of shear at high temperatures are determined by the dynamical properties of dislocations. Deformation localization is provided by the conservation, at all the subsequent stages of deformation, of the inhomogeneities in the glide distribution formed at the initial stages. The mechanism responsible for deformation localization at high temperatures reduces to the removal of edge dipoles (main elements providing work hardening of the material with glide bands by dislocation climb and annihilation.

AB  - Prosocial behavior involves attempting to improve others' welfare and plays a central role in cooperative social relationships. Among the manifold processes that contribute to prosocial development is the quality of children's attachment to their caregivers. Often, researchers have investigated the link between secure attachment and broad indices of prosociality. Recent theory and research, however, suggest that children's prosocial behavior is multifaceted, with distinct correlates and developmental trajectories characterizing specific prosocial behaviors. We offer a theoretical model of the role of parent-child attachment in the development of prosocial behavior, first broadly, and then with regard to comforting, sharing, and helping, specifically. Further, we review the empirical work on this topic from infancy through adolescence. Overall, evidence supports an association between secure attachment and prosociality, broadly defined, but results vary across comforting, sharing, and helping. We discuss potential explanations for the findings and outline directions for future research examining the role of attachment in shaping the diversity of prosocial behaviors across development.

AB  - We draw upon the Associative Network model of memory, as well as the principles of encoding-retrieval specificity, and cue distinctiveness, to argue that self-generated cue mnemonics offer an intuitive means of facilitating reliable recall of personally experienced events. The use of a self-generated cue mnemonic allows for the spreading activation nature of memory, whilst also presenting an opportunity to capitalize upon cue distinctiveness. Here, we present the theoretical rationale behind the use of this technique, and highlight the distinction between a self-generated cue and a self-referent cue in autobiographical memory research. We contrast this mnemonic with a similar retrieval technique, Mental Reinstatement of Context, which is recognized as the most effective mnemonic component of the Cognitive Interview. Mental Reinstatement of Context is based upon the principle of encoding-retrieval specificity, whereby the overlap between encoded information and retrieval cue predicts the likelihood of accurate recall. However, it does not incorporate the potential additional benefit of self-generated retrieval cues.

AB  - Humans and other animals are able not only to coordinate their actions with their current sensorimotor state, but also to imagine, plan and act in view of the future, and to realize distal goals. In this paper we discuss whether or not their future-oriented conducts imply (future-oriented) representations. We illustrate the role played by anticipatory mechanisms in natural and artificial agents, and we propose a notion of representation that is grounded in the agent's predictive capabilities. Therefore, we argue that the ability that characterizes and defines a true cognitive mind, as opposed to a merely adaptive system, is that of building representations of the non-existent, of what is not currently (yet) true or perceivable, of what is desired. A real mental activity begins when the organism is able to endogenously (i.e. not as the consequence of current perceptual stimuli) produce an internal representation of the world in order to select and guide its conduct goal-directed: the mind serves to coordinate with the future.

AB  - Stressors play a defining role in youth development and, in particular, in adolescent psychological and behavioral adaptation. However, the nature of stressors experienced during adolescence has not been reviewed or investigated comprehensively. To bridge this gap, this investigation conducted a systematic review of adolescent stressors reported in the literature (Study 1, N = 18 studies) and a content analysis of self-reported stressors (Study 2, N = 1,568 adolescents, Mean age = 15.5 years, 41.5% female adolescents). The results converged in the identification of negative stressors (i.e., health issues, parental conflicts, issues with parents, teachers, peers or friends, romantic issues, concerns about the future and school) and positive stressors (i.e., leisure time, finding oneself, school or other accomplishments, social acquisitions, receiving help, romance and friendship, birth and good time in the family), which are highly occurring and highly intense among adolescents. Overall, these findings can guide researchers and practitioners towards developing efficient stressors measures, integrative theories on adolescent stress and development, as well as effective interventions targeting specific stress processes in the domains of education, criminology and psychopathology.

AB  - Math anxiety is a prevalent disorder which affects many people worldwide. Here, we draw together ample evidence to suggest a dynamic developmental bio-psychosocial model. The model highlights the complex pathways towards the development of math anxiety, with a focus on dynamism. That is, math anxiety is viewed here as a dynamic interplay between environmental (parenting style, as well as social style including teachers' attitude, instruction strategies and wider social effects) and intrinsic factors (i.e., neuro-cognitive and genetic predispositions, including brain malfunctions, heritability, predisposition towards general anxiety) and basic numerical cognition and affective factors. The model predicts that the dynamic interplay between these factors can either prevent or promote math anxiety's effects on the development of heterogeneous symptoms. Considering the universal nature of math anxiety, a systematic description of the vulnerability factors that contribute to the development of math anxiety is vital. Such information may be of particular value in informing the design of preventive interventions as well as of specific intervention tools.

AB  - Repeated exposure to a wide range of stressors differing in nature and intensity results in a reduced response of prototypical stress markers (i.e. plasma levels of ACTH and adrenaline) after an acute challenge with the same (homotypic) stressor. This reduction has been considered to be a habituation-like phenomenon. However, direct experimental evidence for this assumption is scarce. In the present work we demonstrate in adult male rats that adaptation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to repeated stress does not follow some of the critical rules of habituation. Briefly, adaptation was stronger and faster with more severe stressors, maximally observed even with a single exposure to severe stressors, extremely long-lasting, negatively related to the interval between the exposures and positively related to the length of daily exposure. We offer a new theoretical view to explain adaptation to daily repeated stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in injury and recovery in ischemic injury. They are proteolytic enzymes that degrade all components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). They are secreted in a latent form, protecting the cell from damage, but once activated induce injury prior to rapid inactivation by four tissue inhibitors to metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Normally the constitutive enzymes, MMP-2 and membrane type MMP (MMP-14), are activated in a spatially specific manner and act close to the site of activation, while the inducible enzymes, MMP-3 and MMP-9, become active through the action of free radicals and other enzymes during neuroinflammation. Because of the complex nature of the interactions with tissues during development, injury and repair, the MMPs have multiple roles, participating in the injury process in the early stages and contributing to recovery during the later stages. This dual role complicates the planning of treatment strategies.

AB  - Development of pharmacotherapy to reduce relapse rates is one of the biggest challenges in drug addiction research. The enduring nature of relapse suggests that it is maintained by long-lasting molecular and cellular adaptations in the neuronal circuitry that mediates learning and processing of motivationally relevant stimuli. Studies employing the reinstatement model of drug relapse in rodents point to an important role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), with distinct contributions of the dorsal and ventral regions of the mPFC to drug-, stress- and cue-induced drug seeking. Whereas drug-induced neuroadaptations in the dorsal mPFC function to enhance excitatory output and drive expression of drug seeking, recent evidence suggests that plasticity in the ventral mPFC leads to reduced glutamatergic transmission in this region, thereby impairing response inhibition upon exposure to drug-conditioned stimuli. Treatments aimed at restoring drug-induced neuroadaptations in the mPFC may help to reduce cue-reactivity and relapse susceptibility. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite its chequered history, Kahlbaum's 1874 description of catatonia (tension insanity) and its categorization as a clinical illness is in outline still valid. Kahlbaum also acknowledged the existence of catatonia in children. Corresponding case studies have also been analyzed. The originators and disciples of the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard school proved catatonia in early childhood as a discrete entity with specific psychopathology. This does not mean that catatonic symptoms do not occur in other illnesses and in particular in organic psychoses. These are, however, of a totally different nature. Autism, as first described in connection with schizophrenic negativism by Bleuler in 1910, is one of the key symptoms of schizophrenia. As identified by Kanner in 1943, abnormal social interaction and communication, together with retarded development, are the main characteristics of autism in early childhood. Asperger's concept of autistic disorder (1944), although based on psychopathological theory, did not include retardation in development as an aspect. Consequently, autistic behavior can occur in a variety of mental disorders. Research into possible etiological and pathogenetic factors has been undertaken, but no clear link found as yet.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination of soil has become a serious global issue because of their persistence in the environment and the non-biodegradable nature leading to their accumulation to toxic levels. In order to achieve early warning and prevent soil quality from deteriorating, it is necessary to select suitable indices to diagnose heavy metal pollution. Microbiological indices for monitoring soil pollution by heavy metals are gaining attention. However, the related researches are scattered, and critical review is imperative. This review is mainly to provide readers with an in-depth understanding of the merits and limitations of microbiological indices for heavy metals contaminated and remediated soils. Microbiological indicators include microbial abundance, community diversity and structure, functional activity. The changes of different microbiological indices and the mechanism of microbial response to heavy metal stress in soils are comprehensively summarized. Furthermore, research gaps and future directions of the microbial ecotoxicological diagnosis of soil contamination by heavy metals are also proposed and discussed.

AB  - SPAARS (Schematic, Propositional, Analogical and Associative Representational Systems) is the integrated cognitive model of emotion proposed by Power & Dalgleish (1997). In SPAARS, emotions are described as appraisal based against an individual's goals and this makes the theory functional in nature. The theory proposes two routes for the generation of emotions, namely a direct one in which the appraisals have become automatized and the other where these are still not automatized. It provides a useful approach within which both basic and complex emotions can readily be understood. The theory can also be applied for explaining the disorders of emotion and it can be used to generate novel therapeutic interventions for them. In the current review, the SPAARS approach in conjunction with the theory proposed by Nigg and Casey (2005) has been applied for understanding ADHD. According to Nigg & Casey, affective deficits in ADHD could be due to problems with either approach or avoidance emotions. These problems have been explained with the help of appraisals and reinforcement learning within the SPAARS framework. Interventions that follow logically from the SPAARS framework have also been suggested.

Genetic factors involve variation in the DNA sequences of protein-coding genes, which directly contribute to phenotypic traits, and variation in noncoding sequences, which comprise 98% of the genome and contain DNA elements known to play a role in regulating gene expression. The epigenome refers to the chemical modifications on both DNA and the structural proteins that package DNA into the nucleus, which together regulate gene expression in specific cell types, conditions, and developmental stages. The dynamic nature of the epigenome makes it an ideal tool to investigate the relationship between inherited genetic mutations associated with schizophrenia and altered gene regulation throughout the course of brain development. In this review, we focus on the current understanding of the role of epigenetic marks and their three-dimensional nuclear organization in the developmental trajectory of distinct brain cell types to decipher the complex gene regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in schizophrenia.

AB  - Though much progress has been made in recent years towards understanding the function and physiology of primary cilia, they remain a somewhat elusive organelle. Some studies have explored the role of primary cilia in the developing nervous system, and their dysfunction has been linked with several neurosensory deficits. Yet, very little has been written on their potential role in psychiatric disorders. This article provides an overview of some of the functions of primary cilia in signalling pathways, and demonstrates that they are a worthy candidate in psychiatric research. The links between primary cilia and major mental illness have been demonstrated to exist at several levels, spanning genetics, signalling pathways, and pharmacology as well as cell division and migration. The primary focus of this review is on the sensory role of the primary cilium and the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of psychiatric disease. As such, the primary cilium is demonstrated to be a key link between the cellular environment and cell behaviour, and hence of key importance in the considerations of the nature and nurture debate in psychiatric research.

AB  - To create new varieties resistant to biotic and abiotic stress factors that possess high productivity and improved fruit quality, breeders require modern breeding methods and techniques. Double haploid (DH) lines are an invaluable breeding element due to their guaranteed, completely homozygous nature. One of the fastest methods for obtaining DH lines is anther culture. Microspore embryogenesis provides considerable opportunities in the areas of breeding and biotechnology and represents a model system for fundamental biological research. The effectiveness of pepper anther culture is still low, which affects the application of DH lines in breeding programs. A detailed study of the anther culture process will produce a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the switch from gametophyte to sporophyte during embryo development. In this respect, the genes expressed during microspore embryogenesis and those that control the cellular response to stress have a key role. This review provides information about the control of embryo formation together with the features of practical application of pepper anther culture.

AB  - Heart rate variability (H RV) refers to various methods of assessing the beat-to-beat variation in the heart over time, in order to draw inference on the outflow of the autonomic nervous system. Easy access to measuring HRV has led to a plethora of studies within emotion science and psychology assessing autonomic regulation, but significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of H RV. Firstly, both breathing and blood pressure regulation have their own relationship to social, emotional, and cognitive experiments if this is the case are we observing heart rate (HR) changes as a consequence of breathing changes? Secondly, experiments often have poor internal and external controls. In this review we highlight the interrelationships between HR and respiration, as well as presenting recommendations for researchers to use when collecting data for HRV assessment. Namely, we highlight the superior utility of within-subjects designs along with the importance of establishing an appropriate baseline and monitoring respiration.

AB  - Although it is now widely recognised that social cognitive difficulties are often evident following stroke, important questions remain about the nature and magnitude of these difficulties, as well as the factors that determine the magnitude of this impairment. A meta-analysis of 58 datasets involving 2567 participants (937 with stroke, 1630 non-clinical controls) was therefore conducted. The results indicated that three of the four core domains of social cognitive function were significantly disrupted in people with stroke. Specifically, while the effect size for affective empathy failed to attain significance (r = -.33), moderate to large deficits were identified for theory of mind (r = -.44), social perception (r = -.55), and social behaviour (r = -.53). These deficits were robust across both left and right lateralized lesions, across social cognitive assessments that differed in their broader cognitive demands, as well as in tasks that varied in their modality of presentation. These data are discussed in the context of broader neuropsychological models of social cognitive function.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) apps are becoming much more widely available. As more patients learn about and download apps, clinicians are sure to face more questions about the role these apps can play in treatment. Clinicians thus need to familiarize themselves with the clinical and legal risks that apps may introduce. Regulatory rules and organizations that oversee the safety and efficacy of mHealth apps are currently fragmentary in nature and clinicians should pay special attention to categories of apps which are currently exempt from significant regulation. Uniform HIPAA protection does not apply to personal health data that are shared with apps in many contexts which creates a number of clinically relevant privacy and security concerns. Clinicians should also consider several relatively novel potential adverse clinical outcomes and liability concerns that may be relevant to specific categories of apps, including apps that target (i) medication adherence, (ii) collection of self-reported data, (iii) collection of passive data, and (iv) generation of treatment recommendations for psychotherapeutic and behavioral interventions. Considering these potential pitfalls (and disclosing them to patients as a part of obtaining informed consent) is necessary as clinicians consider incorporating apps into treatment.

AB  - Migraine is one of the most common forms of primary headaches; it affects nearly 10% of the population in developed countries. All major CNS neurotransmitter systems are implicated in migraine pathogenesis, indicating the polyneurochemical nature of the nosology. This review is focused on the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its receptors in the neurobiology of migraine. The report describes evidence for the existence of a cause-effect relationship between impaired GABA metabolism and development of the disease. It summarizes data on the distribution of GABA-A and GABA-B receptors in the trigeminovascular system and on the contribution of GABA to the modulation of nociceptive neurotransmission in the trigemino-thalamo-cortical pathway. As well, it provides detailed information on the mechanisms that underlie GABA-ergic inhibition at the peripheral, spinal, and suprasegmental levels. In the end, we discuss the pharmacodynamics of some GABA-positive drugs that are used for prophylactic and acute treatments of migraine, as well as other primary headaches.

AB  - This paper presents an integrative approach to understanding of the inner experience of suicidal persons in terms of hemispheric asymmetry, The right hemisphere is involved in formation of polysemantic context. Polysemantic context is determined by multiple interconnections among its elements, while each concrete element bears the stamp of the whole context. Left hemisphere functioning leads to formation of monosemantic context. It is suggested that due to functional insufficiency of the right hemisphere the suicidal person demonstrates a compensatory shift to left hemisphere functioning. This shift manifests itself in reversed asymmetry of neurotransmitters, tendency to dissociation, alienated and negative perception of the body, lower sensitivity to pain, disintegration of self-representation, cognitive constriction, overly general nature of personal memories, difficulties in affect regulation as well as such personality traits as low openness to experience and personal constriction. This hypothesis raises a number of suggestions for future research. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exploring EEG alpha oscillations has generated considerable interest, in particular with regards to the role they play in cognitive, psychomotor, psycho-emotional and physiological aspects of human life. However, there is no clearly agreed upon definition of what constitutes 'alpha activity' or which of the many indices should be used to characterize it.
   To address these issues this review attempts to delineate EEG alpha-activity, its physical, molecular and morphological nature, and examine the following indices: (1) the individual alpha peak frequency; (2) activation magnitude, as measured by alpha amplitude suppression across the individual alpha bandwidth in response to eyes opening, and (3) alpha "auto-rhythmicity" indices: which include intra-spindle amplitude variability, spindle length and steepness.
   Throughout, the article offers a number of suggestions regarding the mechanism(s) of alpha activity related to inter and intra-individual variability. In addition, it provides some insights into the various psychophysiological indices of alpha activity and highlights their role in optimal functioning and behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although millions of Americans take psychoactive medicines (e.g. Prozac and Ritalin), few social scientists believe biological theories and findings should be integrated with research on human behavior. Four topics illustrate current studies linking politics and the life sciences: (a) Developments in genetics and medicine indicate that governmental policies have greatly underrated the dangers posed by radiation and the social transformations that will result from DNA sequencing. (b) Research on brain structures and neurochemistry shows how toxic chemicals undermine normal emotions and behavior. Heavy metal burdens are higher in violent criminals, and exposure to these toxins is significantly correlated with rates of violence (controlling for socioeconomic, ethnic, and demographic factors). (c) An untested chemical used to treat water supplied to 140 million Americans significantly increases both odds of dangerous lead uptake and behavioral dysfunctions in children and adults. (d) The complexity of gene-environment interactions challenges accepted theories of gender, sociopolitical inequalities, ethnocentrism, and history. Such research in biopolitics can illuminate policy controversies in education, substance abuse, and crime.

AB  - Several epidemiological and experimental studies have demonstrated that many human diseases are not only caused by specific genetic and environmental factors but also by gene-environment interactions. Although it has been widely reported that genetic polymorphisms play a critical role in human susceptibility to cancer and other chronic disease conditions, many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are caused by somatic mutations resulting from human exposure to environmental stressors. Scientific evidence suggests that the etiology of many chronic illnesses is caused by the joint effect between genetics and the environment. Research has also pointed out that the interactions of environmental factors with specific allelic variants highly modulate the susceptibility to diseases. Hence, many scientific discoveries on gene-environment interactions have elucidated the impact of their combined effect on the incidence and/or prevalence rate of human diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of the nature of gene-environment interactions, and discuss their role in human cancers, with special emphases on lung, colorectal, bladder, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers.

AB  - Due to its ego-syntonic nature, anorexia nervosa (AN) is considered one of the most difficult mental disorders to treat. Patients are often reluctant to accept treatment, while a large group of those who receive therapy have a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, despite suffering from physical and psychosocial impairment, patients with AN are often reluctant to receive any intervention whatsoever. Recent years have seen the development of many new treatment methods for eating disorders in general, and AN in particular. Therapy of anorexia nervosa requires a multidisciplinary approach based on the "cornerstone" of psychotherapy. Despite the growing body of studies and publications concerning psychological treatment of AN, there is still a dearth of high-quality randomized controlled trials which could serve as the basis for developing guidelines in this area. This paper offers a compendium of knowledge on treatment standards recommended for AN, as well as on psychotherapeutic paradigms and programs. Most of the therapies presented herein have been empirically proven effective. Therefore, the paper may facilitate the selection of the most appropriate treatment choices, whether in outpatient or inpatient settings.

AB  - In the past decade, there has been renewed interest in immune/inflammatory changes and their associated oxidative/nitrosative consequences as key pathophysiological mechanisms in schizophrenia and related disorders. Both brain cell components (microglia, astrocytes, and neurons) and peripheral immune cells have been implicated in inflammation and the resulting oxidative/nitrosative stress (O&NS) in schizophrenia. Furthermore, down-regulation of endogenous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms has been identified in biological samples from patients, although the degree and progression of the inflammatory process and the nature of its self-regulatory mechanisms vary from early onset to full-blown disease. This review focuses on the interactions between inflammation and O&NS, their damaging consequences for brain cells in schizophrenia, the possible origins of inflammation and increased O&NS in the disorder, and current pharmacological strategies to deal with these processes (mainly treatments with anti-inflammatory or antioxidant drugs as add-ons to antipsychotics).

AB  - The discovery that expansion of unstable repeats can cause a variety of neurological disorders has changed the landscape of disease-oriented research for several forms of mental retardation, Huntington disease, inherited ataxias, and muscular dystrophy. The dynamic nature of these mutations provided an explanation for the variable phenotype expressivity within a family. Beyond diagnosis and genetic counseling, the benefits from studying these disorders have been noted in both neurobiology and cell biology. Examples include insight about the role of translational control in synaptic plasticity, the role of RNA processing in the integrity of muscle and neuronal function, the importance of Fe-S-containing enzymes for cellular energy, and the dramatic effects of altering protein conformations on neuronal function and survival. It is exciting that within a span of 15 years, pathogenesis studies of this class of disorders are beginning to reveal pathways that are potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - In this paper, it is examined how neuroscience can help to understand the nature of volition by addressing the question whether volitions can be localized in the brain. Volitions, as acts of the will, are special mental events or activities by which an agent consciously and actively exercises her agency to voluntarily direct her thoughts and actions. If we can pinpoint when and where volitional events or activities occur in the brain and find out their neural underpinnings, this can substantively aid to demystify the concept of volition. After first discussing some methodological issues regarding whether it is possible to locate volition in the brain, various approaches by which neuroscientists and psychologists explore the neural correlates and substrates of volition are examined. Although different psychological conceptualizations of volition shape different perspectives toward understanding the functions of volition, the explorations of the neural basis of volition converge on certain common brain areas and structures. A unifying conception of volition that helps to make better sense of recent empirical findings is then suggested. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Suicidal behavior and alcohol use are major public health concerns in the United States; however the association between these behaviors has received relatively little empirical attention. The relative lack of research in this area may be due in part to the absence of theory explaining the alcohol use-suicidality link in the general adult population. The present article expands upon Conner, McCloskey, and Duberstein's (2008) model of suicide in individuals with alcoholism and proposes a theoretical framework that can be used to explain why a range of adult alcohol users may engage in suicidal behaviors. Guided by this model, we review and evaluate the evidence on the associations among several constructs that may contribute to suicidal behaviors in adult alcohol consumers. The current framework should inform future research and facilitate further empirical analyses on the interactive effects among risk factors that may contribute to suicidal behaviors. Once the nature of these associations is better understood among alcohol using adults, more effective suicide prevention programs may be designed and implemented.

AB  - Deficits in interpersonal and social functioning are well established in females with Anorexia Nervosa (AN), and are thought to be key features involved in the onset and maintenance of the disease. Growing literature suggests these may be attributed to poor social cognitive processes. This systematic review evaluates whether differences in social cognition exist in adult females with AN. A total of 32 studies that compared females with AN against a healthy control group using social cognitive measures and/or questionnaires were analysed. The majority of studies were deemed to have a low or moderate risk of bias. Overall, empathy appears to be intact in AN, however greater emotion regulation difficulties, elevated alexithymia and reduced emotional awareness are evident in AN. Findings relating to emotion recognition and emotional Theory of Mind were inconsistent. The nature of the task appeared to influence the domains of cognitive ToM and social perception, warranting further research. These findings are discussed within the broader context of social cognitive models and AN rehabilitation.

AB  - Autophagy is a highly regulated process in which excessive cytoplasmic materials are captured and degraded during deprivation conditions. The unique nature of autophagy that clears invasive microorganisms has made it an important cellular defense mechanism in a variety of clinical situations. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that autophagy is extensively involved in the pathology of HIV-1. To ensure survival of the virus, HIV-1 viral proteins modulate and utilize the autophagy pathway so that biosynthesis of the virus is maximized. At the same time, the abuse of illicit drugs such as methamphetamine, cocaine, morphine, and alcohol is thought to be a significant risk factor for the acquirement and progression of HIV-1. During drug-induced toxicity, autophagic activity has been proved to be altered in various cell types. Here, we review the current literature on the interaction between autophagy, HIV-1, and drug abuse and discuss the complex role of autophagy during HIV-1 pathogenesis in co-exposure to illicit drugs.

AB  - While behavioural difficulties in facial emotion recognition (PER) have been observed in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), behavioural studies alone are not suited to elucidate the specific nature of FER challenges in ASD. Eye tracking (ET) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide insights in to the attentional and neurological correlates of performance, and may therefore provide insight in to the mechanisms underpinning FER in ASD. Given that these processes develop over the course of the developmental trajectory, there is a need to synthesise findings in regard to the developmental stages to determine how the maturation of these systems may impact FER in ASD. We conducted a systematic review of fifty-four studies investigating ET or EEG meeting inclusion criteria. Findings indicate divergence of visual processing pathways in individuals with ASD. Altered function of the social brain in ASD impacts the processing of facial emotion across the developmental trajectory, resulting in observable differences in ET and EEG outcomes.

AB  - In spite of the increasing number of studies on insight in psychiatry and also in neurology and psychology, its nature is still elusive. It encompasses at least three fundamental characteristics: the awareness of suffering from an illness, an understanding of the cause and source of this suffering, and an acknowledgment of the need for treatment. As such, insight is fundamental for patients' management, prognosis, and treatment. Not surprisingly, the majority of available data, which have been gathered on schizophrenia, show a relationship between low insight and poorer outcomes. For mood disorders, however, insight is associated with less positive results. For other psychiatric disorders, insight has rarely been investigated. In neurology, the impaired ability to recognize the presence of sensory, perceptual, motor, affective, or cognitive functioning-referred to as anosognosia-has been related to damage of specific brain regions. This article provides a comprehensive review of insight in different psychiatric and neurological disorders, with a special focus on brain areas and neurotransmitters that serve as the substrate for this complex phenomenon.

AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of the fronto temporal lobes and abnormal protein inclusions. It exhibits a broad clinicopathological spectrum and has been linked to mutations in seven different genes. We will provide a picture, which connects the products of these genes, albeit diverse in nature and function, in a network. Despite the paucity of information available for some of these genes, we believe that RNA processing and post transcriptional regulation of gene expression might constitute a common theme in the network. Recent studies have unraveled the role of mutations affecting the functions of RNA binding proteins and regulation of microRNAs. This review will combine all the recent findings on genes involved in the pathogenesis of FTD, highlighting the importance of a common network of interactions in order to study and decipher the heterogeneous clinical manifestations associated with FTD. This approach could be helpful for the research of potential therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common psychiatric disorders. The nature of the relationship between BPD and PTSD remains controversial, but it has been suggested that these disorders should brought closer because of their many similarities.
   We thus performed a quantitative meta-analysis of resting-state functional imaging to assess similarities in the brain activation across BPD and PTSD diagnostic groups.
   Overlap analyses revealed decreased activation in the left and right precuneus of both BPD and PTSD groups when compared to control subjects. BPD showed significant increased, but PTSD showed decreased activation, relative to control subjects, in the anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyri and in the left superior frontal gyrus. Complementary overlap analyses on a subgroup of studies with similar sex and age distribution partially confirmed the main results as the same pattern of functional activation in the anterior cingulate and in the left superior frontal gyrus were found.
   Our findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that BPD and PTSD share common neuropathological pathways.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in the elderly, can have a late-onset sporadic or an early-onset familial origin. In both cases, the neuropathological hallmarks are the same: senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Despite AD having a proteinopathic nature, there is strong evidence for an organelle dysfunction-related neuropathology, namely dysfunctional mitochondria. In this regard, dysfunctional mitochondria and associated exacerbated generation of reactive oxygen species are among the earliest events in the progression of the disease. Since the maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial pool is essential given the central role of this organelle in several determinant cellular processes, mitochondrial dysfunction in AD would be predicted to have profound pluripotent deleterious consequences. Mechanistically, recent reports suggest that mitochondrial fission/fusion and mitophagy are altered in AD and in in vitro models of disease, and since both processes are reported to be protective, this review will discuss the role of mitochondrial fission/fusion and mitophagy in the pathogenesis of AD.

AB  - This review examines the consequences of social deprivation on brain chemistry and behavior on rats. Although social deprivation produces wide-ranging behavioral and neurochemical effects, it appears that these effects are determined by a number of factors, the most critical factor being the age or developmental stage during the period of deprivation. Roughly, the effects examined in this review may be separated into three major developmental stages and each is related to deprivation of specific types of social interaction: preweaning/neonatal, postweaning/adolescent, and adult. The effects of social deprivation during each of these stages appears to be neurochemically and behaviorally specific. However, much of the research to date has failed to examine deprivation during specific stages, often combining deprivation of different types. Nonetheless, these modifications of experience produce animals of differing phenotypes, which could be characterized as pathological in nature in many instances, and may model particular aspects of human psychopathologies or perhaps the propensity to develop those phenotypic features.

AB  - This article addresses two questions about the standard employment relationship that have become prominent in labour law literature: Does it exacerbate inequality? Is its decline inevitable? The focus is on the second question and emphasizes the extent to which the standard employment relationship was both embedded in, and the outcome of, an institutional ensemble that was fashioned out of the post-war capital-labour compromise in industrialized democracies. The analysis proceeds in three steps. The first is conceptual and stresses the distinctive nature of labour as a fictive commodity, and the recurring regulatory dilemmas that arise in any attempt to institutionalize a labour market. The second step historicizes and contextualizes the employment relationship, emphasizing politics and conflict (power resource theory) over rational choice and coordination (new institutional economics) as the basis for its institutionalization. The emphasis on politics, power and labour leads to the third step, which focuses on how the broad process of financialization influences three key institutions - the large manufacturing firm, the democratic welfare state and autonomous trade unions - that have been crucial for the development of the standard employment relationship.

AB  - Poverty has been shown to negatively influence child health and development along a number of dimensions. For example, poverty-net of a variety of potentially confounding factors-is associated with increased neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates, greater risk of injuries resulting from accidents or physical abuse/neglect, higher risk for asthma, and lower developmental scores in a range of tests at multiple ages.
   Despite the extensive literature available that addresses the relationship between poverty and child health and development, as yet there is no consensus on how poverty should be operationalized to reflect its dynamic nature. Perhaps more important is the lack of agreement on the set of controls that should be included in the modeling of this relationship in order to determine the ''true'' or net effect of poverty, independent of its cofactors. In this paper, we suggest a general model that should be adhered to when investigating the effects of poverty on children. We propose a standard set of controls and various measures of poverty that should be incorporated in any study, when possible.

AB  - Stress has a complex, bidirectional modulatory influence on pain. Stress may either reduce (stress-induced analgesia) or exacerbate (stress-induced hyperalgesia) pain depending on the nature, duration, and intensity of the stressor. The endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system is present throughout the neuroanatomical pathways that mediate and modulate responses to painful stimuli. The specific role of the endocannabinoid system in the brain in pain and the modulation of pain by stress is reviewed herein. We first provide a brief overview of the endocannabinoid system, followed by a review of the evidence that the brain's endocannabinoid system modulates pain. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the role of the endocannabinoid system supraspinally, and particularly in the rostral ventromedial medulla, periaqueductal gray, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, in pain, stress-induced analgesia, and stress-induced hyperalgesia. Increased understanding of endocannabinoid-mediated regulation of pain and its modulation by stress will inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches for pain and its comorbidity with stress-related disorders.

AB  - This paper attempts to study the historical sociology of psychiatry is ancient India. In the early Vedic Age, mental distress is located at the interface of man with the supernatural and physio-moral dimensions of Nature, Typically, this undifferentiated psychological-medical psychiatry required the intervention of a ritualistic or shamanistic expert. In the later phase of this period, when the early pastoral life showed signs of becoming sedentary, a philosophical-rational psychiatry emerges, and a rigidified social structure challenged by heterodoxies - the psychiatry (and medicine) which develops is more individualist and materialist in orientation. Mental distress is said to arise from imbalances in the mind caused by endogeneous and exogeneous reasons. The way out, thus, is to treat the bodily processes as much as the supernatural spirits. Whereas the early Vedic Age psychiatry reflects the emphasis on group relations, the later one reflects the challenge thrown to the 'Vedic' society by the heterodoxies and swift economic changes. The results of this power contest is best seen in the position of the new medico-psychiatry personage, viz the vaidya.

AB  - Background: The global population is ageing. As ageing is often associated with a decline in health, there is a need to further develop preventative health measures. Physical activity can positively influence older adults' (aged 50 years and older) health. Previous research on the relationship between physical activity and health for older adults has mainly focused on physical activity in general, and not specific types of exercise. Due to the social nature of sport, it may assist in improving physical, mental and social health for older adults. Sport, as a form of physical activity, has not been widely explored as a physical activity opportunity for older adults. This review concurrently explored two research questions: the determinants and the trends of sport participation for community dwelling older adults.
   Methods: Two parallel systematic searches of nine electronic databases were conducted in December 2015 for the two research questions. English language quantitative and qualitative studies that provided specific results for community dwelling older adults' sport participation were included and a quality ratings assessment was undertaken.
   Results: There were 10,171 studies initially identified for the first research question and 1992 studies for the second research question. This culminated in 18 and 8 studies respectively that met the inclusion criteria. The most frequently mentioned determinants of participation were health and using sport to negotiate the ageing process. The most frequently mentioned trends of sport participation were the effect of historical sport participation on current participation, and sport participation across the lifespan. The main themes for both research questions had contrasting results, for example, participation in sport could improve health, but poor health was also a limitation of sport participation.
   Conclusions: This review demonstrates that older adults are a heterogeneous age group, and therefore require different strategies than other age groups to successfully participate in sport. It is recommended that the main findings from this review are incorporated into specific strategies to develop age appropriate sporting opportunities for older adults, so that sport can be presented as a viable physical activity option for this age group.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the parvicellular vasopressin (VP) system originating from the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). The vasopressinergic fibers of these nuclei innervate a number of limbic brain areas including the septum-hippocampal complex. Interestingly, this VP system is sexually dimorphic and the VP synthesis in this system depends on circulating gonadal steroids. Studies in rats and mice show that the variation in the lateral septal VP network within the male gender is as large as the variation between the sexes as reported in the literature. Non-aggressive males are characterized by a far more extensive VP network and a higher VP content in the lateral septal area than aggressive males. A review of the literature on the function of lateral septal VP in the organization of behavior reveals not only a modulatory role of behavior in a social context, but also of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors. It is argued that these seemingly diverse functions might be explained by the concept of coping style. Extensive behavioral and physiological analyses in a variety of animal species show that males may be characterized by the way in which they cope with environmental challenges in general. Aggressive males tend to cope actively with their environment whereas nonaggressive males seem to accept the situation as it is more easily. In several tests, we determined the effects of chronic infusion of the V-1 receptor antagonist locally into the lateral septal area in male rats. The main conclusion from these experiments is that LS VP does not modulate coping style in general. However, the experiments confirm the idea that LS VP has a certain degree of functional specificity in social behavior and social learning tasks. Together with the observation that the size and distribution of the vasopressinergic system may be highly variable between individual males in relation to their coping style, this suggests that the lateral septal vasopressinergic system is involved in the differential capacity of individuals to cope behaviorally with challenges of a social nature.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated the use of telemedicine in both high and low resource settings however its use has preceded this, particularly in conflict-affected settings. Several countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean (EMR) region are affected by complex, protracted crises. Though telemedicine has been used in such settings, there has been no comprehensive assessment of what interventions are used, their efficacy, barriers, or current research gaps. Main body: A systematic search of ten academic databases and 3 grey literature sources from January 1st 2000 to December 31st 2020 was completed, identifying telemedicine interventions in select EMR conflict-affected settings and relevant enablers and barriers to their implementation. Included articles reported on telemedicine use in six conflict-affected EMR countries (or territories) graded as WHO Health Emergencies: Afghanistan, Gaza, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen. Data were extracted and narratively synthesised due to heterogeneity in study design and outcomes. Of 3419 articles identified, twenty-one peer-reviewed and three grey literature sources met the inclusion criteria. We analysed these by context, intervention, and evaluation. Context: eight related to Afghanistan, eight to Syria and seven to Iraq with one each in Yemen and Gaza. Most were implemented by humanitarian or academic organisations with projects mostly initiated in the United States or Europe and mostly by physicians. The in-country links were mostly health professionals rather than patients seeking specialist inputs for specialities not locally available. Interventions: these included both SAF (store and forward) and RT (real-time) with a range of specialities represented including radiology, histopathology, dermatology, mental health, and intensive care. Evaluation: most papers were observational or descriptive with few describing quality measures of interventions. Conclusions: Telemedicine interventions are feasible in conflict-affected settings in EMR using low-cost, accessible technologies. However, few implemented interventions reported on evaluation strategies or had these built in. The ad hoc nature of some of the interventions, which relied on volunteers without sustained financial or academic investment, could pose challenges to quality and sustainability. There was little exploration of confidentiality, ethical standards, data storage or local healthcare worker and patient acceptability.

AB  - In tonal language such as Chinese, lexical tone serves as a phonemic feature in determining word meaning. Meanwhile, it is close to prosody in terms of suprasegmental pitch variations and larynx-based articulation. The important yet mixed nature of lexical tone has evoked considerable studies, but no consensus has been reached on its functional neuroanatomy. This meta-analysis aimed at uncovering the neural network of lexical tone perception in comparison with that of phoneme and prosody in a unified framework. Independent Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analyses were conducted for different linguistic elements: lexical tone by native tonal language speakers, lexical tone by non-tonal language speakers, phoneme, word-level prosody, and sentence-level prosody. Results showed that lexical tone and prosody studies demonstrated more extensive activations in the right than the left auditory cortex, whereas the opposite pattern was found for phoneme studies. Only tonal language speakers consistently recruited the left anterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) for processing lexical tone, an area implicated in phoneme processing and word-form recognition. Moreover, an anterior-lateral to posterior-medial gradient of activation as a function of element timescale was revealed in the right STG, in which the activation for lexical tone lied between that for phoneme and that for prosody. Another topological pattern was shown on the left precentral gyrus (preCG), with the activation for lexical tone overlapped with that for prosody but ventral to that for phoneme. These findings provide evidence that the neural network for lexical tone perception is hybrid with those for phoneme and prosody. That is, resembling prosody, lexical tone perception, regardless of language experience, involved right auditory cortex, with activation localized between sites engaged by phonemic and prosodic processing, suggesting a hierarchical organization of representations in the right auditory cortex. For tonal language speakers, lexical tone additionally engaged the left STG lexical mapping network, consistent with the phonemic representation. Similarly, when processing lexical tone, only tonal language speakers engaged the left preCG site implicated in prosody perception, consistent with tonal language speakers having stronger articulatory representations for lexical tone in the laryngeal sensorimotor network. A dynamic dual-stream model for lexical tone perception was proposed and discussed.

AB  - Personality disorders (PDs) are one of the major problems for the organization of public health systems. Deepening the link between personality traits and psychopathological drifts, it seems increasingly essential for the often dramatic repercussions that PDs have on social contexts. Some of these disorders, such as borderline PD, antisocial PD, in their most tragic expression, are the basis of problems related to crime, sexual violence, abuse, and mistreatment of minors. Many authors propose a dimensional classification of personality pathology, which has received empirical support from numerous studies over the last 20 years based on more robust theoretical principles than those applied to current nosography. The present study investigates the nature of the research carried out in the last years on the personality in the clinical field exploring the contents of current research on personality relapses, evaluating, on the one hand, the emerging areas of greatest interest and others, those that they stopped generating sufficient motivations in scholars. This study evaluates text patterns regarding how the terms "personality" and "mental health" are used in titles and abstracts published in PubMed in the last 5 years. We use a topic analysis: Latent Dirichlet Allocation that expresses every report as a probabilistic distribution of latent topics that are represented as a probabilistic distribution of words. A total of 7,572 abstracts (from 2012 to 2017) were retrieved from PubMed for the query on "mental health" and "personality." The study found 30 topics organized in eight hierarchical clusters that describe the type of current research carried out on personality and its clinical relapse. The hierarchical clusters latent themes were the following: social dimensions, clinical aspects, biological issues, clinical history of PD, internalization and externalization symptoms, impulsive behaviors, comorbidities, criminal behaviors. The results indicate that the concept of personality is associated with a wide range of conditions. The study of personality and mental health still proceeds, mainly, according to a practical-clinical approach; too little moves, however, according to an innovative research approach, but the work shows the common commitment of scholars to a new way of dealing with the study of personality.

AB  - Background: To anticipate the dynamics of future long-distance space exploration mission (LDSEM) teams, research is conducted in analog environments (e.g., Antarctic expeditions, space chamber simulations), or environments that share key contextual features of LDSEM such as isolation and confinement. We conducted a systematic review of research conducted on teams in LDSEM-analog environments to identify which factors have been examined with quantitative research, and to summarize what the studies reveal about team dynamics in LDSEM-analog environments.
   Methods: We used a comprehensive search strategy to identify research on teams that lived and worked together. Data on team dynamics were extracted where possible, and sources were coded for key contextual features. The data did not lend themselves to traditional meta-analysis. We used two approaches to summarize the data: a weighted averages approach when the study reported enough data to calculate an effect size, and descriptive figures when data across studies were directly comparable.
   Results: Seventy-two sources met our inclusion criteria, yielding 253 effect sizes and 1,150 data points. Results from our weighted averages approach suggested that the team cohesion and performance relationship may be operating differently in isolated and confined environments than other teams that lived and worked together (e.g., military teams), and that, given the available data, we can say very little about the magnitude and direction of the relationship. Our descriptive figures revealed important trends: (a) team members in longer missions generally spent less social time together than shorter missions; (b) consistent team efficiency over time was typical, whereas decreased team efficiency over time was atypical; (c) by 40% of mission completion or 90 days, all teams reported at least one conflict, (d) commanders' written communication with mission control decreased in length over time, and (e) team mood dynamics did not consistently support the third-quarter phenomenon.
   Conclusions: There are inherent limitations to our study, given the nature of the analog research (e.g., correlational studies, small sample size). Even so, our systematic review provides key insights into team dynamics in LDSEM-analog environments. We discuss the implications of our research for managing future space crews. Importantly, we also provide guidance for future research.

AB  - A review of recent studies published over a 23-year timespan (1990-2012) showed rapidly increasing interest in exploring how environmental contaminants and parasitism might influence each other and (or) interact to affect host health. Those experimental and observational studies fall into three broad categories (comparative studies of the possible influence of each factor on the other, correlative studies between contaminants and parasitism, and studies on relative bioaccumulation of contaminants by parasites versus their hosts). Despite the exponential increase in relevant studies, little attention has been paid to how contaminants and parasitism should co-occur among individuals within host populations and (or) how the nature of co-distributions should be incorporated into study designs and analyses. Null expectations of co-distributions between contaminants and parasitism can be derived from underlying distributions of each factor. Using a subset of studies, we found contaminant distributions showed positive skew in about one third of cases testing for correlations between contaminant concentrations and parasitism among hosts. We show such skew is expected for theoretical reasons. We used this information to guide simulations wherein the oft-cited negative binomial distribution of parasitism (also supported by theory) was combined with both log-normal (skewed) and normal distributions of contaminants to generate expected null co-distributions. Simulations demonstrated an increasingly concave (or L-shaped) co-distribution with increasing contaminant positive skew: proportionately more individuals experience low levels of each factor while few to none experienced high contaminant and high parasite burdens simultaneously. Our results have the following implications: they call into question experimental studies exposing specimens to parasites and pollutants at levels higher than, or even equal to, observed averages, and they provide a framework for exploring how individual-based effects might scale up into effects at the population level. Potential improvements to study designs and (or) statistical tests are offered that recognize the need to understand the underlying distributions of both contaminants and parasitism and the degree to which one can infer host population effects.

AB  - The ecological and evolutionary factors influencing growth rate are reviewed, with particular emphasis on how growth might be constrained by direct fitness costs. Costs of accelerating growth might contribute to the variance in fitness that is not attributable to age or size at maturity, as well as to the variation in life-history strategies observed within and among species. Two main approaches have been taken to study the fitness trade-offs relating to growth rate. First, environmental manipulations can be used to produce treatment groups with different rates of growth. Second, common garden experiments can be used to compare fitness correlates among populations with different intrinsic growth rates. Data from these studies reveal a number of potential costs for growth over both the short and long term. In order to acquire the energy needed for faster growth, animals must increase food intake. Accordingly, in many taxa, the major constraint on growth rate appears to arise from the trade-off between predation risk and foraging effort. However, growth rates are also frequently observed to be submaximal in the absence of predation, suggesting that growth trajectories also impact fitness via other channels, such as the reallocation of finite resources between growth and other traits and functions.
   Despite the prevalence of submaximal growth, even when predators are absent, there is surprisingly little evidence to date demonstrating predator-independent costs of growth acceleration. Evidence that does exist indicates that such costs may be most apparent under stressful conditions. Future studies should examine more closely the link between patterns of resource allocation to traits in the adult organism and lifetime fitness. Changes in body composition at maturation, for example, may determine the outcome of trade-offs between reproduction and survival or between early and late reproduction. A number of design issues for studies investigating costs of growth that are imposed over the long term are discussed, along with suggestions for alternative approaches. Despite these issues, identifying costs of growth acceleration may fill a gap in our understanding of life-history evolution: the relationships between growth rate, the environment, and fitness may contribute substantially to the diversification of life histories in nature.

AB  - Purpose: The increasing incidence of dementia and home-based care exposes family caregivers to a variety of challenges as they endure strong stressors underlying the caregiver role. Despite growing publications on positive aspects of caregiving in dementia, few studies have identified the extent, nature, and gaps in the existing literature based on a holistic view. The aim was to identify key issues and a holistic view of literature regarding positive aspects of caregiving in dementia.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted underlying a five-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Five databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science, were searched, and references were listed accordingly. Data were extracted by two researchers, comprising article characteristics, forms of positive aspects of caregiving and measurements, theories, forms of dementia and family caregiver, and keywords. Descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were performed to analyze data. Network analysis of keywords and authors was conducted using VOSviewer software. Word cloud analysis of titles was examined by NVivo.
   Results: The review included 230 articles, most of which have been published in the last decade (62.61%). Most articles (40.00%) were contributed by the United States. Cross-sectional studies (41.30%) ranked first, followed by qualitative studies (13.48%). Over a quarter of the literature (28.26%) focused on Alzheimer's care, and nearly 90% included all forms of family caregivers. The Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale and stress coping theory were most frequently cited. Four clusters dominated by Casey D, Quinn C, Joling KJ, and Teahan A were identified in the network of co-authorship. Six themes were identified: current situations of caregiver experiences, antecedents, consequences, measurement development, e ects of interventions, and the concept of positive aspects of caregiving. These were in line with network analysis of keywords and word cloud analysis of titles.
   Conclusions: Positive aspects of caregiving in dementia have been widely concerned, but most of them are based on the theory of the negative stress process and are limited to current situations and influencing factors. Building theories focus on the positive aspects of caregiving, subsequently developing a comprehensivemeasurement and e ective interventions, should be further studied.

AB  - Background: Decision-making capacity can be affected by psychiatric illness. Women who have psychiatric illness who make decisions about their reproductive health may require evaluation of their decision-making capacity. Objective: This article aims to characterize existing literature about capacity evaluations in women with psychiatric illness making reproductive decisions. Methods: We conducted a systematic review searching PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid PsycINFO, and Clinical-Trials. gov databases through July 2020. Articles were evaluated for relevance to inclusion criteria, first by title and abstract screening then by reading the full text of articles. Our inclusion criteria were case reports and studies that involved women of childbearing age with psychiatric illness making obstetrical decisions for whom decision-making capacity was evaluated. We qualitatively analyzed our data by examining themes within the studies, such as the circumstances of the referral and characteristics of reproductive decision-making. We also collected information about the clinical circumstances, such as the clinical setting (e.g., inpatient or outpatient, in primarily psychiatric or obstetric care) and who made the determination of capacity. Results: We identified 18 articles, which included 22 distinct patient cases and 27 distinct obstetrical decisions. Decisions about termination of pregnancy were most common, which were 10 of 27 decisions. Decisions about timing and mode of delivery accounted for 7 and 5 decisions, respectively. The most common psychiatric diagnosis reported was schizophrenia, which was present in 8 patients. Major depression and bipolar disorder were also frequently reported, present in 3 and 5 patients, respectively.
   Conclusion: Patients who make health care decisions must have decision-making capacity. A patient with psychiatric illness does not inherently lack capacity, and in fact, most patients with psychiatric illness have decision-making capacity. Psychiatric illness, however, can add complexity to obstetrical medical decision-making. Reasons for this complexity include the involvement of many stakeholders, the often time-sensitive nature of these decisions, and the potentially unpredictable course of psychiatric illness. Successful management of these cases involves multidisciplinary collaboration, the use of preventative ethics through advanced care planning, and identification of a guardian or surrogate decision-maker when a patient is determined to lack decision-making capacity or for a patient who has capacity through advanced care planning.

AB  - Evidence-based assessments are increasingly recognized as the best-practice approach to determine appropriate conservation interventions, but such assessments of the impact of human disturbance on wildlife are rare. Human disturbance comprises anthropogenic activities that are typically non-lethal, but may cause short- and/or longer-term stress and fitness responses in wildlife. Expanding human activity in the Antarctic region is of particular concern because it increases the scope and potential for increased human disturbance to wildlife in a region that is often thought of as relatively untouched by anthropogenic influences. Here, we use a meta-analytical approach to synthesise research on human disturbance to wildlife over the last three decades in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic region. We combine data from 62 studies across 21 species on the behavioural, physiological and population responses of wildlife to pedestrian, vehicle and research disturbances. The overall effect size indicated a small, albeit statistically significant negative effect of disturbance (-0.39; 95% CI: -0.60 to -0.18). Negative effects were found for both physiological and population responses, but no evidence was found for a significant impact on wildlife behavioural responses. Negative effects were found across pedestrian, vehicle and research disturbances. Significant and high among-study heterogeneity was found in both disturbance and response sub-groups. Among species, it remains unclear to what extent different forms of disturbance translate into negative population responses. Most current guidelines to limit wildlife disturbance impacts in Antarctica recommend that approaches be tailored to animal behavioural cues, but our work demonstrates that behavioural changes do not necessarily reflect more cryptic, and more deleterious impacts, such as changes in physiology. In consequence, we recommend that pedestrian approach guidelines in the Antarctic region be revisited. Due to the high heterogeneity in effects, management guidelines for different sites and species will need to be developed on a case-by-case basis, ideally in conjunction with carefully designed experiments. Guidelines to reduce the impact of research activities per se require development to reduce the potential impacts of conducting research. We identify research questions that, if answered, will further improve the evidence base for guidelines to manage human disturbance in Antarctica.

AB  - Introduction Civic engagement (CE) has the potential to transform mental health services and could be particularly important for low and middle-income countries (LMICs), which are rapidly developing to respond to the burden of poor mental health. Research from high income countries has found many challenges associated with the meaningful implementation of CE in practice, but this has been underexplored in LIMCS and in South East Asia (SEA) in particular. Methods We completed a realist synthesis and systematic review of peer reviewed publications and grey literature to identify the context and actions which promote successful implementation of CE approaches in SEA. We used a theory-driven approach-realist synthesis-to analyse data and develop context-mechanism-outcome configurations that can be used to explain how civic engagement approaches operate in South East Asian contexts. We worked closely with patient and public representatives to guide the review from the outset. Results Fifty-seven published and unpublished articles were included, 24 were evaluations of CE, including two Randomized Controlled Trials. The majority of CE interventions featured uptake or adaptation of Western models of care. We identified important cultural differences in the enactment of civic engagement in SEA contexts and four mechanisms which, alongside their contextual barriers and facilitators, can be used to explain how civic engagement produces a range of outcomes for people experiencing mental health problems, their families and communities. Our review illustrates how CE interventions can be successfully implemented in SEA, however Western models should be adapted to fit with local cultures and values to promote successful implementation. Barriers to implementation included distrust of services/outside agencies, stigma, paternalistic cultures, limited resource and infrastructure. Conclusion Our findings provide guidance for the implementation of CE approaches within SEA contexts and identify areas for further research. Due to the collectivist nature of many SEA cultures, and the impact of shared traumas on community mental health, CE might best be implemented at community level, with a focus on relational decision making.

AB  - The complexity of the central nervous system (CNS), its limited self-repairing capacity and the ineffective delivery of most CNS drugs to the brain contribute to the irreversible and progressive nature of many neurological diseases and also the severity of the outcome. Therefore, neurological disorders belong to the group of pathologies with the greatest need of new technologies for diagnostics and therapeutics. In this scenario, nanotechnology has emerged with innovative and promising biomaterials and tools. This review focuses on ischemic stroke, being one of the major causes of death and serious long-term disabilities worldwide, and the recent advances in the study of liposomes and carbon nanomaterials for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Ischemic stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is insufficient to meet metabolic demand, leading to a cascade of physiopathological events in the CNS including local blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption. However, to date, the only treatment approved by the FDA for this pathology is based on the potentially toxic tissue plasminogen activator. The techniques currently available for diagnosis of stroke also lack sensitivity. Liposomes and carbon nanomaterials were selected for comparison in this review, because of their very distinct characteristics and ranges of applications. Liposomes represent a biomimetic system, with composition, structural organization and properties very similar to biological membranes. On the other hand, carbon nanomaterials, which are not naturally encountered in the human body, exhibit new modes of interaction with biological molecules and systems, resulting in unique pharmacological properties. In the last years, several neuroprotective agents have been evaluated under the encapsulated form in liposomes, in experimental models of stroke. Effective drug delivery to the brain and neuroprotection were achieved using stealth liposomes bearing targeting ligands onto their surface for brain endothelial cells and ischemic tissues receptors. Carbon nanomaterials including nanotubes, fullerenes and graphene, started to be investigated and potential applications for therapy, biosensing and imaging have been identified based on their antioxidant action, their intrinsic photoluminescence, their ability to cross the BBB, transitorily decrease the BBB paracellular tightness, carry oligonucleotides and cells and induce cell differentiation. The potential future developments in the field are finally discussed.

KW  - DISEASE
AB  - Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that cover the central nervous system. The most frequent causes of the disease are viruses and bacteria. In the past, the disease was commonly referred to as "brain fever" or "brain inflammation," and extreme temperatures, sun, rain, mental distress, and other factors were believed to be its potent triggers. By the beginning of the twentieth century, these beliefs faded away in the United States and most western European countries. In contrast, some of these archaic notions persist in Russia, where cold air, draft, wet hair, and failure to cover one's head with a hat during winter are perceived as serious risks for contracting meningitis. These sentiments are reflected in the prose of Solzhenitsyn and other contemporary Russian authors. However, in the fictional literature of the nineteenth century, emotional or intellectual disturbances rather than the wrath of winter were portrayed worldwide as the most frequent cause of brain inflammation. Both physicians and laity blamed nervous breakdown or mental distress for the development of meningitis and the tragic deaths of the eminent Russian writer Gogol, talented poet Nadson, and heir to the Imperial throne Grand Duke Nicholas Romanov. Even in the twentieth century, esteemed Russian artists, including Pasternak, Paustovsky, and Roerich, highlighted this belief. Following the discovery of the infectious nature of meningitis, fictional depictions of the illness changed. While literary accounts of brain inflammation by the realists (e.g., Dostoevsky and Flaubert) were rather imprecise, the descriptions of the course and symptoms of meningitis by the modernists (e.g., Balmont, Hesse, and Huxley) became detailed and recognizable. Typically, the victim of the disease is a boy, and his imminent agony is preceded by immense suffering that devastates his parents. The dreadful experience of seeing children in the merciless clutches of meningitis had a profound personal effect on Maugham, Twain, and Russian philosopher Tikhomirov, changing their spiritual convictions. However, several authors, among them Avseenko, Davydov, Gazdanov, and Shmelyov, created uplifting stories of survival of the affliction. In this chapter, references to meningitis in the medical and fictional literature are explored through a cultural and historical prism, which may help readers to understand how and why this disease has held a special significance in the Russian psyche.

AB  - Background: Globally, adolescents are vulnerable to mental health problems, particularly those from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to impoverished living conditions and a higher prevalence of chronic conditions such as HIV/AIDS in the region. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this risk. This calls for an urgent need for evidence-based adolescent mental health interventions to reduce the risk and burden of mental health problems in SSA. The review aims to identify and characterize existing adolescent mental health interventions in SSA, as well as to evaluate their implementation strategies and effectiveness. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, African Index Medicus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for relevant articles. Furthermore, we searched gray literature databases, including Think Tank search, open gray, NGO search engine, and IGO search engine for additional relevant articles. The scoping review was conducted to identify original research articles on mental health interventions among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa published from database inception to 31 December 2021. We carried out a narrative synthesis to report our findings. Results: Our literature search generated 4,750 studies, of which 1,141 were duplicates, 3,545 were excluded after screening, and 64 articles met the inclusion criteria. The 64 studies describe a total of 57 unique mental health interventions comprising 40,072 adolescents. The nature of these interventions was diverse, encompassing various implementation strategies such as economic-based, family strengthening, psychoeducation, interpersonal psychotherapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and resilience training, among others. Most of the interventions were selective interventions that targeted adolescents at high risk of developing mental health problems including adolescents living with HIV, war-affected adolescents, orphans, adolescents from poorer backgrounds, and survivors of sexual violence. Half of the interventions were delivered by lay persons. Sixty-two of the eligible studies examined the effectiveness of the mental health interventions, of which 55 of them reported a positive significant impact on various mental health outcomes. Conclusions: The review findings show that there exist several diverse interventions that promote mental health among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. These interventions can be implemented in diverse settings including schools, communities, health facilities, and camps, and can be delivered by lay persons.

AB  - Disasters are a recurring fact of life, and major incidents can have both immediate and long-lasting negative effects on the health and well-being of people, communities, and economies. A primary goal of many disaster preparedness, response, and recovery plans is to reduce the likelihood and severity of disaster impacts through increased resilience of individuals and communities. Unfortunately, most plans do not address directly major drivers of long-term disaster impacts on humans-that is, acute, chronic, and cumulative stress-and therefore do less to enhance resilience than they could. Stress has been shown to lead to or exacerbate ailments ranging from mental illness, domestic violence, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorders, and suicide to cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, and other infirmities. Individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and social ties are all vulnerable to stress. Based on a targeted review of what we considered to be key literature about disasters, resilience, and disaster-associated stress effects, we recommend eight actions to improve resiliency through inclusion of stress alleviation in disaster planning: (1) Improve existing disaster behavioral and physical health programs to better address, leverage, and coordinate resources for stress reduction, relief, and treatment in disaster planning and response. (2) Emphasize pre- and post-disaster collection of relevant biomarker and other health-related data to provide a baseline of health status against which disaster impacts could be assessed, and continued monitoring of these indicators to evaluate recovery. (3) Enhance capacity of science and public health early-responders. (4) Use natural infrastructure to minimize disaster damage. (5) Expand the geography of disaster response and relief to better incorporate the displacement of affected people. (6) Utilize nature-based treatment to alleviate pre- and post-disaster stress effects on health. (7) Review disaster laws, policies, and regulations to identify opportunities to strengthen public health preparedness and responses including for stress-related impacts, better engage affected communities, and enhance provision of health services. (8) With community participation, develop and institute equitable processes pre-disaster for dealing with damage assessments, litigation, payments, and housing.

AB  - Depression is a highly prevalent condition with devastating personal and public health consequences that often first manifests during adolescence. Though extensively studied, the pathogenesis of depression remains poorly understood, and efforts to stratify risks and identify optimal interventions have proceeded slowly. A major impediment has been the reliance on an all-or-nothing categorical diagnostic scheme based solely on whether a patient endorses an arbitrary number of common symptoms for a sufficiently long period. This approach masks the well-documented heterogeneity of depression, a disorder that is highly variable in presentation, severity, and course between individuals and is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric conditions. In this targeted review, we outline the limitations of traditional diagnosis-based research and instead advocate an alternative approach centered around symptoms as unique dimensions of clinical dysfunction that span across disorders and more closely reflect underlying neurobiological abnormalities. In particular, we highlight anhedonia-the reduced ability to anticipate and experience pleasure-as a specific, quantifiable index of reward dysfunction and an ideal candidate for dimensional investigation. Anhedonia is a core symptom of depression but also a salient feature of numerous other conditions, and its severity varies widely within clinical and even healthy populations. Similarly, reward dysfunction is a hallmark of depression but is evident across many psychiatric conditions. Reward function is especially relevant in adolescence, a period characterized by exaggerated reward-seeking behaviors and rapid maturation of neural reward circuitry. We detail extensive work by our research group and others to investigate the neural and systemic factors contributing to reward dysfunction in youth, including our cumulative findings using multiple neuroimaging and immunological measures to study depressed adolescents but also trans-diagnostic cohorts with diverse psychiatric symptoms. We describe convergent evidence that reward dysfunction: (a) predicts worse clinical outcomes, (b) is associated with functional and chemical abnormalities within and beyond the neural reward circuitry, (c) is linked to elevated peripheral levels of inflammatory biomarkers, and (d) manifests early in the course of illness. Emphasis is placed on high-resolution neuroimaging techniques, comprehensive immunological assays, and data-driven analyses to fully capture and characterize the complex, interconnected nature of these systems and their contributions to adolescent reward dysfunction.

KW  - HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundThe U.S. has experienced exponential growth in overdose fatalities over the past four decades and more than 22 million people are currently living with a substance use disorder (SUD). While great strides have been made in advancing the science of SUD prevention and treatment, proven programs and interventions are not commonly disseminated at scale in impacted communities. The U.S. Cooperative Extension System (Extension) has been recognized as a valued partner in addressing SUD in communities. Federal funding supporting Extension's response to the opioid epidemic reached $35 million in 2021 primarily through two grant programs: the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Health and Safety Education program; and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Rural Opioid Technical Assistance (ROTA) grants. The primary objective of this scoping review was to identify the range of Extension activities aimed at mediating substance misuse. MethodsAuthors utilized the PRISMA-SCR model to complete this scoping review. Due to the nature of Extension work and the expectation that few activities would be cited in the peer-reviewed literature, the scoping review included a search of peer-reviewed databases, Extension websites for each state and U.S. territory, and the utilization of a web search engine. Upon initial analysis of records returned, authors noted a discrepancy between results returned and the number of states receiving ROTA grants. Thus, authors supplemented the PRISMA-SCR review protocol with a systematic procedure for investigating ROTA funded activities not readily apparent in the peer-reviewed or grey literature. ResultsA total of 87 records met inclusion criteria. Findings included seven peer-reviewed articles and 80 results from the grey literature. An additional 11 ROTA grantees responded to requests for information regarding state level activities. ConclusionsNationwide, Extension has scaled multiple efforts to address SUD operating through a loose confederation of organizations connected to the land-grant system. Most activities are funded by federal grants and focus on state-sponsored training and resource sharing. The volume of effort is significant, however, implementation at the community-level has been slow. Significant opportunities exist for local adoption of evidence-based practices aimed at mitigating SUD.

AB  - Background Childhood Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is common and impairing. The recommended treatment is a disorder specific form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that includes social skills training and, whilst they appear to be more effective than more general treatments, it is not clear whether social skills training is the critical component involved in improved outcomes, particularly given that evidence for the relationship between social anxiety and social skills deficits in children is inconsistent. This may be partly due to an overlap in their observable features, and because the nature of the association may vary in different contexts (e.g. according to child age). An alternative approach is to examine the association between social anxiety and the social cognitive capacities that underpin social skills. This paper aims to examine the association between social anxiety and social cognition in children and adolescents, and examine conceptual and methodological moderators of this relationship. Methods Papers published between 1980 and 2019 were screened systematically. Fifty studies were identified from which an effect size could be calculated for the relationship between social anxiety and social cognition, including 15,411 children and adolescents. Results An overall significant, but moderate effect (r = -.15) was identified, where increased social anxiety was associated with lower social cognitive ability. Moderation analyses revealed specific associations within studies examining social anxiety among participants with and without ASD who were older than 7 years old, and studies assessing the relationship between social anxiety and specific aspects of Theory of Mind (ToM). No significant association was identified between social anxiety and emotion recognition. Conclusions Significant associations between social anxiety and social cognitive abilities appear to be accounted for by elevated social anxiety among children with ASD, and those with difficulties in specific aspects of ToM but not broader social skills, such as emotion recognition. This reinforces the importance of accurately identifying and treating social anxiety within ASD populations. In addition, treatments for social anxiety among neurotypical populations may benefit from targeting particular aspects of ToM rather than emotion recognition and other broad social skills.

AB  - Background Infectious outbreaks, most recently coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have required pervasive public health strategies, termed lockdown measures, including quarantine, social distancing, and closure of workplaces and educational establishments. Although evidence analysing immediate effects is expanding, repercussions following lockdown measures remain poorly understood. This systematic review aims to analyse the biopsychosocial consequences after lockdown measures end according to short, medium, and long-term impacts.
   Methods PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to January 12, 2021. Reference lists were manually reviewed. Eligible studies analysed biopsychosocial functioning after lockdown measures secondary to recent infectious outbreaks ended. Lockdown measures were defined as quarantine, isolation, workplace or educational closures, social or physical distancing, and national or local closure of public institutions deemed non-essential. Studies exclusively researching outcomes during lockdown measures, examined infectious participants, or analysed lockdown measures not pertaining to an infectious outbreak were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed bias with a third resolving discrepancies. Data was extracted from published reports with further information requested from authors where necessary. The mixed methods appraisal tool assessed study quality, languages were restricted to English, German, Italian, and French and narrative synthesis was applied.
   Results Of 5149 identified studies, 40 were eligible for inclusion. Psychological distress, economic repercussions, social, biological, and behavioural ramifications were observed. Short to medium-term effects comprised reactions relating to early trauma processing whereas medium to long-term repercussions manifested in maladaptive behaviours and mental health deterioration. Increased alcohol intake, stigmatisation, and economic effects were also identified consequences. High-risk groups included health care workers, children, elderly, inpatients, those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses, and socially isolated individuals.
   Conclusions Supporting vulnerable groups and offering education, workplace modifications, financial, and social assistance may mitigate negative repercussions. Establishing a rapid and comprehensive evidence base appraising the efficacy of such interventions and identifying areas for development is essential. This review was limited by study heterogeneity and lack of randomisation in available literature. Given the unprecedented nature and progression of COVID-19, the relevance of previous outcomes remains uncertain.

AB  - Background: Suicide is a major global public health problem with more than 800,000 incidents worldwide annually. Seventy-five percent of the global suicides occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pakistan is a LMIC where information on suicidal behavior is limited. The aim of the review is to map available literature on determinants, risk factors and other variables of suicidal behavior in Pakistan.
   Method: This study was based on Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework of scoping review, combining peer reviewed publications with grey literature. Ten databases including Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cochrane Trials Register (CRG), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), National Library of Medicine Gateway (NLMG), ExcerptaMedica (EMBASE), National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE (PUBMED), PSYCHINFO, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index (SCI) and Pakmedinet. com were searched from the beginning of their time frames until December 2016 using a combination of key terms. The inclusion criteria included studies of various study designs covering different aspects of suicidal behavior in English language.
   Results: Six hundred and twenty three articles were initially retrieved from all ten databases. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts for relevance. One hundred and eighteen articles were read in full, out of which 11 were excluded because they did not fit the eligibility criteria. One hundred and ten articles, including two student theses and one report, were included in the final review. Most studies were descriptive in nature, with only three that used a case-control design. Majority of the studies were from urban areas, and addressed determinants rather than risk factors. Gender differences and age were predominantly reported, with more males committing suicide. Suicidal behavior was more common among individuals younger than 30 years of age. The three most common methods for suicides were hanging, poisoning and use of firearms. Mental illness as a risk factor for suicides was mentioned in only three studies.
   Conclusions: This review is the first attempt to synthesize available literature on suicidal behavior in Pakistan. The evidence is limited, and calls for more robust analytical research designs, along with a focus on risk factors.

AB  - The Still-Face Paradigm (SFP) designed by Tronick, Als, Adamson, Wise, and Brazelton (Tronick, E., Als, H., Adamson, L, Wise, S., & Brazelton, T. B. (1978). Infants response to entrapment between contradictory messages in face-to-face interaction. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 17, 1-13) has been used for many different purposes in over 80 empirical studies. in the current paper, the nature and correlates of infant behavior in the SFP were examined in a systematic narrative review and a series of meta-analyses. The results of the meta-analyses confirmed the classic still-face effect of reduced positive affect and gaze, and increased negative affect, as well as a partial carry-over effect into the reunion episode consisting of lower positive and higher negative affect compared to baseline. The still-face effect is very robust as it was found regardless of most sample variations such as infant gender and risk status, and regardless of most procedural variations, such as the length of the SFP episodes and the use of intervals between episodes. The few moderator effects that were found in the meta-analyses tended to put findings from the narrative review in a new perspective. Additional meta-analyses confirmed the narrative review in finding that higher maternal sensitivity predicted more infant positive affect during the still-face. Infants' higher positive affect and lower negative affect during the still-face were predictive of secure attachment at age I year. The meta-analytic results for maternal depression were equivocal. implications for future research include a need for studies testing the role of the adults' identity (parent versus stranger, mother versus father) to elucidate the relationship-specificity of the still-face effect. Also, the role of maternal sensitivity and temperament as potential moderators of the still-face effect need to be examined further. On a procedural level, the effects of the timing of the still-face and of the duration of the reunion on infant responses deserve future research attention. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes, is a major public health burden globally. Diabetes is known to be associated with several comorbidities in high-income countries. However, our understanding of these associations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the epidemiological transition is leading to a growing dual burden of non-communicable and communicable disease, is less clear. We therefore conducted an umbrella review to systematically identify, appraise and synthesise reviews reporting the association between diabetes and multiple key comorbidities in LMICs.
   Methods We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, and Global Index Medicus from inception to 14 November 2020 for systematic reviews, with or without meta-analyses, of cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies investigating the associations between diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), depression, dengue, pneumonia, and tuberculosis within LMICs. We sought reviews of studies focused on LMICs, but also included reviews with a mixture of high-income and at least two LMIC studies, extracting data from LMIC studies only. We conducted quality assessment of identified reviews using an adapted AMSTAR 2 checklist. Where appropriate, we re-ran meta-analyses to pool LMIC study estimates and conduct subgroup analyses.
   Results From 11 001 articles, we identified 14 systematic reviews on the association between diabetes and CVD, CKD, depression, or tuberculosis. We did not identify any eligible systematic reviews on diabetes and pneumonia or dengue. We included 269 studies from 29 LMICs representing over 3 943 083 participants. Diabetes was positively associated with all comorbidities, with tuberculosis having the most robust evidence (16 of 26 cohort studies identified in total) and depression being the most studied (186 of 269 studies). The majority (81%) of studies included were cross-sectional. Heterogeneity was substantial for almost all secondary meta-analyses conducted, and there were too few studies for many subgroup analyses.
   Conclusions Diabetes has been shown to be associated with several comorbidities in LMICs, but the nature of the associations is uncertain because of the large proportion of cross-sectional study designs. This demonstrates the need to conduct further primary research in LMICs, to improve, and address current gaps in, our understanding of diabetes comorbidities and complications in LMICs.

AB  - The last several years have seen unprecedented advances in deciphering the genetic etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Heritability studies have repeatedly affirmed a contribution of genetic factors to the overall disease risk. Technical breakthroughs have enabled the search for these genetic factors via genome-wide surveys of a spectrum of potential sequence variations, from common single-nucleotide polymorphisms to essentially private chromosomal abnormalities. Studies of copy-number variation have identified significant roles for both recurrent and nonrecurrent large dosage imbalances, although they have rarely revealed the individual genes responsible. More recently, discoveries of rare point mutations and characterization of balanced chromosomal abnormalities have pinpointed individual ASD genes of relatively strong effect, including both loci with strong a priori biological relevance and those that would have otherwise been unsuspected as high-priority biological targets. Evidence has also emerged for association with many common variants, each adding a small individual contribution to ASD risk. These findings collectively provide compelling empirical data that the genetic basis of ASD is highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of genes capable of conferring varying degrees of risk, depending on their nature and the predisposing genetic alteration. Moreover, many genes that have been implicated in ASD also appear to be risk factors for related neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as for a spectrum of psychiatric phenotypes. While some ASD genes have evident functional significance, like synaptic proteins such as the SHANKs, neuroligins, and neurexins, as well as fragile x mental retardation-associated proteins, ASD genes have also been discovered that do not present a clear mechanism of specific neurodevelopmental dysfunction, such as regulators of chromatin modification and global gene expression. In its sum, the progress from genetic studies to date has been remarkable and increasingly rapid, but the interactive impact of strong-effect genetic lesions coupled with weak-effect common polymorphisms has not yet led to a unified understanding of ASD pathogenesis or explained its highly variable clinical expression. With an increasingly firm genetic foundation, the coming years will hopefully see equally rapid advances in elucidating the functional consequences of ASD genes and their interactions with environmental/experiential factors, supporting the development of rational interventions.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a clinical syndrome of both extraordinary importance and extraordinary complexity. Its conceptual history contains many perspectives on the ''essential'' nature of the illness. For example, Kraepelin in 1919 emphasized primarily onset and course, although he also stressed the importance of some symptoms such as changes in affect and volition. Bleuler in 1911 took a more cross-sectional approach and attempted to identify fundamental characteristic symptoms, especially stressing fragmenting of thought processes. Schneider's (1959) approach was cross-sectional, stressing a group of ''first-rank symptoms.'' DSM-III and its successors attempted to achieve a synthesis of these concepts. Nevertheless, heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of schizophrenia is certain, and heterogeneity in pathophysiology and etiology is likely. Although we can now        define a particular construct of schizophrenia with reasonable agreement, the construct must      be recognized as provisional and based on a need to achieve consensus about definitions rather than on an understanding of pathophysiology and etiology. The major challenge confronting the student of schizophrenia is to identify its mechanisms and causes in order to develop improved strategies for treatment and prevention. Several different approaches have been proposed to achieve this goal. Early attempts to explore and validate the construct of schizophrenia stressed descriptive and epidemiological techniques; the ''validity'' of a given construct of schizophrenia would be determined by evaluation of familial aggregation, course and outcome, response to treatment, and laboratory tests. This earlier approach to validation is now complemented by one that draws on techniques from neuroscience and attempts to understand schizophrenia in terms of underlying neural mechanisms. While the earlier approach conceptualized schizophrenia primarily in terms of a single disease entity, the second approach is particularly useful for the exploration of subtypes or dimensions. Research strategies for the study of schizophrenia have been developed to explore its heterogeneity. Three different competing models are discussed: (1) A single etiopathological process leading to diverse manifestations, similar to multiple sclerosis; (2) multiple disease entities leading to schizophrenia by different etiopathological processes, similar to the syndrome of mental retardation; and (3) specific symptom clusters within schizophrenia reflecting different disease processes that come together in different ways in different patients. Each of these models has strengths and weaknesses for the identification of etiology and pathophysiology.

AB  - BackgroundMost asylum seekers experience stress, not only due to the reason for fleeing and their travel but also due to their compulsory stay in the asylum seeker center in the Netherlands and the asylum procedure. This often leads to self-medication and addiction which causes lower self-esteem and lower quality of life. Adverse life events, forced migration, and prolonged asylum procedures, in addition to the complexity of the acculturation process, can all contribute to higher levels of psychopathology. ObjectiveWhat are the threats to wellbeing in terms of mental health, psychosocial, and addiction problems, and what are the effective interventions for wellbeing for asylum seekers in asylum seeker centers in the Netherlands, reported in the literature? MethodFollowing the descriptive nature of the research question and the need for identifying knowledge gaps, an overview of existing knowledge was created by executing a scoping review on influencing factors on the mental health of asylum seekers. The Neuman system model was used as a guiding framework to understand the complexity of the issues this population experience and to identify the stressors and the factors which cause the imbalance and also the disease. ResultsThe literature review resulted in 26 articles that met the criteria for inclusion. The threats included the influence of staying in the environment of an asylum seekers center, drug abuse among asylum seekers, health-care professionals and employees who do not detect or underestimate the underlying suffering of asylum seekers, and frequent relocations of asylum seekers. The two assessment instruments used were the Rapid-Assessment-Response method (RAR method) and the Health Information Assessment Tool Asylum Seeker tool (HIATUS tool). Finally, the five interventions were identified: therapy for asylum seekers diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PSTD), art therapy, education focused on prevention as intervention, cultural interview, and mindspring. ConclusionThe knowledge on identifying and reducing threats, assessment, and treatment interventions for asylum seekers living in an asylum seekers center found in the literature provided perspectives on improving their wellbeing. The great diversity of cultural aspects and continuous changes in the number and origin of refugees in the Dutch asylum seekers centers disrupted the continuity of care.

AB  - Background: Threatened species often have small and isolated populations where mating among relatives can result in inbreeding depression increasing extinction risk. Effective management is hampered by a lack of syntheses summarising the magnitude of, and variation in inbreeding depression. Here we describe the nature and scope of the literature examining phenotypic/fitness consequences of inbreeding, to provide a foundation for future syntheses and management.
   Methods: We searched the literature for articles documenting the impact of inbreeding in natural populations. Article titles, abstracts and full-texts were assessed against a priori defined criteria, and information relating to study design, quality and other factors that may influence inbreeding responses (e.g. population size) was extracted from relevant articles.
   Results: The searches identified 11457 articles, of which 614 were assessed as relevant and included in the systematic map (corresponding to 703 distinct studies). Most studies (663) assessed within-population inbreeding resulting from self-fertilisation or consanguineous pairings, while 118 studies assessed among-population inbreeding due to drift load. Plants were the most studied taxon (469 studies) followed by insects (52 studies) and birds (43 studies). Most studies investigated the effects of inbreeding on components of fitness (e.g. survival or fecundity; 648 studies) but measurements were typically under laboratory/greenhouse conditions (486 studies). Observations were also often restricted to the first inbred generation (607 studies) and studies frequently lacked contextual information (e.g. population size).
   Conclusions: Our systematic map describes the scope and quality of the evidence describing the phenotypic consequences of inbreeding. The map reveals substantial evidence relating to inbreeding responses exists, but highlights information is still limited for some aspects, including the effects of multiple generations of inbreeding. The systematic map allowed us to define several conservation-relevant questions, where sufficient data exists to support systematic reviews, e.g. How do inbreeding responses vary with population size? However, we found that such syntheses are likely to be constrained by incomplete reporting of critical contextual information. Our systematic map employed the same rigorous literature assessment methods as systematic review, including a novel survey of study quality and thus provides a robust foundation to guide future research and syntheses seeking to inform conservation decision-making.

AB  - To characterize human emotions, researchers have increasingly utilized Automatic Facial Expression Analysis (AFEA), which automates the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and translates the facial muscular positioning into the basic universal emotions. There is broad interest in the application of FACS for assessing consumer expressions as an indication of emotions to consumer product-stimuli. However, the translation of FACS to characterization of emotions is elusive in the literature. The aim of this systematic review is to give an overview of how FACS has been used to investigate human emotional behavior to consumer product-based stimuli. The search was limited to studies published in English after 1978, conducted on humans, using FACS or its action units to investigate affect, where emotional response is elicited by consumer product-based stimuli evoking at least one of the five senses. The search resulted in an initial total of 1,935 records, of which 55 studies were extracted and categorized based on the outcomes of interest including (i) method of FACS implementation; (ii) purpose of study; (iii) consumer product-based stimuli used; and (iv) measures of affect validation. Most studies implemented FACS manually (73%) to develop products and/or software (20%) and used consumer product-based stimuli that had known and/or defined capacity to evoke a particular affective response, such as films and/or movie clips (20%); minimal attention was paid to consumer products with low levels of emotional competence or with unknown affective impact. The vast majority of studies (53%) did not validate FACS-determined affect and, of the validation measures that were used, most tended to be discontinuous in nature and only captured affect as it holistically related to an experience. This review illuminated some inconsistencies in how FACS is carried out as well as how emotional response is inferred from facial muscle activation. This may prompt researchers to consider measuring the total consumer experience by employing a variety of methodologies in addition to FACS and its emotion-based interpretation guide. Such strategies may better conceptualize consumers' experience with products of low, unknown, and/or undefined capacity to evoke an affective response such as product prototypes, line extensions, etc.

AB  - Depressive disorders (DDs) are one of the most widespread forms of psychiatric pathology. According to the World Health Organization, about 350 million people in the world are affected by this condition. Family and twin studies have demonstrated that the contribution of genetic factors to the risk of the onset of DDs is quite large. Various methodological approaches (analysis of candidate genes, genome-wide association analysis, genome-wide sequencing) have been used, and a large number of the associations between genes and different clinical DD variants and DD subphenotypes have been published. However, in most cases, these associations have not been confirmed in replication studies, and only a small number of genes have been proven to be associated with DD development risk. To ascertain the role of genetic factors in DD pathogenesis, further investigations of the relevant conditions are required. Special consideration should be given to the polygenic characteristics noted in whole-genome studies of the heritability of the disorder without a pronounced effect of the major gene. These observations accentuate the relevance of the analysis of gene-interaction roles in DD development and progression. It is important that association studies of the inherited variants of the genome should be supported by analysis of dynamic changes during DD progression. Epigenetic changes that cause modifications of a gene's functional state without changing its coding sequence are of primary interest. However, the opportunities for studying changes in the epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome during DD are limited by the nature of the disease and the need for brain tissue analysis, which is possible only postmortem. Therefore, any association studies between DD pathogenesis and epigenetic factors must be supplemented through the use of different animal models of depression. A threefold approach comprising the combination of gene association studies, assessment of the epigenetic state in DD patients, and analysis of different "omic" changes in animal depression models will make it possible to evaluate the contribution of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors to the development of different forms of depression and to help develop ways to decrease the risk of depression and improve the treatment of DD.

This review work discusses, addresses and provides details of the most important aspects of consumer's perceptions of and attitudes to natural foods and in-depth research into natural sweeteners. It also includes issues about their use and development as regards health impacts, food security and sustainability. In line with our main research outcome, we can assume that consumers are very keen on choosing foods with clean labelling, natural ingredients, preferably with other functional properties, without the loss of taste. In response to such a phenomenon, the food industry offers consumers alternative natural sweeteners with the advantage of added health benefits. It is noteworthy that Nature is a superb source of desirable substances, and many have a sweet taste, and many still need to be studied. Finally, we must stress that being natural does not necessarily guarantee market success.

AB  - Arsenic, a metal ubiquitously distributed in the environment, remains an important global health threat. Drinking arsenic-contaminated water is the major route of human exposure. Exposure to arsenic contributes to several malignancies, in the integumentary, respiratory, hepatobiliary, and urinary systems. Cutaneous lesions are important manifestations after long-term arsenic exposure. Arsenical skin cancers usually herald the development of other internal cancers, making the arsenic-induced skin carcinogenesis a good model to investigate the progression of chemical carcinogenesis. In fact, only a portion of arsenic-exposed humans eventually develop malignancies, likely attributed to the arsenic-impaired immunity in susceptible individuals. Currently, the exact pathophysiology of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis remains elusive, although increased reactive oxidative species, aberrant immune regulations, and chromosome abnormalities with uncontrolled cell growth might be involved. This review discusses how arsenic induces carcinogenesis, and how the dysregulated innate and adaptive immunities in systemic circulation and in the target organs contribute to arsenic carcinogenesis. These findings offer evidence for illustrating the mechanism of arsenic-related immune dysregulation in the progression of carcinogenesis, and this may help explain the nature of multiple and recurrent clinical lesions in arsenic-induced skin cancers.

AB  - Insanity defense is primarily used in criminal prosecutions. It is based on the assumption that at the time of the crime, the defendant was not suffering from severe mental illness and therefore, was incapable of appreciating the nature of the crime and differentiating right from wrong behavior, hence making them not legally accountable for crime. Insanity defense is a legal concept, not a clinical one (medical one). This means that just suffering from a mental disorder is not sufficient to prove insanity. The defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by a "preponderance of the evidence" which is similar to a civil case. It is hard to determine legal insanity, and even harder to successfully defend it in court. This article focuses on the recent Supreme Court decision on insanity defense and standards employed in Indian court. Researchers present a model for evaluating a defendant's mental status examination and briefly discuss the legal standards and procedures for the assessment of insanity defense evaluations. There is an urgent need to initiate formal graduation course, setup Forensic Psychiatric Training and Clinical Services Providing Centers across the country to increase the manpower resources and to provide fair and speedy trail.

AB  - While the cerebellum's role in motor function is well recognized, the nature of its concurrent role in cognitive function remains considerably less clear. The current consensus paper gathers diverse views on a variety of important roles played by the cerebellum across a range of cognitive and emotional functions. This paper considers the cerebellum in relation to neurocognitive development, language function, working memory, executive function, and the development of cerebellar internal control models and reflects upon some of the ways in which better understanding the cerebellum's status as a "supervised learning machine" can enrich our ability to understand human function and adaptation. As all contributors agree that the cerebellum plays a role in cognition, there is also an agreement that this conclusion remains highly inferential. Many conclusions about the role of the cerebellum in cognition originate from applying known information about cerebellar contributions to the coordination and quality of movement. These inferences are based on the uniformity of the cerebellum's compositional infrastructure and its apparent modular organization. There is considerable support for this view, based upon observations of patients with pathology within the cerebellum.

AB  - Biomedical advances and the practice of preventive health behaviors have resulted in an unprecedented growth in the older population of the United States, a trend projected to continue during the next several decades. However, the addition of years to life is no guarantee that those years will be quality years. There is growing evidence to suggest that physical activity is a behavioral modality that is consistently associated with quality of life outcomes. However, there are numerous conceptual, theoretical, and definitional ambiguities associated with this literature. In this review, we examine the literature on physical activity and quality of life in older adults. Specifically, attention is given to the conceptualization of quality of life in the medical and psychological disciplines and how these differential viewpoints influence the outcomes measured and the nature of the relationships reported. We also address the question of whether a dose-response relationship exists between these constructs, as well as the extent to which physical activity is associated with important aspects of cognitive, physical, and psychosocial function. Finally, we propose a multidimensional model for examining the potential mediating and moderating factors in the physical activity and quality-of-life relationship and discuss the practical implications that such a model has for practitioners.

AB  - A systemic functional theory applied to multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA) is related to the theoretical and practical meaning extraction from the data showing how multiple semiotic resources are used in different modes of discourse ranging from textual, printed, and electronic texts to visual language and those existing alive as embedded in reality. In the present paper, we provide an introduction to the SF-MDA approach and then justify how it can benefit the second language acquisition (SLA) domain and more specifically the exploration of L2 affective variables. We will show how the SF-MDA approach fits in with the complexity and dynamic systems theory (CDST), and is capable of revealing the nuances of the developmental nature of the affective variables involved in language learning. The exemplary works of research in the SLA domain using the SF-MDA approach are reviewed here as well as those exploring L2 affective variables. The further benefits of this approach will be emphasized at the end along with the implications it can have for the CDST-led line of research in applied linguistics.

AB  - Orexin, the arousal peptide, originates from neurons located in an area of the dorsal hypothalamus well known for integrating defense responses and their cardiovascular component. Orexin neurons, which are driven in large part by the limbic forebrain, send projections to many regions in the brain, including regions involved in cardiovascular control, as far down as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. Central injections of orexin evoke sympathetically mediated cardiovascular responses. Conversely, blockade of orexin receptors reduce the cardiovascular responses to acute stressors, preferentially of a psychological nature. More importantly, lasting upregulation of orexin signaling can lead to a hypertensive state. This can be observed in rats exposed to chronic stress as well as in strains known to display spontaneous hypertension such as the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) or the hypertensive BPH/2J Schlager mouse. Thus, there is a link between orexin, stress and hypertension, and orexin upregulation could be a factor in the development of essential hypertension. Orexin receptor antagonists have anti-hypertensive effects that could be of clinical use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mass Violence and the Complex Spectrum of Mental Illness and Mental Functioning
AB  - ImportancePsychiatry has struggled to clarify the types of mental turmoil that are associated with mass violence. While the problem is complex, it may present an opportunity to improve research, as well as inform public dialogue about what types of mental illness are actually associated with such mass tragedies.ObservationsAssuring the diagnostic accuracy of those who commit mass violence is challenging due to the retrospective nature of the analysis and lack of reliable psychiatric data. Psychiatric research has begun to use a dimensional approach that may be well suited to the study of mental illness in perpetrators of mass violence. This approach aggregates psychiatric symptoms into 3 domains of psychopathology: (1) internalizing, (2) externalizing, and (3) psychotic experience. This approach has practical clinical use and research support. A dimensional approach may help clear up misconceptions about the rate of psychosis in mass violence perpetrators, as well as reveal the most common dimensions of mental functioning associated with perpetrators.Conclusions and RelevanceImproved research methods are needed to clarify and prevent mass violence. More precisely identifying the symptoms and mental turmoil of perpetrators may be associated with improved early identification and prevention. Because adolescence is a critical and formative period in which internalizing and externalizing problems arise, early interventions may have the best chance of reducing future mass violence.

AB  - Despite decades of research, the nature of the involvement of the motor system in action language processing is still controversial, and little is known about how processing action language relates to observing, imaging and executing motor actions. This study combines a systematic review of the literature, an ALE meta-analysis and a region-of-interest (ROI) meta-analysis to provide the first complete (qualitative and quantitative) account of the motor-related functional network involved in action language processing in comparison to activation reported during motor observation, motor imagery and motor execution. The review of the literature revealed that the methodology of action language studies differed considerably from the methodology of other motor-related processes which may have contributed to blurring the interpretations over the years. The ALE and ROI meta-analyses showed that the functional network of action language was more similar to observation than imagery and finally execution, following a motor gradation. Overall, our results point towards a more cognitive, as opposed to purely motoric, involvement of the motor system during action language processing.

AB  - Prolonged distress and dysregulated memory processes are the core features of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and represent the debilitating, persistent nature of the illness. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the expression of these symptoms are challenging to study in human patients. Stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) paradigms, which encompass both stress and memory components in rodents, are emerging as valuable preclinical models of PTSD. Rodent models designed to study the long-term mechanisms of either stress or fear memory alone have identified a critical role for numerous epigenetic modifications to DNA and histone proteins. However, the epigenetic modifications underlying SEFL remain largely unknown. This review will provide a brief overview of the epigenetic modifications implicated in stress and fear memory independently, followed by a description of existing SEFL models and the few epigenetic mechanisms found to date to underlie SEFL. The results of the animal studies discussed here highlight neuroepigenetics as an essential area for future research in the context of PTSD through SEFL studies, because of its potential to identify novel candidates for neurotherapeutics targeting stress-induced pathogenic memories.

AB  - Context:The aim of this studywas to determine the experimental evidence of treatment/intervention programs fordeficits in social skills, attention, and behavioral disorder in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Evidence Acquisition: Meta-analysis procedures were employed to investigate whether children and adolescents with ADHD exhibit deficits in attention and social skills. A total of 17 empirical research studies published between 2000 and 2013 met our inclusion criteria. Attention and social skills measures were categorized according to both modality and type of processing required.
   Results: Children with ADHD exhibited deficits in multiple components of attention and social skills that were not related to language learning disorders and weaknesses in general intellectual abilities. The overall percentage effect for attention and social skills in students with ADHD was calculated (effect size = 0.79, confidence interval = 0.57-1.08). This meta -analysis study showed that treatment programs reduced attention deficit and social skills in ADHD children and adolescents.
   Conclusions: The evidence of attention and social skills deficits in children with ADHD supports recent studies in ADHD deficits. Further research is required to explain in detail the nature, severity, and specificity of the deficits in individuals with ADHD.

AB  - Extracellular acidification occurs in the brain with elevated neural activity, increased metabolism, and neuronal injury. This reduction in pH can have profound effects on brain function because pH regulates essentially every single biochemical reaction. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that Nature evolves a family of proteins, the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), to sense extracellular pH reduction. ASICs are proton-gated cation channels that are mainly expressed in the nervous system. In recent years, a growing body of literature has shown that acidosis, through activating ASICs, contributes to multiple diseases, including ischemia, multiple sclerosis, and seizures. In addition, ASICs play a key role in fear and anxiety related psychiatric disorders. Several recent reviews have summarized the importance and therapeutic potential of ASICs in neurological diseases, as well as the structure-function relationship of ASICs. However, there is little focused coverage on either the basic biology of ASICs or their contribution to neural plasticity. This review will center on these topics, with an emphasis on the synaptic role of ASICs and molecular mechanisms regulating the spatial distribution and function of these ion channels.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex age-related pathology, the etiology of which has not been firmly delineated. Among various histological stigmata, AD-affected brains display several cellular dysfunctions reflecting enhanced oxidative stress, inflammation process and calcium homeostasis disturbance. Most of these alterations are directly or indirectly linked to amyloid beta-peptides (A beta), the production, molecular nature and biophysical properties of which likely conditions the degenerative process. It is particularly noticeable that, in a reverse control process, the above-described cellular dysfunctions alter A beta peptides levels. beta-secretase beta APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a key molecular contributor of this cross-talk. This enzyme is responsible for the primary cleavage generating the N-terminus of "full length" A beta peptides and is also transcriptionally induced by several cellular stresses. This review summarizes data linking brain insults to AD-like pathology and documents the key role of BACE1 at the cross-road of a vicious cycle contributing to A beta production.

AB  - This paper addresses the question of whether individual violence can be reduced in frequency or severity, if so to what extent and by which methods. It opens with a brief overview of the nature of personal violence and discussion of some key definitional and methodological problems. However, its principal focus is on the findings obtained from a series of meta-analytic reviews of structured programmes for adolescents and adults who have shown repeated aggression or been convicted of personal violence, drawing together the results of studies conducted in prison, probation, youth justice and allied services. Additional results are considered from a systematic review of studies of violence prevention among offenders with mental disorders. This incorporates the preliminary findings of a meta-analysis of controlled trials of psychosocial interventions with that population. Overall, it is concluded that there is sufficient evidence currently available to substantiate the claim that personal violence can be reduced by psychosocial interventions, but that much more research is required to delineate the parameters of effectiveness in this context. Proposals are made for future investigations with reference to the theoretical understanding of causal relationships and the design of experimental trials.

AB  - Research on self-esteem has focused almost exclusively on level of trait self-esteem to the neglect of other potentially more important aspects such as the contingencies on which self-esteem is based. Over a century ago, W. James (1890) argued that self-esteem rises and falls around its typical level in response to successes and failures in domains on which one has staked self-worth. We present a model of global self-esteem that builds on James' insights and emphasizes contingencies of self-worth. This model can help to (a) point the way to understanding how self-esteem is implicated in affect, cognition, and self-regulation of behavior; (b) suggest how and when self-esteem is implicated in social problems; (c) resolve debates about the nature and functioning of self-esteem; (d) resolve paradoxes in related literatures, such as why people who are stigmatized do not necessarily have low self-esteem and why self-esteem does not decline with age; and (e) suggest how self-esteem is causally related to depression. In addition, this perspective raises questions about how contingencies of self-worth are acquired and how they change, whether they are primarily a resource or a vulnerability, and whether some people have noncontingent self-esteem.

AB  - There is a growing body of research investigating the gene expression signature of depression at the genome-wide level, with potential for the discovery of novel pathophysiological mechanisms of depression. However, heterogeneity of depression, dynamic nature of gene expression patterns and various sources of noise have resulted in inconsistent findings. We systematically review the current state of transcriptome profiling of depression in the brain and peripheral tissues with a particular focus on replicated findings at the single gene level. By examining 16 brain regions and 5 cell types from the periphery, we identified 57 replicated differentially expressed genes in the brain and 21 in peripheral tissues. Functional overlap between brain and periphery strongly implicates shared pathways in a comorbid phenotype of depression and cardiovascular disease. The findings highlight dermal fibroblasts as a promising experimental model for depression biomarker research, provide partial support for all major theories of depression and suggest a novel candidate gene, PXMP2, which plays a critical role in lipid and reactive oxygen species metabolism.

AB  - Background: Disgust is, at its core, an emotion that responds to cues of parasites and infection, likely to be evolved to protect human organism from the risk of disease. Interestingly, a growing body of research implicates disgust as an emotion central to human morality. The fact that disgust is associated with appraisals of moral transgressions and that this emotion influences moral judgments implies a remarkable puzzle: Why does an emotion that originally functions in the domain of infectious entities become such a good candidate to play the role of a moral arbiter? The aim of the present review is to clarify the nature of the relationship between disgust and morality. Method: First, we examine the relevant features of disgust in order to explore whether the phenomenology of disgust favors its implementation as a defensive mechanism against offensive social entities. Second, we critically review the most striking findings about the effects of disgust on moral judgments. Results: The revisited analysis of the literature strongly suggests a bidirectional causal link between disgust and moral cognition. Conclusions: We propose that the particular phenomenology of disgust (which involves a sense of offensiveness and rejection) favored the co-adaptation of this emotion to the moral domain.

AB  - The present paper is an attempt to understand emotions and the affect from Indian traditional point of view. In the Indian philosophical texts' detailed descriptions of emotions are not available nor are dealt with as a separate concept. This view of emotions lays emphasis on desires as the root cause of emotional upheavals. They are seen as modification of desire and attachment. The desires are seen as arising from the contact and attachment of the ego or ahamkara with the external world and are caused by a sense of imperfection, incompleteness or non-fulfillment. Ego or ahamkara is differentiated from the true Self or atman. Emotions are viewed as springs of action and are bipolar in nature. According to Patanjali's Yoga Shastra, suffering is due to ignorance about one's true "self" (avidya). Hence, suffering or dukha arises from within and not from the outside world. Bhagvadgita traces all emotional experiences to the gunas, i.e., sattva, rajas, and tamas. Works of Bharathmuni have contributed to the understanding of emotional experiences. Concept of rasa or aesthetic relish is central to this approach to understanding affective experiences as dealt with in the Natyashastra of Bharathamuni. These views underline the recommended path for self-transformation. Regulating emotions, both emotional experience and emotional expression, is an integral part of the recommended "principles of living."

AB  - The arts can provide unique ways for determining how people not directly involved in medicine were viewing and informing others about physical and mental disorders. With operas, one need only think about how various perturbations of madness have been portrayed. Somnambulism has long been a particularly perplexing disorder, both to physicians and the laity, and it features in a number of operas. Two mid-nineteenth-century masterpieces are examined in detail in this contribution: Verdi's Macbeth and Bellini's La Sonnambula. In the former, the sleepwalking scene is faithful to what Shakespeare's had written early in the seventeenth century, a time of witchcraft, superstition, and the belief that nocturnal wanderings might be caused by guilt. In Bellini's opera, in contrast, the victim is an innocent girl who suffers from a quirk of nature, hence eliciting sympathy and compassion. By examining the early literature on somnambulism and comparing this disorder in these operas, we can see how thinking about this condition has changed and, more generally, how music was helping to generate new ways of thinking about specific diseases and medicine.

AB  - Fitness varies nonlinearly with. environmental variables such as temperature, water availability, and nutrition, with maximum fitness at intermediate levels between more stressful extremes. For environmental agents that are highly toxic at exposures that substantially exceed background levels, fitness is maximized at concentrations near zero - a phenomenon often referred to as hormesis. Two main components are suggested: (1) background hormesis, which derives from the direct adaptation of organisms to their habitats; and (2) stress-derived hormesis, which derives from metabolic reserves that are maintained as an adaptation to environmental stresses through evolutionary time. These reserves provide protection from lesser correlated stresses. This article discusses illustrative examples, including ethanol and ionizing radiation, aimed at placing hormesis into an ecological and evolutionary context. A unifying approach comes from fitness-stress continua that underlie responses to abiotic variables, whereby selection for maximum metabolic efficiency and hence fitness in adaptation to habitats in nature underlies hormetic zones. Within this-reductionist model, mare specific metabolic mechanisms to explain hormesis are beginning to emerge, depending upon the agent and the taxon in question. Some limited research possibilities based upon this evolutionary perspective are indicated.

AB  - Research on mindreading in animals has the potential to address fundamental questions about the nature and origins of the human capacity to ascribe mental states, but it is a research programme that seems to be in trouble. Between 1978 and 2000 several groups used a range of methods, some with considerable promise, to ask whether animals can understand a variety of mental states. Since that time, many enthusiasts have become sceptics, empirical methods have become more limited, and it is no longer clear what research on animal mindreading is trying to find. In this article I suggest that the problems are theoretical and methodological: there is difficulty in conceptualising alternatives to 'full-blown' mindreading, and reluctance to use the kinds of empirical methods necessary to distinguish mindreading from other psychological mechanisms. I also suggest ways of tackling the theoretical and methodological problems that draw on recent studies of mindreading in humans, and the resources of experimental psychology more generally. In combination with the use of inanimate control stimuli, species that are unlikely to be capable of mindreading, and the 'goggles method', these approaches could restore both vigour and rigour to research on animal mindreading.

AB  - There has been a growing impetus to bridge the gap between basic science discovery, development of evidence-based practices (EBPs), and the availability and delivery of EBPs in order to improve the public health impact of such practices. To capitalize on factors that support implementation and sustainment of EBPs, it is important to consider that health care is delivered within the outer context of public health systems and the inner context of health care organizations and work groups. Leaders play a key role in determining the nature of system and organizational contexts. This article addresses the role of leadership and actions that leaders can take at and across levels in developing a strategic climate for EBP implementation within the outer (i.e., system) and inner (i.e., organization, work group) contexts of health care. Within the framework of Edgar Schein's "climate embedding mechanisms," we describe strategies that leaders at the system, organization, and work group levels can consider and apply to develop strategic climates that support the implementation and sustainment of EBP in health care and allied health care settings.

AB  - There is a simple and general explanation for the evolution of mate choice that does not rely on benefits to be gained from favoring some potential mates over others, nor on ornament-preference genetic correlations (but that can help establish such benefits and correlations). Mate choice necessarily arises from competition to engage the powerful but discriminating reward mechanisms that regulate sexual interactions. Progress in understanding the evolution of mate choice will come from analyzing the subjective nature of the cognitive-emotional mechanisms that regulate its expression. A key mechanism may be the sense of beauty-the feeling whose function it is to reward attention to, and engagement with, attractive objects. Any animal whose behavior and decision-making are regulated by mechanisms of emotion and feeling may possess the sense of beauty. Competition to be perceived as beautiful engages brain-generated, top-down influences on perception and subjective experience, adding manifold ways to improve ornament attractiveness. In this paper, I discuss the evolutionary consequences of mate choice involving the sense of beauty and how to test for it.

AB  - Conduct disorder (CD), a disturbance characterised by excess rates of aggression - often associated with callousness, lack of empathy and shallow/deficient affect - is extremely prevalent (2-10%) in the juvenile population. CD symptoms are quantitative rather than qualitative in nature whereby, rather than exhibiting abnormal behaviours, CD patients indulge in normal behaviours at abnormal rates. Although genetic and environmental factors contribute to CD aetiology, their precise contribution is yet to be determined. Experimental animal models may aid discriminating genetic vs. environmental effects and designing innovative therapeutic approaches. Here we discuss a theoretical framework potentially favouring the design of experimental models of CD. We suggest that the latter shall recapitulate the "norm violation" typical of the human disorder across the core domains involved in CD: aggression, callousness, empathy and emotionality. We first review how these domains have been operationalised in preclinical models; we then suggest that these experimental paradigms shall be combined with appropriate statistical tools to identify a subset of individuals consistently characterised by abnormal values in CD-relevant phenotypes.

AB  - Life history theory provides a metatheoretical framework for the study of pubertal timing from an evolutionary-developmental perspective. The current article reviews 5 middle-level theories-energetics theory, stress-suppression theory, psychosocial acceleration theory, paternal investment theory, and child development theory-each of which applies the basic assumptions of life history theory to the question of environmental influences on timing of puberty in girls. These theories converge in their conceptualization of pubertal timing as responsive to ecological conditions but diverge in their conceptualization of (a) the nature, extent, and direction of environmental influences and (b) the effects of pubertal timing on other reproductive variables. Competing hypotheses derived from the 5 perspectives are evaluated. An extension of W. T. Boyce and B.J. Ellis's (in press) theory of stress reactivity is proposed to account for both inhibiting and accelerating effects of psychosocial stress on timing of pubertal development. This review highlights the multiplicity of (often unrecognized) perspectives guiding research, raises challenges to virtually all of these, and presents an alternative framework in an effort to move research forward in this arena of multidisciplinary inquiry.

AB  - Background Episodes of mass sociogenic illness are becoming Increasingly recognised as a significant health and social problem that is more common than is presently reported.
   Aims To provide historical continuity with contemporary episodes of mass sociogenic illness in order to gain a broader transcultural and transhistorical understanding of this complex, protean phenomenon.
   Method Literature survey to identify historical trends.
   Results Mass sociogenic illness mirrors prominent social concerns, changing in relation to context and circumstance. Prior to 1900, reports are dominated by episodes of motor symptoms typified by dissociation, histrionics and psychomotor agitation incubated in an environment of preexisting tension, Twentieth-century reports feature anxiety symptoms that are triggered by sudden exposure to an anxiety-generating agent, most commonly an innocuous odour or food poisoning rumours. From the early 1980s to the present there has been an increasing presence of chemical and biological terrorism themes, climaxing in a sudden shift since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the USA.
   Conclusions A broad understanding of the history of mass sociogenic illness and a knowledge of episode characteristics are useful in the more rapid recognition and treatment of outbreaks.

AB  - A lucid dream is a dream during which the dreamer becomes aware of the fact that they are experiencing a dream. The higher awareness and cognitive traits which accompany lucid dreams offer individuals a unique opportunity to use this practice to rehearse waking skills. This scoping review aimed to summarize existing evidence on the effectiveness of lucid dreaming practice (LDP) on the performance of waking skills and used a meta-analytical approach to estimate an overall effect of LDP. A total of seven studies were reviewed. Findings indicate that LDP can improve waking performance of motor tasks of a variety of nature with an overall medium positive effect size of .483 (p = .095). LDP environments appear to be suitable for the practice of waking tasks however practitioners should be aware that perception may at times be distorted from wakefulness. Dream distractions may also be encountered which may impair dream practice and have a negative effect on subsequent performance. A lack of empirical evidence within the literature was identified. Challenges with conducting LDP research are discussed and recommendations for future research are proposed.

AB  - The lateral habenula(LHb) is emerging as a crucial structure capable of conveying rewarding and aversive information. Recent evidence indicates that a rapid increase in the activity of LHb neurons drives negative states and avoidance. Furthermore, the hyperexcitability of neurons in the LHb, especially those projecting to the midbrain, may represent an important cellular correlate for neuropsychiatric disorders like depression and drug addiction. Despite the recent insights regarding the implications of the LHb in the context of reward and aversion, the exact nature of the synaptic and cellular players regulating LHb neuronal functions remains largely unknown. Here we focus on the synaptic and cellular physiology of LHb neurons. First, we discuss the properties of excitatory transmission and the implications of glutamate receptors for long-term synaptic plasticity; second, we review the features of GABAergic transmission onto LHb neurons; and finally, we describe the contribution that neuromodulators such as dopamine (DA) and seroton in may have for LHb neuronal physiology. We relate these findings to the role that the LHb can play in processing aversive and rewarding stimuli, both in health and disease states.

AB  - The toxic and persistent nature of cadmium (Cd) in the environment has become a matter of concern with its drastic increase in the concentrations over past few decades. Among the various techniques, the microbial remediation has been accepted as an effective decontamination tool for environmental applications, which is sustainable over a period of time. The Cd decontamination potential of the microbes depends on various internal and external factors that play a crucial role in selection of the microbes for application in a particular environment. Thus, it is important to understand the role of these factors for optimal application of the microbes. This study provides an insight into the mechanisms involved between the microbes and the environmental Cd. The study also briefly reviews the mathematical models that have been used to predict the remediation potential of the microbes and the kinetics involved during the process. A critical analysis of the recent advancements in the techniques for use of bacteria, fungi, and algal cells to remove Cd has been also presented in the manuscript.

To this end, firstly, I examine research on the presence of these abilities in animals, and the biologically ancient nature of emotional vocalizations. Secondly, I review research attesting to the facilitating effect of emotional voice intonation on these abilities in humans. Thirdly, building on these studies in animals and humans, and through taking an evolutionary perspective, I provide insights for future empirical work on the facilitating effect of emotional intonation on these three processes in animals and preverbal humans. In this work, I highlight the importance of a comparative approach to investigate language evolution empirically. This review supports Darwin's hypothesis, according to which the ability to express emotions through voice modulation was a key step in the evolution of spoken language.

AB  - Organisms have evolved a spectrum of strategies that facilitate survival in the face of adverse environmental conditions. In order to make full use of the unfavorable resources of nature, human beings usually impose selective pressures to breed phenotypic traits that can survive in adverse environments. Animals are frequently under attack by biotic stress, such as bacterial and viral infections, while plants are more often subjected to abiotic stress, including high salinity, drought, and cold. In response to these diverse stresses, animals and plants initiate wide-ranging changes in gene expression by altering regulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional activities. Recent studies have identified a number of key responsive components that promote survival of animals and plants in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Importantly, with recent developments in genome-editing technology based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, manipulation of genetic elements to generate stress-resistant animals and plants has become both feasible and cost-effective. Herein, we review important mechanisms that govern the response of organisms to biotic and abiotic stresses with the aim of applying our understanding to the agriculture and animal husbandry industries.

AB  - In healthy cell, inappropriate accumulation of poor or damaged proteins is prevented by cellular quality control system. Autophagy and ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) provides regular cytoprotection against proteotoxicity induced by abnormal or disruptive proteins. E3 ubiquitin ligases are crucial components in this defense mechanism. Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the Really Interesting New Gene (RING) finger family, plays a pivotal role in many biological and cellular mechanisms. Previous findings indicate that lack of functions of MGRN1 can cause spongiform neurodegeneration, congenital heart defects, abnormal left-right patterning, and mitochondrial dysfunctions in mice brains. However, the detailed molecular pathomechanism of MGRN1 in cellular functions and diseases is not well known. This article comprehensively represents the molecular nature, characterization, and functions of MGRN1; we also summarize possible beneficiary aspects of this novel E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we review recent literature on the role of MGRN1 in the neuro-pathobiological mechanisms, with precise focus on the processes of neurodegeneration, and thereby propose new lines of potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Synapses are the building blocks of neuronal networks. Spines, the postsynaptic elements, are morphologically the most plastic part of the synapse. It is thought that spine plasticity underlies learning and memory processes, driven by kinases and cytoskeleton protein reorganization. Spine strength depends primarily on the number of incorporated glutamatergic receptors, which are more numerous in larger spines. Intrinsic and circadian fluctuations, occurring independently of presynaptic stimulation, demonstrate the native instability of spines. Despite innate spine instability some spines remain intact lifelong. Threats to spine survival are reduced by physical and mental activity, and declining sensory input, conditions characteristic for aging. Large spines are considered less vulnerable than thin spines, and in the older brain large spines are more abundant, whereas the thin spines are functionally weaker. It can be speculated that this shift towards memory spines contributes to enhanced retention of remote memories typically seen in the elderly. Gaining further insight in spine plasticity regulation, its homeostatic nature and how to maintain spine health will be important future research topics in Neuroscience. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current study reviewed and synthesized studies employing a person-centered approach to studying achievement goals. Towards this end, a common labeling scheme was developed for goal profiles. Ten profile types were identified across studies and compared via meta-analytic techniques in terms of academic motivation, social/emotional well-being, engagement, and achievement. Two theoretically relevant profiles-Mastery High and Approach High-were relatively common and adaptive across all outcomes; the Performance/Work Avoidance Low profile was also generally adaptive. The Average All Goals and Low All Goals profiles, conversely, were consistently maladaptive. The pursuit of performance-approach, performance-avoidance, or work-avoidance goals alone was rare and generally maladaptive except with respect to achievement. Supplementary moderator analyses revealed that school level and goal model-but not analytic technique-were important variables to consider regarding both the prevalence and adaptive nature of goal profiles. This research synthesis provides insight into longstanding debates within the achievement goal literature and highlights the potential of person-centered analyses to complement findings from more predominant variable-centered research.

AB  - Background: The recurrent nature of Bipolar Disorder (BD) is the main cause of disability associated with the illness. Despite the proliferation of drugs approved for the maintenance phase of BD, the relapse rate is still high. The combination of drugs, especially the potentiation of mood-stabilizers with second-generation antipsychotics, may reduce the risk of relapse and rehospitalization. However, studies on the efficacy of specific combinations are scarce. Case presentation: The clinical case of a 28-year-old woman involuntarily admitted to an Acute Psychiatric Unit is presented. She suffers a manic postpartum episode with mixed and psychotic features. During the hospitalization, she is successfully treated with a combination of lithium plus olanzapine. In the discussion, a concise narrative review of the scientific literature on the efficacy of such a combination in BD is made. Conclusion: The association of lithium plus olanzapine is one of the combinations with most evidence on its efficacy in BD, especially in mixed-featured episodes. Tolerability concerns should not be an obstacle to its use, although they must be considered.

AB  - According to Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), one-third of food produced globally for human consumption (nearly 1.3 billion tonnes) is lost along the food supply chain. In many countries food waste is currently landfilled or incinerated together with other combustible municipal wastes for possible recovery of energy. However, these two options are facing more and more economic and environmental stresses. Due to its organic-and nutrient-rich nature, theoretically food waste can be converted to valuable products (e.g. bio-products such as methane, hydrogen, ethanol, enzymes, organic acids, chemicals and fuels) through various fermentation processes. Such conversion of food waste is potentially more profitable than its conversion to animal feed or transportation fuel. Food waste valorisation has therefore gained interest, with value added bio-products such as methane, hydrogen, ethanol, enzymes, organic acids, chemicals, and fuels. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide information on the food waste situation with emphasis on Asia-Pacific countries and the state of the art food waste processing technologies to produce enzymes.

AB  - Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent a fraction of petroleum hydrocarbons and are currently one of the foremost sources of generating energy in today's contemporary society. However, evidence highlighted in this review show that PAH pollution, as a result of oil spills, hazardous PAH-contaminated working environments and technologies which do not efficiently utilise fuels, as well as natural sources of emissions (e.g. forest fires) may have significant health implications for all taxa. The extent of damage to organisms from PAH exposure is dependent on numerous factors including degree and type of PAH exposure, nature of the environment contaminated (i.e. terrestrial or aquatic), the ability of an organism to relocate to pristine environments, type and sensitivity of organism to specific hydrocarbon fractions and ability of the organism to metabolise different PAH fractions. The review highlights the fact that studies on the potential damage of PAHs should be carried out using mixtures of hydrocarbons as opposed to individual hydrocarbon fractions due to the scarcity of individual fractions being a sole contaminant. Furthermore, potential damage of PAH-contaminated sites should be assessed using an entire ecological impact outlook of the affected area.

AB  - Cognitive impairment may interfere with an individual's ability to function independently in the community and may increase the risk of becoming and remaining homeless. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature on memory deficits among people who are homeless in order to gain a better understanding of its nature, causes and prevalence. Studies that measured memory functioning as an outcome among a sample of homeless persons were included. Data on sampling, outcome measures, facet of memory explored and prevalence of memory impairment were extracted from all selected research studies. Included studies were evaluated using a critical appraisal process targetted for reviewing prevalance studies. Eleven studies were included in the review. Verbal memory was the most commonly studied facet of memory. Potential contributing factors to memory deficits among persons who are homeless were explored in seven studies. Memory deficits were common among the samples of homeless persons studied. However, there was a great deal of variation in the methodology and quality of the included studies. Conceptualisations of "homelessness" also differed across studies. There is a need for more controlled research using validated neuropsychological tools to evaluate memory impairment among people who are homeless.

AB  - Community Treatment Orders (CTOs) require outpatients to adhere to treatment and permit rapid hospitalisation when necessary. They have become a clinical and policy solution to repeated hospital readmissions despite some strong opposition and the contested nature of published evidence. In this article, we appraise the current literature on CTOs from the viewpoint of Evidence-Based Medicine and discuss the way forward for using and researching CTOs.
   Non-randomised outcome studies show conflicting results, but their lack of standardisation of methods and measures makes it difficult to draw conclusions. In contrast, all three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted concur in their findings that CTOs do not impact on hospital outcomes. No systematic review or meta-analysis has identified any clear clinical advantage to CTOs.
   The evidence-base does not support the use of CTOs in their current form. Involuntary clinical interventions must conform to the highest standard of evidence-based care. To enable clinicians to take an evidence-based approach and to settle remaining uncertainties about the current evidence, high-quality RCTs should be designed and undertaken, using standardised outcome measures.

AB  - Research on future-oriented mental time travel (FMTT) is highly active yet somewhat unruly. I believe this is due, in large part, to the complexity of both the tasks used to test FMTT and the concepts involved. Extraordinary care is a necessity when grappling with such complex and perplexing metaphysical constructs as self and time and their co-instantiation in memory. In this review, I first discuss the relation between future mental time travel and types of memory (episodic and semantic). I then examine the nature of both the types of self-knowledge assumed to be projected into the future and the types of temporalities that constitute projective temporal experience. Finally, I argue that a person lacking episodic memory should nonetheless be able to imagine a personal future by virtue of (1) the fact that semantic, as well as episodic, memory can be self-referential, (2) autonoetic awareness is not a prerequisite for FMTT, and (3) semantic memory does, in fact, enable certain forms of personally oriented FMTT.

AB  - The care of people with first-episode mania has been overlooked in comparison with the care of patients with other non-affective psychoses, despite evidence suggesting targeted treatments might be of benefit for this patient group. In this Personal View, we outline the general epidemiology of first-episode mania in the context of bipolar disorder, the natural history of mania (with an emphasis on its recurrent nature), current evidence for pharmacological, psychological, and service-level interventions, current guidelines for the treatment of first-episode mania, and provide a patient's point of view of the care pathway (appendix). We note the paucity of high-quality evidence for interventions in first-episode mania and the lack of agreement among treatment guidelines in relation to treatment, especially maintenance treatment. We suggest that, based on high morbidity and clinical need, research evidence to inform guideline development is necessary, and in the interim, clearer guidance on treatment and diagnosis should be given; specifically, we have suggested that patients should be cared for within a first-episode psychosis service, when such a service exists.

AB  - Cumulative risk assessments (CRAs) examine potential risks posed by exposure to multiple and sometimes disparate environmental stressors. CRAs are more resource intensive than single chemical assessments, and pose additional challenges and sources of uncertainty. CRAs may examine the impact of several factors on risk, including exposure magnitude and timing, chemical mixture composition, as well as physical, biological, or psychosocial stressors. CRAs are meant to increase the relevance of risk assessments, providing decision makers with information based on real world exposure scenarios that improve the characterization of actual risks and hazards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has evaluated a number of CRAs, performed by or commissioned for the Agency, to seek insight into CRA concepts, methods, and lessons learned. In this article, ten case studies and five issue papers on key CRA topics are examined and a set of lessons learned are identified for CRA implementation. The lessons address the iterative nature of CRAs, importance of considering vulnerability, need for stakeholder engagement, value of a tiered approach, new methods to assess multiroute exposures to chemical mixtures, and the impact of geographical scale on approach and purpose.

AB  - We review recent literature on the social psychology of climate change, focusing on the application of social identity theory and self-categorization theory. These two theories, together forming the social identity approach, point to ways in which collective identities influence responses to climate change. Recent research demonstrates that collective identities influence attitudes, beliefs and behavior relevant to climate change, and they do this through processes such as group norms and social influence, collective efficacy, and collective emotions. The SIA suggests that, in general, people are motivated to protect the identity and status of their ingroups. Indeed, recent studies find that groups who are of higher status, and thus have more to gain from protecting the status quo, tend to be less concerned about addressing climate change than lower status groups, who are more likely to be harmed by climate change. However, individuals from both high and low status groups will be more likely to work towards pro-environmental social change when they perceive current social systems that perpetuate climate change as illegitimate and when they can imagine cognitive alternatives to the status quo, where humans have a more sustainable relationship with nature.

AB  - Among the various dominantly-inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), at least seven of them belong to the polyglutamine disease group and are caused by glutamine-coding CAG triplet repeat expansion. The expanded coding CAG repeat translates into a polyglutamine stretch in the disease protein, which leads to late-onset and progressive neurodegeneration. Expanded polyglutamine adopts a misfolded protein conformation, and is itself a cellular stressor which induces robust heat shock response (HSR). Under polyglutamine stress, heat shock proteins ( Hsps) are produced in neurons to assist refolding and/or promote the degradation of misfolded proteins. Along with the progressive nature of polyglutamine degeneration, a gradual decline of HSR in degenerating neurons was observed. Such kind of reduction can be observed in a large family of hsp gene expression, including hsp22, 26, 27, and 70. This underscores an intimate relationship between the inducibility of hsp gene expression and the disease progression. In this review, we describe the current understandings of hsp gene dysregulation in polyglutamine disease.

AB  - Neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) is an important subject of neuroimmunological research. Emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is a key player in various neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and CNS injury. Neuroinflammation is a complex and well-orchestrated process by various groups of glial cells in CNS and peripheral immune cells. The cross-talks between various groups of glial cells in CNS neuroinflammation is an extremely complex and dynamic process which resembles a well-orchestrated symphony. However, the understanding of how glial cells interact with each other to shape the distinctive immune responses of the CNS remains limited. In this review, we will discuss the joint actions of glial cells in three phases of neuroinflammation, including initiation, progression, and prognosis, the three movements of the symphony, as the role of each type of glial cells in neuroinflammation depends on the nature of inflammatory cues and specific course of diseases. This perspective of glial cells in neuroinflammation might provide helpful clues to the development of the early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of the various CNS diseases.

AB  - Research in psychology and cognitive science has consistently demonstrated the importance of emotion in a wide range of everyday judgments, including moral judgment. Most current accounts of moral judgment hold that emotion plays an important role, but the nature and extent of this role are still debated. We outline three increasingly strong claims about the role of emotion in moral judgment and assess the evidence for each. According to the first and least controversial claim, emotions follow from moral judgments, such that witnessing immorality can lead to negative emotions and witnessing moral virtue can lead to positive ones. According to the second claim, emotions amplify moral judgments, for instance, by making immoral acts seem even more immoral. Finally, on the last claim, emotions can actually moralize nonmoral behaviorsthat is, they give nonmoral acts a moral status. Although this claim seems to be the most intriguing one theoretically, empirical support for it is still very limited. In this review, we discuss research findings that are in line with each of these views, we highlight recurring themes across these three categories of evidence, and we identify some open questions and areas for future research.

AB  - Although amygdala activity has been purported to be modulated by affective and non-affective factors, considerable controversy remains on its precise functional nature. We conducted a meta-analysis of 385 functional neuroimaging studies of emotional processing, examining the effects of experimental characteristics on the probability of detecting amygdala activity. All emotional stimuli were associated with higher probability of amygdala activity than neutral stimuli. Comparable effects were observed for most negative and positive emotions, however there was a higher probability of activation for fear and disgust relative to happiness. The level of attentional processing affected amygdala activity, as passive processing was associated with a higher probability of activation than active task instructions. Gustatory-olfactory and visual stimulus modalities increased the probability of activation relative to internal stimuli. Aversive learning increased the probability of amygdala activation as well. There was some evidence of hemispheric specialization with a relative left-lateralization for stimuli containing language and a relative right-lateralization for masked stimuli. Methodological variables, such as type of analysis and magnet strength, were also independent predictors of amygdala. activation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dementia is a disorder that occurs as result of a neurode-generative process in brain, and usually is chronic or progressive by nature. Most descriptions of senile dementia date back to Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, Alzheimer described the first patient, Auguste Deter, who suffered from the disorder that later became known as Alzheimer's disease. Although, the history of the disease before 1906 is quite rich, little has been said about the contributions of ancient and medieval physicians to the understanding of dementia. Over the centuries, the concept of senile dementia changed from an inevitable mental decline with aging, to different sets of clinical features with narrow limits of diagnosis of a disease in its own right. Documentation of the historical origins of prevention, diagnosis, and therapies of dementia would make an important contribution to a more complete understanding of this pathological degeneration of dementia. The present review focuses on the contributions of Avicenna (AD 980-1037) to the development of diagnosis and the discovery of etiology of different forms of dementia, with the goal of revealing the extent to which dementia was understood in the golden age of Islam in Persia.

AB  - Developments in cognitive neuroscience are providing new insights into the nature of normative judgment. Traditional views in such disciplines as philosophy, religion, law, psychology and economics have differed over the role and usefulness of intuition and emotion in judging blameworthiness. Cognitive psychology and neurobiology provide new tools and methods for studying questions of normative judgment. Recently, a consensus view has emerged, which recognizes important roles for emotion and intuition and which suggests that normative judgment is a distributed process in the brain. Testing this approach through lesion and scanning studies has linked a set of brain regions to such judgment, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus. Better models of emotion and intuition will help provide further clarification of the processes involved. The study of law and justice is less well developed. We advance a model of law in the brain which suggests that law can recruit a wider variety of sources of information and paths of processing than do the intuitive moral responses that have been studied so far. We propose specific hypotheses and lines of further research that could help test this approach.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive loss of motoneurons and degradation of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). Consistent with the dying back hypothesis of motoneuron degeneration the decline in synaptic function initiates from the presynaptic terminals in ALS. Oxidative stress is a major contributory factor to ALS pathology and affects the presynaptic transmitter releasing machinery. Indeed, in ALS mouse models nerve terminals are sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) suggesting that oxidative stress, along with compromised mitochondria and increased intracellular Ca2 amplifies the presynaptic decline in NMJ. This initial dysfunction is followed by a neurodegeneration induced by inflammatory agents and loss of trophic support. To develop effective therapeutic approaches against ALS, it is important to identify the mechanisms underlying the initial pathological events. Given the role of oxidative stress in ALS, targeted antioxidant treatments could be a promising therapeutic approach. However, the complex nature of ALS and failure of monotherapies suggest that an antioxidant therapy should be accompanied by anti-inflammatory interventions to enhance the restoration of the redox balance.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional condition of the bowel that is diagnosed using clinical criteria. This paper discusses the nature of the diagnostic process for IBS and how this impacts epidemiological measurements. Depending on the diagnostic criteria employed, IBS affects around 11% of the population globally. Around 30% of people who experience the symptoms of IBS will consult physicians for their IBS symptoms. These people do not have significantly different abdominal symptoms to those who do not consult, but they do have greater levels of anxiety and lower quality of life. Internationally, there is a female predominance in the prevalence of IBS. There is 25% less IBS diagnosed in those over 50 years and there is no association with socioeconomic status. IBS aggregates within families and the genetic and sociological factors potentially underlying this are reviewed. Patients diagnosed with IBS are highly likely to have other functional disease and have more surgery than the general population. There is no evidence that IBS is associated with an increased mortality risk. The epidemiological evidence surrounding these aspects of the natural history is discussed.

AB  - Our paper provides an overview of current stigma discourse, the origins and nature of the stigma associated with mental illnesses, stigmatization by health providers, and approaches to stigma reduction. This is a narrative review focusing on seminal works from the social and psychological literature, with selected qualitative and quantitative studies and international policy documents to highlight key points. Stigma discourse has increasingly moved toward a human rights model that views stigma as a form of social oppression resulting from a complex sociopolitical process that exploits and entrenches the power imbalance between people who stigmatize and those who are stigmatized. People who have a mental illness have identified mental health and health providers as key contributors to the stigmatization process and worthy targets of antistigma interventions. Six approaches to stigma reduction are described: education, protest, contact-based education, legislative reform, advocacy, and stigma self-management. Stigma denigrates the value of people who have a mental illness and the social and professional support systems designed to support them. It creates inequities in funding and service delivery that undermine recovery and full social participation. Mental health professionals have often been identified as part of the problem, but they can redress this situation by becoming important partners in antistigma work.

AB  - Approximately one quarter of all strokes in humans occur in white matter, and the progressive nature of white matter lesions often results in severe physical and mental disability. Unlike cortical grey matter stroke, the pathology of white matter stroke revolves around disrupted connectivity and injured axons and glial cells, rather than neuronal cell bodies. Consequently, the mechanisms behind ischemic damage to white matter elements, the regenerative responses of glial cells and their signaling pathways, all differ significantly from those in grey matter. Development of effective therapies for white matter stroke would require an enhanced understanding of the complex cellular and molecular interactions within the white matter, leading to the identification of new therapeutic targets. This review will address the unique properties of the axon-glia unit during white matter stroke, describe the challenging process of promoting effective white matter repair, and discuss recently-identified signaling pathways which may hold potential targets for repair in this disease.

AB  - The prevalence of neurodegenerative disease has increased as an outcome of the aging population, and effective clinical treatments for such diseases are lacking. Endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction has been iden-tified as a causative factor in various neurological disorders. The inositol-requiring enzyme 1a (IRE1a)-X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) signaling pathway is the most conserved branch of the unfolded protein response, func-tioning in both physiological and pathological processes. The modulation of IRE1a-XBP1 signaling via genetic manipulation or drug administration has opposite effects in multiple disease models of neurodegeneration, indi-cating the complex and heterogeneous role of IRE1a-XBP1 signaling among neurodegenerative diseases and even at different stages within the same disease. Herein, we focus on the multifaceted nature of IRE1a-XBP1 sig-naling and provide a detailed overview of the latest findings regarding its biological relevance in brain physiology and neurodegenerative disease pathobiology. Moreover, the possible pharmacological targets in the IRE1a-XBP1 axis are discussed.(c) 2022 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Living organisms need to be able to cope with environmental challenges and other stressors and mount adequate responses that are as varied as the spectrum of those challenges. Understanding how the multi-layered biological stress responses become integrated across and between different levels of organization within an organism can provide a different perspective on the nature and inter-relationship of complex systems in health and disease. We here compare two concepts which have been very influential in stress research: Selye's 'Genera/Adaptation Syndrome' and Sies's 'Oxidative Stress' paradigm. We show that both can be embraced within a more general framework of 'change and response'. The 'Reactive Species Interactome' allows each of these to be considered as distinct but complementary aspects of the same system, representative of roles at different levels of organization within a functional hierarchy. The versatile chemistry of sulfur - exemplified by hydrogen sulfide, glutathione and proteinous cysteine thiols - enriched by its interactions with reactive oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur species, would seem to sit at the heart of the 'Redox Code' and underpin the ability of complex organisms to cope with stress.

AB  - The uncanny valley effect (UVE) is a negative emotional response experienced when encountering entities that appear almost human. Research on the UVE typically investigates individual, or collections of, near human entities but may be prone to methodological circularity unless the properties that give rise to the emotional response are appropriately defined and quantified. In addition, many studies do not sufficiently control the variation in human likeness portrayed in stimulus images, meaning that the nature of stimuli that elicit the UVE is also not well defined or quantified. This article describes design criteria for UVE research to overcome the above problems by measuring three variables (human likeness, eeriness, and emotional response) and by using stimuli spanning the artificial to human continuum. These criteria allow results to be plotted and compared with the hypothesized uncanny valley curve and any effect observed can be quantified. The above criteria were applied to the methods used in a subset of existing UVE studies. Although many studies made use of some of the necessary measurements and controls, few used them all. The UVE is discussed in relation to this result and research methodology more broadly.

AB  - Genetic influences on personality differences are ubiquitous, but their nature is not well understood. A theoretical framework might help, and can be provided by evolutionary genetics. We assess three evolutionary genetic mechanisms that could explain genetic variance in personality differences: selective neutrality, mutation-selection balance, and balancing selection. Based on evolutionary genetic theory and empirical results from behaviour genetics and personality psychology, we conclude that selective neutrality is largely irrelevant, that mutation-selection balance seems best at explaining genetic variance in intelligence, and that balancing selection by environmental heterogeneity seems best at explaining genetic variance in personality traits. We propose a general model of heritable personality differences that conceptualises intelligence as fitness components and personality traits as individual reaction norms of genotypes across environments, with different fitness consequences in different environmental niches. We also discuss the place of mental health in the model. This evolutionary genetic framework highlights the role of gene-environment interactions in the study of personality, yields new insight into the person-situation-debate and the structure of personality, and has practical implications for both quantitative and molecular genetic studies of personality.

AB  - Many challenging ethical questions come with the scientific efforts to understand the nature and treatment of schizophrenia. The empirical study of ethical aspects of schizophrenia research has sought to clarify and resolve many of these questions. In this article we provide an overview of the existing data-based literature on schizophrenia research ethics and outline directions for future inquiry. We examine 5 broad categories of inquiry into the ethics of schizophrenia research: (1) Scientific designs (eg, placebo-controlled studies and medication-free intervals, prodromal and high-risk research, and genetics research); (2) informed consent and decision-making capacity, including assessment of decisional abilities, as well as intervention studies; (3) understanding and perceptions of risk and benefit (including the therapeutic misconception); (4) influences on research participation (including voluntarism, altruism, and other motivations); and (5) key participant safeguards, such as protocol review and participant advocates. We discuss how empirical work in each of these areas answers certain questions and raises new ones. Finally, we highlight important gaps in our understanding of ethically relevant aspects of schizophrenia research and offer a specific research agenda for empirical ethics.

AB  - This paper stresses the need for a sound conceptual specification of research constructs prior to fitting them to explanatory models. It emphasizes that in addressing the conceptual level of the predictive validity framework [Libby, R., Bloomfield, R., & Nelson, M. (2002). Experimental research in financial accounting. Accounting, Organizations and Society, 27, 775-810], special attention must be paid to two issues: (1) the production of a specific agreed-upon meaning and domain for each construct of interest; and (2) the specification and conceptual justification of the nature and direction of the epistemic relationships between constructs, dimensions and indicators (i.e., reflective vs. formative models; latent vs. emergent models). The paper highlights the importance of both issues especially in the case of practice-defined variables, and it provides guidelines on how to address both aspects of conceptual specification. While the issues raised are pertinent to many research areas, the paper concentrates on the implications for management accounting and control systems (MACS) research, using interactive use of control systems [Simons, R. (1995a). Levers of control. Boston: Harvard Business School Press] to illustrate how researchers should go about specifying meaning and epistemic relationships in MACS research.

AB  - The popularity of smartphones is undeniable in nearly all facets of society. Despite the many benefits attributed to the technology, concern has grown over the potential for excessive smartphone use to become problematic in nature. Due to the growing concerns surrounding the recognized and unrecognized implications of smartphone use, great efforts have been made through research to evaluate, label and identify problematic smartphone use mostly through the development and administration of scales assessing the behavior. This study examines 78 existing validated scales that have been developed over the past 13 years to measure, identify or characterize excessive or problematic smartphone use by evaluating their theoretical foundations and their psychometric properties. Our review determined that, despite an abundance of self-report scales examining the construct, many published scales lack sufficient internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Additionally, there is a lack of research supporting the theoretical foundation of many of the scales evaluated. Future research is needed to better characterize problematic smartphone use so that assessment tools can be more efficiently developed to evaluate the behavior in order to avoid the excessive publication of seemingly redundant assessment tools.

AB  - Our objective was to examine the neurobiology of social phobia from the perspectives of basic sciences, genetics, immunology, neuroendocrinology, neurotransmission and neuroimaging and to provide an integrated understanding of social phobia in the framework of a hypothetical neural circuit. Family and twin studies provide evidence that social phobia is heritable with significant genetic influence, and molecular genetics offers possibilities in understanding the nature of the trait that is transmitted. The biologic distinctiveness of social phobia from anxiety disorders and physiological validation of differences between generalized and discrete social phobia subtypes have been implicated in genetic, naturalistic and chemical challenge studies. Evidence of specific dysfunction of dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic and GABAergic (gamma -aminobutyric acid) neurotransmitter systems has been presented in animal models, challenge studies and treatment investigations. Preliminary neuroimaging research supports previous studies suggesting striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in social phobia and suggests the importance of functional circuits. A neural circuit involving the striatum, thalamus, amygdala and cortical structures may provide a framework for integrating much of the current knowledge on the neurobiology of social phobia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Open plan or open space office has become increasingly popular but those who promote the concept seldom refer to health studies or workers' perceptions of a change in office layout towards an open space arrangement.
   OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on open plan or open space office layouts in terms of facilities management (FM) with users' perceptions in mind and to obtain opinions of users of open space offices for a better appreciation of the FM issues.
   METHODS: A literature search of research papers from 2007 in journals using the keywords "open plan office" and "open space office" plus "health", first in the titles then in the text, was carried out. Thirty-two of those papers, accessible by the authors' institutions, were consulted together with 5 other works in the Harvard Business Review. The review consulted but excluded papers and reports published or sponsored by commercial firms that were in favour of open space layouts. Case studies were conducted by face to face meetings in confidence with workers in the middle managements of twelve Hong Kong organisations known as friends to two of the authors. Problems as seen by staff are reported and discussed.
   RESULTS: The literature review reveals that apart from writing that promotes the use of an open plan office layout, a host of scientific works point to the problems of perceived dissatisfaction with such a layout, the nature of the dissatisfaction tending to depend on the actual design. Most workers interviewed disliked the new style open plan layouts, which points to the necessity of consulting workers when such changes are contemplated, as well as monitoring the results of the change once it is in place whether against workers' wishes or with their support. There is a need for a number of facility arrangements in making a change to open plan that ensures that worker needs for proper lighting, privacy, and indoor health will be met.
   CONCLUSIONS: If the aim of a change to an open plan arrangement is to promote collegial communications in office, the study sheds light on the extent to which such arrangements may not in practice be suitable for achieving the aim. It follows that further, more specifically sociological studies of workers' job satisfaction and emotional health in open plan office settings would be worth doing.

AB  - As governments and service agencies across the world grapple with chronic rates of homelessness and housing instability, there is a growing need to understand the value that providing secure, stable housing brings to the lives of people who are homeless and the broader community. The complex nature of homelessness is revealed across a variety of academic fields including planning, pharmacology, urban affairs, housing policy, nutrition, psychiatry, sociology, public health, urban health, and criminology. We undertook a scoping review according to PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) that mapped the breadth and scale of the evidence-base and identified themes and gaps. We identified 476 reports and after excluding duplicates and ones that did not relate to our criteria, were left with 100 studies from eight countries. Each of them identified benefits and/or changes that occurred when people experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity transitioned into a secure, stable home. Outcomes measured were distributed across a range of domains including physical and mental health, well-being, mortality rates, criminal justice interaction, service use, and cost-effectiveness. Findings varied by degree but overwhelmingly found improvements in all domains once people were permanently housed. Housing provided a foundation for people to envisage a better life and make plans for the future. As one woman who had fled a violent home was quoted as saying: "housing made everything else possible." The research identified savings for taxpayers and the wider community once people left homelessness for the stability of a permanent home, even after factoring in the cost of housing and rental help. We found numerous gaps. For example, there was a prevalence of studies that focused on those who are visibly homeless, in particular chronically homeless men with mental illness and/or substance use issues. Much less research looked at women whose patterns of homelessness are more varied and even less at homelessness involving children and families. Women who had left domestic and family violence were investigated in a very small number of studies and sample sizes were small. Few reports undertook the complex task of quantifying and comparing cost savings. Other notable gaps were older women, older people more generally, refugees, recent migrants, veterans, Indigenous people and those with a disability.

AB  - The multifactorial nature of schizophrenia and the wide-ranging impact of the illness on the patient, their family, carers and healthcare providers mean that clinicians must be prepared to take a holistic approach to treatment. It is widely recognized that a patient's beliefs about their treatment and their experiences of schizophrenia can be very important in determining both attitude towards treatment compliance and behaviour in response to symptoms of the illness and environmental stress. Antipsychotic therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia. However, there is now growing evidence to support the benefits of non-pharmacological interventions, when used in combination with antipsychotic treatment, in relieving symptoms, improving occupational and social functioning and reducing the risk of relapse. In particular, these interventions appear to provide benefits in coping shills and social and vocational functioning, as reflected in a greater ability to function independently and an improvement in quality of life. Systematic assessment of non-pharmacological therapies in schizophrenia is still a relatively new science, but there is goon evidence that psychosocial therapies, such as family intervention therapy, cognitive-behaviour therapy and compliance therapy can markedly change a patient's behaviour and improve adherence to treatment and hence interaction with families, carers and healthcare providers. Psychosocial interventions can be implemented from the first episode of psychosis onwards and can contribute to an improved overall outcome in schizophrenia, to patients being more satisfied with their treatment, and to a better quality of life for the patient and their family. Initial comprehensive assessment will involve regular contact with the patient and opens channels for an ongoing dialogue. It is important that these discussions with the patients and their families and carers not only cover the need for social, emotional and behavioural support but include regular discussion of the acceptability and side-effects of antipsychotic treatment so that problems can be identified and addressed promptly. While the importance of non-pharmacological interventions in improving the quality of patient care is becoming widely accepted, access to psychological, psycho-educational and family support is by no means universal in current clinical practice. It is important that these services, provided by appropriately trained personnel, are mane available to all patients for whom they may be appropriate.

AB  - Purpose Aging and mental illness both represent significant public health challenges for incarcerated people in the USA. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the vulnerabilities of incarcerated people because of the risks of infectious disease transmission in correctional facilities. Focusing on older adults with mental illness, this paper aims to examine efforts to decarcerate US correctional facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether these approaches may lead to sustainable reforms beyond the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach A narrative literature review was conducted using numerous online resources, including PubMed, Google Scholar and LexisNexis. Search terms used included "decarceration pandemic," "COVID-19 decarceration," "aging mental illness decarceration," "jails prisons decarceration," "early release COVID-19" and "correctional decarceration pandemic," among others. Given the rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, this narrative literature review included content from not only scholarly articles and federal and state government publications but also relevant media articles and policy-related reports. The authors reviewed these sources collaboratively to synthesize a review of existing evidence and opinions on these topics and generate conclusions and policy recommendations moving forward. Findings To mitigate the risks of COVID-19, policymakers have pursued various decarceration strategies across the USA. Some efforts have focused on reducing inflow into correctional systems, including advising police to reduce numbers of arrests and limiting use of pretrial detention. Other policies have sought to increase outflow from correctional systems, such as facilitating early release of people convicted of nonviolent offenses or those nearing the end of their sentences. Given the well-known risks of COVID-19 among older individuals, age was commonly cited as a reason for diverting or expediting release of people from incarceration. In contrast, despite their vulnerability to complications from COVID-19, people with serious mental illness (SMI), particularly those with acute treatment needs, may have been less likely in some instances to be diverted or released early from incarceration. Originality/value Although much has been written about decarceration during the COVID-19 pandemic, little attention has been paid to the relevance of these efforts for older adults with mental illness. This paper synthesizes existing proposals and evidence while drawing attention to the public health implications of aging and SMI in US correctional settings and explores opportunities for decarceration of older adults with SMI beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objective. Cognitive biases can impact experts' judgments and decisions. We offer a broad descriptive model of how bias affects human judgment. Although studies have explored the role of cognitive biases and debiasing techniques in forensic mental health, we conducted the first systematic review to identify, evaluate, and summarize the findings. Hypotheses. Given the exploratory nature of this review, we did not test formal hypotheses. General research questions included the proportion of studies focusing on cognitive biases and/or debiasing, the research methods applied, the cognitive biases and debiasing strategies empirically studied in the forensic context, their effects on forensic mental health decisions, and effect sizes. Method. A systematic search of PsycINFO and Google Scholar resulted in 22 records comprising 23 studies in the United States, Canada, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. We extracted data on participants, context, methods, and results. Results. Most studies focused only on cognitive biases (k = 16, 69.6%), with fewer investigating ways to address them (k = 7, 30.4%). Of the 17 studies that tested for biases, 10 found significant effects (58.8%), four found partial effects (23.5%), and three found no effects (17.6%). Foci included general perceptions of biases; adversarial allegiance; bias blind spot; hindsight and confirmation biases; moral disengagement; primacy and recency effects; interview suggestibility; and cross-cultural, racial, and gender biases. Of the seven debiasing-related studies, nearly all (k = 6) focused at least in part on the general perception of debiasing strategies, with three testing for specific effects (i.e., cognitive bias training, consider-the-opposite, and introspection caution), two of which yielded significant effects. Conclusions. Considerable clinical and methodological heterogeneity limited quantitative comparability. Future research could build on the existing literature to develop or adapt effective debiasing strategies in collaboration with practitioners to improve the quality of forensic mental health decisions.
   Public Significance Statement Evidence of bias in forensic mental health emerged in ways consistent with what we know about human judgment broadly. We know less about how to debias judgments-an important frontier for future research. Better understanding how bias works and developing effective debiasing strategies tailored to the forensic mental health context hold promise for improving quality. Until then, we can use what we know now to limit bias in our work.

AB  - Alcohol use, particularly binge drinking (BD), is a major public health concern among adolescents. Recent national data show that the gender gap in alcohol use is lessening, and BD among girls is rising. Considering the increase in BD among adolescent girls, as well as females' increased risk of experiencing more severe biopsychosocial negative effects and consequences from BD, the current review sought to examine gender differences in risk factors for BD. The review highlights gender differences in (1) developmental-related neurobiological vulnerability to BD, (2) psychiatric comorbidity and risk phenotypes for BD, and (3) social-related risk factors for BD among adolescents, as well as considerations for BD prevention and intervention. Most of the information gleaned thus far has come from preclinical research. However, it is expected that, with recent advances in clinical imaging technology, neurobiological effects observed in lower mammals will be confirmed in humans and vice versa. A synthesis of the literature highlights that males and females experience unique neurobiological paths of development, and although there is debate regarding the specific nature of these differences, literature suggests that these differences in turn influence gender differences in psychiatric comorbidity and risk for BD. For one, girls are more susceptible to stress, depression, and other internalizing behaviors and, in turn, these symptoms contribute to their risk for BD. On the other hand, males, given gender differences across the lifespan as well as gender differences in development, are driven by an externalizing phenotype for risk of BD, in part, due to unique paths of neurobiological development that occur across adolescence. With respect to social domains, although social and peer influences are important for both adolescent males and females, there are gender differences. For example, girls may be more sensitive to pressure from peers to fit in and impress others, while male gender role stereotypes regarding BD may be more of a risk factor for boys. Given these unique differences in male and female risk for BD, further research exploring risk factors, as well as tailoring intervention and prevention, is necessary. Although recent research has tailored substance use intervention to target males and females, more literature on gender considerations in treatment for prevention and intervention of BD in particular is warranted.

AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment (CM) are major social and public health problems. Knowledge translation (KT) of best available research evidence has been suggested as a strategy to improve the care of those exposed to violence, however research on how best to promote the uptake and use of IPV and CM evidence for policy and practice is limited. Our research asked: 1) What is the extent of IPV/CM-specific KT research? 2) What KT strategies effectively translate IPV/CM knowledge? and 3) What are the barriers and facilitators relevant to translating IPV/CM-specific knowledge?
   Methods: We conducted an integrative review to summarize and synthesize the available evidence regarding IPV/CM-specific KT research. We employed multiple search methods, including database searches of Embase, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, and Medline (through April, 2013). Eligibility and quality assessments for each article were conducted by at least two team members. Included articles were analyzed quantitatively using descriptive statistics and qualitatively using descriptive content analysis.
   Results: Of 1230 identified articles, 62 were included in the review, including 5 review articles. KT strategies were generally successful at improving various knowledge/attitude and behavioural/behavioural intention outcomes, but the heterogeneity among KT strategies, recipients, study designs and measured outcomes made it difficult to draw specific conclusions. Four key themes were identified: existing measurement tools and promising/effective KT strategies are underused, KT efforts are rarely linked to health-related outcomes for those exposed to violence, there is a lack of evidence regarding the long-term effectiveness of KT interventions, and authors' inferences about barriers, facilitators, and effective/ineffective KT strategies are often not supported by data. The emotional and sometimes contested nature of the knowledge appears to be an important barrier unique to IPV/CM KT.
   Conclusions: To direct future KT in this area, we present a guiding framework that highlights the need for implementers to use/adapt promising KT strategies that carefully consider contextual factors, including the fact that content in IPV/CM may be more difficult to engage with than other health topics. The framework also provides guidance regarding use of measurement tools and designs to more effectively evaluate and report on KT efforts.

AB  - Despite advances in genetic research, causal variants affecting risk for schizophrenia remain poorly characterized, and the top 108 loci identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only 3.4% of variance in risk profiles. Such work is defining the highly complex nature of this condition, with omnigenic models of schizophrenia suggesting that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that altered expression of any "peripheral" gene in a relevant cell type has the capacity to indirectly modulate the expression of "core" schizophrenia-associated genes. This wealth of associated genes with small effect sizes makes identifying new druggable targets difficult, and current pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia can involve serious side effects. However, the fact that the majority of schizophrenia genome-wide associated variants fall within non-coding DNA is suggestive of their potential to modulate gene regulation. This would be consistent with risks that can be mediated in a "gene x environment" (G x E) manner. Stress and trauma can alter the regulation of key brain-related pathways over the lifetime of an individual, including modulation of brain development, and neurochemistry in the adult. Recent studies demonstrate a significant overlap between psychotic symptoms and trauma, ranging from prior trauma contributing to psychosis, as well as trauma in response to the experience of psychosis itself or in response to treatment. Given the known effects of trauma on both CNS gene expression and severity of psychosis symptoms, it may be that pharmacological treatment alone risks leaving individuals with a highly stressful and unresolved environmental component that continues to act in a "G x E" manner, with the likelihood that this would negatively impact recovery and relapse risk. This review aims to cover the recent advances elucidating the complex genetic architecture of schizophrenia, as well as the long-term effects of early life trauma on brain function and future mental health risk. Further, the evidence demonstrating the role of ongoing responses to trauma or heightened stress sensitivity, and their impact on the course of illness and recovery, is presented. Finally, the need for trauma-informed approaches and psychological therapy-based interventions is discussed, and a brief overview of the evidence to determine their utility is presented.

AB  - Exposure to toxic metals remains a widespread occupational and environmental problem in world. There have been a number of reports in the recent past suggesting an incidence of childhood lead poisoning and chronic arsenic poisoning due to contaminated drinking water in many areas of West Bengal in India and Bangladesh has become a national calamity. Low level metal exposure in humans is caused by air, food and water intake. Lead and arsenic generally interferes with a number of body functions such as the central nervous system (CNS), the haematopoietic system, liver and kidneys. Over the past few decades there has been growing awareness and concern that the toxic biochemical and functional effects are occurring at a lower level of metal exposure than those that produce overt clinical and pathological signs and symptoms. Despite many years of research, we are still far from an effective treatment of chronic plumbism and arsenicosis. Medical treatment of acute and chronic lead and arsenic toxicity is furnished by chelating agents. Chelating agents are organic compounds capable of linking together metal ions to form complex ring-like structures called chelates. They have been used clinically as antidotes for acute and chronic poisoning. 2, 3-dimercaprol (BAL) has long been the mainstay of chelation therapy for lead or arsenic poisoning. Meso 2, 3, -dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been tried successfully in animals as well as in a few cases of human lead and arsenic poisoning. DMSA could be a safe and effective method for treating lead or arsenic poisoning, but one of the major disadvantages of chelation with DMSA has been its inability to remove lead from the intracellular sites because of its lipophobic nature. Further, it does not provide protection in terms of clinical/biochemical recovery. A new trend in chelation therapy is to use combined treatment. This includes the use of structurally different chelators or a combination of an adjuvant and a chelator to provide better clinical/biochemical recovery in addition to lead mobilization. The present review article attempts to provide update information about the current strategies being adopted fora safe, effective and specific treatment for two major toxic metals or metalloid.

AB  - Assessment of a violent act committed by an offender with schizophrenia typically focuses on whether the act was due to distortions in thought or perception, i.e., delusions or hallucination. An important but less appreciated feature is the impulsivity of the act, which can have forensic and therapeutic implications. Here a modification of Barratt's classification of aggressive behavior is presented that includes premeditated (instrumental), medical (secondary), impulsive (expressive), and compulsive (instrumental and expressive) aggression. Violence due to a mental condition such as schizophrenia is considered medical, but even aggression motivated by delusions or hallucinations can also be characterized as impulsive, premeditated, or compulsive. Although research on aggression and schizophrenia is limited with regard to the impulsivity-premeditation dimension and difficult to compare, current evidence suggests this to be an important consideration in the assessment of aggression in individuals with schizophrenia, important both forensically and therapeutically. Future research on the impulsive-premeditated quality of aggressive acts by offenders with schizophrenia-research wherein aggressive behavior is defined, situational context is clarified, and diagnostic criteria are explicitly followed-should further refine our understanding of the nature of aggressive acts associated with schizophrenia. Findings from such research will undoubtedly inform assessment, treatment, and forensic relevance of schizophrenia-related physical aggression. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The term dark triad refers to the constellation of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. Over the past few years, the concept has gained momentum, with many researchers assuming that the dark triad is a prominent antecedent of transgressive and norm-violating behavior. Our purpose in this meta-analytic review was to evaluate (a) interrelations among narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy; (b) gender differences in these traits; (c) how these traits are linked to normal personality factors; and (d) the psychosocial correlates of the dark triad. Our findings show that dark triad traits are substantially intercorrelated, somewhat more prevalent among men than women, predominantly related to the Big Five personality factor of agreeableness and the HEXACO factor of honesty-humility, and generally associated with various types of negative psychosocial outcomes. We question whether dark triad traits are sufficiently distinct and argue that the way they are currently measured is too simple to capture the malevolent sides of personality. Because most research in this domain is cross-sectional and based on self-reports, we recommend using a cross-informant approach and prospective, longitudinal research designs for studying the predictive value of dark triad features.

AB  - Many studies have shown that mycotoxin contamination of agricultural products is a challenge for individual's health especially in developing countries. Improper production and storage of foods, prepare conditions for aflatoxin production in crops, especially rice, wheat, pistachio, walnut, almond, etc which are the main sources of foods for people. Feeding livestock by contaminated bread is another way of human exposure to mycotoxins, especially aflatoxin and because of expensive methods for detecting and analyzing aflatoxin in laboratory; it is not measured in foods. This manuscript is a review of some Iranian and nonIranian reports about aflatoxin, its exposure ways, its adverse effect on human health and nutrition, as well as methods for reducing its exposure. Based on studies on foods, aflatoxin exposure is high in Iran. Since livestock feeding by contaminated bread is one of the potential ways for milk contamination, we should control and reduce aflatoxin contamination by improving production process, storage condition and livestock feeding as soon as possible. Pistachio is one of the most important exporting products of Iran and to maintain Iran's position in exporting of this product, specific regulations on lowering its contamination with aflatoxin should be Considered seriously. Finally, effective controlling of all food and feedstuffs which are vulnerable to aflatoxin contamination is necessary to prevent its effects.

AB  - Family End twin studies suggest a substantial genetic contribution to the etiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Identification of the nature of this genetic contribution should enhance understanding of the pathophysiology of PTSD and suggest improved therapeutic strategies for its treatment. However, a broadly defined phenotype, specific requirement for an environmental exposure and high frequency of comorbid psychiatric illness all complicate genetic studies of PTSD, It is likely that genetic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance, pleiotropy and the involvement of more than one gene all constitute formidable obstacles to the genetic analysis of PTSD. One way to circumvent these problems is to perform genetic analysis of traits associated with PTSD, rather than PTSD itself, an approach that has been fruitful for other diseases with complex modes of inheritance. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hypofunction, physiologic markers of increased arousal, and increased acoustic startle response are all potential PTSD-associated traits that might be susceptible to genetic analysis. However, the capacity of these traits to distinguish PTSD from non-PTSD patients and their familial pattern must be better defined before they can be employed in genetic studies.

AB  - Older adults have reduced performance in visual working memory tasks in comparison to young adults, but the precipitators of the age-related impairment are not fully understood. The most common interpretation of this difference is that older adults are incapable of maintaining the same amount of object representations as young adults over short intervals (in line with the fixed-slot model of working memory). However, it has remained largely unexplored whether the age-related decline is only due to the number of representations that older individuals can retain in visual working memory, or whether the content of the representation(s) may have an effect as well (in line with the flexible-resource model of working memory). Feature binding studies represent an interesting research line to examine the content of older adults' representations. In this mini-review, we present the main results across feature binding studies in aging, as well as highlight the importance of manipulating both the representation content and number to have a stress test of the various models of working memory and their contribution to aging. Overall, feature binding studies, together with the simultaneous manipulation of set size, will allow us to better understand the nature of the age-related decline of visual working memory.

AB  - The Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA) 2017 has been recently enacted with the objectives of providing mental health services and securing of rights of the persons with mental illness. Mental conditions due to abuse of alcohol or drugs have been included in the definition of mental illness. However, these conditions present some unique and difficult problems due to their very nature. Despite being an integral part of psychiatry, these disorders have traditionally been dealt with separately and even treated in dedicated facilities such as deaddiction centers and rehabilitation centers. In fact, some states have separate rules for treatment delivery of these disorders. Addiction also has major legal ramifications that are dealt with other acts such as the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPSA). With this background, this article focuses on the issues of capacity and informed consent specific to addiction, addresses the admission issues in addiction including the issue of coerced treatment, and the treatment facilities, and deals with the some of the discordance and inconsistency between the NDPSA and the MHCA 2017. We believe that addiction-related provisions have not been addressed adequately in the MHCA 2017, and detailed procedures specific to addiction and its treatment will be required if the MHCA 2017 has to be implemented both in letter and in spirit.

AB  - Recent interest in the lasting effects of early-life stress has expanded to include effects on cognitive performance. An increase in circulating glucocorticoids is induced by stress exposure and glucocorticoid effects on the hippocampus likely underlie many of the cognitive consequences. Here we review studies showing that corticosterone administered to young rats at the conclusion of the stress-hyporesponsiveness period affects later performance in hippocampally-mediated trace eyeblink conditioning. The nature and even direction of these effects varies with the elevation patterns (level, duration, temporal fluctuation) achieved by different administration methods. We present new time course data indicating that constant glucocorticoid elevations generally corresponded with hippocampus-mediated learning deficits, whereas acute, cyclical elevations corresponded with improved initial acquisition. Sensitivity was greater for males than for females. Further, changes in hippocampal neurogenesis paralleled some but not all effects. The findings demonstrate that specific patterns of glucocorticoid elevation produced by different drug administration procedures can have markedly different, sex-specific consequences on basic cognitive performance and underlying hippocampal physiology. Implications of these findings for glucocorticoid medications prescribed in childhood are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Time and space are tightly linked in the physical word. Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested that the mental representation of time might be spatial in nature. For instance, time-space interactions have been described as a strong preference to associate the past with the left space and the future with the right space. Here we review the growing evidence of interactions between time and space processing, systematized according to the type of interaction being investigated. We present the empirical findings supporting the possibility that humans represent the subjective time flow on a spatially oriented "mental time line" that is accessed through spatial attention mechanisms. The heterogeneous time-space interactions are then compared with the number-space interactions described in the numerical cognition literature. An alternative hypothesis, which maintains a common system for magnitude processing, including time, space, and number, is also discussed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the more general issue of how the representation of these concepts might be grounded into the cortical circuits that support spatial attention and sensorimotor transformations.

AB  - In modern medicine, the placebo response or placebo effect has often been regarded as a nuisance in basic research and particularly in clinical research. The latest scientific evidence has demonstrated, however, that the placebo effect and the nocebo effect, the negative effects of placebo, stem from highly active processes in the brain that are mediated by psychological mechanisms such as expectation and conditioning. These processes have been described in some detail for many diseases and treatments, and we now know that they can represent both strength and vulnerability in the course of a disease as well as in the response to a therapy. However, recent research and current knowledge raise several issues that we shall address in this review. We will discuss current neurobiological models like expectation-induced activation of the brain reward circuitry, Pavlovian conditioning, and anxiety mechanisms of the nocebo response. We will further explore the nature of the placebo responses in clinical trials and address major questions for future research such as the relationship between expectations and conditioning in placebo effects, the existence of a consistent brain network for all placebo effects, the role of gender in placebo effects, and the impact of getting drug-like effects without drugs.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex metabolic disorder commonly seen in females of reproductive age. The pathophysiology of PCOS is multifactorial and includes dysfunction in ovarian steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis, impaired gonadotropin levels, insulin resistance, gut microbiota imbalance, genetic predisposition, and lifestyle preferences. Low-grade inflammatory conditions such as obesity and impaired glucose tolerance are common metabolic disturbances in women with PCOS. A growing body of literature suggests strong evidence rendering PCOS in close proximity with chronic inflammation as documented by high levels of serum white blood cells, C-reactive protein, and various proinflammatory cytokines seen in this condition. Inflammation seems to be the most common metabolic denominator between the kynurenine pathway and PCOS. The association of tryptophan and kynurenine pathway has already been well documented in mood disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic pain conditions, and different inflammatory states. In this manuscript, we describe the influence of sex steroid hormones on different enzymes of the KP; inflammatory nature of PCOS and CRP as a marker of IDO/TDO activity; and the effects of altered gut flora in women with PCOS. This review provides a novel view of the available evidence of tryptophan and downstream metabolites in PCOS in the context of underlying inflammation.

AB  - The high prevalence of comorbidity between bipolar disorder (BD) and other medical conditions, including autoimmune diseases, supports the hypothesis of the nature of BD as a biological illness category. Hence, an immune dysregulation process may play an important role in the development of at least certain subtypes of BD. Increasing evidence also suggests that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) may be relevant in the pathophysiology of BD. A possible key mechanism underlying the physiopathology of certain autoimmune diseases that may present with affective symptoms might be the production of anti-NMDAR auto-antibodies (auto-Abs). The best characterized autoimmune anti-NMDAR disease is the anti-NMDAR encephalitis. It has been found that 4% of these patients present isolated, mostly affective, psychiatric manifestations during their illness. An interesting suggestion emerged from this overview is that the same mechanisms that trigger affective symptoms in patients with increased anti-NMDAR auto-Abs levels could be involved in the physiopathology of at least a subgroup of BD. Future studies are needed to characterize the relationship between anti-NMDAR auto-Abs and BD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Tricyclic(TCA)and monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressants are effective in the treatment of panic disorder. Two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) have also been licensed in the UK for this indication and studies with three other SSRls have recently been completed. These provide further evidence for the role of serotonin in panic.
   Method Review of clinical, animal and laboratory studies,
   Results SSRls have been shown to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder. The reported rates of improvement of 60-70% of patients taking SSRls are similar to those seen with TCAs and greater than placebo. Other serotonergic agents do not appear to be effective. Animal work and human studies including measures of 5-HT in plasma. cerebrospinal fluid and platelets, challenge paradigms and tryptophan depletion show that the relationship between 5-HT and anxiety is complex.
   Conclusion Clinical trials have shown that of all the serotonergic agents only the SSRls are effective in panic disorder. They are as beneficial as the TCAs and seem to be better tolerated which may be particularly significant in view of the chronic nature of the condition. Serotonin plays a role in panic disorder and serotonergic dysfunction, however the results and evidence do not fit one theory alone. It is also likely that different brain regions and 5-HT receptors are involved in specific ways.

AB  - Accumulating evidence supports an association between chronic pain and psychological disorders, a connection that seems to be bidirectional. Treating both the pain and psychological conditions together is essential for effective treatment outcomes. Acupuncture is a somatosensory-guided mind-body therapy that can tackle the multidimensional nature of pain with fewer or no serious adverse effects. In this review, we discuss the use of acupuncture in some conditions with a high incidence of psychological disorders caused by chronic pain: headache, musculoskeletal pain, low back pain, and cancer pain, focusing on the effect and potential mechanisms of acupuncture. Overall clinical studies indicated that acupuncture might effectively contribute to management of psychological disorders caused by chronic pain. Mechanistic studies showed that acupuncture significantly alleviated such psychological disorders by regulating the activity of amygdala and insula, and regulating functional connectivity of insular and limbic regions/medial prefrontal cortex in humans and the corresponding animal models. In addition, 5-HT in the dorsal raphe nucleus, opioid receptors in the cingulate cortex, and plasma met-enkephalin are involved in acupuncture relief of pain and psychological symptoms. Substantial evidences from animal and human research support a beneficial effect of acupuncture in psychological disorders caused by chronic pain.

AB  - Anosognosia for hemiplegia has seen a century of almost continuous research, yet a definitive understanding of its mechanism remains elusive. Essentially, anosognosic patients hold quasi-delusional beliefs about their paralysed limbs, in spite of all the contrary evidence, repeated questioning, and logical argument. We review a range of findings suggesting that emotion and motivation play an important role in anosognosia. We conclude that anosognosia involves (amongst other things) a process of psychological defence. This conclusion stems from a wide variety of clinical and experimental investigations, including data on implicit awareness of deficit, fluctuations in awareness over time, and dramatic effects upon awareness of psychological interventions such as psychotherapy, reframing of the emotional consequences of the paralysis, and first versus third person perspectival manipulations. In addition, we review and refute the (eight) arguments historically raised against the 'defence' hypothesis, including the claim that a defence-based account cannot explain the lateralised nature of the disorder. We argue that damage to a well-established right-lateralised emotion regulation system, with links to psychological processes that appear to underpin allocentric spatial cognition, plays a key role in anosognosia (at least in some patients). We conclude with a discussion of implications for clinical practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
