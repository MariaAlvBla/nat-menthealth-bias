AB  - For decades, Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a model organism to study human diseases, ranging from heart disease to cancer to neurological disorders [9]. For studying neurodegenerative diseases, Drosophila has been instrumental in understanding disease mechanisms and pathways as well as being an efficient tool in drug discovery studies. For some better-understood disorders, such as Fragile X (a mental retardation syndrome), clinical trials are being run, based in part on translational work in flies and rodents. However, Drosophila is currently less used to study psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), despite numerous discoveries of disease susceptibility genes that could be explored by reverse genetics or miss-expression studies. This deficit might be explained by (1) a lack of reliable tests to study more complex disease (endo)phenotypes in flies, (2) difficulties in translating disease symptoms into animal models and (3) the polygenetic nature of these diseases. In this review we discuss strategies to use D. melanogaster to study complex psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and ADHD. Two common features of these diseases may be defective sleep and attention mechanisms, hence calling for better methods for quantifying and screening arousal thresholds in flies.

AB  - Conservation of Resources (COR) theory predicts that resource loss is the principal ingredient in the stress process. Resource gain, in turn, is depicted as of increasing importance in the context of loss. Because resources are also used to prevent resource loss, at each stage of the stress process people are increasingly vulnerable to negative stress sequelae, that if ongoing result in rapid and impactful loss spirals. COR theory is seen as an alternative to appraisal-based stress theories because it relies more centrally on the objective and culturally construed nature of the environment in determining the stress process, rather than the individual's personal construel. COR theory has been successfully employed in predicting a range of stress outcomes in organisational settings, health contexts, following traumatic stress, and in the face of everyday stressors. Recent advances in understanding the biological, cognitive, and social bases of stress responding are seen as consistent with the original formulation of COR theory, but call for envisioning of COR theory and the stress process within a more collectivist backdrop than was first posited. The role of both resource losses and gains in predicting positive stress outcomes is also considered. Finally, the limitations and applications of COR theory are discussed.

AB  - The aim of the article is to present several conceptions on the functional disorders and neurovegetative (autonomic) dysfunctions. It was indicated that it is important to distinguish between these two concepts and to preserve this division in the newer classifications. The following syndromes were given as examples: neurocirculatory asthenia, Raynaud disease and bodily distress syndrome.
   The current reflections were based mostly on foreign literature. The cited works largely focused on the issue of clinical psychosomatics, which may be a potential area of interest in neuropsychiatry.
   The research carried out so far indicates that the concept of organ neuroses should be removed from the medical literature and rightly replaced with the concept of neurovegetative (autonomic) dysfunctions. Likewise, psychosomatic disorders begin to be understood as functional disorders. However, it becomes questionable to view these diseases as only one diagnostic unit, which is the bodily distress syndrome. They may have different health consequences and complications.
   The nature of functional disorders and neurovegetative dysfunctions is still not well known. Several theories have arisen to explain them, but in general assessment they do not seem sufficient to use them en masse in clinical practice. Especially the development of neurovegetative dysfunctions should be constantly monitored, because, through the neurasthenic period, they can transform into severe organic disease.

AB  - The age of an experimental animal can be a critical variable, yet age matters are often overlooked within neuroscience. Many studies make use of young animals, without considering possible differences between immature and mature subjects. This is especially problematic when attempting to model traits or diseases that do not emerge until adulthood. In this commentary we discuss the reasons for this apparent bias in age of experimental animals, and illustrate the problem with a systematic review of published articles on long-term potentiation. Additionally, we review the developmental stages of a rat and discuss the difficulty of using the weight of an animal as a predictor of its age. Finally, we provide original data from our laboratory and review published data to emphasize that development is an ongoing process that does not end with puberty. Developmental changes can be quantitative in nature, involving gradual changes, rapid switches, or inverted U-shaped curves. Changes can also be qualitative. Thus, phenomena that appear to be unitary may be governed by different mechanisms at different ages. We conclude that selection of the age of the animals may be critically important in the design and interpretation of neurobiological studies.

AB  - Two studies examined the effects of cross-group friendships on heterosexuals' attitudes toward gay men. In Study 1, the authors tested the effects of cross-group friendships with gay men on out-group attitudes, meta-attitudinal strength, and attitude accessibility. The authors simultaneously explored mediational effects of intergroup anxiety. Path analysis showed that cross-group friendships were associated with meta-atfitudinally stronger and more accessible out-group attitudes, and the effects on all 3 criterion variables were mediated by intergroup anxiety. In Study 2, the authors sought to replicate the basic results of Study 1, while additionally exploring mediational effects of closeness of cross-group friendship and moderational effects of perceived group typicality. Structural equation modeling showed that cross-group friendships were associated with meta-attitudinally stronger and more accessible out-group attitudes; friendships had indirect effects on all 3 criterion variables, via closeness of friendship and intergroup anxiety. Closeness of friendship only predicted lower intergroup anxiety, however, when the out-group friend was perceived as highly typical. The authors emphasize the importance of considering the nature of out-group attitudes more completely when evaluating the effectiveness of intergroup contact in reducing prejudice.

AB  - The replication crisis in psychology has led to question popular phenomena such as ego depletion, which has been criticized after studies failed to replicate. Here, we describe limitations in the literature that contributed to these failures and suggest how they may be addressed. At the theoretical level, the literature focuses on two out of at least eight identified auxiliary hypotheses. Thus, the majority of the hypotheses related to the three core assumptions of the ego-depletion theory have been overlooked, thereby preventing the rejection of the theory as a whole. At the experimental level, we argue that the low replicability of ego-depletion studies could be explained by the absence of a comprehensive, integrative, and falsifiable definition of self-control, which is central to the concept of ego depletion; by an unclear or absent distinction between ego depletion and mental fatigue, two phenomena that rely on different processes; and by the low validity of the tasks used to induce ego depletion. Finally, we make conceptual and methodological suggestions for a more rigorous investigation of ego depletion, discuss the necessity to take into account its dynamic and multicomponent nature, and suggest using the term self-control fatigue instead.

AB  - There is a rich literature on the nature of mental health-related stigma and the processes by which it severely affects the life chances of people with mental health problems. However, applying this knowledge to deliver and evaluate interventions to reduce discrimination and stigma in a lasting way is a complex and long-term challenge.
   We conducted a narrative synthesis of systematic reviews published since 2012, and supplemented this with papers published subsequently as examples of more recent work.
   There is evidence for small to moderate positive impacts of both mass media campaigns and interventions for target groups in terms of stigma-related knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviour in terms of desire for contact. However, the limited evidence from longer follow-up times suggests that it is not clear whether short-term contact interventions have a lasting impact.
   The risk that short-term interventions may only have a short-term impact suggests a need to study longer term interventions and to use interim process and outcome data to improve interventions along the way. There is scope for more thorough application of intergroup contact theory whenever contact is used and of evidence-based teaching and assessment methods when skills training is used for target groups.

AB  - Multidimensional motivational theories postulate that the type of motivation is as important as the quantity of motivation, with implications for human functioning and well-being. An extensive amount of research has explored how constructs contained within these theories relate to the activation of the endocrine system. However, research is fragmented across several theories, and determining the current state of the science is complicated. In line with contemporary trends for theoretical integration, this systematic review aims to evaluate the association between multidimensional motivational constructs and endocrine-related responses to determine which theories are commonly used and what inferences can be made. Forty-one studies were identified incorporating five distinct motivation theories and multiple endocrine-related responses. There was evidence across several theories that high-quality motivation attenuated the cortisol response in evaluative environments. There was also evidence that motivational needs for power and affiliation were associated with lower and higher levels of salivary immunoglobulin A, respectively. The need for power may play a role in increasing testosterone when winning a contest; however, this evidence was not conclusive. Overall, this review can shape the future integration of motivational theories by characterizing the nature of physiological responses to motivational processes and examining the implications for well-being.

AB  - Research on dopamine lies at the intersection of sophisticated theoretical and neurobiological approaches to learning and memory. Dopamine has been shown to be critical for many processes that drive learning and memory, including motivation, prediction error, incentive salience, memory consolidation, and response output. Theories of dopamine's function in these processes have, for the most part, been developed from behavioral approaches that examine learning mechanisms in reward-related tasks. A parallel and growing literature indicates that dopamine is involved in fear conditioning and extinction. These studies are consistent with long-standing ideas about appetitive-aversive interactions in learning theory and they speak to the general nature of cellular and molecular processes that underlie behavior. We review the behavioral and neurobiological literature showing a role for dopamine in fear conditioning and extinction. At a cellular level, we review dopamine signaling and receptor pharmacology, cellular and molecular events that follow dopamine receptor activation, and brain systems in which dopamine functions. At a behavioral level, we describe theories of learning and dopamine function that could describe the fundamental rules underlying how dopamine modulates different aspects of learning and memory processes.

AB  - Research advances in psychiatric genetics have raised expectations that genetic findings might lead to major breakthroughs in psychiatric nosology. The author reviews the plausibility of these claims. Four areas are addressed. First, it is argued that familial aggregation of a single putative psychiatric syndrome provides at best limited evidence for the validity of that syndrome. Second, both traditional and molecular genetic strategies can supply important insights into major diagnostic conundrums. However, evidence that one or a few individual genes impact on risk for two disorders is not likely to resolve definitively the nosologic relationship between the two syndromes. Third, while gene- based essentialist models for psychiatric disorders are conceptually appealing, they are not well supported empirically. Gene discovery in psychiatry is, on its own, unlikely to allow us to " carve nature at its joints," thereby validating categorical psychiatric diagnoses. Fourth, the project to ground " messy" psychiatric categories on the firm foundation of genes - as an archetypal natural kind - may be fundamentally flawed because the very concept of " the gene" as a discrete entity is itself increasingly in doubt. Whereas psychiatric genetics has and will continue to provide important insights into the etiology of psychiatric and substance use disorders, it is not likely alone to provide deep answers to the complex and multifaceted problems facing psychiatric nosology.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Depression is associated with increased risk of subsequent development of dementia; however, the nature of the association is still poorly understood. The purpose of the review was based on recent studies to discuss whether depression is a prodromal state of dementia or an independent risk factor for dementia, as well as to discuss how the type of depression, the type of dementia, and antidepressant treatment influence the association.
   Recent findings
   Findings from recent studies suggest that some forms of depressive illness, for example early-onset depression before age 65 years and recurrent depression, may constitute long-term risk factors for development of dementia, whereas the onset of more recent depressive symptoms may reflect a prodromal phase of dementia. It is not clear whether specific subtypes of depression correspond to specific types of dementia. Recent studies suggest that long-term treatment with antidepressants may decrease the risk of developing some types of dementia, depending on the type of depressive disorder.
   Summary
   This review has shown that the type of depression and dementia, as well as the effect of drug treatment, has to be considered to improve knowledge on the association between depression and dementia.

AB  - The demand for employees to be more productive while also being adaptable to new organizational pressures has intensified the nature of work and the demands placed upon employees. We meta-analyzed the relationship between employee role stress and organizational commitment and tested the effects of two potential moderators of this relationship. One-hundred and five studies (N=37,993 individuals) conducted from 2001 to 2019 were included in the meta-analysis. Significant negative relationships were found between three forms of role stress (role ambiguity, role conflict, and role overload) and affective organizational commitment. All role stressors had stronger relationships with affective commitment than with continuance commitment which was not found to be significantly related to any of the types of role stress tested. Overall, employees' perceived role stress was inversely associated with their desire to stay with the organization (affective commitment) but not their need to stay (continuance commitment) with the organization. Moderator analyses revealed that occupational type and culture significantly influenced role stressor-affective commitment relationships. Specifically, stronger relationships were found for studies conducted in transactional occupations and western cultures. Implications of findings for organizations are discussed and directions for future research are provided.

   Mentally ill homeless persons are among the most neglected or marginalized patient groups. Their needs for mental healthcare are widely unmet. The current economic crisis probably accelerates the social decline and deterioration of physical and mental health in high-risk groups worldwide and increases the need for appropriate treatments, services, and prevention strategies.
   Recent findings
   Research on service provision for mentally disordered homeless people (from 2010 to 2012) covers the following issues: epidemiology of mental ill health among homeless persons, service delivery and healthcare utilization, specific treatments, specific high-risk groups among homeless persons, and subjective experience with mental health service provision.
   Summary
   The number of studies published on these issues between 2010 and 2012 may suggest an awareness for the need for adequate service provision of this marginalized clientele. Research evidence is still not sufficient. The majority of studies are from the United States. The methodological quality of the studies is still moderate, being descriptive in nature or applying qualitative approaches to small samples. Included are usually easy to access patients from inner-city regions. There is an encouraging trend to focus on younger age groups that supports the focus on primary or secondary prevention strategies for homelessness and mental disorders.

AB  - Aims Firstly, to outline the nature of health risks in the offshore oil and gas industry to date. Secondly, to outline the commercial, technical and social challenges that could influence the future context of health management in the industry. Thirdly, to speculate how the health function within the industry needs to respond to these challenges.
   Methods A review of the published literature was supplemented with industry subject matter and expert opinion.
   Results There was a relatively light peer-reviewed published literature base in an industry which is perceived as having changed little over three decades, so far as offshore health hazards for physical, chemical, biological hazards are concerned. Recent focus has been on musculoskeletal disorders and stress.
   Conclusions The relative stability of the knowledge base regarding health hazards offshore may change as more innovative methods are employed to develop hydrocarbon resources in more 'difficult' environments. Society's willingness to accept risk is changing. Addressing potential health risks should be done much earlier in the planning process of major projects. This may reveal a skills gap in health professionals as a consequence of needing to employ more anticipatory tools, such as modelling exposure estimations and the skills and willingness to engage effectively with engineers and other HSSE professionals.

AB  - Involuntary autobiographical memories are memories of personal events that come to mind spontaneously-that is, with no conscious initiation of the retrieval process. Such spontaneously arising memories were long ignored in cognitive psychology, which generally has focused on controlled and strategic forms of remembering, studied in laboratory settings. Recent evidence shows that involuntary memories of past events are highly frequent in daily life, and that they represent a context-sensitive, and associative way of recollecting past events that involves little executive control. They operate by constraints that favour recent events and events with a distinct feature overlap to the current situation, which optimizes the probability of functional relevance to the ongoing situation. In addition to adults, they are documented in young children and great apes and may be an ontogenetic and evolutionary forerunner of strategic retrieval of past events. Findings suggest that intrusive involuntary memories observed clinically after traumatic events should be viewed as a dysfunctional subclass of otherwise functional involuntary autobiographical memories. Because of their highly constrained, situation-dependent and automatic nature, involuntary autobiographical memories form a distinct category of spontaneous thought that cannot be equated with mind wandering.

AB  - Heat and mass transfer can be greatly increased when using impinging jets, regardless the application. The reason behind this is the complex behavior of the impinging jet flow which is leading to the generation of a multitude of flow phenomena, like: large-scale structures, small scale turbulent mixing, large curvature involving strong normal stresses, and strong shear, stagnation, separation, and re-attachment of the wall boundary-layers, increased heat transfer at the impinged plate. All these listed phenomena have highly unsteady nature and even though a lot of scientific studies have approached this subject, the impinging jet is not fully understood due to the difficulties of carrying out detailed experimental and numerically investigations. Nevertheless, for heat transfer enhancement in impinging jet applications, both passive and active strategies are employed. The effect of nozzle geometry and the impinging surface macro-structure modification are some of the most prominent passive strategies. On the other side, the most used active strategies utilize acoustical and mechanical oscillations in the exit plane of the flow, which in certain situations favors mixing enhancement. This is favored by the intensification of some instabilities and by the onset of large scale vortices with important levels of energy.

AB  - The widely acknowledged homogeneity assumption limits progress in refining clinical diagnosis, understanding mechanisms, and developing new treatments for mental health disorders. This homogeneity assumption drives both a comorbidity and a heterogeneity problem, where two different approaches tackle the problems. One, a unifying approach, tackles the comorbidity problem by assuming that a single general psychopathology factor underlies multiple disorders. Another, a multifactorial approach, tackles the heterogeneity problem by assuming that disorders comprise multiple subtypes driven by multiple discrete factors. We show how each of these approaches can make useful contributions to mental health-related research and clinical practice. For example, the unifying approach can develop a rapid assessment tool that may be clinically valuable for triaging cases. The multifactorial approach can reveal subtypes that are differentially responsive to treatments and highlight distinct mechanisms leading to similar phenotypes. Because both approaches tackle different problems, both have different limitations. We describe the statistical frameworks that incorporate and adjudicate between both approaches (e.g., the bifactor model, normative modeling, and the functional random forest). Such frameworks can identify whether sets of disorders are more affected by heterogeneity or comorbidity. Therefore, future studies that incorporate such frameworks can provide further insight into the nature of psychopathology.

AB  - A frustrating inertia has affected the development of clinical applications of antidepressant pharmacogenetics and personalized treatments of depression are still lacking 20 years after the first findings. Candidate gene studies provided replicated findings for some polymorphisms, but each of them shows at best a small effect on antidepressant efficacy and the cumulative effect of different polymorphisms is unclear. Further, no candidate was immune by at least some negative studies. These considerations give rise to some concerns about the clinical benefits of currently available pharmacogenetic tests since they are based on the results of candidate gene studies. Clinical guidelines in fact suggest that only polymorphisms that alter cytochrome 2D6 or 2C19 enzymatic activity probably provide useful clinical indications, while variants in genes involved in antidepressant pharmacodynamics have no recommended clinical applications.
   The present review discusses possible strategies to facilitate the identification of genetic biomarkers with clinical usefulness in guiding antidepressant treatments. These include analysis methods for the study of the polygenic/omnigenic nature of antidepressant response, the prioritization of polymorphisms on the basis of functional considerations, the incorporation of clinical-demographic predictors in pharmacogenetic studies (e.g. mixed polygenic and clinical risk scores), the application of methodological improvements to the design of future studies in order to maximize the comparability of results and improve power.

AB  - Psychomotor slowing (PS) is a cluster of symptoms that was already recognized in schizophrenia by its earliest investigators. Nevertheless, few studies have been dedicated to the clarification of the nature and the role of the phenomenon in this illness. Moreover, slowed psychomotor functioning is often not clearly delineated from reduced processing speed. The current, first review of all existing literature on the subject discusses the key findings. Firstly, PS is a clinically observable feature that is most frequently established by neuropsychological measures assessing speed of fine movements such as writing or tasks that require rapid fingertip manipulations or the maintenance of maximal speed over brief periods of time in manual activities. Moreover, the slowed performance on the various psychomotor measures has been demonstrated independent of medication and has also been found to be associated with negative symptoms and, to a lesser extent, with positive and depressive symptoms. Importantly, performance on the psychomotor tasks proved related to the patients' social, clinical, and functional outcomes. Several imaging studies showed slowed performance to coincide with dopaminergic striatal activity. Finally, conventional neuroleptics do not improve the patients' PS symptoms, in contrast to the atypical agents that do seem to produce modestly improving effects.

AB  - Recent trends show online/video games, have shifted from being just recreational in nature, to hazardous even resulting in the gamer's death like the blue whale game. The aim of the study is to examine associations between video/online gaming and its implication on the biopsychosocial domains of the user. Online databases were studied on gaming and its effect on behaviour, general and mental health from 1997-2017. The PICO guidelines, PRISMA flow diagram and the Rayyan software was used in identifying relevant studies. Cross referencing was done with the co-authors. A total of 41 studies were included in the final analysis. The choice of the video game is influenced by age, gender, parental mediation, as well as the players' and the game's characteristics. Excessive gaming affects both the individual himself and their interpersonal relationships, with Internet addiction' being added as a diagnosis under DSM V. Despite its several negative consequences, over the past decade, researchers have now started to acknowledge the benefits of gamification in social, educational and even in the health sector, irrespective of the individual's age. There is a need to develop cross cultural database to understand the impact of addictive and/or promotive use of games on the biopsychosocial factors of the gamer.

AB  - Background: Questions remain concerning the 'effects' of parenting on behavioural/emotional problems in children. This annotation discusses recent findings concerning the parenting 'effects' literature and identifies areas in need of further research. Method: The review begins by examining theories and definitions of parenting, and then considers research findings on the predictors of parent-child relationships and their effects on behavioural/emotional adjustment in children. Evidence for causal processes are then examined in light of findings emphasizing the need to consider the impact of larger systems on child's well-being, bi-directional processes in parent-child interactions, and alternative hypotheses suggested by behavioural genetics. Results: Different kinds of evidence suggest strong links between parent-child relationship quality and children's well-being, but difficulties remain for drawing causal connections. The need for greater integration among research traditions and the need for theory development are highlighted. In addition, although a substantial and robust research base exists on parent-child relationships, the applicability of these findings to clinical settings is uncertain. Conclusions: Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the nature of parent-child relationships and their developmental effects, but a number of basic conceptual and methodological and clinical questions continue to need rigorous study.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment and mental disorders. The actual cause and cascade of events in the progression of this pathology is not fully determined. AD is multifaceted in nature and is linked to different multiple mechanisms in the brain. This aspect is related to the lack of efficacious therapies that could slow down or hinder the disease onset/progression. The ideal treatment for AD should be able to modulate the disease through multiple mechanisms rather than targeting a single dysregulated pathway. Recently, the endocannabinoid system emerged as a novel potential therapeutic target to treat AD. In fact, exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids seem to be able to modulate multiple processes in AD, although the mechanisms that are involved are not fully elucidated. This review provides an update of this area. In this review, we recapitulate the role of endocannabinoid signaling in AD and the probable mechanisms through which modulators of the endocannabinoid system provide their effects, thus highlighting how this target might provide more advantages over other therapeutic targets.

AB  - Motor imagery (MI) or the mental simulation of action is now increasingly being studied using neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. The booming interest in capturing the neural underpinning of MI has provided a large amount of data which until now have never been quantitatively summarized. The aim of this activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was to provide a map of the brain structures involved in MI. Combining the data from 75 papers revealed that MI consistently recruits a large fronto-parietal network in addition to subcortical and cerebellar regions. Although the primary motor cortex was not shown to be consistently activated, the MI network includes several regions which are known to play a role during actual motor execution. The body part involved in the movements, the modality of MI and the nature of the MI tasks used all seem to influence the consistency of activation within the general MI network. In addition to providing the first quantitative cortical map of MI, we highlight methodological issues that should be addressed in future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Psychiatric diseases in general, and bipolar illness in particular, are difficult to model in animals since the subjective nature of the core symptoms appears to preclude objective observation of behavioral changes. An adequate animal model of a psychiatric condition must fulfill three core criteria: share pathophysiological characteristics of the human condition (face validity), have similar behavioral manifestations as the human disease (construct validity), and improve with medications that improve the symptoms seen in afflicted humans (predictive validity). The ouabain model for bipolar illness mimics a widely reproduced biologic abnormality in mania: reduced sodium pump activity. An intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of 5 mu L 10(-3) M ouabain induces motoric hyperactivity preventable by lithium, carbamazepine, and haloperidol. ICV ouabain may also produce environmentally dependent hypoactivity. The model, however, has not yet been examined for other potential manic behavior in rats such as reduced need for sleep, increased sexual activity, or increased irritability. While additional characterization of the model is required, the ouabain model for bipolar illness is the only available animal model that fulfills the three criteria for an adequate animal model for bipolar illness.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Physicians are reluctant to ask for help when they suffer from substance use disorders and/or other mental illnesses (i.e. when they become 'sick doctors'). This can result in greater morbidity/mortality and may lead to significant problems in medical practice. This review aims to describe the nature and development of programs that specifically treat sick doctors [Physician Health Programs (PHPs)].
   Recent findings
   PHPs were first developed in the United States in the late 1970s. The purpose was to identify and treat physicians with problems resulting from mental health issues, mainly substance use disorders. Since then, other PHPs have been developed in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, trying to reach sick doctors, offering counseling or other preventive interventions when needed. New models to help sick doctors, such as the Spanish PHP, were also developed. Counseling and support services for sick doctors have been implemented elsewhere in Europe (e.g. Norway and Switzerland).
   Summary
   PHPs provide interventions specifically designed for physicians and other medical professionals with substance use and other mental health problems. The balance between guaranteeing safe practice and yet encouraging all physicians to ask for help when in trouble raises questions regarding how these programs should be designed.

AB  - This survey takes into account the unconscious aspects of emotions and the critical role played in them by the right hemisphere, considering different acceptations of the term 'unconscious'. In a preliminary step, the nature of emotions, their componential and hierarchical organization and the relationships between emotions and hemispheric specialization are shortly discussed, then different aspects of emotions are surveyed: first are reviewed studies dealing with the unconscious processing of emotional information, taking separately into account various lines of research. All these studies suggest that unconscious processing of emotional information is mainly subsumed by a right hemisphere subcortical route, through which emotional stimuli quickly reach the amygdala. We afterwards inquire if a right hemisphere dominance can also be observed in automatic emotional action schemata and if 'non-removed preverbal implicit memories' also have a preferential link with the right hemisphere. Finally, we try to evaluate if the right hemisphere may also play a critical role in dynamic unconscious phenomena, such as anosognosia/denial of hemiplegia in patients with unilateral brain lesions. In the last part of the review, the reasons that could subsume the right hemisphere dominance for unconscious emotions are shortly discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The nature of insight has been the interdisciplinary focus of scientific inquiry for over 100 years. Behavioral studies and biographical data suggest that insight, as a form of creative cognition, consists of at least four separate but intercorrelated stages as described by Wallas (1926). Yet no quantitative evidence was available for insight-or insight-stage-specific brain mechanisms that generalize across various insight tasks. The present work attempted, for one, to present an integrated and comprehensive description of the neural networks underlying insight and, for another, to identify dynamic brain mechanisms related to the four hypothetical stages of insight. To this end, we performed two quantitative meta-analyses: one for all available studies that used neuroimaging techniques to investigate insight, and the other for the phasic brain activation of insight drawn from task characteristics, using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. One key finding was evidence of an integrated network of insight-activated regions, including the right medial frontal gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left amygdala and the right hippocampus. Importantly, various brain areas were variably recruited during the four stages. Based on the ALE results, the general and stage-specific neural correlates of insight were determined and potential implications are discussed.

AB  - The rise in inadequate and unhealthily diets in children has led investigations to examine the development of food preferences. This review outlines the ways in which children choose between foods made available to them and the subsequent shaping of their own habitual diet. Children are liable to form preferences to certain hedonic foods, and to exhibit neophobic reactions to the unfamiliar. Unfamiliar foods can elicit anxiety and suspicion. Trust and liking of a once novel food can be gained through exposure, increasing familiarity towards that food. This review examines: visual familiarity (awareness of foods within their environment); taste familiarity (knowledge and experience of the taste of foods); contextual familiarity (knowledge of how foods should be presented); and categorical familiarity (which family foods belong to). The influence of familiarity is also explained with regards to both positive and negative associative learning. These associations are influenced by the specific presentation and the social environment of a novel food. The potential benefits of understanding the nature of children's learning and preference development for the promotion of healthy nutrition to both parent and child are discussed.

AB  - Purpose of Review We provide a review and synthesis of the sexual offense treatment change literature with implications for dynamic sexual violence risk assessment and management. An argument is presented for the need for a dynamic approach in research and practice, and that for change to be prognostic, such changes need to be risk relevant and to come from credible change agents. Recent Findings Extant research demonstrates that changes on psychologically meaningful dimensions of risk and need (e.g., sexual deviance; attitudes and cognitions; anger, aggression, and hostility) tend to be associated with reductions in sexual and other forms of recidivism; however, changes in domains less germane to risk and need tend not to be (e.g., empathy, mental health and well-being). Formalized dynamic sexual offense risk measures can be administered at multiple time points to reliably measure changes in sexual violence risk. Change information can then be used systematically to adjust risk appraisals. The extant literature supports the dynamic nature of sexual violence risk. Working toward the routine assessment of change with psychometrically sound measures, and integrating this information into risk management interventions, can not only improve lives and reduce sexual violence but is an ethical and human responsibility.

AB  - Soil contamination is a worldwide crisis, which diminishes food and agricultural production. Alterations in the soil environment due to soil contamination cause biophysical and biochemical changes in vegetation. Due to dynamic nature of these changes, early monitoring can permit for preventive interferences before intense and sometimes inevitable vegetation and soil problems occur. As plants are rooted in soil substrate, vegetation changes can be used as bio-indicators of soil conditions. Traditionally, vegetation changes have been usually determined by visual analysis or detected after major destructive sampling during the growth period. As the characteristics of vegetation influence its spectral properties, effective remote and non-contact detection methods offer an alternative and near real-time way for detecting plant changes, even prior to visual symptoms and negative effects appearance. The aim of the current study is to review the potential of optical proximal and remote sensing techniques at different platforms for indirect assessment of plant-soil interactions via monitoring vegetation anomalies related to soil contamination. It is strongly felt that this rapidly progressing technological direction will permit extending the use of the techniques to geology, soil science and precision agriculture and an overall broad range of applications.

AB  - The current umbrella review aimed to assess and summarise evidence on universal, selective and indicated interventions for mental health at the workplace. This umbrella review forms one of the evidence reviews which were commissioned by the WHO to develop global guidelines on mental health at work. We conducted systematic searches in five bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Global Medicus Index) and included meta-analyses of randomised trials examining psychosocial, physical activity and lifestyle interventions delivered to all general workers (universal interventions), at-risk workers (selective interventions) and workers already experiencing symptoms of mental disorders (indicated interventions). We included outcomes from seven domains: symptoms of mental health conditions, positive mental health, quality of life, work-related outcomes, substance use, suicide-related outcomes and potential adverse effects. We identified 16 meta-analyses producing 66 pooled effect sizes of the examined interventions, mostly on symptoms of mental health conditions (n=43 pooled effect sizes) (eg, burnout, insomnia, stress) and positive mental health (n=15) (eg, well-being). Most of the evidence on universal, selective and indicated interventions was focused on psychosocial interventions, showing small to moderate effects across the various outcomes. Certainty levels according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) were low to very low in almost all of the examined outcomes. The results of existing meta-analyses are promising for the use of preventative and early treatment interventions in the workplace. However, the quality and certainty of the evidence were very modest, and further research on the effectiveness of these interventions is warranted.

AB  - The need to find new therapeutic interventions in patients diagnosed with psychiatric disorders is supported by the data suggesting high rates of relapse, chronic evolution, therapeutic resistance, or lack of adherence and disability. The use of pre-, pro-, or synbiotics as add-ons in the therapeutic management of psychiatric disorders has been explored as a new way to augment the efficacy of psychotropics and to improve the chances for these patients to reach response or remission. This systematic literature review focused on the efficacy and tolerability of psychobiotics in the main categories of psychiatric disorders and it has been conducted through the most important electronic databases and clinical trial registers, using the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The quality of primary and secondary reports was assessed using the criteria identified by the Academy of Nutrition and Diabetics. Forty-three sources, mostly of moderate and high quality, were reviewed in detail, and data regarding the efficacy and tolerability of psychobiotics was assessed. Studies exploring the effects of psychobiotics in mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), neurocognitive disorders, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were included. The overall tolerability of the interventions assessed was good, but the evidence to support their efficacy in specific psychiatric disorders was mixed. There have been identified data in favor of probiotics for patients with mood disorders, ADHD, and ASD, and also for the association of probiotics and selenium or synbiotics in patients with neurocognitive disorders. In several domains, the research is still in an early phase of development, e.g., in substance use disorders (only three preclinical studies being found) or eating disorders (one review was identified). Although no well-defined clinical recommendation could yet be formulated for a specific product in patients with psychiatric disorders, there is encouraging evidence to support further research, especially if focused on the identification of specific sub-populations that may benefit from this intervention. Several limitations regarding the research in this field should be addressed, i.e., the majority of the finalized trials are of short duration, there is an inherent heterogeneity of the psychiatric disorders, and the diversity of the explored Philae prevents the generalizability of the results from clinical studies.

AB  - Introduction: Dual harm is the co-occurrence of self-harm and aggression during an individual's lifetime. It is unclear whether sufficient evidence exists for dual harm as a unique clinical entity. This systematic review aimed to examine whether there are psychological factors that are uniquely associated with dual harm when compared to those who have engaged in sole harm (self-harm alone, aggression alone) and no harmful behaviours. Our secondary aim was to conduct a critical appraisal of the literature.Methods: The review searched PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and EThOS on September 27, 2022, resulting in 31 eligible papers that represented 15,094 individuals. An adapted version of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was used to assess risk of bias and a narrative synthesis was conducted.Results: The included studies assessed differences in mental health problems, personality, and emotion related factors between the different behavioural groups. We found weak evidence that dual harm is an independent construct with unique psychological characteristics. Rather, our review suggests that dual harm results from the interaction of psychological risk factors that are associated with self-harm and aggression.Discussion: The critical appraisal identified numerous limitations within the dual harm literature. Clinical implications and recommendations for future research are provided.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewWe review the literature on sleep in extreme environments. Accordingly, we present a model that identifies the need for mitigating interventions to preserve sleep quality for military deployments.Recent FindingsSituational factors that affect sleep in extreme environments include cold temperatures, isolated and confined areas, fluctuating seasonality, photoperiodicity, and extreme latitudes and altitudes. Results vary across studies, but general effects include decreased total sleep time, poor sleep efficiency, and non-specific phase delays or phase advances in sleep onset and sleep architecture. Considering habitability measures (e.g., light or temperature control) and individual differences such as variable stress responses or sleep need can mitigate these effects to improve mood, cognition, and operational performance.Although the situational demands during military missions inevitably reduce total sleep time and sleep efficiency, mitigating factors can attenuate sleep-related impairments, hence allowing for optimal mission success and personnel safety.

Methods Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Medline, and PubMed were searched between February 2 and 17, 2021, and updated on August 5, 2022. Studies investigating MBIs with children and adolescents (<18 years) with physical health conditions were included, and results are presented with narrative synthesis. Results Eighteen studies met eligibility criteria. Studies included children and adolescents with chronic pain, headaches, cancer, heart conditions, esophageal atresia, inflammatory bowel disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Most studies reported mindfulness was feasible and acceptable, although findings for different health conditions were mixed. Some studies encountered difficulties with attrition, resulting in findings being underpowered. Conclusions MBIs show promise for improving anxiety and depression in children with physical health conditions, but there is limited support for reducing stress in the family unit. A potential direction for future research might be the inclusion of parents. However, because of the heterogeneity of studies included in this review, findings must be cautiously interpreted.

AB  - Australia is a multicultural and linguistically diverse country. Despite the vital role of religion/spirituality in the mental health of people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds, it is not commonly included in their mental health care. A rapid review was conducted to critically evaluate the studies that identified relevant religious/spiritual aspects regarding mental health care for CALD communities. After a systematic search and screening, sixteen empirical studies were included. The findings of the review suggest that people from CALD backgrounds draw strength and comfort from their religion to support mental health. Religious/spiritual practices were identified as effective mental health strategies by CALD people. Religious leaders were noted to be important sources of mental health support and guidance for individuals from some CALD communities. Collaboration of religious leaders in the mental health care, and integration of religious/spiritual practices into mainstream mental health interventions, may improve mental health care for people with CALD backgrounds.

AB  - The availability of digital tools aiming to promote adolescent mental health is rapidly increasing. However, the field lacks an up-to-date and focused review of current evidence. This study thus looked into the characteristics and efficacy of digital, evidence-based mental health programs for youth (11-18 years). The selection procedure followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and resulted in 27 eligible studies. The high heterogeneity of the results calls for careful interpretation. Nevertheless, small, but promising, effects of digital tools were found with respect to promoting well-being, relieving anxiety, and enhancing protective factors. Some important factors influencing overall efficacy include the given setting, the level of guidance and support, and the adherence to the intervention.

AB  - Introduction: As U.S. Veterans reintegrate from active duty to civilian life, many are at risk for negative modifiable social determinants of health. The prevalence of mental health conditions among Veterans is also high. Awareness of the associations between these two factors is growing. This systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of knowledge of the associations between modifiable social determinants and mental health among U.S. Veterans. Methods: The authors systematically searched four databases and identified 28 articles representing 25 unique studies that met inclusion criteria. Findings from the studies were extracted and synthesized on the basis of modifiable social determinants. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Methodological Quality Questionnaire. Results: The studies identified in the systematic review examined three modifiable social determinants of health: 1) housing stability, 2) employment and finances, and 3) social support. Although the lack of validity for measures of housing stability, employment, and finances compromised study quality, the overall evidence suggests that Veterans with access to supportive social determinants had better mental health status. Evidence was particularly robust for the association between strong social support and lower symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Discussion: Current evidence suggests the need to consider modifiable social determinants of health when designing mental health interventions. However, more research encompassing a wider range of modifiable social determinants such as food security, education, and transportation and using comprehensive methods and validated instruments is needed. Future research also needs to intentionally include Veterans from diverse racial-ethnic groups.
   LAY SUMMARY Veterans who served post-9/11 face many challenges as they reintegrate into civilian life. Some of these challenges include securing stable housing, adequate food, employment, and social support, all of which are examples of social determinants of health. Veterans are also at risk for mental health conditions. Thus, this systematic review examined published articles to evaluate what is known about the relationship between social determinants and mental health among U.S. Veterans who served post-9/11. Using four large databases, the authors found 28 articles representing 25 unique studies. The identified studies reported on three social determinants of health: 1) housing stability, 2) employment and finances, and 3) social support. Robust evidence indicates that Veterans with strong social support had better mental health. The evidence for other social determinants of health was either weak or lacking. Studies needed stronger methods to measure housing and employment and finances, as well as more robust statistical analysis. In addition, the majority of U.S. Veterans who participated in the studies were non-Hispanic white men. More research on a wider range of social determinants - such as food security, education, and transportation - that uses stronger study methods is needed. Future research also needs to intentionally include Veterans from diverse racial and ethnic groups.

AB  - Backgrounds: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) delivered via the Internet become increasingly popular for improving maternal mental health, but the effectiveness of internet-delivered MBIs (iMBIs) is still unclear.Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. We included studies that were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental study design, and pre-post test design and contained information on the population of interest (women during pregnancy or within one year after delivery), intervention contents (mindfulness components), and intervention delivery formats (internet-based). ROBINS-I and RoB 2 were used to rate the risk of bias in non-RCTs and RCTs, respectively.Results: Eleven studies composed of six RCTs and five non-RCTs were included. The overall risk of bias was high. IMBIs are effective in improving maternal depression and mindfulness and self-compassion. However, limited by the small number of studies included in the review, effect sizes of iMBIs cannot be estimated. Characteristics of iMBIs (delivery formats, duration, et al.) and studies (study design, measures et al.) were described.Conclusion: iMBIs are still in the initial stage. Studies with rigorous study design and larger sample size, and determining the optimal delivery formats and duration and intensity of interventions are necessary.

AB  - Background: Problematic Internet use (PIU) is an emerging public health problem, and university students comprise a high-risk population. This systematic review aims to examine the terminology, assessment tools, prevalence, and predictive factors associated with PIU in university students.Methods: A literature review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. We searched the Web of Sci-ence, Scopus, PsycInfo, and Medline databases to identify relevant empirical studies published between 2013 and 2021. A total of 76 studies were included. Quality assessment and narrative synthesis were conducted.Results: Variability was found in terminology and assessment tools. The prevalence rates of PIU varied (4-51%). The quality of the articles was adequate. Ten predictive factors for PIU have been identified, divided into three categories (patterns of use, psychological variables, and lifestyles). Among these, nine were risk factors (time spent online, online gaming, depression, negative affect, life stress, maladaptive cognitions, impulsivity, poor sleep quality, substance use (alcohol and drugs)), and one was a protective factor (conscientiousness).Conclusions: The lack of consensus in the terminology, assessment tools, and diagnostic criteria of PIU was corroborated. Furthermore, the essential role of intrapsychic variables in PIU was demonstrated with important practical implications for developing preventive strategies.

AB  - BackgroundChildren represent nearly 40% of forcibly displaced populations and are subject to stressors that affect well-being. Little is known about the effects of interventions to enhance psychological resilience in these children, outside clinical settings.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, following Cochrane methods. Eligible studies tested resilience-enhancing interventions outside clinical settings in forcibly displaced children/adolescents. We included longitudinal quantitative studies with comparator conditions irrespective of geographical scope or language. We searched articles published between January 2010 and April 2020 in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO and the WHO's Global Index Medicus. To standardise effect sizes across the different reported outcomes, we transformed reported mean differences to standardised mean differences using Hedge's g statistic with associated 95% CI. We pooled data for meta-analysis where appropriate. We used Cochrane tools to assess study risk of bias and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to determine evidence quality for meta-analysed outcomes.ResultsSearches yielded 4829 results. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Studies reported 18 outcomes measured by 48 different scales; only 1 study explicitly measured resilience. Eight studies were randomised controlled trials; the rest were non-randomised pre-post studies. Interventions were diverse and typically implemented in group settings. Studies reported significant improvement in outcomes pertinent to behavioural problems, coping mechanisms and general well-being but not to caregiver support or psychiatric symptoms. In meta-analysis, resilience was improved (g(av)=0.194, 95% CI 0.018 to 0.369), but anxiety symptoms and quality of life were not (g(av)=-0.326, 95% CI -0.782 to 0.131 and g(av)=0.325, 95% CI -0.027 to 0.678, respectively). Risk of bias varied. Quality of evidence for most graded outcomes was very low.ConclusionsThe multiplicity of study designs, intervention types, outcomes and measures incumbered quantifying intervention effectiveness. Future resilience research in this population should use rigorous methods and follow reporting guidelines.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42020177069.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate existing evidence of prospective cohort studies on associations between insomnia and multiple health outcomes. Study design: An umbrella review of meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies. Methods: A systematic search was undertaken in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science from inception to October 2021 to find meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies investigating the associ-ation of insomnia with any health outcome. The summary relative risk (SRR) for each meta-analysis was recalculated with random-effects model. The methodological quality and the quality of evidence were assessed by the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation, respectively. Results: A total of 25 published meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies, reporting 63 SRRs for 29 unique outcomes were included. Insomnia was mainly related to cardiovascular outcomes and mental disorders. The former comprised atrial fibrillation (SRR: 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.26 to 1.35), cardiovascular diseases (1.45, 1.29 to 1.64), coronary heart disease (1.28, 1.10 to 1.50), myocardial infarction (1.42, 1.17 to 1.72), and stroke (1.55, 1.39 to 1.72). The latter involved alcohol abuse (1.35, 1.08 to 1.67), all mental disorders (2.16, 1.70 to 3.97), anxiety (3.23, 1.52 to 6.85), depression (2.31, 1.90 to 2.81), suicidal ideation (2.26, 1.79 to 2.86), suicidal attempt (1.99, 1.31 to 3.02), and suicidal death (1.72, 1.42 to 2.08). Besides, insomnia enhanced the risk of Alzheimer's disease (1.51, 1.06 to 2.14) and hyperlipidemia (1.64, 1.53 to 1.76). Conclusion: Insomnia exhibits considerable adverse outcomes, primarily comprises cardiovascular out-comes and mental disorders, but further studies with robustly designed trials are needed to draw firmer conclusions.

AB  - While the prevalence of non-communicable disease risk factors is understood to be higher among migrants than for people born in host nations, little is known about the dementia risk profile of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. This systematic review examines published literature to understand what is currently reported about 12 identified modifiable risk factors for dementia among migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers residing in Australia. Three literature databases (PubMed/CINAHL/MEDLINE) were systematically searched to find articles reporting excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury, air pollution, lack of education, hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, and limited social contact in Australia's migrant, refugee and asylum seeker population samples. Papers were systematically reviewed following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 763 studies were found, of which 676 articles were excluded, and 79 articles remained. Despite wide variability in study design, size and purpose, the prevalence and correlates of modifiable risk factors of dementia appears markedly different among the studied samples. Compared with Australian-born participants, migrant samples had a higher prevalence of depression, social isolation, physical inactivity and diabetes mellitus. Insufficient information or conflicting evidence prevented inference about prevalence and correlates for the remaining dementia risk factors. A better understanding of the prevalence and correlates of modifiable dementia risk factors is needed in Australia's migrant, refugee and asylum seeker populations. This information, together with a deeper understanding of the contextual and cultural contributing factors affecting people who arrive in Australia through differing pathways is needed before preventive interventions can be realistically targeted and sensitively implemented.

AB  - PurposeThis systematic review of systematic reviews aims to provide the first global picture of the prevalence and correlates of perinatal depression, and to explore the commonalities and discrepancies of the literature.MethodsSeven databases were searched from inception until April 2022. Full-text screening and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers and the AMSTAR tool was used to assess the methodological quality.Results128 systematic reviews were included in the analysis. Mean overall prevalence of perinatal depression, antenatal depression and postnatal depression was 26.3%, 28.5% and 27.6%, respectively. Mean prevalence was significantly higher (27.4%; SD = 12.6) in studies using self-reported measures compared with structured interviews (17.0%, SD = 4.5; d = 1.0) and among potentially vulnerable populations (32.5%; SD = 16.7, e.g. HIV-infected African women) compared to the general population (24.5%; SD = 8.1; d = 0.6). Personal history of mental illness, experiencing stressful life events, lack of social support, lifetime history of abuse, marital conflicts, maternity blues, child care stress, chronic physical health conditions, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, being exposed to second-hand smoke and sleep disturbance were among the major correlates of perinatal depression.ConclusionAlthough the included systematic reviews were all of medium-high quality, improvements in the quality of primary research in this area should be encouraged. The standardisation of perinatal depression assessment, diagnosis and measurement, the implementation of longitudinal designs in studies, inclusions of samples that better represent the population and better control of potentially confounding variables are encouraged.

AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are psychological interventions widely used in menopausal women. Currently, there is no evidence summary on the effectiveness of MBIs on anxiety, depression, stress, and mindfulness in menopausal women. This meta-analysis examines the effectiveness of MBIs in improving anxiety, depression, stress, and mindfulness scores in menopausal women. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang, using relevant terms such as MBIs as keywords and covering all studies published before March 13, 2022. The outcomes were anxiety, depression, stress, and mindfulness. The screening and extraction of data were conducted by two independent reviewers. Results: A total of 1,138 menopausal women participated in 13 studies. Meta-analysis results showed that MBIs significantly reduced stress in menopausal women (SMD = -0.84, 95% CI: -1.64 to -0.05, p = 0.04), but no statistical differences were found in reducing anxiety (SMD = -0.40, 95% CI: -0.81 to 0.01, p = 0.06) and depression (SMD = -0.19, 95% CI: -0.45 to 0.07, p = 0.16) and in raising the scores of mindfulness (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.81, p = 0.09) in menopausal women. Conclusion: MBIs may reduce stress in menopausal women, but their effect on improving anxiety, depression, and mindfulness needs further validation.

AB  - IntroductionThe stigma of not giving birth to children affects approximately 53. 08 similar to 64% of female infertility patients worldwide. This stigma not only causes harm to the mental health of these infertility patients, but also affects their quality of life, making them bear the adverse social consequences such as domestic violence, marriage breakdown, or even delay in receiving the treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to have a deep understanding of the patients' stigma and effective intervention in alleviating it. Aims/QuestionThis study aims to discuss and summarize the stigma in infertile women and its impact on patients, and to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment and nursing intervention of disease stigma in infertile female patients. MethodsThe literature search used four English databases (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed) and two Chinese databases (CNKI and Wanfang). The search time of the literature ranges from the establishment of the library to 2022, with no language restriction. ResultsThe review included 28 studies, with 20 cross-sectional studies and 8 qualitative studies. This study found that social support, living environment, education level, occupation, and fertility awareness were the major influencing factors of infertility stigma. ConclusionsInfertility stigma can bring heavy mental pressure and psychological burden to female infertility patients and affect their quality of life. Therefore, effective and targeted psychological interventions should be developed to reduce the patients' stigma and improve their quality of life. Implications for practiceHealthcare workers must develop targeted nursing interventions, provide professional counseling services to reduce the level of stigma in female infertility patients, alleviate fertility stress, and improve their quality of life.

AB  - IntroductionViolence perpetration by adults with severe mental illness (SMI) specifically towards their relatives is a sensitive topic and a largely neglected area that has consequences and implications for different stakeholders, including healthcare providers. This paper sought to systematically review the relevant literature, to identify the types and rates of violence by people with SMI against their relatives, and to develop a detailed understanding of its reported impacts. MethodsA systematic review, registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42019150784), was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The review comprised searches of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo and CINAHL databases, supplemented by manual searches. Data from 38 papers using mixed methodologies were reviewed. ResultsKey findings highlighted that relatives experienced different types of violence, including physical, verbal, psychological, financial violence, and violence directed towards property. Different types often co-occurred. Mothers were the group most likely to report being victims, compared with other relatives. Reported impacts of violence on relatives included mental ill health (e.g., psychological distress, post-traumatic stress symptoms) and the deterioration, and in some cases the permanent breakdown, of family relationships and the family unit. However, relatives often continued to provide a framework of support for patients, despite risks to their own safety. ConclusionFindings speak to the importance of future research extending the focus beyond the identified victimised relative or perpetrator, to also consider the impacts of violence at the family-wide level, and to improve the outcomes of families exposed to and dealing with violence by individuals living with SMI.

AB  - Background Vaccination is an essential public health intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. Despite being at higher at risk of infectious diseases, health inequalities towards vaccine uptake in people with mental health issues have not been systematically appraised. Methods We searched 7 databases from 1994 to 26/03/2021. We included all studies with a relative measure of effect comparing a group with a mental health issue to a control group. All studies covering any mental health issue were eligible with no constraints to study population, vaccine type or region, provided in a high-income country for comparability of health care systems. The study outcomes were synthesised by study population, mental health issue and type of vaccine. Results From 4,069 titles, 23 eligible studies from 12 different countries were identified, focusing on adults (n = 13) or children (n = 4) with mental health issues, siblings of children with mental health issues (n = 2), and mothers with mental health issue and vaccine uptake in their children (n = 6). Most studies focused on depression (n = 12), autism, anxiety, or alcoholism (n = 4 respectively). Many studies were at high risk of selection bias. Discussion Mental health issues were associated with considerably lower vaccine uptake in some contexts such as substance use disorder, but findings were heterogeneous overall and by age, mental health issue or types of vaccine. Only individuals with mental health issues and physical comorbidities had consistently higher uptake in comparison to other adults. Mental health should be considered as a health inequality for vaccine uptake but more context specific research is needed focusing more on specific mental health issues and subgroups of the population to understand who misses vaccination and why.

AB  - Internalizing mental disorders are highly comorbid with one another, and evidence suggests that etiological processes contributing to these disorders often overlap. This systematic umbrella review aimed to synthesize meta-analytic evidence from observational longitudinal studies to provide a comprehensive overview of potentially modifiable risk and protective factors across the depressive, anxiety, and eating disorder psychopa-thology domains. Six databases were searched from inception to August 2022. Only meta-analyses of longitu-dinal studies that accounted for baseline psychopathology (either via exclusion of baseline cases or statistical adjustment for baseline symptoms) were included. Methodological quality of meta-analyses was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2, and quality of evidence for each analysis was rated using GRADE. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were conducted in duplicate by independent reviewers. The protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020185575). Sixty-one meta-analyses were included, corre-sponding to 137 meta-analytic estimates for unique risk/protective factor-psychopathology relationships. Most potential risk/protective factors, however, were examined only in relation to depressive psychopathology. Concern over mistakes and self-esteem were the only risk and protective factors, respectively, identified as statistically significant across depressive, anxiety, and eating disorder psychopathology domains. Eight risk factors and four protective factors also emerged as having transdiagnostic relevance across depressive and anxiety domains. Results suggest intervention targets that may be valuable for preventing/treating the spectrum of internalizing psychopathology and reducing comorbidity. However, few factors were identified as trans -diagnostically relevant across all three internalizing domains, highlighting the need for more research investi-gating similar sets of potential risk/protective factors across internalizing domains.

AB  - Introduction: Humor as a valuable construct in psychology has been the subject of much discussion for many years and has received increased attention more recently in the field of positive psychology. However, empirical research on the application of humor in a clinical setting with depressed or anxious clients has been difficult to discover. Because of the potential benefits and the low costs of providing humorous interventions, our goal was to give an overview of the studies conducted in psychotherapy and to show the effect of humor on the levels of depression and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, we wanted to assess the empiric support of humor as a clinical intervention in psychotherapy according to the SIGN system.Methods: We used the PRISMA guidelines. Because of the differences in the design of the 10 included studies, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis.Results: Results from studies performed in seven different countries show that humorous interventions can have significant positive effects on symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results also confirm the prior observation that empirical research in the field is based on different designs with different populations and different methods of translating the abstract concept of humor into measurable observations. The results need to be considered with caution because of the methodological limitations of the research to date.Discussion: Some authors advocate for an integrative approach to continue research on humor in psychotherapy. It is our recommendation to first focus on the separate aspects of humor and to conduct research based on sound methodology. To initiate wider research to the application of humor in psychotherapy, we propose an approach to humorous interventions based on surprise and confusion which can help clients to search for an alternative framework to resolve the confusion and therefore promote taking on new perspectives and distancing themselves from the actual problem.

AB  - ObjectiveThe number of citations to a paper represents the weight of that work in a particular area of interest. Several highly cited papers are listed in the bibliometric analysis. This study aimed to identify and analyze the 100 most cited papers in insomnia research that might appeal to researchers and clinicians. MethodsWe reviewed the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection database to identify articles from 1985 to 24 March 2022. The R bibliometric package was used to further analyze citation counts, authors, year of publication, source journal, geographical origin, subject, article type, and level of evidence. Word co-occurrence in 100 articles was visualized using VOS viewer software. ResultsA total of 44,654 manuscripts were searched on the Web of Science. Between 2001 and 2021, the top 100 influential manuscripts were published, with a total citation frequency of 38,463. The top countries and institutions contributing to the field were the U.S. and Duke University. Morin C.M. was the most productive author, ranking first in citations. Sleep had the highest number of manuscripts published in the top 100 (n = 31), followed by Sleep Medicine Reviews (n = 9). The most cited manuscript (Bastien et al., Sleep Medicine, 2001; 3,384 citations) reported clinical validation of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) as a brief screening indicator for insomnia and as an outcome indicator for treatment studies. Co-occurrence analyses suggest that psychiatric disorders combined with insomnia and cognitive behavioral therapy remain future research trends. ConclusionThis study provides a detailed list of the most cited articles on insomnia. The analysis provides researchers and clinicians with a detailed overview of the most cited papers on insomnia over the past two decades. Notably, COVID-19, anxiety, depression, CBT, and sleep microstructure are potential areas of focus for future research.

KW  - Mental illness
KW  - TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Background and objectives: This systematic review aimed to investigate the experiences and opinions of people with mental illness regarding the role of telemedicine in their treatment. Methods: To be eligible, studies were required to include people between 18 and 65 years of age with mental illness, defined as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or personality disorder. It was further required that the patients' experiences of the telehealth solutions were reported. Between April 5, 2020, and June 29, 2020 (renewed November 10, 2021), the CINAHL electronic database was searched. Using the OVID search engine, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were likewise searched; gray literature was retrieved from Scopus. The included studies were critically appraised using the CASP checklists.Results: Seventeen studies were included. Treatment provided via telehealth technology offered people with mental illness insights and skills that helped them cope better in everyday life. The patient-therapist relationship was improved where the parties collaborated. Furthermore, gaining control of one's mental health by using an app and following one's development empowered people with mental illness, leading to greater involvement in treatment. Conclusions: Engaging people with mental illness in decisions concerning the use of telehealth technology is essential. It is likewise important that both people with mental illness and health professionals have access to help with the implementation of technology, and that telehealth solutions function as a supplement rather than a substitute for face-to-face treatment.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Cancer diagnosis and treatment constitute profoundly stressful experiences involving unique and common challenges that generate uncertainty, fear, and emotional distress. Individuals with cancer must cope with multiple stressors, from the point of diagnosis through surgical and adjuvant treatments and into survivorship, that require substantial psychological and physiological adaptation. This can take a toll on quality of life and well-being and may also promote cellular and molecular changes that can exacerbate physical symptoms and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis, thereby contributing to negative long-term health outcomes. Since modifying responses to stressors might improve psychological and physiological adaptation, quality of life, and clinical health outcomes, several randomized controlled trials have tested interventions that aim to facilitate stress management. We review evidence for the effects of stress management interventions on psychological and physiological adaptation and health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors and summarize emerging research in the field to address unanswered questions.

AB  - Background: The increasing use of digital mental health (DMH) platforms and digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) is hindered by uncertainty over effectiveness, quality and usability. There is a need to identify the types of available evidence in this domain. Aim: This study is a scoping review identifying evaluation of the (1) DMH platform/s used; and (2) DMHI/s applied on the DMH platform/s. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guided the review process. Empirical studies that focused on evaluation of the use and application of DMH platforms were included from journal articles (published 2012-2022). A literature search was conducted using four electronic databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect, Sage and ACM Digital Library) and two search engines (PubMed and Google Scholar). Results: A total of 6874 nonduplicate records were identified, of which 144 were analyzed and 22 met the inclusion criteria. The review included general/unspecified mental health and/or suicidality indications (n = 9, 40.9%), followed by depression (n = 5, 22.7%), psychosis (n = 3, 13.6%), anxiety and depression (n = 2, 9.1%), as well as anxiety, depression and suicidality (n = 1, 4.5%), loneliness (n = 1, 4.5%), and addiction (n = 1, 4.5%). There were 11 qualitative studies (50%), 8 quantitative studies (36.4%), and 3 mixed-methods studies (n = 3, 13.6%). The results contained 11 studies that evaluated the DMH platform/s and 11 studies that evaluated the DMHI/s. The studies focused on feasibility, usability, engagement, acceptability and effectiveness. There was a small amount of significant evidence (1 in each 11), notably the (cost-)effectiveness of a DMHI with significant long-term impact on anxiety and depression in adults. Conclusion: The empirical research demonstrates the feasibility of DMH platforms and DMHIs. To date, there is mostly heterogeneous, preliminary evidence for their effectiveness, quality and usability. However, a scalable DMHI reported effectiveness in treating adults' anxiety and depression. The scope of effectiveness may be widened through targeted strategies, for example by engaging independent young people.

AB  - Objective: Type 1 diabetes is associated with increased prevalence of individual categories of mental disorders. We aimed to systematically synthesise the prevalence of all the different categories of mental disorders to estimate the overall burden of psychiatric morbidity in the type 1 diabetes population.Method: The electronic database of OVID was searched, and retrieved papers were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction form and the quality of included papers was assessed. Where possible, comparisons with control groups without type 1 diabetes were made. Prevalence data were synthesised into Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 categories, a narrative data-synthesis, and a subsequent meta-analysis where possible was conducted for mental disorder categories.Results: Thirty-eight articles were included. Depressive, anxiety, and feeding and eating disorders were the most examined mental disorders. Studies utilising diagnostic interviews reported higher prevalence of mental disorders than in studies utilising clinical registers, with an up to 24-fold difference respectively. In studies with a control group, the prevalence for nearly every mental disorder were increased for the type 1 diabetes samples.Conclusions: There appears to be a high prevalence of mental disorders and associated need among people with type 1 diabetes, although the quality of research needs to improve. Systematic review registration: This protocol was submitted for registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42020221530).

AB  - This work presents a systematic documen-tary review for the development of a frame of reference on the psychological factors of university students in relation to the pre-pan-demic quality of life. Psychological factors are understood as psychological well-being and present the development of individual capa-bilities and human growth from self-accep-tance, autonomy, positive relationships, life purpose and personal growth, which reflect attitudes and values of people, which are directly related to their quality of life. Like-wise, it is evident in the literature that the stage of university life is framed by biopsychosocial changes that establish it as a period of atten-tion for mature development and is considered as a transition for the later stages of the human life cycle. In this sense, from an ecological theory perspective, the environment in which people relate has a direct influence on their formative development (Bronfenbrenner, 1987), since the levels of environment in which they are immersed determine positive or negative behavior, affecting their social and cultural conditions (Shelton, 2019). There-fore, changes in behavior are associated with some risk factors that can affect the health and quality of life of university students. The methodological approach used is focused on a descriptive qualitative study, through a system-atic documentary review by the PRISMA methodology (Khan et al., 2003 y Moher et al., 2009) with the main characteristics, trends and particularities existing in the literature on psychological factors in young university students. For the systematic review of this work, we chose to use the five stages called: Search, Identification, Screening, Eligibility, and Interpretation. The Search procedure was initiated from the categories of psychological factors related to the quality of life in univer-sity students and from the search equations. As a source of information, papers published in the databases of RedALyC, Scopus, Else-vier, EBSCO, Springer Link, Medline and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collec-tion during the period between January 2015 and first half of the year 2020 were used. For the Identification stage, inclusion and exclu-sion criteria were elaborated considering articles published in scientific journals of psychology and health in the period covered. In the Screening stage, they found a total of 41 950 papers in 82 journals registered in the databases. The following were eliminated: 28 125 papers outside the selection period, 1 457 duplicate studies, and 11 733 articles from other disciplines. Therefore, in the Eligi-bility stage, 635 papers were selected for the reading of the title and summary; of these, 263 documents were chosen for the reading of the complete texts and, a total of 29 papers were left in the last stage of Interpretation for the study and analysis of the results. The results show the prevalence of quantitative studies, as well as the current interest for the moment of the life cycle of adolescence-youth in one of its developmental contexts: the university; and the psychological factors added to the contextual aspects involved in the emergence and approach of problems such as anxiety, suicidal ideation and depression. Likewise, the effect of these aspects on the perception of quality of life and psychological well-being is evident. Similarly, the concept of lifestyles emerges as a variable that acts as a product and condition in the development of students at this stage of the life cycle.
   Finally, catego-ries such as emotional intelligence, resilience, and coping are shown to be inputs to formulate proposals that can favor the development of adolescents and young people. In conclusion, it is necessary to carry out more studies on psychological factors and the problems asso-ciated with them, as a reflection of the quality of life from the perspective of promoting the health of university students.

AB  - Globally, depression and anxiety are major public health concerns with onset during adolescence. While rural Australia experiences overall lower health outcomes, variation in mental health prevalence rates between rural and urban Australia is unclear. The aim of this paper was to estimate the pooled prevalence rates for depression and anxiety among young Australians aged between 10 and 24 years. Selected studies from a systematic literature search were assessed for risk of bias. Random effects model using DerSimonian and Laird method with Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation was fitted. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Prevalence estimates were stratified by region and disorder. The overall pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was 25.3% (95% CI, 19.9-31.0%). In subgroup analysis, anxiety prevalence was 29.9% (95% CI, 21.6-39.0%); depression: 21.3% (95% CI, 14.9-28.5%); and depression or anxiety: 27.2% (95% CI, 20.3-34.6%). Depression and anxiety prevalence were higher in urban 26.1% (95% CI, 17.3-35.9%) compared to rural areas 24.9% (95% CI, 17.5-33%), although the difference was not statistically significant. The heterogeneity was high with an I-2 score of 95.8%. There is need for further research on healthcare access, mental health literacy and help-seeking attitude in Australia.

AB  - Nursing students are reported to have moderate to high test anxiety, leading to reduced academic performance, poor self-esteem, and failure to complete the program and practice nursing. This review aims to examine the interventions for test anxiety reduction in nursing students. Following the PRISMA guidelines, peer-reviewed experimental studies published in English between 2016 and 2021 from four databases, EBSCOhost, PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus, were systematically searched. The findings were presented in tabular and narrative form. Among the 722 studies retrieved, 14 selected studies were critically appraised, guided by the Joanna Briggs checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials and the checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies, resulting in 11 studies for inclusion in the systematic review. Test anxiety was assessed by different scales. Aromatherapy hand massage, aromatherapy using a diffuser in combination with music therapy, confidence training for test relaxation, coping program, music therapy, emotional freedom technique, animal-assisted intervention, and guided imagery were all found to be effective in reducing test anxiety. In conclusion, while numerous interventions to reduce test anxiety in nursing students were found to be effective, the quality of the studies investigating these interventions was varied with generally small sample sizes and limited follow-up. Future research should be conducted, and the same interventions should be carried out using a larger sample size to strengthen the body of evidence.

AB  - Oxidative stress, inflammation, and amyloid-beta are Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks that cause each other and other AD hallmarks. Most amyloid-beta-lowering, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial AD clinical trials failed; none stopped or reversed AD. Although signs suggest an infectious etiology, no pathogen accumulated consistently in AD patients. Neuropathology, neuronal cell culture, rodent, genome-wide association, epidemiological, biomarker, and clinical studies, plus analysis using Hill causality criteria and revised Koch's postulates, indicate that the virus-like oxidative damage-associated molecular-pattern (DAMP) cytosolic and cell-free nucleic acids accumulated in AD patients' brains likely drive neuroinflammation, synaptotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Cytosolic oxidatively-damaged mitochondrial DNA accumulated outside mitochondria dose-dependently in preclinical AD and AD patients' hippocampal neurons, and in AD patients' neocortical neurons but not cerebellar neurons or glia. In oxidatively-stressed neural cells and rodents' brains, cytosolic oxidatively-damaged mitochondrial DNA accumulated and increased antiviral and inflammatory proteins, including cleaved caspase-1, interleukin-1 beta, and interferon-beta. Cytosolic double-stranded RNA and DNA are DAMPs that induce antiviral interferons and/or inflammatory proteins by oligomerizing with various innate-immune pattern-recognition receptors, e.g., cyclic GMP-AMP synthase and the nucleotide-binding-oligomerization-domain-like-receptor-pyrin-domain-containing-3 inflammasome. In oxidatively-stressed neural cells, cytosolic oxidatively-damaged mitochondrial DNA caused synaptotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Depleting mitochondrial DNA prevented these effects. Additionally, cell-free nucleic acids accumulated in AD patients' blood, extracellular vesicles, and senile plaques. Injecting cell-free nucleic acids bound to albumin oligomers into wild-type mice's hippocampi triggered antiviral interferon-beta secretion; interferon-beta injection caused synapse degeneration. Deoxyribonuclease-I treatment appeared to improve a severe-AD patient's Mini-Mental Status Exam by 15 points. Preclinical and clinical studies of deoxyribonuclease-I and a ribonuclease for AD should be prioritized.

AB  - Anxiety is reported to be common and serious among men who have sex with men (MSM). A growing number of researchers focus on MSM's anxiety and reported their severity, while the estimate results vary substantially between studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the pooled prevalence of anxiety or anxiety disorders among MSM worldwide. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Studies will be searched from English and Chinese electronic databases. Observational studies, longitudinal studies, and controlled trials reporting the prevalence of anxiety or anxiety disorders among MSM will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen all the studies and extract data. Quality appraisal will be conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI's) critical appraisal checklist for reporting prevalence data. Meta-analysis will be implemented with a random-effect model which will evaluate pooled prevalence of anxiety with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analysis will be conducted among different regions, sampling methods, data collection methods, MSM characteristics, measures used to assess anxiety and its cut-off. This review will contribute to a great understanding of anxiety among MSM worldwide. The findings will help relative policymakers and researchers develop effective measures and interventions for reducing the burden of anxiety morbidity among this population.

AB  - Background: There have been increasing calls for schizophrenia to be renamed to reduce negative associations with the diagnosis. 'Psychosis' is one proposed alternative, yet some research suggests this has greater negative connotations. This study compared the use of both terms within UK newspapers longitudinally to assess which is more negatively portrayed in the media.Study design: Using LexisLibrary News, six UK newspaper archives were searched for the terms 'schizophrenia' and 'psychosis' in articles published between 2000 and 2019; the included article total was n = 9802. Articles were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software.Study results: A two-level multilevel model was created of newspaper articles nested within newspapers. Adding predictors revealed that diagnostic term was a significant predictor of the emotional tone of articles (beta =-2.30, SE = 0.51, p < .001, 95 % CI-3.30 to -1.30), with 'psychosis' having a more negative tone than 'schizophrenia.' Tabloids were shown to have a significantly more negative tone than broadsheets (beta =-9.32, SE = 1.04, p < .001, 95 % CI-11.36 to -7.28), and emotional tone of writing had become more negative over time (beta =-0.26, SE = 0.04, p < .001, 95 % CI-0.34 to -0.18).Conclusions: These findings suggest 'psychosis' is associated with greater negativity than 'schizophrenia' within UK newspapers, and may be a poor substitute term to reduce stigma. As article tone worsened for both diagnoses over time, increased stigma reduction campaigns are required to target negativity within the media.

AB  - This meta-analytic review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of gamified interventions in bolstering mental health. The gamification and the control groups were compared in terms of the between-group differences in posttest scores of both mental wellness (subjective well-being and quality of life) and psychological symptoms (anxiety and depressive symptoms). The review analyzed 42 studies involving 5792 participants (aged 8-74) across eight world regions. The random-effects meta-analysis revealed an overall small to medium effect size (Hedges' g = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.55; k = 141). The benefits of gamification in enhancing mental wellness were independent of both game and demographic characteristics, but there were intricate findings for studies examining the benefits of gamification in reducing psychological symptoms. For anxiety symptom reduction, the effects were larger (vs. smaller) in studies adopting specific (vs. general) measures of anxiety and in samples comprising a higher (vs. lower) proportion of males (ps < .04). For depressive symptom reduction, the effects were larger (vs. smaller) in non-clinical (vs. clinical) samples (p = .01). These new findings are promising in showing the viability of gamification in promoting mental wellness, encouraging greater collaborations among scholars, practitioners, and game developers to contribute to the growing field of gamification science by co -designing more effective gamified interventions.

AB  - Objective: A growing number of clinical studies have suggested the value of acupuncture-related therapies for patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), and the patient's mental state plays an important role, but there are many types of acupuncture-related therapies involved. This study aimed to evaluate the mental status, efficacy and safety of the different acupuncture-related therapies for IBS-D patients.
   Methods: We searched seven databases to collect randomized controlled trials of acupuncture-related therapies for IBS-D. After independent literature screening and data extraction, the quality of the final included literature was evaluated. Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA), hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and self-rating depression scale (SDS) was used as the primary outcome indicator. And the network metaanalysis (NMA) was performed by using Revman 5.4, Stata 15.0 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 software, and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve was conducted to rank the included interventions.
   Results: We analyzed 24 eligible studies with 1,885 patients, involving eight types of acupuncture and related therapies along with comprehensive therapies. The NMA result shows that: for SAS scores, combined therapies were more efficacious than anti-diarrheal or antispasmodic (western medicine, WM) (SMD: 8.92; 95% CI: 15.30, 2.47); for SDS scores, combined therapies were more efficacious than WM (SMD: 8.45; 95% CI: 15.50, 1.41). For HAMA scores, moxibustion (MOX) was more efficacious than placebo (SMD: 8.66; 95% CI: 16.64, 0.38). For HAMD scores, MOX was more efficacious than all other included interventions. For response rate, MOX was more efficacious than the following interventions: acupuncture (ACU) (SMD:0.29; 95% CI:0.08,0.93), Chinese herb medicine (CH) (SMD:0.09; 95% CI:0.02,0.36), combined therapies (SMD:0.23; 95% CI:0.06, 0.85), electroacupuncture (EA) (SMD:0.06; 95% CI:0.01,0.33), warm acupuncture (WA) (SMD:22.16; 95% CI:3.53,148.10), WM (SMD:15.59; 95% CI:4.68,61.21), and placebo (SMD:9.80; 95% CI:2.90,45.51). Combined therapies were more efficacious than the following interventions: CH (SMD:0.39; 95% CI:0.19,0.80), WA (SMD:4.96; 95% CI:1.30,21.62), and WM (SMD:3.62; 95% CI:2.35,5.66). The comprehensive ranking results show that MOX, ACU, combined therapies, and EA had high SUCRA rankings involving different outcome indicators.
   Conclusion: MOX, ACU, combined therapies, and EA better alleviate anxiety and depression among IBS-D patients, and with a higher safety level, may be the optimal therapies. In addition, combining acupuncture-related treatments and other therapies also delivers a higher global benefit level.

MethodsA computer-based search for studies related to postpartum depression (PPD) was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection from 2017 to 2021. Using CiteSpace 5.8. R3 visualization software, this paper analyzed the hot spots and frontiers of postpartum depression research from countries, institutions, authors, cited references and keywords, and drew corresponding knowledge maps. ResultsA total of 3,789 articles were retrieved, and the annual publication volume showed a steady increase. The countries and institutions with the most publications were the United States and the University of Toronto, respectively. Cindylee Dennis was the most productive author. The most frequently cited and centrally cited articles were meta-analyses on risk factors associated with antenatal depression or anxiety and meta-analyses on the prevalence of antenatal or postnatal anxiety, respectively. The research hotspots in the field of postpartum depression in the past 5 years mainly focused on the risk factors for PPD, and the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on PPD. Providing various aspects of social and family support to women with PPD may be a research trend in this field. ConclusionThis study provides a trend and frontier in the field of postpartum depression, and valuable information for researchers to find potential partners and partner countries, and a reference for future research topics and development directions.

AB  - The World Health Organization's 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) including the chapter on mental disorders has come into effect this year. This review focuses on the "Bipolar or Related Disorders " section of the ICD-11 draft. It describes the benchmarks for the new version, particularly the foremost principle of clinical utility. The alterations made to the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) are evaluated on their scientific basis and clinical utility. The change in the diagnostic requirements for manic and hypomanic episodes has been much debated. Whether the current criteria have achieved an optimum balance between sensitivity and specificity is still not clear. The ICD-11 definition of depressive episodes is substantially different, but the lack of empirical support for the changes has meant that the reliability and utility of bipolar depression are relatively low. Unlike the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), the ICD-11 has retained the category of mixed episodes. Although the concept of mixed episodes in the ICD-11 is not perfect, it appears to be more inclusive than the DSM-5 approach. Additionally, there are some uncertainties about the guidelines for the subtypes of BD and cyclothymic disorder. The initial results on the reliability and clinical utility of BD are promising, but the newly created diagnostic categories also appear to have some limitations. Although further improvement and research are needed, the focus should now be on facing the challenges of implementation, dissemination, and education and training in the use of these guidelines.

AB  - Background: Taijiquan, as a physical and mental exercise, can improve the negative psychology of college students. However, it is still controversial, and the optimal exercise dose of taijiquan to interfere with negative psychology has not been evaluated. Objective: This study is aimed at systematically evaluating the effect of taijiquan therapy on improving negative psychological symptoms of college students and its optimal intervention dose. Methods: Search databases such as Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, CNKI, WFSD, etc. Collect high-quality relevant RCT studies. After screening, extracting, coding and counting the data, a META analysis is done through Review Manage 5.3 and Stata 15.0 software. PICOS established the eligibility criteria to select the studies as follows: (i) population - non-clinical of college students; (ii) intervention - taijiquan intervention; (iii) comparison - taijiquan intervention group and regular physical activity group; (iv) outcomes - depression, anxiety; and (v) study design - randomized controlled trial.ResultsA total of 12 articles and 1,000 samples were included. All of the participants are college students. Taijiquan therapy can significantly reduce the depression and anxiety symptoms of college students [SMD = -0.53, 95% CI (-0.82, -0.23)], [SMD = -0.49, 95% CI (-0.90, -0.09)], with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis shows that: there is a precise focus on depression and anxiety symptoms. The intervention period is more than 12 weeks, and the best effect appears when people practice 3 times a week. The best single intervention time for depression symptoms is 60 min, and for anxiety symptoms 80-90 min. It is found that taijiquan combined with mindfulness intervention can significantly reduce negative psychological symptoms like depression and anxiety of college students than single taijiquan intervention. Funnel plot combined with sensitivity analysis, Begg, Egger test showed no publication bias. Conclusion: Taijiquan intervention can effectively improve the negative psychological symptoms of college students, and it has great promotion value in colleges and universities.

AB  - Alterations in the concentrations of trace elements may play a vital role in Alzheimer dementia progression. However, previous research results are inconsistent, and there is still a lack of review on the relationship between all the studied-trace elements and AD from various perspectives of population-based studies. In this study, we systematically reviewed previous population-based studies and identified the altered trace elements in AD patients. We searched the Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and Scopus database, and ultimately included 73 articles. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to explore the evolution of the field from an epidemiological perspective. Bibliometric data such as trace elements, biological materials, detection methods, cognitive tests, cooccurrence and co-citation statistics are all analyzed and presented in a quantitative manner. The 73 included studies analyzed 39 trace elements in total. In a further meta-analysis, standardized mean differences (SMDs) of 13 elements were calculated to evaluate their altered in AD patients, including copper, iron, zinc, selenium, manganese, lead, aluminum, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, mercury, cobalt, and manganese. We identified four trace elements-copper (serum), iron (plasma), zinc (hair), and selenium (plasma)-altered in AD patients, with SMDs of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10, 0.65), -0.68 (95% CI: -1.34, -0.02), -0.35 (95% CI: -0.62, -0.08), and -0.61 (95% CI: -0.97, -0.25), respectively. Finally, we formed a database of various trace element levels in AD patients and healthy controls. Our study can help future researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of the advancements in the field, and our results provide comprehensive population-based data for future research.

AB  - Objectives: We performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) with up-to-date evidence to compare different anti-inflammatory agents to improve the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) patients.Methods: Four databases (i.e., the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1995 and 2022 on the use of anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of BD. A systematic review and NMA were conducted.Results: Adjunctive N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was superior to placebo for the treatment of BD according to the endpoint scale score (SMD-0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.99 to -0.31), response rate (odds ratio (OR) 3.42, 95% CI: 1.23-9.52), remission rate (OR 4.94, 95% CI: 1.03-41.38) and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) value of the endpoint scale score (0.84). Adjunctive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were more favorable than placebo based on the remission rate (OR 3.93, 95% CI: 1.15-13.43) and were significantly more acceptable than other treatments (OR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.36-0.99). Adjunctive coen-zyme Q10 (CoQ10) was superior to other agents in terms of the response rate (OR 18.85, 95% CI: 2.63-135.00), with a SUCRA value for the response rate of 0.90 and that for the remission rate of 0.71.Conclusion: Adjunctive NAC is recommended for the treatment of BD. Adjunctive NSAIDs and CoQ10 are still seen as effective, but more high-quality clinical studies are needed to verify their efficacy. Other anti-inflammatory agents may not be recommended for clinical use at present. All anti-inflammatory agents demonstrated a good safety profile. We call for further research on the combined treatment of BD with different anti-inflammatory agents to be included in future trials.

AB  - Meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) was one of the first compounds used in clinical and preclinical studies that demonstrated the role of serotonin in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This systematic review aimed to (a) identify publications that report in rodents the effects of mCPP relevant to OCD, (b) explore the methodological characteristics of these studies, and (c) summarize the profile of mCPP effects. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Search terms were a combination of obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD and meta-chlorophenylpiperazine or mCPP. Twenty-nine articles were included in the review. The years of publication ranged from 1993 to 2021. Most studies used adult male Wistar or Sprague-Dawley rats. The most frequent dose of mCPP was 1.0 mg/kg administered acutely, intraperitoneally. In general, available preclinical evidence suggests increased defensive and compulsive behaviors associated with a decreased locomotor activity. But other results besides these and the absence of significant mCPP effects were also observed. Among the factors that may contribute to the variability of mCPP effects, differences in meth-ods are highlighted, such as characteristics of the species/strains studied, mCPP doses and treatment regimens used. The heterogeneity of the OCD-like behaviors evaluated and the interaction of mCPP with different receptors may also be critical variables for discrepancies in the findings with mCPP. The information described in this review may contribute to a better understanding of how mCPP-induced behavioral changes in rodents have been used to study OCD, highlighting the main challenges for future investigations in this field.(c) 2022 IBRO.

AB  - ObjectiveMyasthenia gravis (MG) people experience adverse psychiatric outcomes, which may impact on their life and disturb their daily activity. Depression and anxiety are identified as significant psychiatric problems that MG people face. However, there is no sufficient epidemiological information about depression and anxiety-based publication. Due to this limitation, the aim of this study was to review the prevalence of depression and anxiety in MG patients. MethodsOriginal and international databases were searched to find papers about the estimation of anxiety and depression. Random-effects analysis was used for calculating the proportions of anxiety and depression. For estimating anxiety and depression based the severity, instruments, type of studies, and study regions, subgroup analysis was performed. Results38 studies met inclusion criteria and entered study. The pooling of the prevalence of depression was found at 36%, (95% CI 28% to 45%). Also, prevalence of anxiety was found at 33%, (95% CI 25% to 42%). Prevalence of depression based on mild, moderate, and severe level was 27%, 14%, and 9%, respectively. ConclusionsAnxiety and depression are a major concern among MG individuals. The estimation of both anxiety and depression are high even when compared to other autoimmune diseases. It seems depression and anxiety are important issues and more attention needs to be paid to these psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Objectives Physical and cognitive tasks occur together in many occupations. Previous reviews of combined tasks have mainly focused on their effects in a sports context. This review investigated to which extent combinations (concurrent or alternating) of occupationally relevant physical and cognitive tasks influence responses reflecting biomechanical exposure, stress, fatigue, performance, and well-being. Methods We searched Scopus, Pubmed, Cinahl, and Psychinfo for controlled experiments investigating the effects of combinations of occupationally relevant physical and cognitive tasks in participants aged 18 to 70. In total, we identified 12 447 records. We added recent papers that had cited these studies (n = 573) to arrive at a total of 13 020 publications. After screening for relevance, 61 studies remained, of which 57 were classified to be of medium or high quality. Of the 57 studies, 51 addressed concurrent tasks, 5 alternating tasks, and 1 both concurrent and alternating tasks. Results Most studies of concurrent physical and cognitive tasks reported negative effects, if numerically small, on indicators of biomechanical exposure, fatigue, and performance, compared to a physical task alone. Results were mixed for stress indicators, and well-being was too little studied to justify any conclusions. Effects depended on the tasks, including their intensity and complexity. Alternating physical and cognitive tasks did not appear to influence outcomes much, compared to having passive breaks in-between physical tasks. Conclusions The reviewed evidence indicated that concurrent physical and cognitive work tasks have negative, yet small effects on biomechanical indicators, fatigue and performance, compared to performing the physical task alone, but only if the physical task is intense, and the cognitive task is complex. Alternating between physical and cognitive tasks may have similar effects as breaking up physical tasks by passive breaks, but studies were few. Future studies should address ecologically valid combinations of physical and cognitive tasks, in particular in controlled field studies devoted to the long-term effects of combined work.

AB  - Context: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease in which the myelin lining the central nervous system is damaged and often occurs between the ages of 20 and 40. In addition to loss of motor, sensory, and cognitive function, patients with MS also experience related symptoms such as depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, and pain.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to systematically and meta-analyze the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral, mindfulness and acceptance and commitment (CMAC) therapies to improving the psychological symptoms of patients with multiple sclerosis in Iran.
   Methods: The study was conducted using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. This study examined articles published from the beginning until November 20, 2021 in Persian and English on cognitive and behavioral interventions performed in Iran, in order to influence psychological symptoms for people with multiple sclerosis. Articles relevant to research were screened in external (Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science) and internal databases (Sid, Magiran, Ganj, Irandoc, Civilica). The quality of the included RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane guideline risk of bias tool. The results were expressed in terms of mean difference (MD) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Data analyses were performed by RevMan5.4.
   Results: In the first stage of the search, 792 articles were obtained. After reviewing the titles of the articles, 701 articles were discarded due to irrelevance and duplication and 91 articles remained. Finally, 21 studies were selected by reviewing the abstracts and considering the inclusion criteria. Compared with the control group, the standardized mean difference (SMD) estimate depression was 1.60 (2.27, 0.93), for anxiety 0.49 (0.80, 0.19), for stress 0.97 (1.70, 0.23) and for fatigue 0.19 (2.75, 1.25) had a positive effect; But no significant effect on pain reduction equal to 0.49 (2.21, 1.23) was not found.
   Conclusions: The meta-analysis in the posttest showed that the effects of CMAC were considerable on reducing depression, anxiety, stress, and fatigue, but the effects were not notable for pain mitigation. Future high quality studies with follow-up evaluations are needed to support the effects of CMAC on reducing symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis and to evaluate the interventional features that enhance and maintain the effects.

AB  - Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) may be associated with worse physical and mental health in adulthood, and low physical activity engagement, but the relationships are not fully understood. Objectives: To establish the scope of the literature exploring associations between ACEs, physical activity, and physical and mental health. Methods: We conducted this scoping review according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and PsycInfo for relevant articles. Results: Eighteen studies were included, 17 observational and 1 randomized controlled trial. The majority of studies were cross-sectional and employed self-reported physical activity and ACE measures. Six studies explored physical health, 9 explored mental health, and 3 explored both. Associations between ACEs and poor physical health outcomes (poor self-reported physical health, inflammation, high resting heart rate, and obesity) were consistently weaker or attenuated among those who were physically active. Physical activity may also moderate the associations between ACEs and depressive symptoms, psychological functioning, and health-related quality of life. Conclusion: Associations between ACEs and poor physical and mental health were observed in those with less frequent physical activity engagement, though the majority of evidence relies on cross-sectional observational designs with self-report instruments. Further research is required to determine whether physical activity can prevent or treat poor physical and mental health in the presence of ACEs.

A systematic search for articles published between 2010 and 2020 was conducted using five databases. The RevMan software version 5 was used. Out of 671 studies, 8 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Three studies reported that eye movement desensitization and reprocessing reduced depression symptoms better than cognitive behavior therapy in both children, adolescents, and adults (SDM (95% CI) = -2.43 (-3.93--0.94), p = 0.001). In three other studies, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing were shown to reduce anxiety in children and adolescents better than cognitive behavior therapy (SDM (95% CI) = -3.99 (-5.47--2.52), p < 0.001). In terms of reducing PTSD symptoms, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and cognitive behavior therapy did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences (SDM (95% CI) = -0.14 (-0.48-0.21), p = 0.44). There was no statistically significant difference at the three-month follow-up and at the six-month follow-up for depression (p = 0.31), anxiety (p = 0.59), and PTSD (p = 0.55). We recommend randomized trials with larger samples and longer follow-up times in the future.

AB  - Chemsex is presented as a major challenge in public health, with numerous physical and mental consequences. The general objective of this review was to analyze the relationship between the practice of chemsex and the development of psychosis. A mixed systematic review model was chosen. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched following a predetermined search strategy. The studies were selected, and their information was extracted following a systematic method. A total of 10 articles were included. Psychotic symptoms ranged from 6.7% to 37.2%, being one of the most frequent psychiatric diagnoses. Slamsex, polydrug use and smoked methamphetamine posed up to a 3-fold increased risk of psychosis within this practice. The risk factors found were foreign or ethnic minority status, location in large cities, stress and anxiety, trauma, loneliness, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), hepatitis, and previous psychotic history. In conclusion, chemsex is associated with psychosis development; we found numerous converging risk factors and a clear mediating role of drugs. It is important, in approaching the prevention and treatment of this addiction, to take into account motivations and psychosocial circumstances.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable disruption to cancer care and may have exacerbated existing challenges already faced by cancer survivors from rural areas. This has created a need for a rapid evidence synthesis to inform the development of tailored interventions that address the specific needs of rural cancer survivors who continue to be affected by the pandemic. The review was conducted following guidance from the Cochrane Rapid Review Methods Group. Database searches were performed via the EBSCOHost interface (includes MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO) on 25 May 2022 and supplemented with searches on Google Scholar. Peer-reviewed articles published after March 2020 that reported primary data on the experiences of cancer survivors residing in rural and remote settings during the pandemic were included. Findings were tabulated and written up narratively. Fourteen studies were included. The COVID-19 pandemic had a mostly detrimental impact on the experiences of rural cancer survivors. People's individual coping mechanisms were challenging for a range of reasons. Specifically, the pandemic impacted on their ability to access testing, treatment, check-ups and supportive care, their ability to maintain and access social support with close friends and family, as well as negative consequences to their finances and emotional wellbeing with some reporting feelings of psychological distress including depression and anxiety. This review provides important insight into the experiences of rural cancer survivors that may help inform tailored support in line with the needs and challenges faced because of the pandemic.

AB  - This systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mental health interventions delivered by frontline health care workers in disasters and public health emergencies. Six databases and trial registries were searched, and manual searches were conducted. Of the 221 studies identified, 21 were included. Meta-analyses assessed differences between the intervention and control in terms of PTSD outcomes. Eleven studies of 1802 participants were incorporated in the meta-analysis. Interventions delivered or prompted by specialist health care workers showed significant and large effects in improving PTSD-related symptoms with a SMD = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.42-1.57, p = 0.0007). Interventions delivered or prompted by frontline non-specialist health care workers showed significant but small effects in improving PTSD-related symptoms with SMD of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.11-0.39; p = 0.0007). The results showed that most mental health interventions delivered by frontline health care workers effectively supported affected people. Mental health interventions delivered by mental health care professionals are effective in reducing PTSD-related disorders in natural disasters. Future adequately powered RCTs are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of mental health interventions delivered by trained non-specialists. Economic modelling may be useful to estimate cost effectiveness in low- and middle-income countries given the difficulties of conducting studies in disaster and emergency settings.

AB  - Objectives: The relationship between maternal alcohol consumption and postpartum depression (PPD) is still controversial. The objective of the present study was to assess the association between maternal alcohol consumption and the risk of developing PPD by means of a meta-analysis of cohort studies. Study design: This was a meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Weipu, and Wanfang databases were searched up to February 4, 2021, to identify relevant studies that evaluated the association between maternal alcohol consumption and PPD. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan software and Stata software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the potential heterogeneity source, and Begg's funnel plots and Begg's linear regression test were conducted to assess the potential publication bias. Results: A total of 12 studies involving 50,377 participants were identified in our study. Overall, pregnant women who were exposed to alcohol were at a significantly greater risk of developing PPD compared with those who did not consume alcohol (odds ratio = 1.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.41; P = 0.020). Conclusions: Maternal alcohol consumption is significantly associated with the risk of developing PPD. These results emphasize the necessity of enhancing health awareness, improving the public health policies and regulations concerning alcohol use, and strengthening the prevention and intervention of maternal alcohol consumption to promote maternal mental health.

AB  - Emotion Dysregulation (ED) and Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU) are two rising global issues requiring further understanding on how they are linked. This paper aims to summarize the evidence pertaining to this relationship. Five databases were systematically searched for published literature from inception until 29 March 2021 using appropriate search strategies. Each study was screened for eligibility based on the set criteria, assessed for its quality and its level of evidence was determined. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software program (CMA) was employed to run further analyses of the data. Twenty-one studies were included in the systematic review. Nine studies with extractable data for meta-analysis had high across-studies heterogeneity, hence subgroup analyses were performed that confirmed a significant moderate positive correlation between ED and PSU (pooled correlation coefficient, r = 0.416 (four studies, n = 1462) and r = 0.42 (three studies, n = 899), respectively) and a weak positive correlation between "expressive suppression" and PSU (pooled correlation coefficient, r = 0.14 (two studies, n = 608)). Meta-regression analysis showed a stronger correlation between ED and PSU (R-2 = 1.0, p = 0.0006) in the younger age group. Further studies to establish and explore the mechanisms that contribute towards the positive link between ED and PSU are required to guide in the planning of targeted interventions in addressing both issues.

AB  - First responders, such as paramedics and firefighters, encounter duty-related traumatic exposures, which can lead to post-traumatic stress (PTS). Although social support protects against PTS, we know little about how first responders' families, spouses/partners, friends, and care-partners (i.e., 'trusted others') provide social support. This narrative review explores support behaviors, coping strategies, and resources trusted others use to support first responders. A structured literature search yielded 24 articles. We used House's (1981) conceptual framework to inform our analysis. We identified three main themes: providing support, finding support, and support needs. Additionally, we describe trusted others' self-reported preparedness, coping strategies, and barriers to providing social support. We found that trusted others provided different types of support: (a) emotional (fostering a safe space, giving autonomy over recovery, facilitating coping mechanisms, prioritizing first responders' emotional needs); (b) instrumental (prioritizing first responders' practical needs, handling household tasks, supporting recovery); (c) appraisal (active monitoring, verbal reassurance, positive reframing), and (d) informational (seeking informal learning). In their role, trusted others sought formal (organizational) and informal (peer and personal) support and resources, alongside intrapersonal and interpersonal coping strategies. Identified barriers include inadequate communication skills, maladaptive coping, and disempowering beliefs. Thus, we offer practical, treatment, and social support recommendations.

AB  - Background: Chronic pain is often accompanied by emotional dysfunction. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used for reducing pain, depressive and anxiety symptoms in chronic pain patients, but its therapeutic effect remains unknown. Objectives: To ascertain the treatment effect of tDCS on pain, depression, and anxiety symptoms of patients suffering from chronic pain, and potential factors that modulate the effectiveness of tDCS. Methods: Literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from inception to July 2022. Randomized controlled trials that reported the effects of tDCS on pain and depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with chronic pain were included.Results: Twenty-two studies were included in this review. Overall pooled results indicated that the use of tDCS can effectively alleviate short-term pain intensity [standard mean difference (SMD): -0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.75 to -0.12, P = 0.007] and depressive symptoms (SMD: -0.31, 95% CI, - 0.47 to -0.14, P < 0.001), middle-term depressive symptoms (SMD: -0.35, 95% CI: -0.58 to -0.11, P = 0.004), long-term depressive symptoms (ES: -0.38, 95% CI: -0.64 to -0.13, P = 0.003) and anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.26, 95% CI: -0.51 to -0.02, P = 0.03) compared with the control group.Conclusion: tDCS may be an effective short-term treatment for the improvement of pain intensity and concomitant depression and anxiety symptoms in chronic pain patients. Stimulation site, stimulation frequency, and type of chronic pain were significant influence factors for the therapeutic effect of tDCS.

AB  - Objective: In patients with intestinal pathologies, the placement of a stoma bag affects multiple aspects of their perceived quality of life. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the prevalence of depression among patients with enterostomy and to determine the underlying factors that could explain the potential heterogeneity of this prevalence.
   Methods: Relevant published studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science until May 2022. The random-effects model was used to determine the pooled prevalence of depression among patients with enterostomy using cross-sectional studies from various countries. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were performed to identify factors contributing to heterogeneity. Quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for nonrandomized studies.
   Results: The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms among patients with enterostomy, as calculated using the random-effects model, was 41.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.4-59.7%, Q-value = 145.794, df = 8, p < 0.001, tau(boolean AND)2 = 1.124, I(boolean AND)2 = 94.513). The meta-regression found that mean age and gender were not significant moderators for the observed heterogeneity in prevalence. Subgroup analysis according to the indications for enterostomy formation showed that the prevalence of depression was highest in patients with colorectal cancer, at 34.4% (95% CI: 27.2-42.4%). Subgroup analysis by region showed that patients in Africa had the highest prevalence of depression, at 88.2% (95% CI: 76.1-94.6%), compared to other regions. Subgroup analysis by stoma indication was not significant.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis reports that the pooled prevalence of depression among patients with enterostomy is 41.6%. Indications for enterostomy formation, as well as geographical region, were identified as potential sources of heterogeneity. These findings highlight the need for appropriate psychosocial support and interventions at different stages of enterostomy placement.

AB  - Background School connectedness reflects the quality of students' engagement with peers, teachers, and learning in the school environment. It has attracted attention from both the health and education sectors as a potentially modifiable protective factor for common mental health problems. However, the extent to which school connectedness may prevent the onset of youth depression or anxiety or promote their remission is unclear. This systematic review examined evidence for prospective relationships between school connectedness and depression and anxiety, and the effect of interventions to improve school connectedness on depression and anxiety. Methods We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and ERIC electronic databases for peer-reviewed quantitative longitudinal, or intervention studies published from 2011-21 in English examining relationships between school connectedness and anxiety and/or depression. Participants were 14-24 years old when depression and anxiety outcomes were assessed in any education setting in any country. We partnered with five youth advisers (aged 16-21 years) with lived experience of mental health problems and/or the schooling system in Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines to ensure that youth perspectives informed the review. Results Our search identified 3552 unique records from which 34 longitudinal and 2 intervention studies were ultimately included. Studies were primarily from the United States of America (69.4%). Depression and anxiety outcomes were first measured at 14 years old, on average. Most studies found a significant protective relationship between higher levels of school connectedness and depressive and/or anxiety symptoms; more measured depression than anxiety. A few studies found a non-significant relationship. Both intervention studies designed to increase school connectedness improved depression, one through improvements in self-esteem and one through improvements in relationships at school. Conclusions These findings suggest that school connectedness may be a novel target for the prevention of depression and anxiety. We were not able to determine whether improving school connectedness promotes remission in young people already experiencing depression and anxiety. More studies examining anxiety, diagnostic outcomes, and beyond North America are warranted, as well as intervention trials.

AB  - Inhibition of Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a popular explanation for the effects of lithium ions on mood regulation in bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses, including major depression, cyclothymia, and schizophrenia. Contribution of GSK3 is supported by evidence obtained from animal and patient derived model systems. However, the two GSK3 enzymes, GSK3 alpha and GSK3 beta, have more than 100 validated substrates. They are thus central hubs for major biological functions, such as dopamine-glutamate neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity (Hebbian and homeostatic), inflammation, circadian regulation, protein synthesis, metabolism, inflammation, and mitochondrial functions. The intricate contributions of GSK3 to several biological processes make it difficult to identify specific mechanisms of mood stabilization for therapeutic development. Identification of GSK3 substrates involved in lithium therapeutic action is thus critical. We provide an overview of GSK3 biological functions and substrates for which there is evidence for a contribution to lithium effects. A particular focus is given to four of these: the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), the RNA-binding protein FXR1, kinesin subunits, and the cytoskeletal regulator CRMP2. An overview of how co-regulation of these substrates may result in shared outcomes is also presented. Better understanding of how inhibition of GSK3 contributes to the therapeutic effects of lithium should allow for identification of more specific targets for future drug development. It may also provide a framework for the understanding of how lithium effects overlap with those of other drugs such as ketamine and antipsychotics, which also inhibit brain GSK3.

AB  - BackgroundLevonorgestrel (LNG)-intrauterine devices (IUDs) are an effective method of contraception; however, there is growing evidence regarding potential psychiatric side effects such as depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to summarise the psychiatric effects of using LNG-IUDs.MethodsWe searched six databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and PsycInfo), and we included all study designs. The included studies were extracted, quality assessed, and qualitatively summarised.ResultsOut of the screened studies, only 22 were finally included. While ten studies showed increased depressive symptoms, two studies showed reduced symptoms. Moreover, one study showed increased anxiety, another one reported an increased risk of suicide, four studies concluded no association with depressive symptoms, and four other studies showed uncertainty about a potential association but mentioned other psychiatric symptoms.ConclusionDespite unreliable data, many studies report psychiatric symptoms associated with LNG-IUDs, predominantly depression. Gynaecologists, general practitioners, and psychiatrists should therefore be aware of these potential risks, especially depressive symptoms and suicidality. Counselling patients about these risks should be mandatory. Further studies should investigate the absolute risk of mental disorders associated with LNG-IUDs and other hormonal contraceptives.KEY MESSAGESMany researchers are reporting adverse psychiatric events associated with levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs).Despite their effectiveness, a proper psychiatric assessment should be done before inserting LNG-IUDs.Proper counselling regarding the depressive symptoms and suicidality should be done by the treating obstetrician.Further studies should investigate the absolute risk of mental disorders associated with LNG-IUDs and other hormonal contraceptives.

AB  - Purpose of Review As maternal mortality climbs in the USA with mental health conditions driving these preventable deaths, the field of reproductive psychiatry must shift towards identification of women and other birthing individuals at risk and facilitating access. This review brings together recent studies regarding risk of perinatal depression and highlights important comorbidities that place individuals at higher vulnerability to poor perinatal outcomes. Recent Findings Recent research suggests that identifying risk for perinatal depression including historical diagnoses of depression, anxiety, trauma, and comorbid substance use and intimate partner violence may move the field to focus on preventive care in peripartum populations. Emerging data shows stark health inequities in racial and ethnic minority populations historically marginalized by the health system and in other vulnerable groups such as LGBTQ+ individuals and those with severe mental illness. Innovative models of care using systems-level approaches can provide opportunities for identification and risk analyses of vulnerable peripartum patients and facilitate access to therapeutic or preventive interventions. Utilizing intergenerational approaches and leveraging multidisciplinary teams that thoughtfully target high-risk women and other birthing individuals could promote significant changes to population-level care in maternal health.

AB  - IntroductionThe family has an important role in the care of the ICU patient. Research shows that the implementation of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium, including interventions with the family, can reduce the incidence of delirium. The aim of this review was to search the available literature about the experiences and attitudes of family/carers of ICU patients diagnosed with delirium during hospitalization. MethodsA scoping review method was used to map terms relevant to the involvement of relatives in the care of critically ill patients with delirium. To identify studies, the following databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The database search was ongoing from 15 July 2022, with a final search on 4 August 2022. ResultsThirteen articles reporting on the experiences and attitudes of family/carers of ICU patients who developed delirium during hospitalization were included in the scoping review. Of the included studies, eight were qualitative studies, three were quantitative studies and two were reviews (systematic review and integrative review). The studies were conducted in North America, Europe, South Africa, and Asia. Our findings show that carers experienced adverse effects associated with delirium in ICU patients such as stress, anxiety, embarrassment, uncertainty, anger, shock. Families/relatives need both emotional and informational support from medical staff. ConclusionRelatives want to be involved in the care of the delirium patient, although this needs improvement in some aspects of care such as: lack of awareness, family/relatives knowledge of delirium, improved education, and communication with medical staff. Recognition of delirium by families is acceptable and feasible. Family involvement may induce an increased anxiety, but this aspect needs further research.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to systematically review the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in terms of improving the quality of life (QOL) and negative emotion of informal cancer caregivers. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, MEDLINE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc) were searched from the database establishment to October 2021. Literature screening, data extraction, and quality evaluation were conducted based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Stata 14.0 software was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2,348 cancer informal caregivers (CGs) were included in this study, with an overall loss rate of 13.3%. Meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference in the impact of CBT on QOL (SMD = 0.28, 95%CI: -0.09-0.65, P < 0.001). However, the improvement of depression in CBT intervention group was significantly better than that in control group (SMD = -0.32, 95%CI: -0.56 to -0.07, P = 0.010). The HADS subgroup showed differences in depression scores (SMD = -0.80, 95%CI: -1.30 to -0.29, P = 0.002). The overall effect of CBT on anxiety was statistically different, the improvement of anxiety in CBT intervention group was significantly better than that in control group (SMD = -0.36, 95%CI: -0.720-0.004, P = 0.047). Conclusions: CBT had a positive effect on reducing depression and anxiety in informal cancer caregivers, and the effect on quality of life was not statistically significant, but showed a positive trend.

AB  - It has been well documented that periphyton communities play a key role in primary productivity, nutrient cycling, and food web interactions. However, a worldwide overview of research on the key themes, current situation, and major trends within the field is lacking. In this study, we applied the machine learning technique (latent Dirichlet allocation, LDA) to analyze the abstracts of 6690 publications related to periphyton from 1991 to 2020 based on the Web of Science database. The relative frequency of classical and basic research on periphyton related to colonization, biomass, growth rate, and habitats has been clearly decreasing. The increasing trends of research on periphyton are embodied in the periphyton function in freshwater ecosystems (e.g., application as ecological indicators, function in the removal of nutrients, and application in paleolimnology), the research at macroscales (e.g., spatial-temporal variation, and functional and taxonomic diversity), and the anthropogenic themes (e.g., climate warming, response to multiple stressors, and land use type). The keyword and title analysis showed that the periphyton studies are concentrated mainly on diatom aspects, especially with respect to streams relative to lakes. The thematic space based on non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) showed that the classical themes such as growth rate, colonization, and environmental factors (e.g., multiple stressors and climate warming) were most linked to other research themes. We proposed that future trends in the periphyton should focus on the function of periphyton in lakes and their response to multiple environmental pressures with the increasingly extensive eutrophication in lakes and the increasingly significant change in the climate.

AB  - Organizations are composed of individuals working together for achieving specific goals, and interpersonal dynamics do exert a strong influence on workplace behaviour. Nevertheless, the dual and multiple perspective of interactions has been scarcely considered by Organizational Neuroscience (ON), the emerging field of study that aims at incorporating findings from cognitive and brain sciences into the investigation of organizational behaviour. This perspective article aims to highlight the potential benefits of adopting experimental settings involving two or more participants (the so-called "second person" approach) for studying the neural bases of organizational behaviour. Specifically, we stress the idea that moving beyond the individual perspective and capturing the dynamical relationships occurring within dyads or groups (e.g., leaders and followers, salespersons and clients, teams) might bring novel insights into the rising field of ON. In addition, designing research paradigms that reliably recreate real work and life situations might increase the generalizability and ecological validity of its results. We start with a brief overview of the current state of ON research and we continue by describing the second-person approach to social neuroscience. In the last paragraph, we try and outline how this approach could be extended to ON. To this end, we focus on leadership, group processes and emotional contagion as potential targets of interpersonal ON research.

Importantly, both disorders are associated with a broad range of cognitive deficits as well as al-tered glutamatergic and GABAergic neurometabolism. We conducted a systematic review of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies investigating the relationship between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurometabolites and cognition in schizophrenia spectrum disorders and mood disorders. A literature search in Pubmed of studies published before April 15, 2019 was conducted and 37 studies were deemed eligible for sys-tematic review. We found that alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission have been identi-fied relatively consistently in both schizophrenia and mood disorders. However, because of the vast heterogeneity of published studies in terms of illness stage, medication exposure, MRS acquisition parameters and data post-processing strategies, we still do not understand the relationship between those neurotransmitters and cognitive dysfunction in mental illness, which is a critical initial step for rational drug development. Our find-ings emphasize the need for coordinated multi-center studies that characterize cognitive function and its biolog-ical substrates in large and well-defined clinical populations, using harmonized imaging sequences and analytical methods with the goal to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and to inform future clinical trials.

Methods We searched the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases using the search string "(Dry eye syndrome OR Keratoconjunctivitis sicca OR KCS OR Aqueous tear deficiency OR Sjogren syndrome) AND (depression OR depressive symptoms) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review) " from inception to 20 July 2022. We considered all meta-analyses investigating the association between dry eye disease and depression. Results After summarizing the included meta-analyses, it was concluded that dry eye disease is associated with depression. The symptoms of dry eye disease affect the daily lives of patients, thus affecting their mood. However, further evidence is required to confirm this association. Conclusion This finding highlights the importance of psychological support for patients with dry eye disease. Future clinical studies should investigate the mechanism underlying the association between dry eye disease and depression.

AB  - Since the pandemic of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in addition to the harm caused by the disease itself, the psychological damage caused to the public by the pandemic is also a serious problem. The aim of our study was to summarize the systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) of the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia in different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic and to qualitatively evaluate these SRs/MAs. We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web of Science to obtain SRs/MAs related to anxiety, depression, and insomnia in different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main populations we studied were healthcare workers (HCWs), college students (CSs), COVID-19 patients (CPs), and the general populations (GPs). A subgroup analysis was performed of the prevalence of psychological disorders. A total of 42 SRs/MAs (8,200,330 participants) were included in calculating and assessing the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in these populations. The results of subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of anxiety in different populations were: HCWs (20-44%), CSs (24-41%), CPs (15-47%), and GPs (22-38%). The prevalence of depression were: HCWs (22-38%), CSs (22-52%), CPs (38-45%), and GPs (16-35%), statistically significant differences between subgroups (p < 0.05). The prevalence of insomnia were: HCWs (28-45%), CSs (27-33%), CPs (34-48%), and GPs (28-35%), statistically significant differences between subgroups (p < 0.05). The comparison revealed a higher prevalence of psychological disorders in the CP group, with insomnia being the most pronounced. The methodological quality of the included SRs/MAs was then evaluated using AMSTAR 2 tool. The results of the methodological quality evaluation showed that 13 SRs/MAs were rated "medium, " 13 were rated "low, " and 16 were rated "very low. " Through the subgroup analysis and evaluation of methodological quality, we found a higher prevalence of insomnia than anxiety and depression among the psychological disorders occurring in different populations during the pandemic, but the sample size on insomnia is small and more high-quality studies are needed to complement our findings.

AB  - Aim Stress measurement in adolescent males is in its relative infancy, which is likely to influence the effectiveness of mental health services for this heterogeneous population. Although evidence suggests the prevalence of mental health difficulties increases during adolescence, the relationship between gender and stress measurement is less explored or understood. This review summarizes findings on gender operationalisation and stress measurement in research with adolescent males. Methods For this scoping review, six electronic databases across social and life sciences were searched using terms linked to adolescence, male, stress and research design. Articles were screened, data were extracted, and a narrative synthesis used to characterise studies by research design, adaptation of method for participants' cultural context, operationalisation of gender, and measurement of stress. Results Searches identified 3259 citations, 95 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Findings suggest that research on psychological stress in adolescence is a developing field, but one that is currently dominated by Western studies. Furthermore, the results indicate that stress measurement research with adolescent males tends not to make adaptations relative to participants' gender, age, or context. Conclusions Stress research with adolescent males is lacking in scope. This review highlights the need for researchers to consider stress responses as more than a biological response, as it has been conceptualised historically. Recommendations for researchers to report research design and protocol more clearly are made to support readers to understand how stress and gender have been operationalised and measured and how this may influence research methodology. Future research should avoid conflating biological differences with gendered experience and demonstrate greater sensitivity to how gender identity may intersect with age and location to perpetuate gendered inequalities.

AB  - Nowadays, in a society where the rate of mental health issues and imbalances is increasing, dance is acknowledged as a tool for emotional management. This study aimed to carry out a systematic review of the scientific articles published on dance and emotions, to analyse their themes and evolution. This review was carried out by the statistical analysis of textual data and their means, using the MANOVA Biplot to generate a lexical matrix, resulting in 216 articles. This was used to study the evolution between time periods and the topics addressed. In conclusion, it can be stated that there is a lack of scientific research on dance and emotions in Secondary Education, as it depends on the educational curriculum of each country, their laws and teaching protocols. Greater the frequency of performance, greater the improvements in physical fitness, cognitive, social, physical and affective functioning. In addition, dance therapy has positive results on emotional effects in illnesses such as Parkinson's disease. This is why dance is a fundamental means of helping students work on emotional awareness and management, although it has limited involvement in the educational field.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases 5 (Cdk5) is a special member of proline-directed serine threonine kinase family. Unlike other Cdks, Cdk5 is not directly involved in cell cycle regulation but plays important roles in nervous system functions. Under physiological conditions, the activity of Cdk5 is tightly controlled by p35 or p39, which are specific activators of Cdk5 and highly expressed in post-mitotic neurons. However, they will be cleaved into the corresponding truncated forms namely p25 and p29 under pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases and neurotoxic insults. The binding to truncated co-activators results in aberrant Cdk5 activity and contributes to the initiation and progression of multiple neurological disorders through affecting the down-stream targets. Although Cdk5 kinase activity is mainly regulated through combining with co-activators, it is not the only way. Post-translational modifications of Cdk5 including phosphorylation, S-nitrosylation, sumoylation, and acetylation can also affect its kinase activity and then participate in physiological and pathological processes of nervous system. In this review, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms of Cdk5 and its roles in a series of common neurological disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, anxiety/depression, pathological pain and epilepsy.

AB  - Background: Major depression is one of the leading causes of disability and limited capacity to work. Neuropsychological impairment is a common symptom in acute and remitted major depression and is associated with poor psychosocial functioning. This scoping review aimed to identify research on the role of neuropsychological functioning in outcomes of vocational rehabilitation programs in individuals with depression.Methods: We report on the conduct of this pre-registered () scoping review in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. PubMed and PsychInfo were systematically searched for English or German research articles published between 1990 and September 2021 that studied objective neuropsychological tests as predictors of vocational rehabilitation interventions and included participants with depression.Results: The systematic literature search yielded no studies that specifically targeted subjects with major depression. However, eight articles published since 2016 were included in the review, analyzing data from five trials that evaluated the effectiveness of supported employment in North America and Europe in severe mental illnesses. An estimated 31% of the total number of participants included (n = 3,533) had major depression. Using a variety of cognitive tests and covariates, seven articles found that neuropsychological functioning - especially global cognition scores, verbal and visual learning and memory - significantly predicted vocational outcomes of rehabilitation programs.Conclusion: Despite a lack of studies specifically targeting major depressive disorder, the identified literature suggests that higher baseline neuropsychological functioning predicts better vocational outcomes of supported employment programs in individuals with depression. In clinical practice, additional neuropsychological modules during return-to-work interventions might be helpful for vocational outcomes of such programs.

AB  - Objective: A quantitative synthesis of online psychotherapies' effectiveness in managing COVID-19 related distress is lacking. This study aimed to estimate online psychological interventions' effectiveness and associated factors on COVID-19 related psychological distress. Methods: Multi-databases including PubMed, EBSCO, ProQuest, and Cochrane were searched repeatedly till the end of June 2022. Hand-picking was also utilized for relevant papers. Depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of sleep were evaluated as outcomes. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane tool. Data analyses were conducted through Review Manager (version 5.4.1). Results: A total of 13 studies involving 1,897 participants were included for meta-analysis. Results showed that online psychotherapy significantly reduced the levels of depression [standard mean difference, SMD = -0.45, 95% CI (-0.69, -0.20)], anxiety [SMD = -0.67, 95% CI (-0.99, -0.36)], and stress [SMD = -0.73, 95% CI (-1.11, -0.34)], but not quality of sleep [SMD = -0.53, 95% CI (-1.23, 0.17)]. In addition, guided therapies were more effective than self-help ones on reducing levels of anxiety (chi(2) = 5.58, p = 0.02, and I-2 = 82.1%), and <= 2 weeks' daily interventions were more effective on treating depression than 2-month weekly interventions (chi(2) = 7.97, p = 0.005, I-2 = 87.5%). Conclusion: Online psychological interventions effectively reduced COVID-19 related depression, anxiety, and stress levels, and the effectiveness was influenced by settings like guidance and duration and frequency.

AB  - Background: The relationship between allergic diseases (AD) and mental disorders (MD) in women has not been fully systematically evaluated. We aimed at validating this correlation. Methods: The relevant cohort and case-control studies from the establishment of the database to February 18, 2022 in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library were searched by computer. The researchers conducted the quality evaluation of the included articles by reviewing and discussing with reference to relevant standards, and conducted the analysis of the correlation between female patients with AD and MD by using Review Manager 5.4. Results: Six observational studies from 2631 studies (n = 1160858 women) were assessed as medium and high-quality studies. The meta-analysis demonstrated that AD was correlated with MD in female patients (OR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.14-1.29), including asthma (OR = 1.16, 95%CI: 1.11-1.22), allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.06-1.63), and atopic dermatitis in women (OR = 1.37, 95%CI: 1.24-1.50) were associated with MD. At the same time, subgroup analysis was performed according to region, study design, criteria of AD and MD, and the results demonstrated that both AD and MD were correlated in these different conditions. Conclusion: Allergic diseases in female patients do have an association with mental disorders.

AB  - Objective The continuity of Australian First Nations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) culture has been threatened by colonisation and effects of this continue to have devastating impacts on their social emotional wellbeing [SEWB], especially mental health. This review analyses cultural interventions aiming to improve mental health outcomes for First Nations Australians (e.g., mood, self-esteem, suicide-attempts, self-harm, risky behaviours) to uncover the effectiveness and key components of such interventions. Method Databases PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, EMCARE, LIt.search tool from Lowitja Inst, Australian Indigenous Health InfoNet and Google Scholar were searched. Studies published between 2000 and 2021 which reported the impact of cultural interventions on the mental health of First Nations Australians were included. Results From 172 studies, only eight studies met inclusion criteria and all improved measured domains of SEWB. Six studies evaluated culturally adapted interventions (i.e., Western interventions adapted to be culturally appropriate) and two evaluated culturally grounded interventions (i.e., interventions developed by First Nations Australians). Participants called for more cultural components in culturally adapted interventions. The most successful studies used collaborative and participatory approaches in the designs, included First Nations members in their research teams and presented culturally grounded interventions. Conclusions The paucity of literature limit findings. There was a limited ability to identify key mechanisms of change across some intervention studies, and large outcome variations across studies meant some aspects could not be compared. Nonetheless, this review concludes that culturally grounded interventions are the most promising and successful mental health interventions currently available for First Nations Australians which has many implications for practice and funding.

AB  - Insulin-sensitizing medications were originally used in psychiatric practice to treat weight gain and other metabolic side effects that accompany the use of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and some antidepressants. However, in recent studies these medications have been shown to cause improvement in depressive symptoms, creating a potential new indication outside of metabolic regulation. However, it is still unclear whether the antidepressant properties of these medications are associated with improvements in metabolic markers. We performed a systematic search of the literature following PRISMA guidelines of studies investigating antidepressant effects of insulin-sensitizing medications. We specifically focused on whether any improvements in depressive symptoms were connected to the improvement of metabolic dysfunction. Majority of the studies included in this review reported significant improvement in depressive symptoms following treatment with insulin-sensitizing medications. Nine out of the fifteen included studies assessed for a correlation between improvement in symptoms and changes in metabolic markers and only two of the nine studies found such association, with effect sizes ranging from R-2 = 0.26-0.38. The metabolic variables, which correlated with improvements in depressive symptoms included oral glucose tolerance test, fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin following treatment with pioglitazone or metformin. The use of insulin-sensitizing medications has a clear positive impact on depressive symptoms. However, it seems that the symptom improvement may be unrelated to improvement in metabolic markers or weight. It is unclear which additional mechanisms play a role in the observed clinical improvement. Some alternative options include inflammatory, neuroinflammatory changes, improvements in cognitive functioning or brain structure. Future studies of insulin-sensitizing medications should measure metabolic markers and study the links between changes in metabolic markers and changes in depression. Additionally, it is important to use novel outcomes in these studies, such as changes in cognitive functioning and to investigate not only acute, but also prophylactic treatment effects.

AB  - BackgroundThe prevalent, neuropsychiatric, deficit perspective on children and youth diagnosed with ADHD prohibits a multidimensional approach where socio-economic status, family stress and relationships within the families are relevant factors to examine. Assessments of ADHD through the use of rating scales and short-term interventions may lead not only to overdiagnosis but also to a reductionistic approach in the psychiatric field. This literature review aims to address research outside the prevailing discourse on ADHD as an organic brain dysfunction and broaden the perspectives on children's behavioral difficulties. MethodsThe articles included in this applied, mixed-method, systematic review includes 26 peer-reviewed articles, both English and French, with a search focus on ADHD in children and youth related to Attachment styles and relationships. ResultsIn the studies reported, researchers approached correlations between ADHD and attachment in different ways, and in most cases, there was a caution to address causality. The role of parents was found to be both buffering and aggravating for the appearance of ADHD. In the French case studies, the diagnosis was conceptualized as a relational phenomenon where the child's behavior was inseparable from family member's suffering. DiscussionThis review article illustrates how children's difficulties in terms of ADHD symptoms can be addressed through a paradigm where emotional and cognitive dysregulation is understood through psychosocial factors rather than as a neurological condition. In our view, to avoid an overly reductionistic and medicalized approach to children's behavioral difficulties, it is time to reiterate the value of the biopsychosocial perspective. ConclusionProfessionals and researchers need to acknowledge that becoming diagnosed with ADHD has a strong connection to economic disadvantage, social status, and familial care. The academic discourse of addressing brain dysfunctions might serve the unintended purpose of masking emotional stress and social disadvantage that manifests across generations. A biopsychosocial approach to ADHD including family, emotional history, and socio-economic issues could imply a lesser focus on medical treatment as a first choice.

AB  - Two-thirds of individuals experience adversity during childhood such as neglect, abuse or highly-stressful events. Early-life adversity (ELA) increases the life-long risk of developing mood and substance use disorders. Rewardrelated deficits has emerged as a key endophenotype of such psychiatric disorders. Animal models are invaluable for studying how ELA leads to reward deficits. However, the existing literature is heterogenous with difficult to reconcile findings. To create an overview, we conducted a systematic review containing multiple meta-analyses regarding the effects of ELA on reward processes overall and on specific aspects of reward processing in animal models. A comprehensive search identified 120 studies. Most studies omitted key details resulting in unclear risk of bias. Overall meta-analysis showed that ELA significantly reduced reward behaviors (SMD: -0.42 [-0.60; -0.24]). The magnitude of ELA effects significantly increased with longer exposure. When reward domains were analyzed separately, ELA only significantly dampened reward responsiveness (SMD: -0.525[-0.786; -0.264]) and social reward processing (SMD: -0.374 [-0.663; -0.084]), suggesting that ELA might lead to deficits in specific reward domains.

AB  - Introduction. Depression and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are important public health problems. This systematic review evaluated whether the atypical subtype of depression is associated with MetS, when compared to other depressive subtypes. Methods. Two independent reviewers searched in Medline, Lilacs, PsycInfo, Scopus and Web of Science databases, up to May 2021, without language restriction, including cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies, assessing adults. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The PRISMA guidelines were adopted and this review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018109762). Results. The databases search identified 96 articles and 6 was included in this review. The methodological quality scores ranged from 7 to 10 points. The association between atypical depression and MetS was demonstrated in all publications, as well as the lack of association with melancholic and other subtypes. The prevalence of MetS was significantly higher among individuals with atypical depression. It is worth noting that only few studies assessing this comorbidity were conducted so far. Conclusions. MetS is associated with atypical depression, but not with melancholic or other subtypes. The identification of distinct depressive clinical features seems crucial to better understand its comorbidity with MetS and elucidate its pathophysiological pathways, both necessary to better guide prevention and treatment strategies.

AB  - Considered at a high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults in China not only face the disadvantages caused by their relatively low immune systems, but also the challenges brought about by the complex psychological environment in which they spend this special period of their life. However, a thorough study on the impact of the pandemic on older adults' mental health in China remains scant. Hence, this research aimed to investigate the question: What are the mental health outcomes and associated risk factors of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults in China? Two Chinese academic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG DATA) as well as six English academic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Social Science, and Google Scholar) were searched while following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were selected according to the predetermined inclusion criteria. Further, relatively high detective rates of mental health disorders, including anxiety symptoms (4.9% to 48.6%), depression symptoms (13.8% to 58.7%), hypochondria (11.9%), suicidal ideation (4.1%), along with worries and fear (55.7%) were all reported. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a threat to not only the physical, but also the psychological health of Chinese older adults. The most common risk factors of psychological distress among Chinese older adults were found in female gender, living in rural areas, coexisting chronic diseases, and insufficient knowledge about the COVID pandemic. As a result, government policy and psychological guidelines that are created in order to alleviate the adverse effects of COVID-19 on older adults' mental health, need to be further developed.

AB  - Simple Summary Scientists use animal models to study the mechanisms of human diseases and find new drugs to treat them. Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress is the best animal model of depression. However, this animal model is very sensitive to even the slightest changes in design. Researchers often have difficulty reproducing the main behavioral and physiological effects of Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress. Animal behavior is influenced by a wide variety of factors. The better we standardize the Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress procedure and the more factors we can control; the more reproducible results will be obtained by scientists from different laboratories who are engaged in the study of depression. In this review, we have attempted to identify possible sources of poor reproducibility of this model and have made a number of recommendations that can improve the model by making it more reliable. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mood disorders worldwide. A lack of understanding of the exact neurobiological mechanisms of depression complicates the search for new effective drugs. Animal models are an important tool in the search for new approaches to the treatment of this disorder. All animal models of depression have certain advantages and disadvantages. We often hear that the main drawback of the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression is its poor reproducibility, but rarely does anyone try to find the real causes and sources of such poor reproducibility. Analyzing the articles available in the PubMed database, we tried to identify the factors that may be the sources of the poor reproducibility of CUMS. Among such factors, there may be chronic sleep deprivation, painful stressors, social stress, the difference in sex and age of animals, different stress susceptibility of different animal strains, handling quality, habituation to stressful factors, various combinations of physical and psychological stressors in the CUMS protocol, the influence of olfactory and auditory stimuli on animals, as well as the possible influence of various other factors that are rarely taken into account by researchers. We assume that careful inspection of these factors will increase the reproducibility of the CUMS model between laboratories and allow to make the interpretation of the obtained results and their comparison between laboratories to be more adequate.

AB  - Background: Depression has been recognized as one of the most significant factors affecting mental health status. For this reason, several efforts to prevent and reduce depression in all ages have been made in various domains to identify the relevant factors as well as the causes of depression. The objective of this meta-analysis was to examine the effect size between physical fitness and depression in adolescents and adults.Methods: A systematic search for meta-analysis (2009-2020) was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and RISS, with key terms such as depression, depressive illness, and physical fitness or fitness. Overall, 19 out of 448 articles were included in the meta-analysis with strict inclusion criteria.Results: The effect size is a medium between physical fitness and depression in adolescents and adults. Two fitness factors, namely cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength, are more relevant for alleviating depres-sion in adolescents and adults, whereas agility was not related to depression. In particular, the cardiovascular fitness factor has an impact on almost all ages; however, muscular strength has less impact on depression in young adolescents, but has a great impact on older adults' depression.Conclusion: The effect size in this study is a medium between physical fitness and depression in adolescents and adults. Thus, more longitudinal and clinical studies with larger sample sizes are needed to clarify the relationship between physical fitness and depression.

AB  - Published reports indicate the need for psychological interventions and the integration of psychiatric care into crisis management plans in people with mental health issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It seems crucial to identify the root causes of the health-social-economic crisis and identify potential opportunities for widely implemented psychological assistance. This narrative literature review aims to identify the types of interventions deployed as telemedicine-based mental health support and their effectiveness. The PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases were searched. From a total of 48 articles, 46 were analysed after removing duplicates. From these, thirty-seven records were excluded according to the inclusion criteria and nine (eight RCT and one cross-over) were assessed as full texts. The included publications were randomised clinical trials or cross-over studies focused on remote mental support interventions. In all studies, participants represented both sexes and had an average age range of 6-64. Studies included participants from seven countries and the overall number of participants in the included studies was 687. The content of these intervention programmes includes both established psychotherapeutic programmes, as well as new interventions. Remote support was implemented through three approaches: phone/video calls, mobile applications, and internet-based programs. The results of the included studies indicate a higher or equal efficacy of telemedicine interventions compared to traditional forms. The review also revealed a relatively wide range of targeted research groups: from children with social anxiety through to their caregivers; adolescents with neurological disorders; and from college students to adults with psychiatric or orthopaedic disorders. Analysis of the included papers found that telemedicine interventions show promising results as an attempt to improve population mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected students' mental health, and it is important to implement mental health management strategies. The purpose of this study was to present current findings on the implementation of remote mental health interventions in students during the pandemic. The PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases were searched and, from a total of 174 articles, 106 records were excluded according to the inclusion criteria and 23 were assessed as full texts. After the full-text screening, 12 studies were included in the review. The included publications were randomized clinical trials focused on remote mental support interventions among students from 10 countries, representing both genders, and were in the average age range of 17-55 years with an overall number of 892 participants. The included studies covered the effectiveness of strictly psychotherapeutic programs, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), as well as other techniques such as mindfulness, laughter therapy, the brain wave modulation technique (BWM-T), and physical activity-based interventions. This narrative review provides an overview of studies with a wide range of types of remote mental health support interventions. Each of the forms of intervention analyzed in this review resulted in positive changes in students' mental health, which indicates hope for widespread help via various forms of intervention implemented remotely.

AB  - Background: To inform the future development of consultation-liaison psychiatry services, we need accurate information on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the general hospital inpatient setting. Systematic reviews have summarized the literature on specific aspects of this broad topic, but there has been no high-level overview that aggregates their findings and identifies gaps in the relevant literature. Objective: We aimed to produce a compre-hensive overview of the field, summarizing the research literature on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders (i.e., interview-based psychiatric diagnoses) in general hospital inpatients. We did this using a systematic umbrella review (systematic review of systematic reviews), which is the best and most efficient method for summarizing a broad area of research. Methods: We searched Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL, and Scopus from database inception to September 2021 for systematic reviews that provided a pooled prevalence es-timate, or prevalence range, for interview-diagnosed psychiatric disorders in general hospital inpatients. Two reviewers independently assessed articles and extracted data. The review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019125574. Results: We screened 11,728 articles and included 10 systematic reviews in our umbrella review. We were able to extract pooled prevalence estimates from these as follows: major depression 12% to 20%, any anx-iety disorder 8%, generalized anxiety disorder 5%, panic disorder 3%, delirium 15%. We were only able to extract a prevalence range for dementia, which was 3% to 63%. We found no systematic reviews from which we could extract prevalence data for the other psychiatric disorders that we included in our searches, indicating important gaps. From these data, we estimated that approximately one-third of inpatients have a psychiatric disorder. Conclusions: Psychiatric disorders are very common in general hospital inpatients. While the planning of consultation-liaison psychiatry services will benefit from more research on the prevalence of each of the full range of disorders encountered in the inpatient setting, our findings indicate that we already know enough to justify increased and more population-based service provision.

AB  - Background: Cognitive control (CC), including shifting, updating, and inhibiting functions, may play an integral role in various aspects of psychotherapy; however, research on this is limited. This review aims to link the disparate lines of evidence on CC as they relate to psychotherapy processes, techniques, and outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of the literature on neuropsychological domains relating to psychotherapy in adults with anxiety/depression yielded 18 eligible studies. The review also uses a narrative format to explore other potential links between CC and psychotherapy that are underinvestigated, and highlights the need for research and application to evidence-based practice of psychotherapy. Results and conclusions: Findings suggest that CC may predict psychotherapy outcomes and also improve as a function of psychotherapy. Analog sample studies suggest a possible link between CC and techniques for regulation of cognition and emotion, such as reappraisal, mindfulness, and cognitive restructuring. CC may also play an integral role in the regulation of behavior. Study of CC in the context of psychotherapy may potentially explain individual differences in psychotherapy outcomes and mechanisms of action of various psychotherapy techniques and processes. Such an understanding may have possible implications for "best fit" matching clients to therapies and modifying psychological interventions to account for poorer CC abilities. CC may be enhanced through training and further research is warranted on the impact of such training in facilitating better long-term psychotherapy outcomes.

AB  - Background Research indicates that perinatal loss can cause profound psychological consequences in parents. However, a comprehensive summary of existing quantitative literature describing the association between perinatal loss and the development of depression/depressive symptoms or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)/post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in fathers has not been published. Methods A systematic literature search (from inception to December 2021), using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to articles assessing depressive or PTS symptoms, was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Only studies investigating the period of intrauterine death from 20 weeks of gestation, stillbirth, or neonatal death within the first month after birth were included. Results A final sample of 13 articles were eligible for inclusion. Some studies showed an increased risk of depressive and PTS symptoms in fathers after perinatal loss. However, many study results did not show significant differences, symptoms generally decreased over time, and the majority of studies showed higher levels of depressive and PTS symptoms in mothers, compared with fathers. Conclusions Although the majority of the included studies showed elevated levels of depressive and/or PTSD symptoms after perinatal loss in fathers, no clear firm conclusion can be drawn, as the included studies were very heterogeneous. More homogeneous research measuring depressive and PTS symptoms in fathers is needed at the time of the loss, as the current literature available shows several limitations and gaps.

AB  - Objectives Merchant ships represent a peculiar working environment with several challenges and risks. The specific situation on board of ships may affect the mental health of seafarers more remarkably than ashore workers. Content A systematic review of the literature has been carried out to identify the main causes of mood disorders among seafarers and the impact that these disorders have on their health. This review has analyzed the scientific literature published between January 2006 and December 2021 using the search engines PubMed, Web of Science (WoS) and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Social isolation, distance from families, fatigue, stress and long work shifts represent the main causes of mood disorders among seafarers. Outlook Strategies aimed at improving conditions of cohabitation on board, and a greater consideration of these problems are key for improving the mental health of workers at sea.

AB  - Anxiety-related mental health problems constitute a health challenge, especially in the elderly population. At present, there are few psychological treatments to reduce anxiety adapted to this group. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to determine the therapeutic effects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on anxiety in older adults, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. Two blinded reviewers participated in the search, selection and methodological quality assessment processes; reaching satisfactory levels of agreement between reviewers (kappa > 0.70). The search was performed in PubMed, Proquest Central, Scopus and Web of Science; making use of standardized terms for the construction of the algorithm. In the general search 348 studies were found. After applying the eligibility criteria and excluding duplicates, seven articles were extracted for qualitative analysis. The total number of subjects was 633, with an average age of 68.89 years (68.94% women). The analysis of methodological rigor showed moderate indices on average. The publications focused primarily on samples with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, proposing a variety of assessment tests for related dependent variables, especially depressive symptoms and psychological flexibility. Critical analysis of the findings provides evidence for the efficacy of ACT in reducing anxious and depressive symptoms in older adults. This study proposes the use of this procedure as a non-pharmacological alternative for a group usually underrepresented in the scientific literature on this topic.

AB  - Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction (TMD) is an umbrella term that includes musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint. The present systematic review aimed to verify whether there is a specific association between TMD and anxiety. The searches were carried out in electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS, without restrictions on publication date and language. The acronym PECO was used, whose participants (P) were humans exposed to TMD (E), compared to participants without TMD (C) and the presence of anxiety as an outcome (O). After the search retrieval, the duplicates were removed, and the articles were evaluated by title and abstract, following our inclusion and exclusion criteria; then, the papers were read and thoroughly assessed. After selection, the methodological quality was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was used to assess the level of evidence. A total of 710 studies were found, and 33 articles were considered eligible and were included for the qualitative synthesis and the level of evidence assessment. The studies confirmed the association between anxiety and DTM, although there was a low certainty of evidence among the selected studies. Most articles showed a low risk of bias. Although the limitations of this systematic review, it suggested a significant association between anxiety and TMD, as well as highlights possible directions for future research.

AB  - Lifestyle factors are known to be influential determinants of health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately one third of deaths involve unhealthy lifestyle habits. Among lifestyle risk factors for head and neck cancers (HNC), alcohol consumption and smoking have an undeniable role in the multifactorial aetiology of the disease. In recent years, the promotion of healthy lifestyle choices has gained significant attention as contributory to improving health and disease prevention. Interventions to tackle these risk factors are vitally important in disease prevention and progression. However, in order to effectively prevent the disease and reduce the risk factors, it is crucial to identify what upstream reasons lead to the adoption of these lifestyle risk factors in the first place. Stress being a constant aspect of modern-day life is known to contribute to alcohol and smoking practices. In this review paper, relevant literature was searched in PubMed database for stress, lifestyle factors, HNC and cancer to explore the role of stress and its associated biological pathways as an upstream factor in the adoption of lifestyle risk factors that cause HNC. It highlights the importance of stress pathways and the Hypothalamus Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis as a locus of interaction between stress, alcohol, smoking and cancer. Despite their widely accepted harmful effects, alcohol and smoking remain deeply rooted in contemporary life. A greater understanding of the impact of stress on lifestyle choices and an exploration of the mechanisms resulting in stress, alcohol- and smoking- related cancer may highlight opportunities for improved prevention measures through the modification of unhealthy lifestyle choices.

Aims The aim of this review was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and previous pandemics, epidemics and economic crises on mental health. Method Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Sociological Abstracts. We included studies of all populations exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other similar pandemics/epidemics and economic crises, compared with non-exposed time periods or regions. The outcome was mental health. Results The 174 included studies assessed mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (87 studies), 2008 economic crisis (84 studies) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (three studies). Outcomes were divided into affective disorders, suicides, mental healthcare utilisation and other mental health. COVID-19 pandemic studies were of lesser quality than those for the economic crisis or SARS epidemic. Most studies for all exposures showed increases in affective disorders and other mental health problems. For economic crisis exposure, increases in mental healthcare utilisation and suicides were also found, but these findings were mixed for COVID-19 pandemic exposure. This is probably because of quarantine measures affecting help-seeking and shorter follow-ups of studies of COVID-19 pandemic exposure. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of available, accessible and sustainable mental health services. Also, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations should be particular targets of policy interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Introduction: Evidence supporting associations between cannabis use and many health outcomes is growing, however it remains unclear how such associations vary across the lifespan. We therefore aim to answer the following questions: (1) Are the risks of cannabis's adverse effects on mental health and addiction-related outcomes different in adolescents than in adults? (2) What are the relationships between these cannabis's adverse effects and (a) an individual's age at first cannabis use, (b) age at assessment, and (c) duration of cannabis use?Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PsychINFO from inception to 18 October 2021. Two reviewers independently screened studies and descriptively synthesized results.Results: We included 140 studies. Cannabis effects on mental health and addiction-related outcomes were worse in adolescents, early cannabis initiators and cannabis users who consumed for longest periods. Evidence of worse long-term adverse effects in adolescents was substantial for psychosis, cannabis, and nicotine use disorders; mixed for depression, suicidality, other substance use and disorders; and limited for anxiety. Additionally, acute cannabis exposure had the opposite trend with adults more often reporting adverse effects than adolescents.Conclusion: The available evidence suggests that cannabis use should be delayed as late as possible in adulthood and shortened in duration across the lifespan to decrease the risk of negative outcomes, while emphasizing the

AB  - Background The global spread of coronavirus has caused many physical and mental health problems throughout the world. Depression and anxiety are among the issues that people are experiencing abundantly, along with other mental health disorders, during this period. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is one of the approaches that is effective on improving most of the psychological issues including depression and anxiety. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effects of CBT on depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic period. Methods English databases such as Cochrane, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Persian databases such as SID, MagIran and IranDoc were searched with a time limit of 2019 to 2022. Two researchers independently evaluated the quality of the entered studies based on Cochrane handbook. Subgroup analysis was conducted separately on the basis of being infected with coronavirus, not being infected with coronavirus, and having a history of depression or anxiety before the intervention and internet-based CBT for depression and anxiety. Meta-analysis results were reported using standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity of studies was analyzed by means of I-2 index; and in the case of heterogeneity presence, random effects model was used instead of fixed effects model. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used for evaluating the quality of evidence. Results Totally, 2015 articles were analyzed of which 11 articles entered meta-analysis. The overall results of meta-analysis showed that mean score of anxiety in the group receiving CBT was significantly lower than the control group (SMD: - 0.95, 95% CI - 1.29 to - 0.62; P < 0.00001, I-2 = 94%). In addition, mean score of depression in the intervention group was significantly lower than the control group (SMD: - 0.58; 95% CI - 1.00 to - 0.16, P < 0.00001, I-2 = 94%). In addition, the results of subgroup meta-analysis showed that internet-based CBT was effective in reducing of depression (SMD - 0.35; 95% CI - 0.50 to - 0.20; P < 0.00001; I-2 = 0%) and anxiety (SMD - 0.90; 95%CI - 1.47 to - 0.33; P = 0.002; I-2 = 94%). The evidence about the effectiveness of CBT on depression and anxiety compared with control group on the basis of GRADE approach had low quality. Conclusions Meta-analysis results showed that CBT reduced the mean scores of anxiety and depression significantly during COVID-19 pandemic period. Due to the low quality of evidence, conducting more randomized controlled trials with rigorous design is suggested.

AB  - Successful psychotherapy for anxiety disorders is thought to be linked to functional neural changes in prefrontal control areas and fear-related limbic regions. Thus, discovering such therapy-associated neural changes might point to relevant mechanisms of action. Using AES-SDM, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 22 whole-brain datasets (n = 419 anxiety patients) from 18 studies identified by our systematic literature search following PRISMA criteria (preregistration available at OSF: https://osf.io/dgc4p). In these studies, fMRI data was collected in response to negative stimuli during cognitive-emotional tasks before and after psychotherapy. Post-psychotherapy, activation decreased in the right insula, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; no region had increased activation. A subgroup analysis for CBT revealed additional decrease in the supplementary motor area. Reduced activation in limbic and frontal regions might indicate therapy -associated normalization regarding the perception of internal and external threat, subsequent allocation of cognitive resources, and changes in cognitive control. Due to the integration of diverse treatments and experi-mental tasks, these changes presumably reflect global effects of successful psychotherapy.

AB  - Compared to neurotypical peers, autistic adolescents show greater cognitive inflexibility (CI) which manifests at the behavioral and cognitive level and potentially increases vulnerability for the development of internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) symptoms. This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the association between CI and INT/EXT in autistic adolescents. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant studies until April 2022 (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42021277294). Systematic review included 21 studies (n = 1608) of CI and INT, and 15 studies (n = 1115) of CI and EXT. A pooled effect size using Pearson's correlation between CI and INT/EXT was calculated and the moderating effects of age, sex, IQ and study quality were investigated using meta-regressions. Sensitivity analyses were completed to investigate the impact of measure variance for CI and co-occurring ADHD on the overall effects. Greater CI is associated with increased INT (nine studies; n = 833; r = 0.39 (moderate effect), 95% confidence interval [0.32, 0.46]) and EXT (six studies; n = 295; r = 0.48 (large effect), 95% confidence interval [0.38, 0.58]). Results withheld when only using parental reports of CI and excluding autistic adolescents with co-occurring ADHD. Increased CI may be a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor that can increase autistic adolescents' rigid or perseverative patterns of unhelpful cognition and behaviors and reduce their ability to access psychological interventions. Addressing CI may improve autistic children and adolescents' engagement with psychological therapy for co-occurring mental health difficulties. Lay Summary This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the relationship between cognitive inflexibility (CI) and symptoms of anxiety, depression and behavioral difficulties in autistic children and adolescents. CI refers to increased rigidity and perseveration in thinking and behavior and was found to be associated with increased mental health symptoms in autistic adolescents. Addressing and targeting individual differences in CI may improve autistic children and adolescents' engagement with psychological therapy for co-occurring mental health difficulties.

AB  - Amygdaloid circuits are involved in a variety of emotional and motivation-related behaviors and are impacted by stress. The amygdala expresses several neuromodulatory systems, including opioid peptides and their receptors. The Dynorphin (Dyn)/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system has been implicated in the processing of emotional and stress-related information and is expressed in brain areas involved in stress and motivation. Dysregulation of the Dyn/KOR system has also been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. However, there is limited information about the role of the Dyn/KOR system in regulating amygdala circuitry. Here, we review the literature on the (1) basic anatomy of the amygdala, (2) functional regulation of synaptic transmission by the Dyn/KOR system, (3) anatomical architecture and function of the Dyn/KOR system in the amygdala, (4) regulation of amygdala-dependent behaviors by the Dyn/KOR system, and (5) future directions for the field. Future work investigating how the Dyn/KOR system shapes a wide range of amygdala-related behaviors will be required to increase our understanding of underlying circuitry modulation by the Dyn/KOR system. We anticipate that continued focus on the amygdala Dyn/KOR system will also elucidate novel ways to target the Dyn/KOR system to treat neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Translational research in behavioral neuroscience seeks causes and remedies for human mental health problems in animals, following leads imposed by clinical research in psychiatry. This endeavor faces several problems because scientists must read and interpret animal movements to represent human perceptions, mood, and memory processes. Yet, it is still not known how mammalian brains bundle all these processes into a highly compressed motor output in the brain stem and spinal cord, but without that knowledge, translational research remains aimless. Based on some four decades of experience in the field, the article identifies sources of interpretation problems and illustrates typical translational pitfalls. (1) The sensory world of mice is different. Smell, hearing, and tactile whisker sensations dominate in rodents, while visual input is comparatively small. In humans, the relations are reversed. (2) Mouse and human brains are equated inappropriately: the association cortex makes up a large portion of the human neocortex, while it is relatively small in rodents. The predominant associative cortex in rodents is the hippocampus itself, orchestrating chiefly inputs from secondary sensorimotor areas and generating species-typical motor patterns that are not easily reconciled with putative human hippocampal functions. (3) Translational interpretation of studies of memory or emotionality often neglects the ecology of mice, an extremely small species surviving by freezing or flight reactions that do not need much cognitive processing. (4) Further misinterpretations arise from confounding neuronal properties with system properties, and from rigid mechanistic thinking unaware that many experimentally induced changes in the brain do partially reflect unpredictable compensatory plasticity. (5) Based on observing hippocampal lesion effects in mice indoors and outdoors, the article offers a simplistic general model of hippocampal functions in relation to hypothalamic input and output, placing hypothalamus and the supraspinal motor system at the top of a cerebral hierarchy. (6) Many translational problems could be avoided by inclusion of simple species-typical behaviors as end-points comparable to human cognitive or executive processing, and to rely more on artificial intelligence for recognizing patterns not classifiable by traditional psychological concepts.

AB  - Preliminary research indicates that the COVID-19 illness affects the mental well-being of patients. This scoping review, thus, aims to examine the current state of research into mental health treatments for depression symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Select databases were searched on 7/1/2021. Full-text articles involved (1) mental health treatment (2) suicide and/or depression outcomes, (3) a quasi-experimental research trial, and (4) a primary analysis. 11 articles were included in this review. The studies spanned 5 countries, and demonstrated immediate positive effects of mental health treatments and tele-health as a treatment modality for depression in COVID-19 patients. 6 studies were randomized controlled trials. Various treatments were administered, including cognitive behavior therapy, mindfulness, and muscle relaxation. Most interventions were conducted in in-patient units and focused on acute symptoms. There were limitations in the design and description of methodology in many studies, which affects the generalizability and replicability of positive findings. Only two studies included a post-intervention follow-up and one study assessed suicide risk. Thus, this review found there is a pressing need for more research in the area, with greater rigor in study methodology, and for treatments targeting long-term symptoms and suicidality, and outpatient services.

AB  - An umbrella review of systematic reviews with a meta-analysis was developed to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of qigong, tai chi, and yoga in chronic spinal pain outcomes. The CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed and SPORTDiscus databases were searched. Pain, psychological factors, and quality of life (QOL) were the outcomes of interest. The methodological quality of the reviews was evaluated using the AMSTAR-2 tool. The overlap was calculated using the corrected covered area. A total of 72 meta-analyses drawn from 20 systematic reviews were included and often were rated at a critically low quality. The effects of qigong on chronic low back and neck pain (CLBP and CNP, respectively) were inconsistent, although it improved the physical component of QOL after 12 weeks for CNP. Tai chi was superior to the controls in reducing CLBP; no reviews of interest were found on CNP. Yoga was superior to multiple controls in reducing CLBP, but no relevant effects on depression or QOL were found. QOL, anxiety, depression, and general mood improved with yoga for CNP. Inconsistencies arose related to yoga and CNP. Our findings mainly supported the potential effects of yoga and tai chi on pain-related outcomes, psychological factors, and QOL in populations with CLBP and NP. Clinical and methodological considerations were discussed.

AB  - A number of authors consider that exploring the interconnections between social representations and emotions is essential. However, both empirical and theoretical contributions have focused on specific aspects of these concepts and thus offer a narrow view of their articulation. Moreover, these are published in different languages, making it difficult to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the subject. Consequently, this article adopts a broader approach through a literature review articulating social representations and emotions. This is based on a search of various databases, conducted between March and April 2020 and using the terms "social representation" and "emotion" (or affect, mood, or feeling) in their singular and plural forms, both in French and in English. As a result, 41 references explicitly mentioned both terms and were published in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish were collected. This brought to light two lines of inquiry that structure this field of research: the first focuses on the role of emotions in the emergence, dynamics, and functioning of social representations, while the second explores how social representations determine emotions or emotional processes. These perspectives will be discussed from both a theoretical and methodological standpoint with the aim of highlighting new avenues for research.

AB  - Background: Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are at heightened risk of experiencing self-stigma, and some cultures are more stigmatizing towards SSD than others. The first purpose of this review is to provide an estimate of the relationship between self-stigma and clinical and psychosocial outcomes. The second purpose is to examine how these relationships vary across cultures.
   Method: Studies reporting correlations between self-stigma and outcome variable(s) were identified through electronic database searches from June 1, 2021, to January 2, 2022. Mean effect sizes were calculated using Fisher's r-to-Z-transformation.
   Results: Sixty-three articles (N = 8925, 22 countries) were included in the systematic review and fifty-three articles (N = 7756) were included in the meta-analysis. For the most studied clinical correlates, self-stigma had a moderate, positive correlation with depressive symptoms (r = 0.49, p <.001), a moderate, negative correlation with functioning (r = -0.39, p <.001), and a positive, small correlation with severity of psychotic symptoms (r = 0.29, p <.001), negative symptoms (r = 0.18, p <.001) and positive symptoms (r = 0.13, p =.01). For the most studied psychosocial correlates, self-stigma had a strong, negative correlation with quality of life (r = 0.52, p <.001) and self-esteem (r = 0.55, p <.001). The correlates of self-stigma were similar across cultures.
   Discussion: Self-stigma shows strong to small correlations with clinical and psychosocial variables similarly across cultures. More research is needed to examine underlying mechanisms to develop effective interventions.

AB  - Background: Shame and guilt are involved in suicidality and in post-traumatic stress disorder. However, few studies have explored the implication of those emotions in the suicidality of patients exposed to traumatic events. Objective: The objective of this literature review was to examine the implication of shame and guilt in the suicidality of individuals who have experienced potentially traumatic events or been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. These two emotions are part of post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidality. Moreover, when individuals perceive that their coping strategies are inadequate, they may view suicide as a relief from suffering. Method: This review was conducted according to PRISMA method. We used combinations of search words for traumatization, suicide ideation and behavior and shame and guilt to search for empirical studies in common databases in psychology and medicine. Results: Among 137 identified articles, 9 full texts were retained. Results suggest that shame and guilt were involved in all aspects of suicidality in patients who had experienced traumatic events or been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The degree of shame and guilt differed with the type of traumatic event, notably affecting individuals who had experienced military combat, physical or sexual abuse, or emotional or physical neglect. Conclusion: Shame and guilt are implicated in suicide's risk. Future research is now needed to determine whether greater attention to these two emotions would enhance our understanding and anticipation of suicidal behavior in those who have experienced a potentially traumatic event or been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Objectives. Parenting is the general child-rearing practice that has both long- and short-term impacts on the physical, emotional, mental, and social development of the children. We aims at seeing the relationship between parenting style and suicidal behaviors. Methods. A search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO to identify the articles assessing the relationship between different types of parenting styles and suicidal behavior. We included 32 articles in the review published from inception to search date. Results. Among the 32 studies, 27 studies used a cross-sectional study design, 17 were published between 2011 and 2020, and most of the studies included respondents with ages between 9 and 21 years. A wide variety of the used instruments to assess suicidal behavior, and parenting style was noted. Eight studies revealed that authoritarian parenting style is one of the predictors of suicidal behavior, while one study reported the authoritarian parenting style as a resilient factor. Both dominating and flexible parenting styles were associated with higher suicidal behavior, and two studies reported that the permissive style is a contributing factor to suicidal ideation among participants. Conclusion. This review identified the supportive notion that authoritarian parenting style has an association with suicidal behavior in adolescence, and later life. However, a prudential judgment is warranted due to the heterogeneity of study methods, population, contexts, and measurement tools.

AB  - Continued urban development is inevitable with ongoing human population growth. Urbanization has profound negative impacts on aquatic environments and the organisms that occupy those environments. Urbanization results in habitat stressors including sedimentation, alterations to flow, increases in water temperature, changes in riparian habitat, and changes in the food supply of freshwater systems. In the face of continuing urbanization there is an urgent need to employ effective and practical tools to evaluate the impacts on freshwater fish populations and to better understand the implications of urban development for lotic aquatic ecosystems. Stable isotope analyses (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18 delta S-34 and delta H-2) are useful and cost-effective tools that can help highlight and evaluate urbanization impacts on fish populations. Here we review recent developments in stable isotope-based methods for studying urbanization impacts on freshwater fish populations. We identified and review published studies that have implemented stable isotopes to evaluate urban impacts, discuss promising stable isotope-based approaches that have not been commonly applied to the assessment of urban impacts, and highlight the advantages and limitations of the various approaches. In particular, we show how stable isotope analyses can help address both the ecological and physiological impacts of urban development on freshwater fishes in hopes of inspiring more frequent use of the approaches in urbanization studies. We elucidate how stable isotopes can be used to understand the impacts of urbanization on the feeding ecology, habitat and thermal occupancy, and field metabolic rates of freshwater fishes. It was found that stable isotope-based approaches are underutilized to examine the impacts of urbanization on freshwater fishes. We suggest such approaches can be applied more frequently in freshwater environments globally to help assess and actively mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on freshwater fishes.

AB  - Many racial-ethnic minoritized individuals are repeatedly exposed to subtle actions reflecting racial slights, termed racial microaggressions (RMAs), which are associated with adjustment problems in early adult and adult populations. Early adolescence represents a unique developmental period when minoritized youth begin their racial-ethnic identity exploration and are subjected to stereotypes and prejudice, thereby making them vulnerable to RMAs. Based upon the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist, a systematic literature search, screening and review of RMA literature focusing on high schoolers and younger youth was conducted and yielded 54 publications. This paper reviewed the publications and identified gaps in the field such as the need for systematic research on early adolescents including the frequency and severity of RMAs and the important contributions of peers, parents and teachers for RMA victims, and the need for more evidence-based programming for middle schoolers. Findings suggest that developing school-based microaggression antiracism programs is clearly needed for minoritized and White youth. Impact Statement Racial microaggressions are harmful to minoritized youth's well-being, including higher rates of suicidal ideation even after accounting for experiences of overt discrimination. The current systematic review suggests a great need for helping school staff provide an inclusive, equitable classroom and for empowering other adults to better support minoritized youth in handling racial microaggressions. The authors propose that school psychologists can fill this critical gap given their important role in providing socio-emotional support to both students and staff.

This study was aimed at systematically reviewing and providing a meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on improving depression and anxiety in patients with musculoskeletal pain. Methods The search was done in three databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to August 2021. For each of the studies included in the meta-analysis, the mean, standard deviation, and sample size were extracted in the post-test, and the effect size was calculated. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed in studies at the end of the analysis. Results Nineteen randomized control trials were included in the meta-analysis. Exercise training has a positive effect on depression in patients with musculoskeletal pain, so exercise reduces depression and Hedges' g was equal to -0.21, with confidence intervals of -0.40, -0.02. Exercise training has a positive effect on anxiety in patients with musculoskeletal pain, so exercise reduces anxiety and Hedges' g was equal to -0.63, with confidence intervals of -1.08, -0.19. Conclusions It was found that exercise training is effective in improving depression and anxiety in patients with musculoskeletal pain and therefore this treatment should be given more attention from clinical specialists.

Methods: Online databases were searched from inception to 30 October 2020 to locate cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies focusing on the FVI and CMDs in youth (i.e., 10-18 years old). The risk of bias of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Results: Among 3,944 records identified, 12 studies (8 cross-sectional, 1 case-control, and 3 prospective cohort studies) were included in the final synthesis. None of the prospective cohort studies identified a statistically significant association between FVI and CMDs in youth, although inconsistent associations were reported in cross-sectional and case-control studies. Conclusion: The lack of associations between FVI and CMDs in youth, along with consistent associations in adults, might be explained by the accumulation of risk theoretical model and methodological challenges.

Design: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies. Review methods: Eleven databases were systematically searched for relevant publications in March 2022. All qualitative and mixed-method studies in English and Chinese that explored the stress and coping experience during NRPs of new graduate nurses were included. The qualitative meta-synthesis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and assessed the quality of each study. Meta-synthesis was performed to integrate the results. Results: A total of 13 studies revealed 13 sub-themes and three descriptive themes: multi-dimensional stressors, somatic and emotional responses, coping resources and coping methods. Conclusion: New nurses faced a lot of physical and emotional stress during NRPs, which had a negative impact on their physical and mental health. NRPs are a critical period for the career growth of new nurses. Effective management strategies must be implemented to improve nurse capacity, meet their needs, improve self-efficacy, and build organizational support, as this can improve the quality of clinical nursing and keep the enthusiasm and stability of the nursing team.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Lifetime psychotic symptoms are present in over half of the patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and can have an adverse effect on its course, outcome, and treatment. However, despite a considerable amount of research, the impact of psychotic symptoms on BD remains unclear, and there are very few systematic reviews on the subject.
   AIM
   To examine the extent of psychotic symptoms in BD and their impact on several aspects of the illness.
   METHODS
   The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines were followed. An electronic literature search of six English-language databases and a manual search was undertaken to identify published articles on psychotic symptoms in BD from January 1940 to December 2021. Combinations of the relevant Medical Subject Headings terms were used to search for these studies. Articles were selected after a screening phase, followed by a review of the full texts of the articles. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies and the risk of bias was conducted using standard tools.
   RESULTS
   This systematic review included 339 studies of patients with BD. Lifetime psychosis was found in more than a half to two-thirds of the patients, while current psychosis was found in a little less than half of them. Delusions were more common than hallucinations in all phases of BD. About a third of the patients reported first-rank symptoms or mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms, particularly during manic episodes. Psychotic symptoms were more frequent in bipolar type 1 compared to bipolar type II disorder and in mania or mixed episodes compared to bipolar depression. Although psychotic symptoms were not more severe in BD, the severity of the illness in psychotic BD was consistently greater. Psychosis was usually associated with poor insight and a higher frequency of agitation, anxiety, and hostility but not with psychiatric comorbidity. Psychosis was consistently linked with increased rates and the duration of hospitalizations, switching among patients with depression, and poorer outcomes with mood-incongruent symptoms. In contrast, psychosis was less likely to be accompanied by a rapid-cycling course, longer illness duration, and heightened suicidal risk. There was no significant impact of psychosis on the other parameters of course and outcome.
   CONCLUSION
   Though psychotic symptoms are very common in BD, they are not always associated with an adverse impact on BD and its course and outcome.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to characterise the prevalence and/or severity of psychological distress (namely, depression and anxiety symptoms) in siblings of people with mental illness (MI) and to examine correlates of distress in siblings of people with MI. Method: Studies comparing distress in individuals with and without a sibling with MI were eligible. Studies reporting on correlates of distress in siblings were also eligible. A search of MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO and Embase was conducted up until 17 March 2022. Results: Fifteen studies comprising 2304 siblings and 2263 comparison individuals were included. Meta-analyses indicated individuals with a sibling with MI experience significantly greater depressive symptoms (Hedges's g = 0.53, 95% CI = [0.32, 0.73], siblings n = 1962, comparison individuals n = 2248) and anxiety symptoms (Hedges's g = 0.40, 95% CI = [0.19, 0.61], siblings n = 653, comparison individuals n = 533) than those without. The sibling relationship, siblings' locus of control, interpersonal functioning and their appraisal of the impacts of MI were identified as important and potentially modifiable correlates. Conclusion: Individuals with a sibling with MI experience greater depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without and would likely benefit from support. Future studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying distress in siblings.

AB  - This scoping review describes the research-based mindfulness intervention on anxiety, distress, and depression. The search strategy retrieved articles published in English from 2014 to 2019 and were retrieved across Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. The PRISMA-Scr checklist is a tool to evaluate the quality of the articles. The selection criteria initially included all original articles in English, with 1,527 that were related to mindfulness intervention for anxiety, distress, and depression. A total of 490 full texts were retrieved, and after the abstracts were reviewed, 124 full-text articles were included for eligibility, and the final eight studies were determined. The articles were reviewed and screened for relevance to mindfulness intervention in reducing anxiety, distress, and depression among those with chronic diseases. The results have shown that mindfulness intervention reduces anxiety, distress, and depression among patients with chronic diseases. The review contributes further insight into the fact that mindfulness intervention is also appropriate for other conditions to facilitate reducing psychological symptoms.

AB  - Objective: No synthesis of the Australian evidence regarding targeted prevention and early intervention for mental health concerns among young children exists. This review aimed to (1) describe the types of targeted community-based mental health programmes evaluated in Australia to support children aged 1-9 years exhibiting internalising and/or externalising symptoms and (2) examine their impact on children's internalising and externalising symptoms and disorder diagnosis. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted (PROSPERO: CRD42021255257). Four databases (PsycINFO, PsycArticles, MEDLINE and CINAHL) were searched for Australian studies published in the past 10 years that quantitatively evaluated the impact of a targeted programme on children's mental health. The National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tools were used to evaluate the study quality. Results: Forty-two studies were included; the majority (67%) were medium quality. The mean sample size was 142 (SD = 170), children's average age was 5.78 years (SD = 2.44) and 58% were male. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were underrepresented. Studies evaluated 16 programmes that targeted (1) externalising symptoms (n = 20 studies, n = 6 programmes), (2) internalising symptoms (n = 14 studies, n = 7 programmes) or (3) both, termed transdiagnostic programmes (n = 8 studies, n = 3 programmes). Externalising programmes achieved a significant moderate mean reduction in externalising behaviours (standardised mean differences = -0.56), internalising programmes yielded a small mean improvement in anxiety symptoms (standardised mean differences = -0.25) and 57% reduced odds of anxiety disorder diagnosis. Evidence supporting transdiagnostic programmes was inconclusive. Conclusion: Parenting-focused programmes targeting young children's internalising or externalising behaviours have the largest local evidence base supporting their effectiveness. Limitations include a lack of engagement with fathers, triangulation of outcomes, homogeneity and implementation reporting. Greater implementation and evaluation of community-driven integrated and systemic approaches that identify, engage and support Australia's most disadvantaged cohorts of young children and their families are needed.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the prevalence of anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Computers were used to search CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data, PubMed, and other Chinese and English databases. The search period was limited to December 2019 to April 2022. Cross-sectional studies collected data on the prevalence of anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers since the onset of COVID-19. The STATA 15.1 software was used for the meta-analysis of the included literature. Results: A total of 30 studies were included, with a sample size of 18,382 people. The meta-analysis results showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the total prevalence of anxiety among frontline healthcare workers was 43.00%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.36-0.50, and the total prevalence of depression was 45.00%, with a 95% CI of 0.37-0.52. The results of the subgroup analysis showed that prevalence of anxiety and depression in women, married individuals, those with children, and nurses was relatively high. Frontline healthcare workers with a bachelor's degree or lower had a higher prevalence of anxiety. The prevalence of depression was higher among frontline healthcare workers with intermediate or higher professional titles. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers was high. In the context of public health emergencies, the mental health status of frontline healthcare workers should be given full attention, screening should be actively carried out, and targeted measures should be taken to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among frontline healthcare workers.

AB  - Background Adolescents are at high risk of incident psychopathology. Fleeting psychotic experiences (PEs) that emerge in young people in response to stress may be warning signs that are missed by research that fails to study stressed populations, such as late high school and college/university students. Our aim in this systematic review was to conduct a meta-analysis that estimates prevalence rates of PEs in students, and to assess whether these rates differ by gender, age, culture, and COVID-19 exposure. Method We searched nine electronic databases, from their inception until January 31, 2022 for relevant studies. We pooled the estimates using the DerSimonian-Laird technique and random-effects meta-analysis. Our main outcome was the prevalence of self-reported PEs in high school and college/university students. We subsequently analyzed our data by age, gender, population, country, culture, evaluation tool, and COVID-19 exposure. Results Out of 486 studies retrieved, a total of 59 independent studies met inclusion criteria reporting 210 ' 024 students from 21 different countries. Nearly one in four students (23.31%; 95% CI 18.41%-29.05%), reported having experienced PEs (heterogeneity [Q = 22,698.23 (62), p = 0.001] tau(2) = 1.4418 [1.0415-2.1391], tau = 1.2007 [1.0205-1.4626], I-2 = 99.7%, H = 19.13 [18.59-19.69]). The 95% prediction intervals were 04.01%-68.85%. Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled prevalence differed significantly by population, culture, and COVID-19 exposure. Conclusion This meta-analysis revealed high prevalence rates of self-reported PEs among teen and young adult students, which may have significance for mental health screening in school settings. An important realization is that PEs may have very different mental health meaning in different cultures.

AB  - Future energy crises and environmental deterioration may only be avoided by converting solar energy into sustainable, safe, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly technologies such as water splitting. Many re-searchers and governments throughout the globe have stressed the imperative need for affordable, environ-mental benign, resistive to corrosion, and earth-abundant nanostructured photocatalysts. This has led scientists to look for a green and cost-effective way to generate energy. As a result, the significance of photo catalyst engineering and reactor design difficulties connected to the performance of the photocatalytic reactions, as well as the examination and analysis of photocatalyst behaviors for adaptable and cost effective H2 production, is emphasized and summarized. The carbon-based materials have an appealing band structure, strong chemical stability, is plentiful on Earth, and is relatively easy to produce, making them suitable for hydrogen production. As example, graphene oxide (GO) with the oxygenated functional groups and graphene and its counterparts, including Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), GO, reduce graphene oxide (rGO), have been demonstrated to be ideal nanocomposite materials due to their superior properties and distribution in matrix and CNTs with excellent electronic transmission efficiency, low cost, stability, and environmental friendly are a great alternative of electron mediators for photocatalytic devices to boost light absorptivity for efficient hydrogen generation but some of them have limited photocatalytic activity due to their low sunlight usage efficiency, therefore the numerous methods, such as doping ions, constructing heterostructure, and functionalizing carbon-based mate-rials, have recently been proven to promote the photocatalytic activity of them. The pore structure of carbon material functions as an acceptor of photogenerated electrons, improved the photocatalyst's specific surface area. Generally low-dimensional carbon materials demonstrated immense promise as highly efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly catalysts for hydrogen generation as an energy source. This article reviews the recent research progress on carbon-based materials for hydrogen evolution for the first time. It commences with a quick overview of the present state of affairs and fundamental concepts of hydrogen production in carbon-based nanomaterials for use in this field. We anticipate that this study will inspire readers to expand the use of carbon-based materials in H2 generation in a more environmentally friendly way.

AB  - Background: Due to the existence of inconsistencies in the evidence regarding the direction and extent of association between diabetes and anxiety disorders, the anxiety-diabetes comorbidity remains an issue of debate. Aim: To estimate the proportion and risk of diabetes among individuals with anxiety disorder and vice versa. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using studies retrieved from databases and grey literature, with the last database search being conducted on April 15, 2021. The methodological rigor of studies was assessed using the National Institute of Health quality assessment tool. Prevalence and effect size (ES) estimates were pooled using a random effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Higgins' I2 statistical test, and subgroup analysis conducted. Results: We included 68 studies presenting data from 2,128,029 participants. The prevalence of anxiety disorders in diabetic patients was 28% (95% CI: 26%, 31%); however, subgroup analysis showed significant differences based on type of anxiety assessment scales, study location, and type of diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes among patients with anxiety disorders was 12% (95% CI: 9%, 16%). Patients with anxiety disorders were found to have a 19% higher risk of diabetes (pooled effect size (ES) = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.26). Diabetic patients were found to have a 41% higher risk of developing anxiety disorders (ES = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.62). Conclusions: There is a higher risk of anxiety disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus and vice versa. It is recommended to screen diabetic patients for anxiety at initial diagnosis and follow-up visits. Similarly, patients with anxiety disorders should have regular screening for diabetes.

AB  - Background Improving the quality of care in community settings for people with 'Complex Emotional Needs' (CEN-our preferred working term for services for people with a "personality disorder" diagnosis or comparable needs) is recognised internationally as a priority. Plans to improve care should be rooted as far as possible in evidence. We aimed to take stock of the current state of such evidence, and identify significant gaps through a scoping review of published investigations of outcomes of community-based psychosocial interventions designed for CEN. Methods We conducted a scoping review with systematic searches. We searched six bibliographic databases, including forward and backward citation searching, and reference searching of relevant systematic reviews. We included studies using quantitative methods to test for effects on any clinical, social, and functioning outcomes from community-based interventions for people with CEN. The final search was conducted in November 2020. Results We included 226 papers in all (210 studies). Little relevant literature was published before 2000. Since then, publications per year and sample sizes have gradually increased, but most studies are relatively small, including many pilot or uncontrolled studies. Most studies focus on symptom and self-harm outcomes of various forms of specialist psychotherapy: most result in outcomes better than from inactive controls and similar to other specialist psychotherapies. We found large evidence gaps. Adaptation and testing of therapies for significant groups (e.g. people with comorbid psychosis, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance misuse; older and younger groups; parents) have for the most part only reached a feasibility testing stage. We found little evidence regarding interventions to improve social aspects of people's lives, peer support, or ways of designing effective services. Conclusions Compared with other longer term mental health problems that significantly impair functioning, the evidence base on how to provide high quality care for people with CEN is very limited. There is good evidence that people with CEN can be helped when specialist therapies are available and when they are able to engage with them. However, a much more methodologically robust and substantial literature addressing a much wider range of research questions is urgently needed to optimise treatment and support across this group.

AB  - The birth of a child alters family dynamics and can be stressful for parents, especially in the case of prematurity. This article carried out a systematic review on interventions in parents to reduce the stress experienced by the birth of a premature infant. The aims were to describe and classify the different interventions and to have an overview of their effectiveness. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guide and the PICO model. For searching the bibliography, we used Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed and PsycINFO databases. From a total of 450 articles identified, this review finally included 46 studies with empirical evidence. The articles clustered into different types of interventions, such as psychoeducational and parental or maternal support programs, relaxation techniques, expressive writing, art therapy, music therapy and interventions related to interaction and tactile stimulation. There is a wide range of effectiveness in reducing parental stress to a greater or lesser degree. There is a great heterogeneity of interventions. Despite that, they all have a parental educational component that needs to be studied in greater depth.

AB  - No systematic review has been conducted to provide an overview of the effectiveness of psychoanalysis for treatment outcomes in bipolar depression and mania. The present study undertakes a scoping review of the effectiveness of psychoanalysis for bipolar disorder (BD), provides a summary of the evidence base, and identifies issues for future research in this area. A thorough search of journal articles in MEDLINE, PEP-Web, PsycINFO, Scopus, and the Web of Science was carried out to obtain available studies on psychoanalytic treatment for BD published from 1990 to 2021. We searched for either quantitative or single-case studies. Twenty-six single-case reports from 21 articles and no quantitative studies met the inclusion criteria. A qualitative analysis suggests efficacy and cost-effectiveness but thus far there is no scientific evidence in support of psychoanalysis. Although these pilot findings suggest that psychoanalysis may impact symptoms and global functioning in individuals with BD, the underlying evidence is poor and should be confirmed by experimental studies.

AB  - We present the first systematic literature review on stress and burnout in K-12 teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a systematic literature search, we identified 17 studies that included 9,874 K-12 teachers from around the world. These studies showed some indication that burnout did increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were, however, almost no differences in the levels of stress and burnout experienced by K-12 teachers compared to individuals employed in other occupational fields. School principals' leadership styles emerged as an organizational characteristic that is highly relevant for K-12 teachers' levels of stress and burnout. Individual teacher characteristics associated with burnout were K-12 teachers' personality, self-efficacy in online teaching, and perceived vulnerability to COVID-19. In order to reduce stress, there was an indication that stress-management training in combination with training in technology use for teaching may be superior to stress-management training alone. Future research needs to adopt more longitudinal designs and examine the interplay between individual and organizational characteristics in the development of teacher stress and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

AB  - Objective: to systematically search for randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols vs. control without exercise or other exercise protocols, in patients with mental disorders experiencing depressive symptoms, and to provide some guidance based on the current HIIT literature to improve further interventions. Methods: we searched for relevant studies, published by 18 August 2022 on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus databases, that used a HIIT protocol, involving adults (>= 18 years) with a diagnosis of a mental disorder, participating in a HIIT or a control condition, and assessed for depressive symptoms. Results: Four studies accounting for 108 participants (n HIIT = 55; n comparison groups = 53) met the inclusion criteria. Three out of the four studies included found significant improvements of depressive symptoms after 12 days to 8 weeks of intervention. However, there were no differences to other forms of low-to-moderate continuous exercise in 2/3 studies. Conclusions: The limited evidence suggests the effectiveness of HIIT interventions for improving depressive symptoms in people with mental illness. However, HIIT was not superior to other exercise treatments, although a trend for its superiority may be recognized. A number of methodological issues should be considered in further interventions to better characterize and identify the most efficient HIIT modalities for the treatment of depressive symptoms in these patients.

AB  - The limbic system describes a complex of brain structures central for memory, learning, as well as goal directed and emotional behavior. In addition to pathological studies, recent findings using in vivo structural and functional imaging of the brain pinpoint the vulnerability of limbic structures to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) throughout the disease course. Accordingly, dysfunction of the limbic system is critically related to the symptom complex which characterizes PD, including neuropsychiatric, vegetative, and motor symptoms, and their heterogeneity in patients with PD. The aim of this systematic review was to put the spotlight on neuroimaging of the limbic system in PD and to give an overview of the most important structures affected by the disease, their function, disease related alterations, and corresponding clinical manifestations. PubMed was searched in order to identify the most recent studies that investigate the limbic system in PD with the help of neuroimaging methods. First, PD related neuropathological changes and corresponding clinical symptoms of each limbic system region are reviewed, and, finally, a network integration of the limbic system within the complex of PD pathology is discussed.

AB  - Men often experience depressive symptoms during the transition to parenthood, but there is a lack of synthesized knowledge of instruments used to identify such symptoms. The aim of this scoping review was to identify instruments used to measure symptoms of depressive symptoms among fathers in pregnancy and the postpartum period, and to describe the instruments' characteristics and measurement properties. We identified studies published since 1990 through searches in databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO and in gray literature. Pairs of reviewers selected relevant studies based on predetermined inclusion criteria. For each included study, we collected information relevant to the review question, guided by the COnsensus based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN). We included 13 instruments, described in 59 studies with about 29,000 participants across 25 countries. There were 12 validation studies. None of the instruments were uniquely developed for assessing paternal depressive symptoms related to fatherhood. The three most extensively examined instruments were the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. For seven of the 13 instruments, there was no information reported about the instruments' properties beyond internal consistency, but for the other six instruments the 12 validation studies reported on both reliability and validity. No studies reported on measurement error or responsiveness. EPDS was both the most extensively assessed instrument and reported to be the most reliable and valid. Further research on instruments for identifying men with depression in pregnancy and the postpartum period is warranted.

AB  - Aim Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be an effective therapy of some treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders and movement disorders. Comorbid depressive symptoms are common and difficult to manage. Treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be required. There are few published cases describing the safety and efficacy of ECT for patients with DBS implants, and there are no available guidelines for administration of ECT in patients with DBS and mood disorders. The current study had 3 aims: (i) to conduct a systematic review of case reports on patients with DBS implants who received ECT; (ii) to report the case of a 69-year-old man with a DBS implant for essential tremor, who required ECT; and (iii) to provide practical recommendations for ECT in patients with DBS implants. Methods We conducted a systematic review, in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, of existing case reports on patients with DBS implants administered ECT for psychiatric disorders. Results Our search yielded 25 cases of ECT in patients implanted with DBS systems. In addition, we here describe successful ECT management of major depressive disorder in a patient treated by DBS. We also set forth ECT management guidelines based on points of consensus. The 2 most important practical recommendations are to make sure the DBS system is set to 0 V and turned off before ECT, and to avoid sites near the DBS electrodes. Conclusions Electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective and safe treatment for DBS patients with MDD.

AB  - This review aims to map the available evidence on biopsychosocial predictors of elderly mental health. The articles were independently screened in three selected databases, namely Pubmed, Proquest and Google Scholar. The stages consist of identifying the research questions, seeking and selecting relevant evidence, mapping data, and concluding and reporting results. The PRISMA flowchart was used to show the PEOS evidence search flow. A total of 23,722 articles were obtained from all databases during the initial search, where 458 titles fulfilled the eligibility criteria at the title screening stage. Furthermore, 383 articles passed through abstract screening, where 75 met the inclusion criteria and were included for full-text screening. Based on the full-text screening stage, 28 articles were excluded and the remaining 47 articles that matched the search process were included for data extraction. This review creates biopsychosocial variables related to the mental health of the elderly. The biological factors consist of age, biomarkers, female, health conditions, chronic diseases, and physical function. Variables related to psychological factors are affect, personality traits, and subjective well-being. Meanwhile, social factors include smoking, sleep quality, physical activity, daily living, social support, marital status, loneliness, religiosity, spirituality, and early life conditions.

AB  - Dance has been highlighted as one of the most enjoyable, safe, and feasible forms of physical activity, improving physical health, mental health, and general well-being, among various patients. Little is known about the effect and impact of dance interventions to improve health among patients with pulmonary diseases, and research lacks a robust synthesis of evidence. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to investigate the impact of dance intervention on patients with noninfectious pulmonary diseases. Following the PRISMA guidelines, six electronic databases were searched in May 2022. Of the 1308 unique records identified, seven studies (five quantitative, two qualitative) across four countries were included in this systematic review. Six studies investigated adult populations, and one study explored the effect of dance on children. The dance interventions lasted between 1 and 10 weeks. Overall, dance was perceived to have a broad range of physical/mental/social benefits, including quality of life, social cohesion, dyspnoea levels, balance, exercise tolerance, general well-being, and adherence to nutrition regimens. Furthermore, the dance session was the most enjoyable activity among children and adolescents with asthma. With available evidence, dance interventions are promising and may effectively improve health and well-being among patients with noninfectious pulmonary diseases. More organised and continuous long-term dance interventions in future may reveal a detailed impact on health outcomes.

AB  - Depression is associated with hyperactivity of the hypothalamo pituitary adrenal axis. Cortisol is a steroid hormone, released from the adrenal gland and is considered to be a biological marker of stress and anxiety. Serum or plasma cortisol levels have been previously studied in depressive patients but reported contradictory results. The present meta analysis aims to assess the serum or plasma concentration of cortisol in depressive patients compared with controls. We have conducted a systematic review with sequential meta analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases, and published reference lists were searched up to January 2021. We have conducted a systematic review on PubMed for the following search (MeSH) terms ( "Hydrocortisone "[Mesh]) AND "Depressive Disorder "[Mesh]). The RevMan 5.3 and Open Meta Analyst software was used with the standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The Jamovi and Open Meta Analyst Software were used to evaluate the publication bias, sensitivity analysis, and meta regression as possible sources of heterogeneity. Seventeen studies having a combined population (n) of 1400 (743 depressive patients and 657 controls) had satisfied the inclusion criteria for serum or plasma cortisol. The pooled SMD of the serum or plasma cortisol levels in depressive patients compared with controls was 1.18, (95% CI: 0.84, 1.52; P < 0.00001) with I2 = 85% (Ph < 0.00001). This meta analysis indicates a statistically significant mean difference in serum or plasma cortisol between depressed patients and controls. Meta analysis concluded that serum or plasma cortisol can differentiate depressed patients from nondepressed controls.

AB  - The Department of Defense has mandated combat and operational stress control (COSC) efforts for the Services since 1999. Although several COSC-related programs have been implemented, few have undergone evaluation, and no standardized metrics have been established to assess their effectiveness and utility. The purpose of this review was to characterize the content and psychometrics of measures that have been utilized as outcome metrics in evaluations of COSC-related programs and interventions. Systematic literature searches were conducted for publications that: a) evaluated at least one measure from U.S. service members who participated in a program or intervention to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of combat and operational stress; and b) reported U.S. data on the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and sensitivity/specificity of the identified measures. This process identified 15 measures for which psychometric properties were reviewed for acceptability based on recommended criteria. Identified measures varied from well-validated measures to newer instruments for which more data is needed on one or more of the target psychometric properties. Aside from internal consistency, psychometric data from U.S. military samples were sparse. Results further suggested that some measures might have reduced sensitivity in service members under certain conditions, such as large-scale screening. Additional studies are needed to validate COSC-relevant measures in service members. Future evaluations of programs and interventions for combat and operational stress should select measures that will increase the consistency of the literature, allow comparisons across studies, and ensure alignment with the objectives of identified programs.

AB  - Objectives: Alexithymia is characterized by an inability to identify and describe feelings, which may increase the psychological burden of patients with psoriasis. The prevalence of alexithymia in psoriasis has been investigated with variable results. This study aimed to estimate the overall alexithymia prevalence in psoriasis. Methods: The PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, China Knowledge Resource in Integrated Database (CNKI), WanFang Database, Weipu Database (VIP), and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) electronic databases were searched from inception to March 28, 2022, for cross-sectional studies, that reported prevalence of alexithymia. The included studies were evaluated for quality, data synthesis, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias. Results: This systematic review and meta-analysis included 16 articles involving 3752 patients with psoriasis from eight countries. The pooled prevalence of alexithymia was 28% (95% CI: 25-32%), with heterogeneity between studies (I-2 = 80.03%, p < .001). There was a higher prevalence of alexithymia in women with psoriasis, patients with a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score > 10, patients with psoriatic arthritis, and patients with psoriasis with visible skin lesions had a higher prevalence of alexithymia. Conclusion: More than a quarter of people with psoriasis have alexithymia., But due to the small sample size of the included studies, the results of the subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of alexithymia development in psoriasis. These findings may provide a theoretical basis for the screening and intervention of alexithymia in patients with psoriasis.

AB  - Background Symptoms related to chronic stress are prevalent and entail high societal costs, yet there is a lack of international consensus regarding diagnostics and treatment. A new stress-related diagnosis, exhaustion disorder, was introduced into the Swedish version of ICD-10 in 2005. Since then, use of the diagnosis has increased rapidly. Aims To create the first comprehensive synthesis of research on exhaustion disorder to report on the current state of knowledge. Preregistration: Open Science Framework (osf.io), doi 10.17605/OSF.IO/VFDKW. Method A PRISMA-guided scoping review of all empirical studies of exhaustion disorder was conducted. Searches were run in the MEDLINE, PsycInfo and Web of Science databases. Data were systematically charted and thematically categorised based on primary area of investigation. Results Eighty-nine included studies were sorted into six themes relating to lived experience of exhaustion disorder (n = 9), symptom presentation and course (n = 13), cognitive functioning (n = 10), biological measures (n = 24), symptom measurement scales (n = 4) and treatment (n = 29). Several studies indicated that individuals with exhaustion disorder experience a range of psychiatric and somatic symptoms beyond fatigue, but robust findings within most thematic categories were scarce. The limited number of studies, lack of replication of findings and methodological limitations (e.g. small samples and scarcity of specified primary outcomes) preclude firm conclusions about the diagnostic construct. Conclusions More research is needed to build a solid knowledge base for exhaustion disorder. International collaboration regarding the conceptualisation of chronic stress and fatigue is warranted to accelerate the growth of evidence.

AB  - beneficial effects of exercise on human brain function have been demonstrated in previous studies. Myokines secreted by muscle have attracted increasing attention because of their bridging role between exercise and brain health. Regulated by PPARc coactivator 1a, fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 releases irisin after proteolytic cleavage. Irisin, a type of myokine, is secreted during exercise, which induces white adipose tissue browning and relates to energy metabolism. Recently, irisin has been shown to exert a protective effect on the central nervous system. Irisin secretion triggers an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the hippocampus, contributing to the amelioration of cognition impairments. Irisin also plays an important role in the survival, differentiation, growth, and development of neurons. This review summarizes the role of irisin in neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological disorders. As a novel positive mediator of exercise in the brain, irisin may effectively prevent or decelerate the progress of neurodegenerative diseases in models and also improve cognitive functions. We place emphasis herein on the potential of irisin for prevention rather than treatment in neurodegenerative diseases. In ischemic diseases, irisin can alleviate the pathophysiological processes associated with stroke. Meanwhile, irisin has anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. The potential therapeutic effects of irisin in epilepsy and pain have been initially revealed. Due to the pleiotropic and beneficial properties of irisin, the possibility of irisin treating other neurological diseases could be gradually explored in the future.?? 2022 IBRO.

AB  - As the global population increases, the expansion of road networks has led to the destruction and disturbance of terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Road-related stressors have significant effects on both lotic and lentic habitats. While there are several systematic reviews that evaluate the effects of roads on lotic environments, there are none that consider their effects on lentic habitats only. We conducted a literature review to achieve two objectives: (1) to summarize the effects of roads on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of lentic environments; and (2) to identify biases and gaps in our current knowledge of the effects of roads on lentic habitats, so that we could find promising areas for future research. Our review found 172 papers published between 1970 and 2020. The most frequently studied stressors associated with roads included road salt and heavy metal contamination (67 and 43 papers, respectively), habitat fragmentation (37 papers), and landscape change (14 papers). These stressors can lead to alterations in conductivity and chloride levels, changes in lake stratification patterns, increases in heavy metal concentrations in water and organisms, and significant mortality as amphibians disperse across roadways. We also identified a variety of other stressors that may be understudied based on their frequency of appearance in our search results, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, road dust, increased accessibility, hydrological changes, noise pollution, dust suppressants, sedimentation, invasive species introductions, and water withdrawal. Our review indicated that there are strong geographic biases in published studies, with 57.0% examining North American sites and 30.2% examining European sites. Furthermore, there were taxonomic biases in the published literature, with most studies focusing on amphibians (41.7%), fish (15.6%), and macroinvertebrates (14.6%), while few considered zooplankton (8.3%), diatoms (7.3%), amoebas (5.2%), water birds (3.1%), reptiles (2.1%), and macrophytes (1.0%). Based on our review, we have identified promising areas for future research for each of the major stressors related to roadways. However, we speculate that rectifying the geographic and taxonomic bias of our current knowledge could significantly advance our understanding of the impacts of roads on lentic environments, thereby better informing environmental management of these important habitats.

AB  - The objective of the study is to provide a reliable estimate of the pooled prevalence of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and social anxiety symptoms (SAS) among children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) in China. Meta-analysis is used to provide pooled-prevalence rate of SAD and SAS. Literature searches were conducted in both English and Chinese databases from the database's inception to April 2019. Eleven studies were identified for SAD, and 17 were included for SAS. The results revealed a pooled prevalence of SAD of 2.1% (95% CI: 1.2-3.8%) with high between-studies heterogeneity (Q = 1,055.2, I-2 = 99.1%, p < 0.001). The pooled prevalence estimate of SAS was 23.5% (95% CI: 18.6-29.3%), also with significant heterogeneity (Q = 1,019.3, I-2 = 98.4%, p < 0.001). Different diagnostic tools or self-report scales reported significant different prevalence of SAD or SAS. Further analysis stratified by gender, age, sampling methods, economic status, and risk of bias were performed. Limitations include the high level of heterogeneity between studies, inadequate number of the studies, and significant differences in prevalence caused by measurements.

AB  - Background: Lead exposure remains highly prevalent worldwide despite decades of research highlighting its link to numerous adverse health outcomes. In addition to well-documented effects on cognition, there is growing evidence of an association with antisocial behavior, including aggression, conduct problems, and crime. An updated systematic review on this topic, incorporating study evaluation and a developmental perspective on the outcome, can advance the state of the science on lead and inform global policy interventions to reduce exposure.
   Objectives: We aim to evaluate the link between lead exposure and antisocial behavior. This association will be investigated via a systematic review of human epidemiological and experimental nonhuman mammalian studies.
   Methods: The systematic review protocol presented in this publication is informed by recommendations for the conduct of systematic reviews in toxicology and environmental health research (COSTER) and follows the study evaluation approach put forth by the U.S. EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program.
   Data sources: We will search the following electronic databases for relevant literature: PubMed, BIOSIS and Web of Science. Search results will be stored in EPA's Health and Environmental Research Online (HERO) database.
   Study eligibility and criteria: Eligible human epidemiological studies will include those evaluating any population exposed to lead at any lifestage via ingestion or inhalation exposure and considering an outcome of antisocial behavior based on any of the following criteria: psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), disruptive behavior disorders (DBD)); violation of social norms (e.g., delinquency, criminality); and aggression. Eligible experimental animal studies will include those evaluating nonhuman mammalian studies exposed to lead via ingestion, inhalation, or injection exposure during any lifestage. The following outcomes will be considered relevant: aggression; antisocial behavior; and altered fear, anxiety, and stress response.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Screening will be conducted with assistance from an artificial intelligence application. Two independent reviewers for each data stream (human, animal) will screen studies with highest predicted relevance against pre-specified inclusion criteria at the title/abstract and full-text level. Study evaluation will be conducted using methods adapted from the U.S. EPA IRIS program. After data extraction, we will conduct a narrative review and quantitative meta-analysis on the human epidemiological studies as well as a narrative review of the experimental animal studies. We will evaluate the strength of each evidence stream separately and then will develop a summary evidence integration statement based on inference across evidence streams.

AB  - S-ketamine is approved for treatment-resistant patients with depression and adult patients with suicide behavior. While ketamine is therapeutically beneficial in adults, there is a dearth of research on the effects of ketamine on adolescent brain function and behavior. In this review we summarize the current literature on the neurobio-logical and behavioral effects of adolescent ketamine exposure in preclinical animal models and humans. A search of PubMed was conducted using pre-defined criteria, resulting in the evaluation of 406 articles. A total of 39 animal studies and 7 human studies met the selection criteria. The included studies examined the effects of ketamine exposure during adolescence and excluded studies on ketamine use for pain or anesthesia and ketamine as a model of schizophrenia. Pre-clinical animal models of adolescent ketamine exposure show ketamine-induced neurotoxicity and apoptosis, and changes in locomotor activity, social behaviors, anxiety-and depression-like behaviors, and memory. There is variability in the results, and differences in ketamine dose and length of exposure appears to influence the results. Ketamine reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety and improves mood in human adolescents. Much of the literature on adolescent ketamine exposure examines the effects in males, with more limited research in females. Relatively little research has focused on adolescent ketamine exposure. Despite its effectiveness for mitigating symptoms of depression, adolescent ketamine exposure can disrupt memory and other behaviors and have deleterious effects on brain function. Further research is war-ranted to better define doses and dosing paradigms that are beneficial without unintended side effects in adolescence.

AB  - Early identification of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is critical for mitigating the many negative functional outcomes associated with its diagnosis. Because of the strong genetic basis of ADHD, the use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) could potentially aid in the early identification of ADHD and associated outcomes. Therefore, a systematic search of the literature on the association between ADHD and PRS in pediatric populations was conducted. All articles were screened for a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria, and, after careful review, 33 studies were included in our systematic review and 16 studies with extractable data were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the review were categorized into three common themes: the associations between ADHD-PRS with 1) the diagnosis of ADHD and ADHD symptoms 2) comorbid psychopathology and 3) cognitive and educational outcomes. Higher ADHD-PRS were associated with increased odds of having a diagnosis (OR = 1.37; p<0.001) and more symptoms of ADHD (beta = 0.06; p<0.001). While ADHD-PRS were associated with a persistent diagnostic trajectory over time in the systematic review, the meta-analysis did not confirm these findings (OR = 1.09; p = 0.62). Findings showed that ADHD-PRS were associated with increased odds for comorbid psychopathology such as anxiety/depression (OR = 1.16; p<0.001) and irritability/emotional dysregulation (OR = 1.14; p<0.001). Finally, while the systematic review showed that ADHD-PRS were associated with a variety of negative cognitive outcomes, the meta-analysis showed no significant association (beta = 0.08; p = 0.07). Our review of the available literature suggests that ADHD-PRS, together with risk factors, may contribute to the early identification of children with suspected ADHD and associated disorders.

AB  - Behavioral neuroscience tests such as the Light/Dark Test, the Open Field Test, the Elevated Plus Maze Test, and the Three Chamber Social Interaction Test have become both essential and widely used behavioral tests for transgenic and pre-clinical models for drug screening and testing. However, as fast as the field has evolved and the contemporaneous involvement of technology, little assessment of the literature has been done to ensure that these behavioral neuroscience tests that are crucial to pre-clinical testing have well-controlled ethological motivation by the use of lighting (i.e., Lux). In the present review paper, N = 420 manuscripts were examined from 2015 to 2019 as a sample set (i.e., n = similar to 20-22 publications per year) and it was found that only a meager n = 50 publications (i.e., 11.9% of the publications sampled) met the criteria for proper anxiogenic and anxiolytic Lux reported. These findings illustrate a serious concern that behavioral neuroscience papers are not being vetted properly at the journal review level and are being released into the literature and public domain making it difficult to assess the quality of the science being reported. This creates a real need for standardizing the use of Lux in all publications on behavioral neuroscience techniques within the field to ensure that contributions are meaningful, avoid unnecessary duplication, and ultimately would serve to create a more efficient process within the pre-clinical screening/testing for drugs that serve as anxiolytic compounds that would prove more useful than what prior decades of work have produced. It is suggested that improving the standardization of the use and reporting of Lux in behavioral neuroscience tests and the standardization of peer-review processes overseeing the proper documentation of these methodological approaches in manuscripts could serve to advance pre-clinical testing for effective anxiolytic drugs. This report serves to highlight this concern and proposes strategies to proactively remedy them as the field moves forward for decades to come.

AB  - Objective Serotonergic psychedelics are re-emerging as potential novel treatments for several psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder. The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) convened a task force to review the evidence and provide a consensus recommendation for the clinical use of psychedelic treatments for major depressive disorder. Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify contemporary clinical trials of serotonergic psychedelics for the treatment of major depressive disorder and cancer-related depression. Studies published between January 1990 and July 2021 were identified using combinations of search terms, inspection of bibliographies and review of other psychedelic reviews and consensus statements. The levels of evidence for efficacy were graded according to the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments criteria. Results Only psilocybin and ayahuasca have contemporary clinical trials evaluating antidepressant effects. Two pilot studies showed preliminary positive effects of single-dose ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression (Level 3 evidence). Small randomized controlled trials of psilocybin combined with psychotherapy showed superiority to waitlist controls and comparable efficacy and safety to an active comparator (escitalopram with supportive psychotherapy) in major depressive disorder, with additional randomized controlled trials showing efficacy specifically in cancer-related depression (Level 3 evidence). There was only one open-label trial of psilocybin in treatment-resistant unipolar depression (Level 4 evidence). Small sample sizes and functional unblinding were major limitations in all studies. Adverse events associated with psychedelics, including psychological (e.g., psychotomimetic effects) and physical (e.g., nausea, emesis and headaches) effects, were generally transient. Conclusions There is currently only low-level evidence to support the efficacy and safety of psychedelics for major depressive disorder. In Canada, as of 2022, psilocybin remains an experimental option that is only available through clinical trials or the special access program. As such, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments considers psilocybin an experimental treatment and recommends its use primarily within clinical trials, or, less commonly, through the special access program in rare, special circumstances.

AB  - Cannabis potency, defined as the concentration of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has increased internationally, which could increase the risk of adverse health outcomes for cannabis users. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic review of the association of cannabis potency with mental health and addiction (PROSPERO, CRD42021226447). We searched Embase, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE (from database inception to Jan 14, 2021). Included studies were observational studies of human participants comparing the association of high-potency cannabis (products with a higher concentration of THC) and low-potency cannabis (products with a lower concentration of THC), as defined by the studies included, with depression, anxiety, psychosis, or cannabis use disorder (CUD). Of 4171 articles screened, 20 met the eligibility criteria: eight studies focused on psychosis, eight on anxiety, seven on depression, and six on CUD. Overall, use of higher potency cannabis, relative to lower potency cannabis, was associated with an increased risk of psychosis and CUD. Evidence varied for depression and anxiety. The association of cannabis potency with CUD and psychosis highlights its relevance in health-care settings, and for public health guidelines and policies on cannabis sales. Standardisation of exposure measures and longitudinal designs are needed to strengthen the evidence of this association.

AB  - The environment has been implicated to be a strong determinant of brain health with higher risk of neuro-degeneration. The drastic rise in the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), multiple sclerosis (MS) etc., supports the idea that environmental factors may play a major role in NDDs aetiology. Nickel is one of the listed environ-mental metals reported to pose a serious threat to human health. This paper reported available studies on nickel level in NDDs covering both animal and human studies. Different databases were searched for articles reporting the main neurotoxicity mechanisms and the concentration of nickel in fluids and tissues of NDDs patients compared to controls. Data were extracted and synthesized by ensuring the articles were related to nickel and NDDs. Various mechanisms were reported as oxidative stress, disturbances in mitochondrial membrane poten-tial, trace elements homeostasis destabilization, etc. Nickel was found elevated in biological fluids as blood, serum/plasma and CSF and in the brain of NDDs, as a consequence of unintentional exposure thorough nickel -contaminated air, food, water, and skin contact. In addition, after exposure to nickel, the concentration of markers of lipid peroxidation were increased, while some antioxidant defence systems decreased. Thus, the reduction in the exposure to nickel contaminant may hold a promise in reducing the incidence of NDDs.

AB  - Background Millions of children and adolescents are exposed to wars, affecting their psychological well-being. This review focuses on psychosocial interventions in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the Middle East, where mental health services are limited. Aims Our primary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of trial-assessed psychosocial interventions in reducing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in children and adolescents aged <= 18 years who were exposed to war in LMICs in the Middle East. Changes in other psychological conditions and symptoms were evaluated where reported. Method PubMed, Cochrane Library and Ovid were searched without year restriction, in December 2021. Previous review reference lists were also checked. Only studies published in English were included. Each study was evaluated for risk of bias and results are presented as a narrative synthesis. Results Three group-based interventions were identified and evaluated across six studies: 'Teaching Recovery Techniques', 'Writing for Recovery' and 'Advancing Adolescents'. Two studies took place in post-war settings, and four in a context of ongoing conflict. Positive experiences and improved social skills were indicated following most interventions, but Teaching Recovery Techniques was the only programme associated with a statistically significant reduction in PTSD score. Differences in follow-up interval limited comparability of outcomes. Conclusions This review highlights a paucity of evidence for effective treatment options for children and adolescents affected by war from LMICs in the Middle East. Promising indications of reductions in PTSD symptoms, specifically from Teaching Recovery Techniques, require further rigorous evaluation and long-term follow-up.

AB  - Objective: To examine associations between baseline anxiety and depression and occurrence of ICD shocks and risk of mortality in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Method: We systematically searched EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for eligible studies fulfilling the predefined criteria. Results: We included 37 studies based on 25 different cohorts following 35,003 participants for up to seven years. We observed no association between baseline anxiety nor depression and the occurrence of ICD shocks. More than half of the identified studies (respectively 56% and 60%) indicated a significant association between baseline anxiety or depression and increased risk of mortality (anxiety: n = 5, ranging from Hazard ratios (HR):1.02 [Confidence intervals (CI) 95% 1.00-1.03] to HR:3.45 [CI 95% 1.57-7.60]; depression: n = 6, ranging from HR:1.03 [CI 95% 1.00-1.06] to HR:2.10 [CI 95% 1.44-3.05]). We found a significant association between high methodological quality of the primary study and the detection of a significant association (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Baseline anxiety and depression are associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with an ICD, but not with occurrence of ICD shocks. Inclusion of baseline anxiety and depression in risk stratification of mortality may be warranted.

AB  - C. pluricaulis Choisy (C. pluricaulis), a perennial herb aka C. microphyllus Sieb. and C. Prostratus Forsk. is being used as a traditional folk medicine for a variety of ailments. In this article, we collected information about C. pluricaulis through electronic search using PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, and Web of Science as well as network pharmacology is done. This comprehensive review sheds light on the plant profile, phytochemistry, neuropharmacological, and toxicological data of C. pluricaulis. The crude herb and its metabolites have exhibited a wide range of in vitro and in vivo neuropharmacological effects, including memory enhancement, anxiolytic, tranquilizing, anti-depressant, anti-stress, neurodegenerative, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, analgesic, sedative, anti-convulsant, and Alzheimer's disease-reversing effects. Network pharmacology results indicate that compounds from C. pluricaulis interact with various proteins, neuro synapses, signaling pathways, and serotonergic synapse which plays a crucial role in neurotransmission, Alzheimer's disease, long-term depression, addictions to alcohol, cognitive disorders, psychological conditions, and increasing serotonin concentration in synapses.

AB  - Purpose: The intent of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effects of Traditional Chinese Exercise (TCE) on mental health and drug cravings in drug rehabilitees. Methods: Six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycArticles, and CNKI) were searched to identify the potential literature from inception to March 2022. The controlled studies with a pro-posttest design that investigated the effects of TCE on mental health (depression, anxiety, drug craving, and sleep quality) were included. The effect sizes were calculated using the random-effect models with a 95% confidence interval. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was employed to evaluate study quality. Results: A total of 10 studies (740 participants, mean age 35 years old) were included in this study. The pooled results showed that TCE produced significant improvements in depression (SMD = 0.65, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.02, p < 0.01), anxiety (SMD = 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.53, p < 0.01), and drug craving (SMD = 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.21, p < 0.01) compared to the control group. The subgroup analysis results showed that TCE resulted in significant improvements in depression compared to active intervention (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60) or passive intervention (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.74). A significant improvement in depression was observed in both male and female drug rehabilitee (p < 0.05). Moreover, Tai Chi (SMD = 0.69, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.18) or Qigong (SMD = 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.74) exercise, 3-4 times per week (SMD = 1.06, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.74) or >= 5 times (SMD = 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.66), > 45 min (SMD = 0.62, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.15) or <= 45 min (SMD = 0.68, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.27), and for a duration of 12 weeks (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.54) produced significant improvement in depression. Conclusion: This current study suggests that TCE (Tai Chi, Qigong) may have benefits in alleviating depression, anxiety, and drug cravings in drug rehabilitees. Further studies are required to verify our results through the implementation of well-designed experimental protocols.

AB  - Various neurotrophins (NTs), including nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4, promote cellular differentiation, survival, and maintenance, as well as synaptic plasticity, in the peripheral and central nervous system. The function of microRNAs (miRNAs) and other small non-coding RNAs, as regulators of gene expression, is pivotal for the appropriate control of cell growth and differentiation. There are positive and negative loops between NTs and miRNAs, which exert modulatory effects on different signaling pathways. The interplay between NTs and miRNAs plays a crucial role in the regulation of several physiological and pathological brain procedures. Emerging evidence suggests the diagnostic and therapeutic roles of the interactions between NTs and miRNAs in several neuropsychological disorders, including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and drug abuse. Here, we review current data regarding the regulatory interactions between NTs and miRNAs in neuropsychological disorders, for which novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies are emerging. Targeting NTs-miRNAs interactions for diagnostic or therapeutic approaches needs to be validated by future clinical studies.

AB  - Background Although its effect has not been verified, family therapy - such as family psychoeducation (FPE) - is a widely used intervention for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). To our knowledge, no systematic review and meta-analysis exists that examines the effect of FPE on MDD. Aims To assess evidence on the effectiveness of FPE on depressive symptoms in people with MDD. Method We searched several databases - including PubMed, MEDLINE and Web of Science, among others - to identify eligible studies on the topic published up to March 2022. Our criteria included studies on participants with a primary MDD diagnosis and their family members and excluded studies on people with bipolar disorders and other mental illnesses. In the included studies, family members in the control groups did not receive FPE. Participants in both the intervention and control groups received standard treatment. Two researchers independently selected relevant publications, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and GRADE evaluation. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42020185884). Results The meta-analysis included five studies with 301 patients with MDD and their family members. The effect of FPE on patients' symptom severity, compared with the control condition, at 16 weeks was available for five comparisons of four randomised control trials (RCTs); a final follow-up was available for six comparisons of five RCTs. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in patients' symptoms, compared with control, at 16 weeks (s.m.d. = -0.52, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.01) and at a final follow-up (s.m.d. = -0.53, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.08). The meta-analysis on the effect of FPE on family functioning showed a non-significant improvement both at 16 weeks and at final follow-up. Conclusions FPE had a small but statistically significant effect on depressive symptoms in people with MDD, in both the short and long term. However, according to the GRADE framework, all outcomes are graded very low on certainty; therefore, more high-quality research is needed.

AB  - Dyadic behavioral synchrony is a complex interactional process that takes place between the mother and her infant. In the first year of life, when the infant is prelinguistic, processes such as synchrony enable the dyad to communicate through shared behavior and affect. To date, no systematic review has been carried out to understand the risk and protective factors that influence behavioral synchrony in the mother-infant dyad. The aim of this review was to identify and evaluate the factors that influence behavioral synchrony in the mother-infant dyad, when the infant is between 3 and 9 months old. Key electronic databases were searched between 1970 and April 2021, and 28 eligible studies were identified for review. As the results were largely heterogeneous, four subgroups of factors were identified: (i) infant demographics, (ii) physiological factors, (iii) maternal mental health, and (iv) miscellaneous factors. Identified risk factors and covariates suggest that social determinants of health, underpinned by biological factors, play a large role in influencing behavioral synchrony within the dyad. Implications for the need to identify additional risk and protective factors, as well as design support for at-risk families are discussed.

AB  - (1) Background: Nursing and care home staff experienced high death rates of older residents and increased occupational and psychosocial pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The literature has previously found this group to be at risk of developing mental health conditions, moral injury (MI), and moral distress (MD). The latter two terms refer to the perceived ethical wrongdoing which contravenes an individual's moral beliefs and elicits adverse emotional responses. (2) Method: A systematic review was conducted to explore the prevalence, predictors, and psychological experience of MI and MD in the aforementioned population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The databases CINAHL, APA PsychINFO, APA PsychArticles, Web of Science, Medline, and Scopus were systematically searched for original research studies of all designs, published in English, with no geographical restrictions, and dating from when COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency on the 30 January 2020 to the 3 January 2022. Out of 531 studies screened for eligibility, 8 studies were selected for review. A thematic analysis was undertaken to examine the major underpinning themes. (3) Results: MI, MD, and related constructs (notably secondary traumatic stress) were evidenced to be present in staff, although most studies did not explore the prevalence or predictors. The elicited major themes were resource deficits, role challenges, communication and leadership, and emotional and psychosocial consequences. (4) Conclusions: Our findings suggest that moral injury and moral distress were likely to be present prior to COVID-19 but have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Whilst studies were generally of high quality, the dearth of quantitative studies assessing prevalence and predictors suggests a research need, enabling the exploration of causal relationships between variables. However, the implied presence of MI and MD warrants intervention developments and workplace support for nursing and care home staff.

AB  - The metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were some of the hottest tech terms in 2021, according to a Google Trends search. Our review aims to describe the metaverse and NFTs in the context of their potential application in the treatment of mental health disorders. Advancements in technology have been changing human lives at an ever-increasing pace. Metaverse, also known as the three-dimensional (3D) internet, is the convergence of virtual reality (VR) and physical reality in a digital space. It could potentially change the internet as we know it, with NFTs as the key building blocks in the new expansive virtual ecosystem. This immersive 3D virtual world boasts the features of the real world with the added ability to change the surrounding environment according to individual needs and requirements. VR, augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) have been employed as tools in the treatment of various mental health disorders for the past decade. Studies have reported positive results on their effectiveness in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. VR/AR/MR have been hailed as a solution to the acute shortage of mental health professionals and the lack of access to mental healthcare. But, on the flip side, young adults tend to spend a significant amount of time playing 3D immersive games and using social media, which can lead to insecurity, anxiety, depression, and behavioural addiction. Additionally, endless scrolling through social media platforms negatively affects individuals' attention span as well as aggravating the symptoms of adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
   We aimed to explore the ramifications of expanding applications of the metaverse on mental health. So far, no other review has explored the future of mental health in the context of the metaverse.

AB  - While the effectiveness of parent-mediated interventions in the field of autism spectrum disorder is well documented, information on the experience of parents involved in parent-mediated interventions is limited. We performed a systematic review with qualitative evidence synthesis to explore the experience of parent-mediated interventions in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Sociology Collection were searched from the date of their creation until 25 February 2022. Qualitative studies reporting parents' experience of parent-mediated interventions were included. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias. The findings of the selected studies were extracted and synthesized using the meta-aggregation method. The results are reported according to PRISMA and ENTREQ guidelines. A total of 23 studies were synthesized representing 345 participants. We found 34 categories that were summarized in four synthesized themes: barriers to implementation and logistical issues, feeling overwhelmed and stressed (a need for support), facilitators of implementation, and empowerment in the parent and improvement in the child. Parents' experience of parent-mediated interventions in autism spectrum disorder is balanced between positive outcomes for them and their child, emotional struggles, and some difficulties in implementing parent-mediated interventions. Based on these results, we propose new ways to improve implementation of parent-mediated interventions and research in the field. Lay abstract The effectiveness of parent-mediated interventions in the field of autism spectrum disorder is well documented but information on the experience of parents involved in parent-mediated interventions is limited. This study is the first synthesis of evidence concerning the experience of parents involved in parent-mediated interventions. It synthesizes the voice of 345 parents across the world into four general themes: barriers to implementation and logistical issues, feeling overwhelmed and stressed (a need for support), facilitators of implementation, and empowerment in the parent and improvement in the child. The findings of our study provide evidence that parent-mediated interventions should be adapted to the needs of each family. Specific care and support should be offered to parents in addition to parent-mediated interventions. Our study, however, highlights which outcomes are important to parents and should be considered in future studies.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the risk factors associated with suicidal behavior and thus, prioritizing its prevention is recommended. Methods This study systematically reviewed the global evidence on the incidence of suicide/suicidal attempts and the trend in suicidal rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional and cohort studies investigating the outcomes of suicidal death and suicidal attempts at any setting during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases for papers published from December 2019 to May 2021. Results Out of 1052 studies18 studies with 12,746 suicidal attempts and 33,345 suicidal deaths were included in the final analysis. The mental health impact of social distancing, COVID-19 quarantine, and financial crises due to loss of employment were associated risk factors with suicide and/or suicidal attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six common thematic recommendations for preventing suicidal deaths and suicidal attempts were identified. Conclusions Unexpected behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the increasing trend of suicidal attempts reported. Domestic conflicts and violence, financial loss, anxiety and depression, and pre-existing mental health condition/s should be considered in preventing suicidal attempts and deaths secondary to the COVID 19 pandemic. Early detection and timely intervention for individuals with suicidal behavior is crucial and collated recommendations in the current study can be utilized for those preventive interventions. More systematic suicide risk screening process should be introduced who are at risk, along with an evidence base prevention approach.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have identified substantial unmet information needs in people with depression and anxiety. Sufficient information about the disorder, treatment, available services, and strategies for self-management is essential as it may influence quality of care and patients' quality of life. This scoping review aimed to provide a broad overview of information needs of people with depression and anxiety as well as the sources that they use to seek this information.
   Methods: We included all primary research published in English that investigated information needs or information sources in people with depression or anxiety, with no restrictions imposed on the study design, location, setting, or participant characteristics. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LISTA, Web of Science) and the grey literature (Google and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant studies published up to November 2021. Two reviewers independently screened articles and extracted data. Narrative synthesis was performed to identify key themes of information needs and information sources. Factors associated with information needs/sources such as demographic variables and symptom severity were also identified.
   Results: Fifty-six studies (comprising 8320 participants) were included. Information needs were categorised into seven themes, including general facts, treatment, lived experience, healthcare services, coping, financial/legal, and other information. The most frequently reported needs in both people with depression and anxiety were general facts and treatment information. Subclinical samples who self-reported depressive/anxious symptoms appeared less interested in treatment information than patients with clinical diagnoses. Information sources were summarised into five categories: health professionals, written materials, media, interpersonal interactions, and organisational resources. Health professionals and media (including the internet) were the most frequently adopted and preferred sources. Although few studies have examined factors associated with information needs and information sources, there is preliminary evidence that symptom severity and disease subtypes are related to information needs/sources, whereas findings on demographic factors were mixed.
   Conclusions: Information needs appear to be high in people with depression and anxiety. Future research should examine differences between subgroups and associated factors such as the treatment course. Personalised information provision strategies are also needed to customise information according to individual needs and patient profiles.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the mindfulness literature up until the end of 2020 by (a) uncovering its underlying intellectual structure, (b) identifying the most influential and popular themes, and (c) presenting new directions for future research on mindfulness. To this end, a systematic quantitative review based on bibliometric methods was conducted, which is perhaps less prone to researcher bias and can complement existing meta-analyses and qualitative (narrative) structured reviews as an objective approach. Three bibliometric techniques-document co-citation analysis, co-word (co-occurrence and content) analysis, and bibliographic coupling-were applied to explore the past, present, and future of mindfulness research. The co-citation analysis showed that measurement, mechanisms, mindfulness-based interventions, and examinations of the efficacy of mindfulness interventions are among the key theoretical knowledge bases from which the field of mindfulness is derived. The content analysis demonstrated the beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation for physical and mental health conditions. The bibliographic coupling revealed novel directions in cognitive behavioral therapy, emotion regulation, the application of mindfulness practice to children and adolescents, mindfulness at work, and the role of mindfulness in positive psychology. The large sample of articles that was analyzed allowed us to provide a broader and more objective overview than possible with other forms of literature reviews. The combination of the three bibliometric techniques granted deeper insights into the complex multidisciplinary field of mindfulness, along with specific suggestions for future research.

AB  - Background Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a major mental health condition with a lifetime prevalence rate of 1.3% among adults. While placebo effects are well described for conditions such as depressive and anxiety disorders, they have not been systematically characterized in OCD. Objectives We aimed to determine the impact of placebos in improving different symptom domains in patients with OCD. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases/search engine from inception to January 2021 for randomized controlled trials of treatments for OCD with a placebo arm. A modified Cohen's effect size (ES) was calculated using change in baseline to endpoint scores for different measurement scales within placebo arms to estimate placebo effects and to investigate their correlates by random-effects model meta-analyses. Results Forty-nine clinical trials (placebo group n = 1993), reporting 80 OCD specific (153 measures in general) were included in the analysis. Overall placebo ES (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 0.32 (0.22-0.41) on OCD symptoms, with substantial heterogeneity (I-square = 96.1%). Among secondary outcomes, general scales, ES: 0.27 (95%CI: 0.14-0.41), demonstrated higher ES than anxiety and depression scales, ES: 0.14 (95%CI: -0.4 to 0.32) and 0.05 (95%CI: -0.05 to 0.14), respectively. Clinician-rated scales, ES: 0.27(95%CI: 0.20-0.34), had a higher ES than self-reported scales, ES: 0.07 (95%CI: -0.08 to 0.22). More recent publication year, larger placebo group sample size, shorter follow-up duration, and younger age of participants were all associated with larger placebo ES. Egger's test reflected possible small-study effect publication bias (P = 0.029). Conclusion Placebo effects are modest in OCD trials and are larger in clinician ratings, for younger patients, and early in the treatment course. These findings underscore the need for clinicians and scientists to be mindful of placebo effects when formulating treatments or research trials for OCD.

AB  - Aims: Somatic complaints are a frequent cause for consultation in primary care. In a transcultural context, somatic complaints are typically associated with psychological distress. A recent review about somatic symptom disorders in adolescence showed some nosographic heterogeneity and outlined various etiological hypotheses (traumatic, environmental, or neurologic), separate from the cross-cultural considerations. Migrants' children encounter specific problems involving cultural mixing-issues of filiation (familial transmission) and affiliation (belonging to a group). This paper aims to provide a systematic review of somatization in transcultural contexts among teenagers and young adults, aged 13 to 24, over the past decade. Methods: This review adheres to the quality criteria set forth by the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Two authors queried three English databases (Medline, PsycInfo, WebOfScience) about somatization in transcultural contexts (migrant or non-Western population) among teenagers (13-18), young adults (19-24), or both. The methodological process comprised articles selection, data extraction, and then the analysis of emerging themes. Setting selection criteria to limit the transcultural field was difficult. Results: The study analyzed 68 articles. We present a descriptive analysis of the results, centered on three main themes. First, the literature highlights a nosographic muddle reflected in the combination of anxious and depressive symptoms together with the highly variable symptomatology. Second, discrimination issues were prevalent among the migrant population. Lastly, the literature review points out possibilities for improving a care pathway and reducing the diagnostic delay induced by migrants' hesitancy about Western care and the recurrent use of inappropriate diagnostic criteria. Conclusion: This review discusses the links between the nosographic muddle described here and the diagnostic delays these patients experience and raises concerns about rigid diagnostic compartmentalization. The work of the psychiatrist Frantz Fanon is here useful to understand externalized symptoms resulting from physical and psychological confinement. Discrimination issues raise questions about the cultural counter-transference health professionals experience in dealing with young migrants. Defining healthcare professionals' representations about somatic complaints in a transcultural context might be a fruitful path to explore in future research.

AB  - Depression is a common, recurrent mental disorder and one of the leading causes of disability and global burden of disease worldwide. Up to 15%-40% of cases do not respond to diverse pharmacological treatments and, thus, can be defined as treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The development of biomarkers predictive of drug response could guide us towards personalized and earlier treatment. Growing evidence points to the involvement of the glutamatergic system in the pathogenesis of TRD. Specifically, the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), which are targeted by ketamine and esketamine, are proposed as promising pathways. A literature search was performed to identify studies on the genetics of the glutamatergic system in depression, focused on variables related to NMDARs and AMPARs. Our review highlights GRIN2B, which encodes the NR2B subunit of NMDAR, as a candidate gene in the pathogenesis of TRD. In addition, several studies have associated genes encoding AMPAR subunits with symptomatic severity and suicidal ideation. These genes encoding glutamatergic receptors could, therefore, be candidate genes for understanding the etiopathogenesis of TRD, as well as for understanding the pharmacodynamic mechanisms and response to ketamine and esketamine treatment.

AB  - Emotion theories emphasize the relevance of (predicted) bodily changes for the construction of one's own emotions and an extensive overlap of brain regions involved during emotion intensity perception and somato-sensory processing. The ability to accurately perceive bodily changes and its impact on the perception of emotion intensity has been studied for at least 40 years. The results of previous studies were summarized in a meta -analysis to examine how closely interoceptive accuracy and emotion intensity are related. After a systematic literature search, 4036 studies were screened for eligibility. Only studies assessing adults from general popu-lation samples were considered. Samples recruited to examine mental disorders or neurological conditions were excluded. Thirty studies with a quantifiable measure for the relation of interoceptive accuracy and emotion intensity perception were included in the meta-analysis. Interoceptive accuracy was significantly related with emotion intensity perception, when emotions were experimentally induced (k= 22, r= 0.15). However, the relationship was only found when IAPS images (k= 9, r= 0.33) or facial expressions (k= 3, r= 0.24) were used for emotion induction. No significant relation was found in studies without emotion induction (k= 19, r =-0.007). There was considerable bias, varying dependent on bias assessment method, study protocol and examined risk of bias dimension. We discuss the impact of differences in study protocols, review the operationalization of interoceptive accuracy critically and derive directions for future research.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction with challenging treatment. According to evidence-based studies, acupuncture is likely to be a promising therapy and subservient adjunct for IBS. Mechanism study of acupuncture based on related clinical trials of high quality, nevertheless, is still vacant. Aim: This study aims to assess the results and qualities of current clinical evidence and conclude the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic effects of acupuncture on IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). Methods: Literature from four databases, namely, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science, was systematically searched to obtain eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which contained mechanism research of acupuncture treatment in IBS-D patients. Two independent reviewers completed data extraction and quality evaluation using the RevMan 5.4.1 software. Results: Ten trials that covered 19 items related to mechanism research were included in this review. Acupuncture was reported to improve IBS-D symptoms and quality of life, with positive effects in regulating brain-gut peptides, cerebral activities, neuroendocrine functions, psychological state, and inflammatory GI and hypersensitive intestinal tracts. Conclusion: Acupuncture has potential influence on pathophysiology alterations such as regulating brain-gut peptides, altering cerebral connectivity and activity, promoting neuroendocrine functions and mental state, and mitigating inflammation as well as hypersensitivity of bowels in IBS-D patients, but further studies of high quality are still necessary.

AB  - Background: Having a child with autism spectrum disorder can have significant psychological effects on parents. This systematic review summarizes the current state of literature underscoring the impact of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on parents in Arab countries Methods: A systematic search of seven databases (PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Google Scholar, ERIC, Academic Search Complete, and PsycINFO) was performed, which identified 24 studies (20 quantitative studies and four qualitative studies) that included 3,299 parents or caregivers of children with ASD. These studies were conducted in 10 Arab countries (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Emirates, Palestine, Qatar, and Lebanon). Results: The majority of the included studies found that ASD has a significant negative impact on the mental health and wellbeing of Arab parents. It was found that parents of children with ASD have a poor quality of life (QoL) and an increased risk of psychological disorders. These findings were in contrast to findings of parents of typically developing children and children with other developmental disorders. Challenges faced by parents of children with ASD were associated with several child- and parent-related factors. The most common coping strategy used by parents was religious coping. Conclusion: The impact of ASD on parents has only recently gained traction among researchers in Arab countries. Despite several knowledge gaps, published studies have provided useful information outlining the impact of ASD on parents in some of these countries. Further research comprising larger random samples and using varied research and data-collection methods is required to understand the multifaceted challenges experienced by parents raising children with ASD in Arab countries.

AB  - Background Goal setting and goal-focused work is widely used in young people's mental health settings. However, little is known about how, why or for whom this is helpful. This study aims to explore the mechanisms of collaborative goal setting as part of therapeutic relationships: is it helpful for young people experiencing anxiety and/or depression, how and why/not, for whom, and under what circumstances? Methods Online database searches generated 10,907 records. Seven unique studies are included, combined with insight analysis from directed discussions with international advisors with lived experience of anxiety and/or depression and therapy (N = 8; mean age = 20.8), and mental health academics/clinicians (N = 6). Results Findings are presented as a narrative synthesis and suggest that goal setting is helpful to young people experiencing anxiety and/or depression because it helps build good therapeutic relationships through open communication and building trust. Goal setting helps make things more manageable, enabling young people to feel supported and have ownership of their care. Individual preferences, or high levels of distress, trauma, low confidence, hopelessness, negative past experiences of goal setting, perfectionism, and rumination are considered limiting factors to goal setting. Additionally, contextual factors including country and long-term therapy are explored. Conclusion Whilst the resultant sample is small, emphasis on the voices of young people in the research is both prominent and of paramount importance. Several key literature gaps are identified, including evidenced links to the reduction in symptoms. Priority must be given to researching unhelpful mechanisms of goal setting for young people experiencing anxiety and/or depression, to avoid any potential iatrogenic effects.

AB  - The outbreak of SARs-CoV-2 with emerging new variants is leading to global health crisis and has brought a major concern for patients with comorbidities. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a motor neurodegenerative disease involving various metabolic and psychological ailments along with the common occurrence of hyposmia as observed in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the observed surplus inflammatory responses in both diseases are also alarming. Alongside, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, essentially required by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell and dopamine decarboxylase (DDC), required for dopamine synthesis is known to co-regulate in the non-neuronal cells. Taken together, these conditions suggested the probable reciprocal pathological relation between COVID-19 and PD and also suggested that during comorbidities, the disease diagnosis and therapeutics are critical and may engender severe health complications. In this review, we discuss various events and mechanisms which may have implications for the exacerbation of PD conditions and must be taken into account during the treatment of patients.

AB  - Objective: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a frequent comorbid condition in adults with bipolar disorder. We performed a meta-analysis aimed at assessing sociodemographic and clinical correlates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in bipolar disorder. Method: We searched main electronic databases up to June 2021. Random-effects meta-analyses, with relevant meta-regression and quality-based sensitivity analyses, were carried out to estimate the association between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and putative correlates, grading the quality of evidence. Results: We included 43 studies, based on 38 independent samples. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participants were more likely to be males (odds ratio = 1.46; p < 0.001) and unemployed (odds ratio = 1.45; p = 0.045), and less likely to be married (odds ratio = 0.62; p = 0.014). They had an earlier onset of bipolar disorder (standardized mean difference = -0.36; p < 0.001); more mood episodes (standardized mean difference = 0.35; p = 0.007), particularly depressive (standardized mean difference = 0.30; p = 0.011) and mixed (standardized mean difference = 0.30; p = 0.031) ones; higher odds of using antidepressants (odds ratio = 1.80; p = 0.024) and attempted suicides (odds ratio = 1.83; p < 0.001) and lower odds of psychotic features (odds ratio = 0.63; p = 0.010). Moreover, they were more likely to have generalized anxiety disorder (odds ratio = 1.50; p = 0.019), panic disorder (odds ratio = 1.89; p < 0.001), social phobia (odds ratio = 1.61; p = 0.017), eating disorders (odds ratio = 1.91; p = 0.007), antisocial personality disorder (odds ratio = 3.59; p = 0.004) and substance (odds ratio = 2.29; p < 0.001) or alcohol (odds ratio = 2.28; p < 0.001) use disorders. Quality of the evidence was generally low or very low for the majority of correlates, except for bipolar disorder onset and alcohol/substance use disorders (high), and suicide attempts (moderate). Conclusion: Comorbid bipolar disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may have some distinctive clinical features including an earlier onset of bipolar disorder and higher comorbid alcohol/substance use disorder rates. Further research is needed to identify additional clinical characteristics of this comorbidity.

AB  - Background: Medical students are at a significant risk of experiencing psychological issues, such as burnout. Over the past few years, more studies have been conducted on this topic, producing different results. Aims: The purpose of this review was to determine the global pooled prevalence rate and risk factors associated with burnout and its components among undergraduate (pre-intern) medical students. Method: From inception until 30 November 2021, nine electronic databases were used for an electronic search. Using random-effects meta-analysis, we pooled the estimates using the DerSimonian-Laird method. The prevalence of burnout in medical students was the primary outcome of interest. Data were analyzed globally, by country, by research measure. Age and sex were examined as confounders using meta-regression analysis. Results: A random-effects meta-analysis of 42 studies involving 26,824 evaluating the prevalence of burnout in medical students showed an overall prevalence rate 37.23% [32.66%; 42.05%], Q = 2,267.15(41), p < .0001, tau(2) = .42, tau = .65, I-2 = 98.2%; H = 7.5. Prevalence of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment were 38.08% [30.67%; 46.10%], 35.07% [26.74%; 44.41%], and 37.23% [32.66%; 42.05%], respectively. Variations were observed between countries and research measures. Age (older) and sex (female) were both significant predictors of burnout. Conclusion: The prevalence of burnout in medical students was estimated to be 37.23%. It is urgent that future studies serve as a basis for the development of prevention and treatment programs to prevent and treat burnout in students.

AB  - Eye movement abnormalities in association with cognitive and emotional deficits have been described in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Eye-Tracking (ET) techniques could therefore enhance cognitive interventions by contingently providing feedback to patients. Since no consensus has been reached thus far on this approach, this study aimed at systematically reviewing the current evidence. This review was performed and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. Records were searched for in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus (1990-2021) through the following string: ('Eye Tracking' OR 'Eye-Tracking' OR 'Oculomotor') AND ('Neuropsychol*' OR 'Cognitive') AND ('Rehabilitation' OR 'Training' OR 'Stimulation'). Study outcomes were thematically classified and qualitatively synthesized. A structured quality assessment was performed. A total of 24 articles were included, addressing neurodevelopmental (preterm infants and children with autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, or ADHD; N = 14), psychiatric (mood and anxiety disorders or alcohol dependence; N = 7), and neurological conditions (stroke; N = 3). Overall, ET gaze-contingent training proved to be effective in improving cognitive and emotional alterations. However, population heterogeneity limits the generalizability of results. ET gaze-contingent protocols allow researchers to directly and dynamically train attentional functions; together with the recruitment of implicit, "bottom-up" strategies, these protocols are promising and possibly integrable with traditional cognitive approaches.

AB  - The effectiveness of peer support in improving mental health and well-being has been well documented for vulnerable populations. However, how peer support is delivered to migrant domestic workers (MDWs) to support their mental health is still unknown. This scoping review aimed to synthesize evidence on existing peer support services for improving mental health among MDWs. We systematically searched eight electronic databases, as well as grey literature. Two reviewers independently performed title/abstract and full-text screening, and data extraction. Twelve articles were finally included. Two types of peer support were identified from the included studies, i.e., mutual aid and para-professional trained peer support. MDWs mainly seek support from peers through mutual aid for emotional comfort. The study's findings suggest that the para-professional peer support training program was highly feasible and culturally appropriate for MDWs. However, several barriers were identified to affect the successful implementation of peer support, such as concerns about emotion contagion among peers, worries about disclosure of personal information, and lack of support from health professionals. Culture-specific peer support programs should be developed in the future to overcome these barriers to promote more effective mental health practices.

AB  - Background and objectives: Over the past few decades, research has revealed complex interactions between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a wide range of comorbid conditions. The present paper sought to examine the relationship between bipolar disorder and T2DM and clarify the clinical impact of therapeutic interventions, highlighting the interpretation and implications of recent literature reports. Methods: The PubMed electronic database was searched for keywords "bipolar disorder" AND "diabetes" OR "glucose". Based on this literature search, 15 meta-analyses/systematic reviews and numerous research studies were identified that examined interrelationships between bipolar disorders and T2DM. Results: Patients with bipolar disorder have higher rates of T2DM compared to the general population. Further, type 2 diabetic patients with comorbid bipolar disorder often experience deteriorated long-term glucose control and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent literature suggests shared risk factors and underlying disease mechanisms. In addition, genetic factors, sedentary life-style, lack of exercise, increased simple carbohydrate intake, adverse effects of bipolar pharmacotherapy, and bipolar depressive symptoms phenomenology may affect glucose metabolism. Conclusions: The observed bidirectional interaction merits screening for psychiatric disorders in T2DM and vice versa to allow for early detection and treatment of this at risk population. Selection of drugs with neutral metabolic effects and dose individualization hold significant promise for optimizing therapy with antipsychotic and antidiabetic agents.

AB  - Emotion regulation (ER) is a central target in the study of psychological and neurobiological processes of emotions for numerous psychological disorders. Ecological momentary assessments, overcoming retrospective self-reports, allow a better understanding of the relation between the use of ER strategies and daily life affective experiences. A systematic review and meta-analyses of studies testing these relations through experience sam-pling methods (ESM) and daily diaries were conducted. ESM studies showed significant large effect sizes in contemporaneous relations between negative affect (NA) and rumination, suppression, and worry, and in both contemporaneous and prospective relations between positive affect (PA) and reappraisal; medium effect sizes in prospective relations between NA and rumination, and PA and distraction; and a small effect size in the pro-spective relation between NA and suppression. Daily diary studies showed significant large effect sizes in contemporaneous relations between NA and rumination and suppression, and in both contemporaneous and prospective relations between PA and reappraisal; medium effect sizes in contemporaneous relations between PA and acceptance, and problem-solving; and a small effect size in the prospective relation between NA and reappraisal. These findings shed light on the temporal relations between the use of ER strategies and affective experiences and highlight conceptual and methodological limitations in the field.

AB  - Recent studies have found abnormal levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) diseases (e.g., stroke, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease). This suggests that BDNF may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Moreover, regulating BDNF signaling may represent a potential treatment for such diseases. With reference to recent research papers in related fields, this article reviews the production and regulation of BDNF in CNS and the role of BDNF signaling disorders in these diseases. A brief introduction of the clinical application status of BDNF is also provided.

AB  - The 2019 coronavirus pandemic forced the shift to distance education aggravating mental and physical vulnerabilities of undergraduate students, including sleep. This review aims to describe sleep problem rates and prevalence, sleep pattern disruption, sleep duration, sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, psychological and socio-economic factors affecting sleep of undergraduates in 22 countries. A systematic search for articles published from 2020 to 2021 using 'COVID-19,' 'Coronavirus,' 'Pandemic,' 'Sleep,' 'Mental Health,' and 'Students' from PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane yielded 2550 articles, where 72 were included. Selection criteria were: English full-text available articles, undergraduates and not postgraduates, reported sleep outcomes, and participants not from allied health courses. Risk of bias was assessed using various Joanna Briggs Institute checklists and outcomes were descriptively synthesized. Prevalence of sleep problems was notable, while longitudinal studies showed increased rates. There was significantly increased sleep duration, and sleep pattern disruption during lockdowns. Several psychological, behavioural, environmental, demographic, and socio-economic factors were found to be associated with sleep changes. These highlight the pandemic's impact on sleep of undergraduate students and reveal opportunities for institutions to intervene with policies and programs to promote the well-being of undergraduates. Limitations include recall bias and underrepresentation of other countries. This study is self-funded with registration number RGAO-2021-0071.

One of the most common mental health disorders in these victims is Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of PTSD on the flood victims.Methods: Data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Embase, Google Scholar, conference and congress papers, key journals, the reference list of selected articles as well as systematic reviews were searched to identify studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD in flood victims. Random Effect Model was used to perform meta-analysis of the studies. Cochran test and I-2 indicator were used to explore heterogeneity between the studies. Publication bias of the study was evaluated using Begg'test. Data were analyzed by STATA (version 14) software.Results: After a comprehensive search, 515 papers were extracted. After eliminating duplicates and final screening, 23 studies were selected and entered the meta-analysis phase after qualitative evaluation. The results showed that the prevalence of PTSD in flood victims is 29.48% (95% CI: 18.64-40.31, I-2 = 99.3%, p-value < 0.001).Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that the prevalence of PTSD is relatively high in the flood victims. So, it is necessary to take preventive, supportive, therapeutic and effective actions for them.

AB  - Introduction Tele-medicine services have been developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupts mental health services. The present study investigates the effectiveness of telephone-delivered services for psychological disorders in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials for relevant clinical studies up to February 1, 2022. Following terms were used: "severe acute respiratory syndrome", "Coronavirus", "Coronavirus infection", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19", "mental disorder", "mental health", "mental health program", "mental health service", "psychiatric service", "telemedicine", "Telehealth", "Tele-health", "Telecare", "Mobile health". Results Twelve relevant clinical articles were included in our study. Eight articles were parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs), two were Quasi-experimental, and one was a multicenter retrospective cohort study. A total of 1900 adults (18 years old or above that) were included. Online telecommunication methods like online apps and videoconference were the most common interventions. The most prevalent measured outcome was levels of anxiety and depression among participants. Eleven out of 12 articles showed a significant association between telemedicine and mental health improvement. Conclusions The included studies in the current systematic review reported the probable efficacy of telemedicine in improving mental health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is not possible to determine the best telecommunication method for each mental disorder in different populations and the preference of patients is still face to face therapy. So RCTs in different populations with previous mental disorders or chronic diseases are required to investigate the further telemedicine's efficacy on managing mental problems.

AB  - Background. Studies have identified high rates of mental disorders in refugees, but most used self-report measures of psychiatric symptoms. In this study, we examined the percentages of adult refugees and asylum seekers meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder (BPD), and psychosis.
   Methods. A systematic literature search in three databases was conducted. We included studies examining the prevalence of MDD, post-traumatic stress disorder, BPD, and psychosis in adult refugees according to a clinical diagnosis. To estimate the pooled prevalence rates, we performed a meta-analysis using the Meta-prop package in Stata (PROSPERO: CRD42018111778).
   Results. We identified 7048 records and 40 studies (11 053 participants) were included. The estimated pooled prevalence rates were 32% (95% CI 26-39%; I-2 = 99%) for MDD, 31% (95% CI 25-38%; I-2 = 99.5%) for post-traumatic stress disorder, 5% (95% CI 2-9%; I-2 = 97.7%) for BPD, and 1% (95% CI 1-2%; I-2 = 0.00%) for psychosis. Subgroup analyses showed significantly higher prevalence rates of MDD in studies conducted in low-middle income countries (47%; 95% CI 38-57%, p = 0.001) than high-income countries studies (28%; 95% CI 22-33%), and in studies which used the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (37%; 95% CI 28-46% p = 0.05) compared to other diagnostic interviews (26%; 95% CI 20-33%). Studies among convenience samples reported significant ( p = 0.001) higher prevalence rates of MDD (35%; 95% CI 23-46%) and PTSD (34%; 95% CI 22-47%) than studies among probability-based samples (MDD: 30%; 95% CI 21-39%; PTSD: 28%; 95% 19-37%).
   Conclusions. This meta-analysis has shown a markedly high prevalence of mental disorders among refugees. Our results underline the devastating effects of war and violence, and the necessity to provide mental health intervention to address mental disorders among refugees. The results should be cautiously interpreted due to the high heterogeneity.

AB  - Healthcare workers (HCWs) and public safety personnel (PSP) across the globe have continued to face ethically and morally challenging situations during the COVID-19 pandemic that increase their risk for the development of moral distress (MD) and moral injury (MI). To date, however, the global circumstances that confer risk for MD and MI in these cohorts have not been systematically explored, nor have the unique circumstances that may exist across countries been explored. Here, we sought to identify and compare, across the globe, potentially morally injurious or distressful events (PMIDEs) in HCWs and PSP during the COVID-19 pandemic. A scoping review was conducted to identify and synthesize global knowledge on PMIDEs in HCWs and select PSP. Six databases were searched, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsychInfo, CINAHL, and Global Health. A total of 1,412 articles were retrieved, of which 57 articles were included in this review. These articles collectively described the experiences of samples from 19 different countries, which were comprised almost exclusively of HCWs. Given the lack of PSP data, the following results should not be generalized to PSP populations without further research. Using qualitative content analysis, six themes describing circumstances associated with PMIDEs were identified: (1) Risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19; (2) Inability to work on the frontlines; (3) Provision of suboptimal care; (4) Care prioritization and resource allocation; (5) Perceived lack of support and unfair treatment by their organization; and (6) Stigma, discrimination, and abuse. HCWs described a range of emotions related to these PMIDEs, including anxiety, fear, guilt, shame, burnout, anger, and helplessness. Most PMIDE themes appeared to be shared globally, particularly the 'Risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19' and the 'Perceived lack of support and unfair treatment by their organization.' Articles included within the theme of 'Stigma, discrimination, and abuse' represented the smallest global distribution of all PMIDE themes. Overall, the present review provides insight into PMIDEs encountered by HCWs across the globe during COVID-19. Further research is required to differentiate the experience of PSP from HCWs, and to explore the impact of social and cultural factors on the experience of MD and MI.

AB  - Background Prevalence of depression and anxiety in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) and their caregivers is high, however, results have been inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety in PwCF and their caregivers and explore sources of heterogeneity. Method MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL plus and PsychINFO databases were searched from inception to January 2021. Studies were included if a specific psychometric tool (PT) to assess depression or anxiety (rather than quality of life) was used and did not involve a transitory patient state. Random-effects models were applied due to high anticipated heterogeneity and I(2 )estimates were calculated. Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup comparisons. The presence of small-study effects was investigated visually using funnel plots and statistically using the Egger test. Results A total of 94 articles (48 full-text publications, 46 abstracts) were included. Depression prevalence in adolescents aged 12-18 years (n = 2386), adults (n = 9206) and caregivers (n = 6617) were 18.7% (95% CI 12.8-25.3%, I-2 = 89.2%), 27.2% (95% CI 23.6-31%, I-2 = 90.4%), and 32.8% (95% CI 27.9-37.9%, I-2 = 90.3%), respectively. Anxiety prevalence in adolescents aged 12-18 years (n = 2142) was 26% (95% CI 19.6-33%, I-2 = 86.4%), 28.4% (95% CI 25-31.9%, I-2 = 85%) for adults (n = 8175), and 38.4% (95% CI 30.8-46.2%, I-2 = 94.6%) for caregivers (n = 5931). Prevalence differed by the PT used and study location. Discussion This comprehensive analysis found the prevalence of depression and anxiety in PwCF and their caregivers to be high, supporting recommendations for regular screening. Choice of PT significantly influenced prevalence, indicating a need for future studies to identify the optimal PT for each CF population to identify those most at risk.

AB  - Objective. - The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the methods used to measure social network site use among adolescents. Such a review is important given the number and diversity of sites and the prevalence of their use among adolescents. Methods. - A systematic review of the literature was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines to arrive at an analysis of 58 peer-reviewed studies indexed in PubMed, PsychInfo, or Scopus. To be included in the review, articles had to be peer-reviewed, available in full text, and published in French or English. For inclusion, studies were required to pertain to adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years; to focus on social network site use and indicate how their use was estimated. Studies that simultaneously examined social network sites and general internet use or video games and only provided a combined analysis were excluded. The keywords for the search were: social media use, social media usage, social media misuse, measure, teen, and adolescents. Results. - In the literature, different methods were used to operationalize the use of social network sites: quantitative methods with the measurement of frequency and duration of use of social network sites, and qualitative methods to measure the different activities adolescents engage in on such sites. In this review, 28 articles investigated the use of social media through a measurement of frequency and 22 articles through a measurement of the duration of use. Most of the studies focused on social network sites in general, without specifying which sites in particular were considered by the respondents when answering the question. However, some articles provided cross measures of quantitative and qualitative measurements resulting in the examination of both the frequency of use and the time spent on specific activities on social network sites. Conclusions. - The present review highlights the great diversity in the methods used to measure the use of social network sites among adolescents. The reliance on frequency-based measurements without taking into account the specificities of the activities or sites involved limits the investigation of their impact on adolescent functioning and behaviors. Given the observed discrepancies in the literature concerning the measurement of social network site use among adolescents and their associated biases, the development of specific instruments is needed to advance in this important field of research.

AB  - Background Research suggests that increasing neighbourhood social cohesion can prevent mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. However, it is unknown whether this is the case for adolescents and young adults. Aims To investigate whether neighbourhood social cohesion can prevent depression and anxiety, and identify interventions that can increase neighbourhood cohesion in young people. Method We conducted a rapid review for an overview of the available literature. PubMed, Campbell Collaboration, KSR Ltd and grey literature databases were searched from inception up to 10 July 2020. When synthesising the results, we applied a hierarchy of evidence, prioritising study designs that allowed for the most ability to infer causality. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBIS tool and Joanna Briggs Institute risk-of-bias assessment. A narrative review and two workshops with young people were conducted to inform what future interventions may look like. Results Forty-two peer-reviewed publications, including two systematic reviews, 13 longitudinal studies and 27 cross-sectional studies, were identified. Prospective longitudinal studies found that neighbourhood social cohesion factors (safety, trust, positive social connections, helping others and a lack of crime and violence) were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Future interventions to increase neighbourhood cohesion should involve creating safe and attractive community centres, accessible and safe outdoor spaces, community activity groups and online communities. Conclusions Neighbourhood social cohesion has the potential to protect mental health. The next step is to conduct intervention studies to evaluate the effects on onset prevention. Clinicians should consider the impact cohesion can have on mental health, and signpost to community initiatives.

AB  - The present review aims to examine whether multi-component interventions for informal caregivers of people with dementia are effective on positive and negative aspects of caregiver well-being. Eleven databases were searched from inception to 8 March 2021. Only randomized controlled trials reporting the effectiveness of multi-component intervention on positive and negative aspects of caregiver well-being were eligible. Endnote X7 (Thomson ResearchSoft, Stanford, CA, USA) was used for study selection and version 5.1.0 of Cochrane Collaboration's tool (Cochrane, London, UK) was applied for quality assessment. Review Manager (Revman) Version 5.3 (Cochrane, London, UK) was used for the meta-analysis, and if statistical synthesis was inappropriate, only narrative analysis was performed. A total of 31 RCTs with 3939 participants were included. Meta-analyses showed small to moderate effects on subjective well-being, depression, and burden of caregivers, and a moderate to high effect on caregiver anxiety. Due to insufficient data and vast heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not performed for other outcomes, such as resilience, competence, and empathy. This review suggests that individualized multi-component interventions for caregivers may be one of the ways to promote their well-being. Further research is needed to explore the impact of rigorously designed and personalized multi-component interventions on informal caregivers, especially on more positive indicators, as well as its long-term effects and sustainability.

Studies were included if they provided quantitative data on mental health symptoms and disorders and consisted of adult rugby players. Eight studies were included, covering symptoms of anxiety, depression, alcohol use/misuse, distress, sleeping/sleep disturbance, and eating disorders/ adverse nutrition behaviors. Prevalence of mental health symptoms ranged from 6% (depression) to 68.8% (alcohol use/misuse). Most rates were similar to the general population, while symptoms of sleeping/sleep disturbance were lower, and symptoms of eating disorders/adverse nutrition behaviors and alcohol use/ misuse were higher than the general population. One study included female rugby players. Epidemiological evidence comprising of rigorous diagnostic data and inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and other protected characteristics is needed to inform future mental health support in this population.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, and approximately 50% of PD patients suffer from depression. We aim to determine the effects of physical activity on depression in PD patients and to provide scientific evidence-based exercise prescriptions for PD patients. A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PsycInfo until February 2022 for randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies published in English. The primary outcome was a score on a depression scale. A total of 14 RCTs involving 516 patients with PD were included in this study. The results of the meta-analysis showed that physical activity had a moderate and significant improvement in depression in PD patients (SMD = -0.60; 95% CI = -0.79 to -0.41; p < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis indicated that resistance exercise for 60-90 min more than 4 times per week for up to 12 weeks had a significant effect on PD patients who have had the disease for more than 5 years. Meta-regression showed that intervention type, intervention time, intervention frequency, intervention period, age, and disease duration were not sources of heterogeneity. Physical activity may reduce depression in PD patients. However, other larger sample sizes and high-quality studies are needed to validate these effects in the future.

AB  - The intensity and frequency of extreme weather and climate events are expected to increase due to anthropogenic climate change. This systematic review explores extreme events and their effect on gender-based violence (GBV) experienced by women, girls, and sexual and gender minorities. We searched ten databases until February, 2022. Grey literature was searched using the websites of key organisations working on GBV and Google. Quantitative studies were described narratively, whereas qualitative studies underwent thematic analysis. We identified 26 381 manuscripts. 41 studies were included exploring several types of extreme events (ie, storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires) and GBV (eg, sexual violence and harassment, physical violence, witch killing, early or forced marriage, and emotional violence). Studies were predominantly cross-sectional. Although most qualitative studies were of reasonable quality, most quantitative studies were of poor quality. Only one study included sexual and gender minorities. Most studies showed an increase in one or several GBV forms during or after extreme events, often related to economic instability, food insecurity; mental stress, disrupted infrastructure, increased exposure to men, tradition, and exacerbated gender inequality. These findings could have important implications for sexual-transfonnative and gender-transformative interventions, policies, and implementation. High-quality evidence from large, ethnographically diverse cohorts is essential to explore the effects and driving factors of GBV during and after extreme events.

AB  - Background and aims: We aimed to systematically identify, evaluate and summarize the research on adolescent emotion dysregulation and problematic technology use. We critically appraise strengths and limitations and provide recommendations for future research. Methods: We followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and conducted a systematic review of published original reports on adolescent emotion dysregulation and problematic technology use published until March 1, 2022. A thorough search preceded the selection of studies matching prespecified criteria. Strengths and limitations of selected studies, regarding design and reporting, were identified based on current best practices. Results: 39 studies met inclusion criteria. All of these studies provided on the relationship between adolescent emotion dysregulation and prob-lematic technology use severity based on self-report data. Discussion: There was a positive correlation between adolescent emotion dysregulation and the severity of problematic technology use. Beyond this, other variables (such as anxiety, depression, self-esteem, etc.) were also closely related to emotion dysregulation and problematic technology use. Such studies are of importance to better understand cause-effect relations regarding both variables.

AB  - (1) Background: Emotion regulation (ER) is regarded as a core treatment target for depression and other mental illnesses. In recent years, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been extensively used as an intervention for mental illnesses, but there has been no systematic review conducted regarding its effect on emotion regulation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of NIBS for emotion regulation; (2) Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. We analyzed the effects of NIBS on tasks assessing emotion regulation using a random-effects model, and further explored the moderating role of the following factors on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) studies by conducting subgroup analyses and meta-regression: target electrode placement, return electrode placement, current intensity, target electrode size, and duration of intervention; (3) Results: A total of 17 studies were included. Our meta-analysis indicated a small but significant effect of NIBS on the downregulation of negative emotions. Separate analyses indicated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) had a medium and significant effect on the downregulation of negative emotions, whereas tDCS had no significant effect. Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of tDCS was moderated by target and return electrode placemen; (4) Conclusions: These results indicate that NIBS had a positive effect on the downregulation of negative emotions. The stimulation protocols should be carefully considered and the underlying mechanisms should be further explored.

AB  - Dogs are becoming increasingly popular in pedagogical settings. Particularly children with special educational needs are believed to benefit from dog-assisted interventions. However, reliable evidence for supporting such claims is still scarce and reports on the effectiveness of this approach are often anecdotal. With our review we aim at evaluating the literature to answer the question, whether dog-assisted interventions in an educational setting can help children with special educational needs to improve and to develop their emotional, social and cognitive skills. Following the PRISMA Guidelines, the literature was systematically searched for experimental studies until February 2021. Eighteen studies were finally included, which varied greatly in type of intervention, outcomes measured, sample sizes, and scientific quality, which precluded a formal meta-analysis. Hence, we resorted to a narrative synthesis. Overall, the studies report mixed results in the different functional domains of stress reduction, motivation, social skills, cognitive abilities, reading abilities, social conduct, and mental wellbeing. No study reported any negative effects of the intervention. The most unequivocal evidence comes from studies on dogs' effects on physiological stress response in challenging situations and on motivation and adherence to instructions, reporting significantly lower levels of cortisol in both children and pedagogues in the presence of dogs, as well as increased motivation to learn and participate. Findings for other outcomes, academic or social, however, remain inconclusive. Data on long-term effects are lacking altogether. Still, this review indicates the potentials of dog-assisted interventions in special pedagogy, particularly towards supporting a calm and trustful social atmosphere.

AB  - Neuroscience research presents contradictory evidence in support of both the protective and destructive effects of cannabinoids in depression. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the existing preclinical literature on the effects of cannabinoid administration in the chronic unpredictable stress model of depression in order to evaluate the effects of cannabinoids and identify gaps in the literature. After protocol registration (PROSPERO #CRD42020219986), we systematically searched Scopus, Embase, Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection, APA PsychINFO, PubMed, CINAHL Complete, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global from the earliest record of the databases, February 1964, to November 2020 for articles that met inclusion criteria (e.g., rodent subjects and administration of a cannabinoid. A total of 26 articles were included representing a sample size estimate of 1132 rodents with the majority of articles administering daily intraperitoneal injections during chronic unpredictable stress. These articles were evaluated using a modified SYRCLE's risk-of-bias tool. For each continuous behavioral measure, the standardized mean difference was calculated between cannabinoid and vehicle groups in rodents subjected to chronic unpredictable stress. The effects of cannabinoids on depressive-like behavior was evaluated using a multilevel mixed-effects model with effect size weights nested within control groups. Cannabinoid administration moderately improved the pooled negative effects of chronic unpredictable stress on anhedonia, learned helplessness, novelty suppressed feeding, time in the anxiogenic context, and entries into the anxiogenic context. Although the interpretations are limited, these findings suggest that with further investigation, cannabinoids may be a viable long-term treatment for stress-related psychopathologies such as depression.

AB  - The potential modifiable role of diet in common psychological disorders, including depression and anxiety, has attracted growing interest. Diet may influence the occurrence of mental disorders through its inflammatory characteristics. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore whether dietary inflammatory potential is associated with the risk of depression and anxiety. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases up to February 2021. Articles related to dietary inflammatory potential and risk of depression or anxiety were included. After the elimination of repetitive and irrelevant literature, we conducted quality assessment, publication bias, and sensitivity analysis. In total, 17 studies with a total of 157,409 participants were included in the final analysis. Compared with the lowest inflammatory diet group, the highest group was significantly associated with the incidence of depression and anxiety, with the following pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs): 1.45 (1.30 similar to 1.62) for depression and 1.66 (1.41 similar to 1.96) for anxiety. A subgroup analysis by gender showed that this association was more prominent in women. For depression, the increased risk was 49% in women (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.28 similar to 1.74) and 27% in men (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06 similar to 1.52). As for anxiety, the increased risk was 80% in women (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.30 similar to 2.49) and 47% in men (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.81 similar to 2.89). As a result, long-term anti-inflammatory eating patterns may prevent depression and anxiety, whereas pro-inflammatory eating patterns may promote these conditions. People should add more fish, fish oil, fresh fruit, walnuts, and brown rice to their diet.

AB  - BackgroundThe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a key node of the frontal cognitive circuit. It is involved in executive control and many cognitive processes. Abnormal activities of DLPFC are likely associated with many psychiatric diseases. Modulation of DLPFC may have potential beneficial effects in many neural and psychiatric diseases. One of the widely used non-invasive neuromodulation technique is called transcranial direct current stimulation (or tDCS), which is a portable and affordable brain stimulation approach that uses direct electrical currents to modulate brain functions. ObjectiveThis review aims to discuss the results from the past two decades which have shown that tDCS can relieve clinical symptoms in various neurological and psychiatric diseases. MethodsHere, we performed searches on PubMed to collect clinical and preclinical studies that using tDCS as neuromodulation technique, DLPFC as the stimulation target in treating neuropsychiatric disorders. We summarized the stimulation sites, stimulation parameters, and the overall effects in these studies. ResultsOverall, tDCS stimulation of DLPFC could alleviate the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, depression, drug addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other mental disorders. ConclusionThe stimulation parameters used in these studies were different from each other. The lasting effect of stimulation was also not consistent. Nevertheless, DLPFC is a promising target for non-invasive stimulation in many psychiatric disorders. TDCS is a safe and affordable neuromodulation approach that has potential clinical uses. Larger clinical studies will be needed to determine the optimal stimulation parameters in each condition.

AB  - Background: Emerging evidence suggests that overprotective and controlling parenting, often referred to as "helicopter parenting " may have negative implications on the child's mental health such as anxiety and depression. However, no systematic review on the topic exists. Objective: Conducting a systematic review to identify all studies where the relationship between helicopter parenting and symptoms of anxiety and/or depression have been investigated. Method: A systematic literature search conducted the 3rd of November 2021 yielded 38 eligible studies. Since helicopter parenting is a fairly new construct, this review considered parental control and overprotective parenting to be dimensions of helicopter parenting and thus, eligible for the study. Study quality was assessed in accordance with Campbells Validity Typology. Results: The majority of the studies included in this review found a direct relationship between helicopter parenting and symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, validity problems undermine these findings with regarding to assessing the causal relationship between helicopter parenting and these symptoms. There were no longitudinal studies of sufficient quality to determine if helicopter parenting precedes the outcome of anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Even though the majority of the studies included in this systematic review found a relationship between helicopter parenting and anxiety and depression, the evidence for this relationship is insufficient and must be investigated further. Findings suggest that it is important to include both maternal and paternal parenting style in future studies as they could affect the outcome of anxiety and depression differently.

AB  - Purpose: This meta-analysis was to critically evaluate the effects of aromatherapy on the symptoms of anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Methods: Eight Chinese and English databases (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO) were systematically searched from the inception of databases to October 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). According to Cochrane Collaboration criteria, two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias and extract data from included studies. All analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.4. Results: Eleven qualified studies were included in the meta-analysis, ten of which reported the effect of aromatherapy on anxiety in cancer patients, including 1724 patients; five of the studies reported the effect on depression, including 1039 patients. The quality of the included studies was low, and most studies compared aromatherapy to usual care. This meta-analysis indicated that aromatherapy appeared to be effective for anxiety [SMD =-0.51, 95%CI (-0.83,-0.19), P = 0.002] and depression [SMD =-0.44, 95%CI (-0.76,-0.12), P = 0.008] symptoms in cancer patients. Inhalation aromatherapy may be more effective than massage. Aromatherapy seemed to improve the anxiety symptoms in cancer patients in a short time, especially in perioperative patients, but had no effect for patients treated with radiation, chemotherapy or palliative therapy. Placebo also appeared to be effective in some studies. Conclusions: Aromatherapy, especially inhalation aromatherapy, may help relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression in cancer patients, but more and higher-quality studies are needed. The literature does not yet support clinical implementation.

The Web of Science database was used as the data source and 1,658 publishments were included. Using two visualization analysis software, CiteSpace and VOSviewer, we analyzed the publishing years, countries, institutions, authors, journals, categories, keywords, and research frontiers in depression. The publishments revealed an upward trend from 2004 to 2020; the most prolific country and institutions were the United States and INSERM, respectively. The journal of Neuroscience was the most published and cited journal. The most relevant category was neurosciences. The hot topics in this field were GABAergic research in Gaba(a) receptor; the research frontier was depressive model. These analysis results provide a new perspective for researchers to conduct studies on related topics in the future and guidance for scientists to identify potential collaborators and research cooperation institutions.

AB  - Purpose Loneliness is associated with poor health including premature mortality. There are cross-sectional associations with depression, anxiety, psychosis, and other mental health outcomes. However, it is not known whether loneliness is causally linked with the new onset of mental health problems in the general population. Longitudinal studies are key to understanding this relationship. We synthesized evidence from longitudinal studies investigating the relationship between loneliness and new onset of mental health problems, in the general population. Method We systematically searched six electronic databases, unpublished sources, and hand-searched of references, up to August 2021. We conducted a meta-analysis of eight independent cohorts and narrative synthesis of the remaining studies. Results We included 32 studies, of which the majority focused on depression. Our narrative synthesis found most studies show loneliness at baseline which is associated with the subsequent new onset of depression. The few studies on anxiety and self-harm also showed a positive association. Our meta-analysis found a pooled adjusted odds ratio of 2.33 (95% CI 1.62-3.34) for risk of new onset depression in adults who were often lonely compared with people who were not often lonely. This should be interpreted with caution given evidence of heterogeneity. Conclusion Loneliness is a public mental health issue. There is growing evidence; it is associated with the onset of depression and other common mental health problems. Future studies should explore its impact across the age range and in more diverse populations, look beyond depression, and explore the mechanisms involved with a view to better informing appropriate interventions.

AB  - Background: Medical and socio-economic uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have had a substantial impact on mental health. This study aimed to systematically review the existing literature reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general populace in Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine associated risk factors. Methods: A systematic search of the following databases African Journal Online, CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted from database inception until 30th September 2021. Studies reporting the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among the general populace in African settings were considered for inclusion. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Meta-analyses on prevalence rates were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. Results: Seventy-eight primary studies (62,380 participants) were identified from 2,325 studies via electronic and manual searches. Pooled prevalence rates for anxiety (47%, 95% CI: 40-54%, I-2 = 99.19%) and depression (48%, 95% CI: 39-57%, I-2 = 99.45%) were reported across Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sex (female) and history of existing medical/chronic conditions were identified as major risk factors for anxiety and depression. Conclusions: The evidence put forth in this synthesis demonstrates the substantial impact of the pandemic on the pervasiveness of these psychological symptoms among the general population. Governments and stakeholders across continental Africa should therefore prioritize the allocation of available resources to institute educational programs and other intervention strategies for preventing and ameliorating universal distress and promoting psychological wellbeing.Systematic Review Registration, PROSPERO CRD42021228023.

AB  - Objectives Although a number of early childhood development (ECD) interventions in healthcare settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been developed to improve parent-directed outcomes and support ECD, their impact have yet to be established. This review assesses the effectiveness of healthcare-based ECD interventions in LMICs on the following key evidence-informed parenting outcomes affecting ECD: (1) responsive caregiving (2) cognitive stimulation and (3) parental mental health. Impacts on parental knowledge regarding ECD and parenting stress were also assessed. Methods PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL and Embase were searched. We included randomized controlled trials reporting effects of healthcare-based ECD interventions in LMICs on parent-directed outcomes in the first five years of life. Data extraction included study characteristics, design, sample size, participant characteristics, settings, intervention descriptions, and outcomes. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models. Results 8 articles were included. Summary standardized mean differences demonstrated significant benefits of healthcare-based interventions in LMICs for improving: (1) cognitive stimulation (n = 4; SMD = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.56) and (2) ECD knowledge (n = 4; SMD = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.60). No significant effects were seen on maternal depression and parenting stress; only one study assessed parent-child interactions in the context of responsiveness. Limitations included small number of studies for moderation analysis, high heterogeneity, variability in measures used for outcomes and timing of assessments. Conclusions for practice Our results demonstrate statistically significant effects of healthcare-based interventions in LMICs on improving key evidence-based parenting outcomes and offers one promising strategy to support children reach their full developmental potential.

AB  - Human adolescence is a period of development characterized by wide ranging emotions and behavioral risk taking, including binge drinking (Konrad et al., 2013). These behavioral manifestations of adolescence are complemented by growth in the neuroarchitecture of the brain, including synaptic pruning (Spear, 2013) and increases in overall white matter volume (Perrin et al., 2008). During this period of profound physiological maturation, the adolescent brain has a unique vulnerability to negative perturbations. Alcohol consumption and stress exposure, both of which are heightened during adolescence, can individually and synergistically alter these neurodevelopmental trajectories in positive and negative ways (conferring both resiliency and susceptibility) and influence already changing neurotransmitter systems and circuits. Importantly, the literature is rapidly changing and evolving in our understanding of basal sex differences in the brain, as well as the interaction between biological sex and life experiences. The animal literature provides the distinctive opportunity to explore sex-specific stress- and alcohol- induced changes in neurocircuits on a relatively rapid time scale. In addition, animal models allow for the investigation of individual neurons and signaling molecules otherwise inaccessible in the human brain. Here, we review the human and rodent literature with a focus on cortical development, neurotransmitters, peptides, and steroids, to characterize the field's current understanding of the interaction between adolescence, biological sex, and exposure to stress and alcohol.

A systematic literature search was performed for 33 identified tests routinely used in health care, using specific review databases as well as PsycInfo, Embase and Medline. The trained authors conducted an overall assessment of quality for each test which was then verified by the editors. A total of 12% of the tests were rated at Level 1 'Low level of quality', 61% at Level 2 'Some evidence of Quality', 15% at level 3 'Good level of Quality' and 12% at Level 4 'High level of quality'. This indicates that the evidence for the psychometric properties is insufficient for many tests used in the Nordic countries for this purpose

AB  - Some nursing homes for the elderly provide holistic care that integrates several interventions, including physical exercise. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the effects of physical exercise or multicomponent exercise programs on the mental health (wellbeing, anxiety and depression) and cognitive functions of older adults with/without dementia who live in a nursing home and do/do not require wheelchair assistance. To this end, PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science are using to identify clinical trials and randomized controlled studies conducted during the period January 2011 to December 2021 to examine the progression of research in this field over the past ten years. In total, 2597 articles are identifying and 21 are including in the systematic review. After selecting articles according to the PRISMA standards, the data extraction and methodological quality assessment of the eligible studies are performing individually by two reviewers and then pooled together. The synthesis of the studies shows that physical exercise or multicomponent exercise programs have a beneficial effect on mental health and cognitive functions. However, this effect is more common among older adults without dementia, compared to their counterparts who have dementia or use wheelchairs. The explanatory mechanisms, lack of benefits from physical exercise and the need to standardize methods are discussing in this regard. Finally, future studies must examine the effects of an innovative and adaptive physical activity program on the mental health and cognitive functions of older adults living in nursing homes.

AB  - Background: For the general population, the positive effects of paid employment on health and wellbeing are well established. However, less is known for people from refugee and asylum-seeking backgrounds. This review aims to systematically summarise the quantitative literature on the relationship between employment and health and wellbeing for refugees and asylum seekers.Method: A search strategy was conducted in online databases, including MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMCARE, SCOPUS, CINHAL, ProQuest and Web of Science. Articles were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies published in English between 2000 to October 2021 were included if they used quantitative methods to consider the relationship between employment and health for refugees and asylum seekers in resettlement countries. Study quality was assessed using The Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Tools. Findings were synthesised using a narrative approach. Results: Seventy-two papers were identified. The majority of papers (N = 58, 81%) examined the association between employment and mental health outcomes. Overall, while there were inconsistencies in the findings, employment had a positive effect on mental health particularly in reducing levels of psychological distress and depression. Though more limited in number, the papers examining physical health suggest that people who are employed tend to have better physical health than unemployed persons. There was some evidence to support the bi-directional relationship between employment and health. Poor mental and physical health negatively impacted the odds of employment and occupational status of refugees.Conclusion: Good quality employment is an essential component of refugee resettlement and this review found that in general employment is also beneficial for refugee health, particularly aspects of mental health. More research regarding the effects of employment on physical health is required. The effects of refugee-specific factors such as gender roles, torture, and trauma on the relationship between employment and health also require further investigation.

AB  - Objective To synthesize and critically evaluate evidence on the effectiveness of integrated psychological care models for children with complex chronic illness within pediatric hospital settings and provide recommendations for successful implementation. Design Six electronic databases (Medline, Cochrane, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL) were systematically searched for English language studies including families of children aged 0-17 years with complex chronic illness. Eligible studies reported on psychology or neuropsychology screening, assessment, intervention, or services provided within a pediatric hospital setting. Results Fifteen studies were identified for review; nine assessed a psychological service, five examined psychosocial screening, and one examined a neuropsychology service. Three studies demonstrated the effectiveness of integrated psychological services in improving child or parent physical, psychological, or behavioral health outcomes. Uptake of psychosocial screening was high (84-96%), but only 25-37% of children or families identified as 'at-risk' engaged with on-site psychology services. Integrated psychological services offering consultations at the same time and location as the child's medical visit reported the highest rates of uptake (77-100%). Conclusions The available evidence supports co-location of child medical and psychological services. A more consistent and comprehensive approach to the assessment of patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes and implementation effectiveness is recommended.

AB  - (Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have extremely harmful impacts on an individual's physical, social and mental health throughout their life-span. Recently, it has been reported that maternal ACEs increase the risk of developmental delay in the offspring across generations. This mini review focuses on the direct relationship between maternal ACEs and child developmental delay, and potential mediators/moderators that associate their relationship. Six studies were identified using three search engines. The results indicated that four out of six studies reported at least one significant direct association between maternal ACEs and child development. Additionally, maternal biological, psychological, and social factors were identified as mediators or moderators. In summary, we identified that maternal ACEs increased the risk of developmental delay in children via biological and psychosocial pathways. Future research should examine potential buffering factors and identify when it is crucial to break the intergenerational transmission.

AB  - Background: The mental health of medical students is an issue worthy of attention, especially during COVID-19. Many studies have shown that depression and anxiety are the main problems faced by medical students. To assess the pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students worldwide, we conducted this meta-analysis. Methods: According to PRISMA, we used a computerized strategy to search studies in EMBASE, PubMed, PsycArticles, Web of Science, and China Biology Medicine disc. The pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was calculated by a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analysis. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also carried out in this meta-analysis. Results: Of 1316 studies, 41 studies were selected based on 36608 medical students. The pooled depression prevalence was 37.9% (95% CI: 30.7-45.4%), and pooled anxiety prevalence was 33.7% (95% CI: 26.8-41.1%). The prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students varied by gender, country, and continent. Conclusion: The data reported that the prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students during COVID-19 was relatively higher than those of the general population and the healthcare workers. The impact of COVID-19 on medical students and how to protect the mental health of medical students are needed to determine through further research.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a scoping review to identify programs and interventions to support youth with mental health conditions (MHCs) with their transition to postsecondary institution (PSI). Method: A database search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, SocINDEX, ERIC, CINHAL, and Education Research Complete was undertaken. In this review, MHC was defined as a mental, behavioural, or emotional condition, or problematic substance use, and excluded neurodevelopmental or physical disorders. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted the data. Included studies are described and a risk-of-bias assessment was conducted on included studies. Results: Nine studies were included in this review, describing eight unique interventions. Sixty-two percent of interventions were nonspecific in the MHCs that they were addressing in postsecondary students. These interventions were designed to support students upon arrival to their PSIS. Peer mentorship, student engagement, goal setting, and interagency collaboration were some of the strategies employed. However, the overall quality and level of evidence in these studies was low and the effectiveness of these programs was not established. Conclusion: The volume of research identified was limited, no reliable nor policy informing conclusions can yet be made about the impact of these interventions as the evaluation methods, quality of the research methodologies, and the levels of evidence available were of low-quality. Future randomized control trials are required that are designed to target and improve transitions from secondary education to PSIS for those with MHCs.

AB  - Informal caregivers include family, friends, and significant others who provide important support for people who have attempted suicide or experienced suicidal ideation. Despite the prevalence of suicidal behaviour worldwide, they remain an understudied population. This review aimed to synthesise the literature on the experiences and support needs of informal caregivers of people who have attempted suicide or experienced suicidal ideation. We conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. Searches of peer-reviewed literature in Medline, Emcare, Embase, EBM Reviews, and PsycINFO identified 21 studies (4 quantitative and 17 qualitative), published between 1986 and 2021. Informal carers commonly reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, for which they receive little assistance. They also expressed a desire for more involvement and education in the professional care of suicidality. Together, the studies indicated a need to improve the way informal caregiving is managed in professional healthcare settings. This review identified potential avenues for future research, as well as broad areas which require attention in seeking to improve the care of suicidal people and their caregivers.

AB  - Women commonly suffer from depression during pregnancy. For reducing depression, yoga seems to be more suitable for pregnant women than other physical activities because of its low exercise intensity. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of prenatal yoga on the treatment of depression during pregnancy. Three electronic databases were searched for relevant articles from their inception to May 2021, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect. Pre- and post-test outcomes were adopted to estimate standardized mean difference with a 95% confidence interval for assessing the efficacy of yoga. Heterogeneity among articles was detected using I-2 value. A total of 13 articles that contained 379 subjects were included for meta-analysis. No significant improvement in depression scores after practicing yoga was observed for women without depression (p = 0.09) but significant improvement was observed for women with depression (p = 0.001). Although significant improvement in anxiety scores after yoga was observed for women without depression (p = 0.02), the results of the sensitivity analysis were not consistent, while significant improvement in anxiety scores after yoga was also observed for women with depression (p < 0.00001). The current evidence has suggested that yoga had significant improvement in depression and anxiety scores in pregnant women with depression. However, the level of evidence of this study was not high. More articles with high levels of evidence should be conducted to confirm our conclusion in the future.

AB  - Adolescent depression is a worldwide public health concern and has contributed to significant socioeconomic burden. Investigating the association between time spent on social media (TSSM) and depression may provide guidance toward the prevention and intervention of adolescent depression. However, related literature reported mixed findings in terms of the relationship between TSSM and depression in adolescents. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive dose-response meta-analysis to clarify this issue. We conducted a systematic title/abstract and topic search of the relative terms in Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO databases through 9 January 2022. Odd ratios (ORs) were used to examine the pooled effect size of the association between TSSM and risk of depression. Dose-response analysis was evaluated by a generalized least squares trend estimation. Twenty-one cross-sectional studies and five longitudinal studies including a total of 55,340 participants were included. Overall, more TSSM was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression symptoms (OR = 1.60, 95%CI: 1.45 to 1.75) with high heterogeneity (Q((29)) = 105.9, p < 0.001; I-2 = 72.6%). The association was stronger for adolescent girls (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.41 to 2.09) than boys (OR = 1.20, 95%CI: 1.05 to 1.37). Five studies with seven reports were included in dose-response analysis. There was a linear dose-response association of TSSM and risk of depression. The risk of depression increased by 13% (OR = 1.13, 95%CI: 1.09 to 1.17, p < 0.001) for each hour increase in social media use in adolescents. TSSM is associated with depression in a linear dose-response and gender-specific manner, which suggests the need for better monitoring of adolescent social media use. However, motivation, content, and engagement on and exposure to social media use may also be important contributing factors, making it necessary to interpret the current findings with caution. Therefore, further research is required to clarify not only the causal link between TSSM and depression by randomized control studies but also the influence of other factors, such as active vs. passive social media use or different types of engagement or environments in which social media is used.

AB  - The journey of graduate students through academia can be a difficult road plagued with several roadblocks due to several intersectional factors. These difficulties often impact the students' mental health with severe consequences on their well-being and personal and academic achievements. There is a critical need for researchers to conduct studies in response to the positive mental well-being for this group of trainees, considering their peculiar role in the scholarly environment. This study aimed to explore the scientific research on the health and well-being of graduate students; typify the scientific landscape and development trajectory, cooperation networks, and fundamental research areas; and identify areas of needed research in this field. A bibliometric analysis of articles indexed in Scopus and published in the past decade (2012 to 2021) was undertaken. The results revealed that the research on graduate students' mental health and well-being has increased over the years, significantly in the past two years, probably owing to the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns around remote learning. The highest number of publications was from the United Kingdom (U.K.) and United States (U.S.), while the organizational affiliations were mainly from universities. The most prominent source type of publications was journal articles. The result also shows a weak collaboration across countries and organizations. The study identifies other areas of useful research, collaboration, intervention strategies, and policy review.

AB  - Purpose This review aimed to evaluate interventions led by peer counselors (PCs) for adults with common mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) along indices of overall effectiveness and key implementation outcomes (acceptability, feasibility, cost, fidelity, sustainability). Methods This review followed a mixed-methods systematic review design. MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Global Health databases were searched for PC-led interventions for adults in LMICs targeting depressive and/or anxiety disorders or PTSD. Quantitative data was narratively synthesized, and qualitative data was thematically synthesized separately. The results from the qualitative and quantitative syntheses were then combined in a cross-study synthesis. Results Twenty-four papers describing thirteen PC-led interventions were included for review. Narrative synthesis results indicated mixed effectiveness of PC-led interventions in reducing depressive, anxiety, PTSD symptoms and high PC competency. Thematic synthesis revealed five descriptive themes: (1) Preferred PC characteristics; (2) Incentives and motivation for PCs; (3) Barriers to PC-led intervention implementation; (4) Helpful supervision/training practices; and (5) Overall high acceptability of PC-led interventions. Cross-study synthesis revealed high acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity, but cost and sustainability outcomes were underreported in included papers. Conclusion PC-led interventions seem to show initial promise in terms of effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, cost, fidelity, and sustainability. Future research should focus on standardizing measurements of implementation outcomes to facilitate cross-study analysis. Additional empirical attention should be paid to underrepresented implementation outcomes (e.g., cost, sustainability). Finally, researchers should adopt a participatory approach that elevates the perspectives of PCs throughout all stages of the implementation process.

AB  - Aims Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) different countries implemented quarantine measures to limit the spread of the virus. Many studies analysed the mental health consequences of restrictive confinement, some of which focused their attention on specific populations. The general public's mental health also requires significant attention, however. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 quarantine on the general population's mental health in different European countries. Risk and protective factors associated with the psychological symptoms were analysed. Methods A systematic search was conducted on four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus and Google Scholar). Studies published up until 20th April 2021, and following eligibility criteria were selected for this review. One thousand three hundred thirty-five (1335) studies were screened, 105 of which were included. Via network analysis, the current study investigated the pathways that underlie possible risk factors for mental health outcomes. Results Anxiety, depression, distress and post-traumatic symptoms are frequently experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine and are often associated with changes in sleeping and eating habits. Some socio-demographic and COVID-19-related variables were found to be risk factors for an individual's wellbeing. In particular, being female, young, having a low income, being unemployed and having COVID-19-like symptoms or chronic disorders, were found to be the most common risk factors for mental health symptoms. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic represented an unprecedented threat to mental health globally. In order to prevent psychological morbidity and offer support tailored to short-, medium- and long-term negative outcomes, it is essential to identify the direct and indirect psychosocial effects of the lockdown and quarantine measures, especially in certain vulnerable groups. In addition to measures to reduce the curve of viral transmission, policy makers should urgently take into consideration provisions to alleviate hazards to mental health.

AB  - Mental health screening and diagnostic apps can provide an opportunity to reduce strain on mental health services, improve patient well-being, and increase access for underrepresented groups. Despite promise of their acceptability, many mental health apps on the market suffer from high dropout due to a multitude of issues. Understanding user opinions of currently available mental health apps beyond star ratings can provide knowledge which can inform the development of future mental health apps. This study aimed to conduct a review of current apps which offer screening and/or aid diagnosis of mental health conditions on the Apple app store (iOS), Google Play app store (Android), and using the m-health Index and Navigation Database (MIND). In addition, the study aimed to evaluate user experiences of the apps, identify common app features and determine which features are associated with app use discontinuation. The Apple app store, Google Play app store, and MIND were searched. User reviews and associated metadata were then extracted to perform a sentiment and thematic analysis. The final sample included 92 apps. 45.65% (n = 42) of these apps only screened for or diagnosed a single mental health condition and the most commonly assessed mental health condition was depression (38.04%, n = 35). 73.91% (n = 68) of the apps offered additional in-app features to the mental health assessment (e.g., mood tracking). The average user rating for the included apps was 3.70 (SD = 1.63) and just under two-thirds had a rating of four stars or above (65.09%, n = 442). Sentiment analysis revealed that 65.24%, n = 441 of the reviews had a positive sentiment. Ten themes were identified in the thematic analysis, with the most frequently occurring being performance (41.32%, n = 231) and functionality (39.18%, n = 219). In reviews which commented on app use discontinuation, functionality and accessibility in combination were the most frequent barriers to sustained app use (25.33%, n = 19). Despite the majority of user reviews demonstrating a positive sentiment, there are several areas of improvement to be addressed. User reviews can reveal ways to increase performance and functionality. App user reviews are a valuable resource for the development and future improvements of apps designed for mental health diagnosis and screening.

AB  - Background: Effective antibullying interventions may reduce the impact of bullying on young people's mental health. Nevertheless, little is known about their effectiveness in reducing internalizing symptoms such as anxiety or depression, and what factors may influence intervention effects. The aim of this systematic review, meta-analysis, and metaregression is to assess the effects of school-based antibullying interventions on children's and adolescent's internalizing symptoms. The secondary aims are to explore potential moderators, intervention components, and reductions in bullying as mediators of intervention effects on internalizing symptoms. Methods: We searched nine databases: PsycINFO, Web of Science, ERIC, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Medline, Embase, ProQuest, and Cochrane Library, and performed an author search of included studies in English from January 1983 to April 2021. We included studies that evaluated school-based antibullying interventions using controlled designs and reporting on both bullying and internalizing outcomes. Random-effects and metaregression models were used to derive Hedges g values with pooled 95% CIs as estimates of effect size and to test associations between moderator variables and effect size estimates. Path analysis was used to test potential mediation using effect size measures of victimization, perpetration, and internalizing outcomes. Quality and risk of bias were assessed using Cochrane collaboration tools. Results: This review included 22 studies with 58,091 participants in the meta-analysis. Antibullying interventions had a very small effect in reducing overall internalizing symptoms (ES, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.0284 to 0.1005), anxiety (ES, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.011 to 0.158), and depression (ES, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.107) at postintervention. The reduction in internalizing symptoms did not vary significantly across geographic location, grade level, program duration, and intensity. The intervention component 'working with peers' was associated with a significant reduction, and 'using CBT techniques' was associated with a significant increase in internalizing outcomes. Bullying victimization and perpetration did not mediate the relationship between intervention condition and internalizing outcomes. Conclusions: Antibullying interventions have a small impact on reducing internalizing symptoms. Ongoing development of antibullying interventions should address how best to maximize their impact on internalizing symptoms to safeguard young people from the damaging mental health outcomes of bullying.

AB  - Tobacco dependence remains one of the major preventable causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are well over 8,000 compounds present in tobacco and tobacco smoke, but we do not know what effect, if any, many of them have on smokers. Major interest has been on nicotine, as well as on toxic and carcinogenic effects and several major and minor components of tobacco smoke responsible for the negative health effects of smoking have been elucidated. Smokers themselves report a variety of positive effects from smoking, including effects on depression, anxiety and mental acuity. Smoking has also been shown to have protective effects in Parkinson's Disease. Are the subjective reports of a positive effect of smoking due to nicotine, of some other components of tobacco smoke, or are they a manifestation of the relief from nicotine withdrawal symptoms that smoking provides? This mini-review summarises what is currently known about the components of tobacco smoke with potential to have positive effects on smokers.

AB  - In the field of language-education psychology, the psychology of educators was not at the center of attention to some extent, despite the immense attention given to the psychology of students. Recently, positive psychology has become very important as it puts more emphasis on the constructive dimensions of life and it regards individual well-being as a major problem for individuals' achievement. Since the core of an instructing institution is the educators, their well-being must be prioritized in the academic circumstances to both improve students' skills and to motivate and inspire participation and involvement in the class. Moreover, teacher engagement is viewed as another significant factor in this realm that refers to people's outlook toward their job, impacting their emotional attendance and engagement during their presentation. Also, there is an inner force that pushes educators to put more time and strength in maintaining participation in the school that is called educator commitment that is determined on evolving the school builds an emotive connection between educators and schools. It eventually encourages educators to improve their instructing careers and find ways to create a successful educational setting that would enable learners to attain their goals. In addition, teacher self-efficacy, including educators' convictions in their skill to successfully manage assignments, responsibilities, and difficulties associated with their expert activity, has an important function in affecting key scholastic results in the career setting. By taking the aforementioned constructs, this review of literature provides implications for academics, teachers, and policymakers in search of better considering the functions of commitment and self-efficacy on their work engagement and well-being.

AB  - Emotional intelligence is an emerging field since the 1990s due to its important outcomes for employees. This study is a psychometric meta-analysis examining the links between emotional intelligence and organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, job satisfaction, job performance, and job stress of employees. In this meta-analysis, carefully selected studies on emotional intelligence since the origin of the concept in 1990 were included along with studies examining its outcomes. For this analysis, three streams of emotional intelligence, consistent with previous meta-analyses, were considered: ability, self-report, and mixed emotional intelligence. This meta-analysis is an attempt to add to the literature by analyzing the relationships between emotional intelligence and selected employee outcomes over a period of time beginning in 1990. The three streams of emotional intelligence were separately analyzed to examine their relationship with employee outcomes. These outcomes were included in the study based on select research studies. Our study results showed that emotional intelligence and its three streams were positively related to organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, job satisfaction, and job performance and negatively related to job stress.

AB  - Background Perinatal depression (PND) is a prevalent ailment that affects both the woman and her family. Addressing PND in primary health care, such as pediatrics and obstetric care settings, has been proposed as an effective way to identify and treat women. Objective The purpose of this study is to examine best practices for management of PND in obstetric and pediatric settings, as well as investigate the evidence that supports the guidelines. Methods Guidelines were identified through a literature search and discussion with experts in the field of perinatal depression, while evidence was examined through a literature search of reviews and thereafter experimental studies. Results Twenty-five guidelines, across 17 organizations were retained for analysis. Findings suggest that there is little or varied guidance on the management of PND, as well as a lack of specificity. Treatment was the topic most frequently reported, followed by screening. However best practices vary greatly and often contradict one another. Across all areas, there is inadequate or contrasting evidence to support these guidelines. Conclusions Although there was consensus on the key steps in the pathway to care, the review revealed lack of consensus across guidelines on specific issues relating to identification and management of depression during the perinatal period. Clinicians may use these recommendations to guide their practice, but they should be aware of the limitations of the evidence supporting these guidelines and remain alert to new evidence. There is a clear need for researchers and policymakers to prioritize this area in order to develop evidence-based guidelines for managing perinatal depression.

AB  - Background The Fear of Childbirth (FOC) is regarded as a general problem, which affects women's health and well-being, justifying demanding caesarean section. Several primary studies have been performed in relation to the interventions performed to reduce the fear of childbirth, which show contradictions between the results of these studies. Objective This review aims to provide a comprehensive review of the different types of interventions used to reduce the fear of childbirth in pregnant mothers. Methods In this study, systematic review of study information related to the effect of different therapies on reducing the fear of childbirth using subject-related keywords and validated with MeSH in SID, MagIran, IranMedex, IranDoc, Embase, ProQuest, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) databases and Google Scholar Search Engine were extracted without any time limit until February 2021. Results After removing duplicates and irrelevant works from among the 5396 articles found, 63 articles remained in the study. The participants in these 63 articles were 5415 cases and 5770 controls. In addition, three studies were on epidural anesthesia, 33 on the effects of psychotherapy, 19 on the effects of education, and eight on the influence of other interventions on alleviating FOC. As shown by the results, psychotherapy intervention and education decreased FOC significantly. Conclusion According to the results of this study, to prevent the fear of childbirth, pregnancy training and prenatal preparation courses are recommended to empower pregnant women. It also seems beneficial to use psychotherapy approaches for women who are afraid of childbirth.

AB  - BACKGROUND Psychiatric disorders are common but underdiagnosed in cancer survivors. Research suggests that tumor type has an effect on the prevalence of clinically relevant depression, anxiety, comorbid anxiety-depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). AIM To identify studies that examined the prevalence of clinically relevant levels of depression, anxiety, comorbid anxiety-depression and PTSD for patients with one or more tumor sites and compare those prevalences between cancer subtypes. METHODS Four databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, PubPsych and the Cochrane Database) were searched and resulted in a total of 2387 articles to be screened. To be included, a study must have investigated cancer-free and posttreatment survivors using tools to assess clinically relevant levels of the listed psychiatric comorbidities. All articles were screened by two authors with a third author reviewing debated articles. RESULTS Twenty-six studies on ten different tumor types fulfilled all inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The studies showed heterogeneity regarding the study characteristics, number of participants, time since diagnosis, and assessment tools. Generally, all four comorbidities show higher prevalences in cancer survivors than the general population. Brain tumor survivors were reported to have a relatively high prevalence of both depression and anxiety. Studies with melanoma survivors reported high prevalences of all four psychiatric comorbidities. Regarding comorbidities, a wide range in prevalence existed across the tumor types. Within one cancer site, the prevalence also varied considerably among the studies. CONCLUSION Psychiatric comorbidities are more frequent in cancer survivors than in the general population, as reflected by the prevalence of depression, anxiety, comorbid anxiety-depression and PTSD across all tumor subtypes. Developing generalized screening tools that examine psychological distress in cancer survivors up to at least ten years after diagnosis could help to understand and address the psychological burden of cancer survivors.

AB  - Aims There is a lack of evidence related to the prevalence of mental health symptoms as well as their heterogeneities during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Latin America, a large area spanning the equator. The current study aims to provide meta-analytical evidence on mental health symptoms during COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers, general healthcare workers, the general population and university students in Latin America. Methods Bibliographical databases, such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and medRxiv, were systematically searched to identify pertinent studies up to August 13, 2021. Two coders performed the screening using predefined eligibility criteria. Studies were assigned quality scores using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The double data extraction method was used to minimise data entry errors. Results A total of 62 studies with 196 950 participants in Latin America were identified. The pooled prevalence of anxiety, depression, distress and insomnia was 35%, 35%, 32% and 35%, respectively. There was a higher prevalence of mental health symptoms in South America compared to Central America (36% v. 28%, p < 0.001), in countries speaking Portuguese (40%) v. Spanish (30%). The pooled prevalence of mental health symptoms in the general population, general healthcare workers, frontline healthcare workers and students in Latin America was 37%, 34%, 33% and 45%, respectively. Conclusions The high yet heterogenous level of prevalence of mental health symptoms emphasises the need for appropriate identification of psychological interventions in Latin America.

AB  - From a neurobiological perspective, diverse studies have associated emotional regulation with cognitive deficits. Structural and/or metabolic changes in the frontal cortex are often inferred from dysfunction in cognitive-emotional processing. In addition, electroencephalographic findings support the idea that alpha band oscillations are responses to these same processes. Thus, the objective of this meta-analytical literature review is to verify whether the possible hemispheric lateralization attributed to frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) correlates with emotional regulation and the cognitive deficits underlying depression. The data included in our meta-analysis are from articles published from 2009 to July 2020, which utilized DSM or ICD criteria to diagnose depression or anxiety disorders and included a control group. For statistical analysis, the measurements obtained through the 10-20 electroencephalography system were used. The frontal alpha asymmetry index was calculated from the difference between the logarithm of the absolute spectral values in the alpha rhythm observed from the F4 and F3 electrodes that were fixed to the scalp of the frontal region of the right and left hemispheres (ln mu V-2 RH-ln mu V-2 LH) = (F4-F3). Eighteen articles were included in the systematic review. Of these, 9 were homogeneous enough for statistical analyses (total N: 1061; N-Dep: 326; N-cont: 735). Nine others could not be statistically analyzed due to the absence of FAA measurements from the F4 and F3 electrodes. A random effects meta-analysis revealed low heterogeneity (Qt = 11,00, df = 8, p = 0.20, I-2 = 27%) and an average effect size of the studies equal to -0.03 (CI = [-0.07 to 0.01]). The results, although not significant, suggested a slight tendency toward left lateralization in the depression group. Although the effects shown in these data did not confirm hemispherical lateralization in depressed patients, it was found that emotional regulation and cognitive processes share similar neural circuits. Therefore, future research on this complex relationship is encouraged, especially studies that are focused on the search for quantitative biological markers in depression.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that individuals with a history of childhood adversity are at greater risk for developing depression. Potential psychological mechanisms have not been well-established. Our study aims to identify psychological variables consistently mediating/moderating the link between childhood adversity to depression. We systematically searched articles from 1990 to October 2021 on online databases including PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO. Studies that examined a mediating/moderating role of psychological variables between childhood adversities and depression were included. Totally, 33 records were included. The review identified maladaptive schema, negative automatic thoughts, and avoidance as mediators of the relationship between childhood adversity and depression. Additionally, resilience was identified as both a mediator and moderator of the association between childhood adversity and depression. In general, cognitive dysfunction, avoidance behaviors and impaired resilience may be a by-product of childhood adversity and may contribute to increased risk for depression. Interventions that target at challenging negative cognition and improving resilience may be effective to prevent or treat depression in individuals with a history of childhood adversity.

AB  - Introduction: The stressful pre-operative period exerts a profound impact on psychological, physiological and immunological outcomes. Oncological surgeries, in particular, elicit significantly higher stress responses than most other surgeries. Managing these responses through psychological interventions may improve long-term outcomes. The purpose of the current research was to review studies that have explored pre-operative psychological interventions in cancer patients in order to map the types of current interventions and provide an initial assessment of whether these interventions improved psychological, physiological, and/or immunological indices as well as long-term cancer outcomes.
   Methods: A systematic literature search for studies that included pre-operative psychological interventions in oncology patients was conducted, using the databases PubMed and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria included studies pertaining to oncological surgery in adults, study designs that included a clearly defined pre-operative psychological intervention and control group.
   Results: We found 44 studies, each using one of the following interventions: psychoeducation, cognitive interventions, relaxation techniques, integrated approaches. All the studies reported improved immediate post-operative psychological, physiological, and/or immunological outcomes. Only a few studies addressed long-term cancer outcomes, and only one reported improved survival.
   Conclusions; Research on pre-operative interventions with cancer patients is missing systematic methods. Studies provide varying results, which makes it difficult to compare them and reach reliable conclusions. There is considerable heterogeneity in the literature regarding the specific intervention used, the timing of intervention, the characteristics of the patients studied and the outcome measures. In order to improve research in this field, including the measurement of long-term outcomes, we suggest some steps that should be taken in further research.

AB  - Background Lifestyle interventions for severe mental illness (SMI) are known to have small to modest effect on physical health outcomes. Little attention has been given to patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Aim To systematically review the use of PROs and their measures, and quantify the effects of lifestyle interventions in patients with SMI on these PROs. Methods Five electronic databases were searched (PubMed/Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science) from inception until 12 November 2020 (PROSPERO: CRD42020212135). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of lifestyle interventions focusing on healthy diet, physical activity, or both for patients with SMI were included. Outcomes of interest were PROs. Results A total of 11.267 unique records were identified from the database search, 66 full-text articles were assessed, and 36 RCTs were included, of which 21 were suitable for meta-analyses. In total, 5.907 participants were included across studies. Lifestyle interventions had no significant effect on quality of life (g = 0.13; 95% CI = - 0.02 to 0.27), with high heterogeneity (I-2 = 68.7%). We found a small effect on depression severity (g = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.00 to 0.58, I-2 = 65.2%) and a moderate effect on anxiety severity (g = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.95, I-2 = 0%). Discussion This meta-analysis quantifies the effects of lifestyle interventions on PROs. Lifestyle interventions have no significant effect on quality of life, yet they could improve mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety symptoms. Further use of patient-reported outcome measures in lifestyle research is recommended to fully capture the impact of lifestyle interventions.

AB  - Vulnerability of small-scale fisheries (SSF) results from complex interactions amongst various threats and stressors, including biophysical risks, environmental variability, unstable political situations, and weak governance, to name a few. SSF vulnerability has become more evident, with increased severity, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge about what makes SSF vulnerable is limited, which impedes appropriate policy responses and intervention. As a first step to rectifying the situation, a classification approach is proposed to better describe and differentiate types of vulnerability to SSF and to guide data collection and dissemination about SSF vulnerability. The classification system is developed based on a narrative review of case studies worldwide, published in scientific journals in the past 20 years. The case studies cover SSF in diverse aquatic environments, including river, floodplain, reservoir, river delta, lake, atoll, estuaries, lagoon mangrove, coral reefs, seagrass ecosystem, islands, coastal and marine environment. Similar to the five pillars of sustainability, SSF vulnerability is associated with five main factors, i.e., biophysical, social, economic, technological, and governance. Knowledge about SSF vulnerability helps inform tailored management strategies and policies to reduce SSF marginalization and promote viability, aligning, therefore, with the goal of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries.

AB  - Public concern over environmental issues such as ecosystem degradation is high. However, restoring coupled human -natural systems requires integration across many science, technology, engineering, management, and governance topics that are presently fragmented. Here, we synthesized 544 peer-reviewed articles published through September 2020 on the desiccation and nascent recovery of Lake Urmia in northwest Iran. We answered nine questions of scien-tific and popular interest about causes, impacts, stabilization, recovery, and next steps. We find: (1) Expansion of irri-gated agriculture, dam construction, and mismanagement impacted the lake more than temperature increases and precipitation decreases. (2) Aerosols from Lake Urmia's exposed lakebed are negatively impacting human health. (3) Researchers disagree on how a new causeway breach will impact salinity, evaporation, and ecosystems in the lake's north and south arms. (4) Most researchers tried to restore to a single, uniform, government specified lake level of 1274.1 m intended to recover Artemia. (5) The Iranian government motivated and funded a large and growing body of lake research. (6) Ecological and limnological studies mostly focused on salinity, Artemia, and Flamingos. (7) Few studies shared data, and only three studies reported engagement with stakeholders or managers. (8) Researchers fo- cused on an integration pathway of climate downscaling, reservoirs, agricultural water releases, and lake level. (9) Nu- merous suggestions to improve farmer livelihoods and governance require implementation. We see an overarching next step for lake recovery is to couple human and natural system components. Examples include: (a) describe and monitor the system food webs, hydrologic, and human components; (b) adapt management to monitored conditions such as lake level, lake evaporation, lake salinity, and migratory bird populations; (c) improve livelihoods for poor, chronically stressed farmers beyond agriculture; (d) manage for diverse ecosystem services and lake levels; (e) engage all segments of society; (f) integrate across restoration topics while building capacity to share data, models, and code; and (g) cultivate longer-term two-way exchanges and public support. These restoration steps apply in differ- ent degrees to other Iranian ecosystems and lakes worldwide.

AB  - Background: The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic negatively impacts mental health. Some published studies have investigated the prevalence of depression among children and adolescents in China during the pandemic. However, the results vary widely. We aimed to systematically analyze and estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and attempted to reveal the reasons for prevalence variety in previous studies.& nbsp;Methods: Published studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP Database), China National Knowledge database (CNKI), and the WanFang database from December 2019 to May 2021. The quality of all included studies was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist and the American Agency for Health Care Quality and Research's (AHRQ) cross-sectional study quality evaluation items. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modeling.& nbsp;Results: Of the 1,708 references screened, 13 related reports that involve 41,729 participants were included. The results suggested that the pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic was 28.6%. Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled prevalence was highest among the studies using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 (46.8%) and lowest among these using Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC) (11.4%). All studies using PHQ-9 set the cutoff at 5 points instead of 10. The pooled prevalence of studies that include primary school students was lower (16.5%) than that of studies excluding primary school students (39.1%).& nbsp;Conclusion: The meta-analysis suggests that depressive symptoms were relatively prevalent among Chinese children and adolescents during COVID-19, especially among the secondary school students. The suitable screening tools and cutoff should be carefully chosen in the survey.

AB  - Aim Identifying predictors for future onset of depression is crucial to effectively developing preventive interventions. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify risk factors for first-onset depression among adolescents and young people. Methods We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO, Cochrane Database, Web of Science, Lilacs, African Journals Online and Global Health (July 2009 to December 2020) for longitudinal studies assessing risk factors for first-onset depression among adolescents and young people aged 10-25 years. Meta-analyses generated summary odds ratio (OR) estimates. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42018103973. Results Nineteen studies representing 21 unique populations were included in the meta-analysis. Among studies reporting race/ethnicity, 79% of participants were of White/European descent. Seventeen studies were from high-income countries, with only two from an upper-middle-income country (China). Odds for first-onset depression were significantly greater for girls compared to boys (n = 13; OR = 1.78 [1.78, 2.28], p < 0.001) and for youth with other mental health problems at baseline (n = 4; OR = 3.20 [1.95, 5.23], p < 0.001). There were non-significant associations for negative family environment (n = 8; OR = 1.60 [0.82, 3.10], p = 0.16) and parental depression (n = 3; OR = 2.30 [0.73, 7.24], p = 0.16). Conclusions Most longitudinal studies do not report risk factors specifically for first-onset depression. Moreover, predictive data are limited to predominantly White populations in high-income countries. Future research must be more ethnically and geographically representative. Recommendations are provided for consistent and comprehensive reporting of study designs and analyses of risk factors for first-onset depression.

AB  - The rising prevalence of depression among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients has triggered an alarming situation, and further actions need to be taken by health care professionals and policymakers to curb the issue. There is a lack of evidence review in terms of the biopsychosocial and nutritional factors that are related to depression among T2DM. Hence, this review aimed to identify available evidence on the biopsychosocial and nutritional factors associated with depression among T2DM patients based on the existing literature. Articles were systematically searched from four databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCOHost. The approach for the identification of the final articles followed PRISMA guidelines. The selected full-text articles were published between 2017 and 2021 in the English language, and included studies focused on depression among T2DM patients. Using AXIS tools, the eligible articles were evaluated to assess the quality of studies. A total of 19 studies were included in the review, and information related to research questions and associated factors was extracted. Biological, psychological, social, and nutritional factors were shown to be linked with depression among T2DM patients. Future studies need to considered using the biopsychosocial model and incorporating nutritional factors to manage the issues of depression among T2DM patients.

AB  - A context-specific delineation of research approaches to resilience in the perinatal and early motherhood literature is currently lacking. A principle-based concept analysis was used to establish a description of how women's resilience is currently conceptualised and operationalised within empirical research in the perinatal period and early motherhood (defined as up to five-years postpartum). CINAHL, Medline, PsychInfo, EMBASE, ASSIA, Web of Science, Scielo, Maternity and Infant Care, the Cochrane Library, and the World Health Organization were systematically searched (January/February 2020 and March 2022). Fifty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Analysis demonstrated interchangeable use of associated concepts such as 'coping', 'coping strategies', and 'adaptation'. Resilience was frequently operationalised as the absence of illness symptomatology, rather than the presence of mental well-being. Investigations of positive areas of functioning were predominately related to the mother's family role. There was limited qualitative exploration of women's perspectives. Recommendations for the pragmatic application of resilience research were not well developed. The narrow operationalisation of resilience by mental ill-health and parental role, and the distinct absence of women's perspectives, restricts the logical maturity and pragmatic application of the concept. Future research may benefit from exploration of women's insights on indicators that might best reflect positive functioning and resilience in this period.

AB  - Simple Summary Cancer patients need to overcome several issues, leaving them more vulnerable to depressive symptoms. Exercise is recognised as a practice that helps to deal with depressive symptoms. This study is an umbrella review of meta-analyses about the effect of exercise on depressive symptoms among cancer patients. Six studies were included. A significant reduction in depressive symptoms was observed because of exercise. However, the studies varied in methodological terms, making a broad generalisation difficult. We can conclude that exercise is a good alternative to deal with depressive symptoms among cancer patients. Still, more studies are needed to clarify some aspects that are not answered yet. Background: Cancer patients must deal with several health challenges, including emotional distress and depressive symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate evidence from published systematic reviews and meta-analyses about the efficacy of exercise on depressive symptoms in cancer patients. Methods: We searched for previous meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, with data inception to 30 December 2021. Two independent researchers assessed the methodological quality using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR2) instrument. Six meta-analyses were integrated. All included middle-aged and older adults. Five presented moderate quality, and one presented low quality. Results: Overall, a significant reduction in depressive symptoms was observed among the included studies. However, the heterogeneity between studies was high, and high-quality evidence for the efficacy of exercise on depressive symptoms was limited. Conclusions: Exercise could be a possibility in the treatment of depressive symptoms in cancer patients, especially when supervised and outside the home. The better dose of exercise needs to be clarified. More high-quality evidence is needed to better prescribe exercise to this vulnerable population.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review aimed to summarise the effects of cognitive-behavioural therapy on psychological, physical and social outcomes of children with cancer without limitations on publication date. Methods: Thirteen English and seven Chinese electronic databases were searched from April to June 2021. Randomised control trials, quasi-experimental studies, pre-test post-test studies with a control group, factorial or cross-over designs that included children <= 18 years old and during various stages of the cancer trajectory, who have received cognitive-behavioural therapy, and reported (anxiety, depression, stress, quality of life, self efficacy, fatigue, pain, behavioural distress, anger, and/or academic performance) were included. Results: Eight studies with quality of evidence ranging from low to high risk of bias were included. The results show cognitive-behavioural therapy has favourable effects on anxiety, depression, pain and behavioural distress. The meta-analysis also show that it reduces anxiety (SMD =-0.89, 95% CI (-1.45,-0.32), p < 0.002), depression (SMD =-0.90, 95% CI (-1.40, 0.39), p < 0.0005), and pain (SMD =-0.56, 95% CI (-1.04,-0.08), p < 0.002). It also has a favourable effect on stress, anger and self-efficacy, though the results are drawn from a single study. Conclusion: Cognitive-behavioural therapy has the potential to reduce anxiety, depression and pain for children with cancer. It also shows promise in reducing behavioural distress. Although effects on stress, anger, and self efficacy have been found to be significant, there have been limited studies on these aspects of functioning and more research is needed. The findings are drawn from heterogeneous participants and interventions, thus emphasising the need to conduct well-designed intervention studies, including cancer survivors.

AB  - Objective: The current review aims to (1) investigate the effectiveness of Internet-based psychological intervention in reducing depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms and fear of childbirth among pregnant women at post-intervention and follow-up; (2) compare the effects of the intervention using different psychological principles; and (3) explore potential covariates on the intervention effect.& nbsp;Methods: A literature search of seven databases was carried out to identify published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English without any time limitation up to February 2021. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. This review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021235565).& nbsp;Results: Sixteen RCTs involving 3894 pregnant women were included from more than 23 countries. Internet-delivered psychological interventions were found to significantly (p < 0.05) reduce depressive (g =-0.16 to-0.32) and anxiety (g =-0.22 to-0.33) symptoms with small effect sizes at post-intervention and follow-up during 6 to 8 weeks postpartum compared with those in the comparator group. However, there was insufficient evidence for fear of childbirth and stress symptoms. Our subgroup analyses found that psychological interventions adopting component of cognitive behavioral therapy (g =-0.29) or mindfulness therapy (g =-0.62) showed beneficial effects to improve depressive symptoms among pregnant women. Univariate random-effect regression analyses showed that the attrition rate was a significant covariate (Z =-2.33, p = 0.02) on depressive symptoms. The certainty of main outcomes was graded from low to very low in accordance with the GRADE criteria.& nbsp;Conclusions: Our reviews suggested that Internet-delivered psychological intervention may complement usual antenatal care in the improvement of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Future trials involving a large-scale sample are needed to improve the methodological quality.

AB  - Objective During the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, general medical complications have received the most attention, and few studies have examined the association between the COVID-19 lockdown and eating disorders (ED). This study aimed to investigate the impact of the coronavirus lockdowns on ED symptoms severity and summarize factors associated with lockdowns that led to changes in eating disorders. Method PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies measuring the impact of coronavirus lockdowns on ED symptoms. Results A total of 132 studies were retrieved, after abstract screening and removal of duplicates, 21 papers were full-text screened, and 11 eligible papers were identified. Factors associated with symptomatic deterioration in ED patients during COVID-19 lockdowns included disruption of lifestyle routine, social isolation, reduced access to usual support networks, limited or no access to healthcare and mental care services, and social anxiety. Discussion Overall, the pandemic lockdowns were associated with worsening of eating disorders. This triggering environment can lead to increased anxiety and depression symptoms, change in dietary habits, and eventually result in worsening eating disorder symptoms.

AB  - Objective The purpose of the study is to present a comprehensive systematic review of the effects of park-based interventions on health outcomes among youth, defined as children and adolescents. Data Source Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases searched through November 2020. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Interventions conducted in publicly accessible parks that evaluated health outcomes (i.e., physical, mental, and emotional); focused on children and adolescents (up to 18 years old, or up to 22 years old for individuals with developmental needs); and was published in English, Spanish, and Chinese. Data Extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of the 15 included studies using the Guide to Community Preventive Services tool. Data Synthesis Descriptive summary of study characteristics and summarized methodological quality of the studies. Results Twelve studies were person-based interventions involving the evaluation of health outcome changes in cohorts, and the remaining studies were park-based, focused on changing the park environment and observing changes in youth participation in parks. All identified interventions were positively associated with individual-level and park-level outcomes ranging from body weight, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity, park utilization, and health behavior knowledge. Conclusions This systematic review demonstrated that parks as sites of interventions can provide an environment that promotes health and wellbeing for youth. Nevertheless, the number of relevant studies were limited, thus it is important to leverage and expand on existing knowledge of the utility of parks as sites of intervention to address health concerns at this critical juncture of the life course.

AB  - Background Self-harm is a significant public health concern during adolescence. Most cases of self-harm do not come to the attention of professional services, however, where adolescents do disclose self-harm, the majority confide in their friends. Objective Therefore, more needs to be understood about the protective function and risks friends may pose in the context of self-harm and personal implications of this behaviour. This review synthesises current research in this area. Methods A systematic search of five healthcare databases was conducted, yielding nine papers, comprising of ten studies. Most studies recruited participants from schools. Papers were appraised using three quality appraisal tools relevant to study designs. Results The synthesis found that friends act as first-line support for adolescents who self-harm, demonstrating emotional and physical availability and acting as a vehicle for terminating this behaviour and disclosure to adults. However, supporting friends who self-harm can be all-consuming, negative peer dynamics may perpetuate self-harm and group and personal vulnerability factors may increase risk of friends engaging in self-harm themselves. Conclusions: There are some indications that adolescents who self-harm may self-select friendship groups in which this behaviour is known to occur. The synthesis suggests adolescents need to be empowered to support peers who self-harm through mental health promotion and awareness-raising training at universal levels (e.g., whole school approaches). Leads for mental health in schools may also be important contact points for adolescents to disclose concerns to and seek personal support. Further practice and research implications are considered.

AB  - Suicide is a leading cause of maternal death during pregnancy and up to a year after birth (perinatal period). Many psychological and psychosocial risk factors for maternal suicidal ideation and behaviour have been investigated. Despite this, there have been no attempts to systematically search the literature on these risk factors. Additionally, few studies have described how the risk factors for suicidal ideation, attempted suicides and suicide deaths differ, which is essential for the development of tools to detect and target suicidal ideation and behaviour. Seven databases were searched up to June 2021 for studies that investigated the association between suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behaviour and psychological/psychosocial risk factors in pregnant and postpartum women. The search identified 17,338 records, of which 59 were included. These 59 studies sampled a total of 49,929 participants and investigated 32 different risk factors. Associations between abuse, experienced recently or during childhood, and maternal suicide ideation, attempted suicide and death were consistently reported. Social support was found to be less associated with suicide ideation but more so with suicide attempts. Identifying women who have experienced domestic violence or childhood abuse and ensuring all women have adequate emotional and practical support during the perinatal period may help to reduce the likelihood of suicidal behaviour.

AB  - Emotionalism can develop following a range of neurological disorders; however the aetiology of emotionalism is still unclear. To identify anatomical, neuropsychological and psychological predictors and correlates of emotionalism across neurological disorders: stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To explore if these predictors and correlates of emotionalism differ across neurological disorders. A comprehensive systematic search was completed of four databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO and EMBASE. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies and each study was graded according to the level of evidence using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Fifty papers (participants N = 1922) were included. 25 studies were rated as "Fair," 21 "Good" and 4 "Poor." The review identified predictors and correlates found in several neurological disorder such as bulbar networks, serotonergic pathways, genetics and female gender. Multiple studies across diseases (stroke, MS, ALS) indicate emotionalism is associated with cognitive impairment, especially frontal deficits. Due to the disproportionate number of studies identified across neurological disorders, it is difficult to draw definitive answers. Further research is required across neurological disorders to explore similarities and differences in anatomical, neuropsychological and psychological predictors and correlates.

AB  - Introduction: Displaced people are prone to develop mental health problems due to resettlement in new environments, traumatic events and forced migration. Depression is a mental health problem repeatedly observed among displaced people such as refugees, migrants, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Therefore, estimating the global pooled prevalence of depression as well as pinpointing its determinants may support policymakers and health care workers to mitigate the disease burden and improve the psychological well-being of displaced people. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHIL, Psych-INFO, and SCOPUS databases were searched for English written relevant observational studies conducted between 1984 and 2020. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Heterogeneity across studies was checked using the Q- and I2 test. Publication bias was checked by observing Funnel plot symmetry and using Egger's regression test. STATA 16 was used to combine studies using a random effect model. Results: Of the 4102 studies identified, 81 studies with an overall sample size of 53,458 were included in the current systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence estimate of depression among displaced people was 26.4% (95% CI; 22.2-31.1). Also, three in five IDPs, one in three refugees and asylum seekers and one in four migrants suffer from depression globally. Being female migrant [AOR: 2.46 95% CI: 1.79-3.13, I2=34.5%), non-partnered marital status [AOR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.29-3.30, I2= 0.00%], and perceived low social support [AOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.00-2.52, I2=34.6%] were significant determinants of depression among displaced people. Conclusion: Overall, around 1 in 4 displaced people suffer from depression and exceed the prevalence of depression reported by community samples in different nations and demonstrate a need for culturally fitting and targeted responses from migrant/refugee host nations and their serving clinicians.

AB  - ObjectiveMaternal mental health disorders are a leading complication of childbirth. While few systems are adequately able to identify and treat depression, people experiencing perinatal depression may benefit from the intervention of home visiting. The intent of home visiting interventions is to alleviate stressors of parenthood for people facing additional risk factors. The aim of this scoping review is to investigate the effect of home visiting on perinatal depression grounded in published studies. MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of the existing literature of studies relevant to perinatal depression and home visiting. We entered keywords in five search databases: MEDLINE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Social Work Abstracts, and Google Scholar. All relevant literature published between January 1999-December 2019 was reviewed. Duplicates, books, and errata were excluded from the study. As a scoping review, we included all studies published in English describing the inclusion of maternal depression in home visits. We hypothesize birthing people with perinatal depression will benefit from home visiting interventions. ResultsThe results from the scoping review and describe the use of home visiting to improve perinatal mental health. An initial 12,652 records were identified in the search. After duplicates were removed, the titles of 2,140 articles were assessed for applicability, however 29 identified for full-text eligibility and were included in this analysis. The majority of the studies included in this review were quantitative (n = 23), followed by qualitative (n = 3), and mixed methods (n = 3). Nearly all studies (n = 28) using validated instruments such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to determine depressive symptoms. DiscussionThis review offers preliminary qualitative insights on the efficacy of home visiting for administrating perinatal depression care. Studies show that home visiting programs can provide treatment for perinatal depression and reduce the effects of depression for birthing people. Our review suggests that the efficacy of home visiting programs beginning in the postpartum period are less predictable than prenatal home visiting intervention among various populations, including people experiencing both high-risk and low-risk situations.

AB  - Background: The hierarchy of evidence coming from evidence-based medicine favors meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials over observational studies and clinical cases. Nonetheless, in the field of psychiatry, where conditions are much more complex, additional evidence coming from real-world clinical practice is necessary to complement data from these gold standards. Thus, in this systematic review, the aim is to summarize the evidence coming from clinical case reports regarding cariprazine, a third-generation antipsychotic drug that has been approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder with manic, depressive or mixed features in adults. Methods: A systematic review was performed using Embase and Pubmed databases searching for English-language cases published in peer-reviewed journals between 2000 January and 2021 September with the following search terms: (cariprazin* OR "rgh-188 " OR rgh188 OR vraylar OR reagila) AND ( "case report* " OR "case report "/de OR "case stud* " OR "case study "/de OR "case seri* "). Results: After the removal of duplicates, 49 articles were retrieved via the search, from which 22 were suitable for this review. These 22 articles encompassed 38 cases from which 71% described patients with schizophrenia, 16% patients with psychotic disorders, 5% patients with mood disorder and 8% described patients with other disorders such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, borderline personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder with paranoid schizophrenia. The median age of patients was 31, and half of them were female. The majority of patients (76%) started cariprazine with 1.5 mg/day, and the most common maintenance dose was 4.5 mg/day (34%) and 3.0 mg/day (29%). Conclusion: Cariprazine was found to be safe and effective in a wide range of psychiatric conditions with different symptom profiles from acute psychotic symptoms through addiction to negative and cognitive symptoms. The results are in-line with the established evidence from clinical trials, however, they also show how cariprazine can be successfully utilized for treating certain symptoms irrespective of the indication.

AB  - Background: Depression-related mortality and morbidity pose growing public health burdens worldwide. Although the therapeutic effect of exogenous melatonin on depression has been investigated, findings remain inconsistent. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the effectiveness of melatonin in the treatment of depression, including primary and secondary depression symptoms. Methods: We searched the online databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for original studies published up to May 2021. We used STATA 14.0 software to synthesize the results of included studies. To evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin, we calculated the standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of depression scores between the melatonin and placebo groups. Results: Our literature search returned 754 publications, among which 19 studies with 1,178 patients (715 women, 463 men; mean age: 56.77 years) met inclusion criteria. Melatonin dosages ranged from 2 to 25 mg per day; treatment durations were between 10 days and 3.5 years. Our synthesized results showed that melatonin was not found significantly beneficial for alleviating depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.17, 95% CI = [-0.38, 0.05]). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the decrease in depression scores measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was significant (SMD = -0.52, 95% CI = [-0.73, -0.31]). Conclusions: There is very limited evidence for effects of melatonin on depression.

AB  - Background To evaluate the global prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among college students and potential associated factors. Methods PubMed and Web of Science were searched from their inception to March 28, 2021. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential heterogeneity. Egger's and Begg's test were used to assess publication bias. Results A total of 64 studies with 100,187 individuals were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among college students was 33.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29.3%-37.8%) and 39.0% (95% CI, 34.6%-43.4%), respectively. The highest prevalence of depression symptoms was found in Africa region (40.1%, 95% CI 12.3-67.9%), lower middle-income countries (42.5%, 95% CI 28.6-56.3%), and medical college students (39.4%, 95% CI 29.3-49.6%). For the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, the highest was observed in North America (48.3%, 95% CI 37.4-59.2%), lower middle-income countries (54.2%, 95% CI 35.0-73.4%), medical college students (47.1%, 95% CI 35.1-59.1%) and identified by Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (49.1%, 95% CI 31.0-43.0%). Besides, the prevalence of depression symptoms (35.9%, 95% CI 20.2-51.7%) and anxiety symptoms (40.7%, 95% CI 39.5-42.0%) was higher in studies conducted after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Conclusions Our study suggests that a lot of college students experience depression and anxiety symptoms and clarifies factors that are related to these mental disorders. Effective prevention and intervention strategies for mental disorders should be developed among college students.

The search identified 35 eligible studies: 26 quantitative studies and nine qualitative studies. Most quantitative studies (n = 33) were conducted in military samples. The studies examined interventions delivered by chaplains (n = 5), MHPs (n = 23) and combined approaches (n = 7). Most studies used symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression as primary outcomes. Various approaches to addressing MI have been reported in the literature, including MHP, chaplaincy and combined approaches, however, there is currently limited evidence to support the effectiveness of any approach. There is a need for high quality empirical studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions designed to address MI-related symptoms. Outcome measures should include the breadth of psychosocial and spiritual impacts of MI if we are to establish the benefits of MHP and chaplaincy approaches and the potential incremental value of combining both approaches into a holistic model of care.

AB  - Up to 50% of all children and adolescents growing up worldwide are exposed to at least one form of childhood adversity (CA), which is one of the strongest predictors for later life psychopathology. One way through which CA confers such vulnerability in later life is through increased sensitivity to and likelihood of social stress. A growing body of research demonstrates the positive impact of adolescent friendship support on mental well-being after CA; however, the mechanisms that may underlie this relationship are unknown. Neurobiological models of social buffering suggest that social support can reduce perceptions, reactions, and physiological responses to and after stress. Therefore, this preregistered, systematic literature search examined whether friendships reduce neural stress responses in adolescents with CA.

AB  - Objectives Our objective was to assess the effects of mental health interventions for children, adolescents, and adults not quarantined or undergoing treatment due to COVID-19 infection. Methods We searched 9 databases (2 Chinese-language) from December 31, 2019, to March 22, 2021. We included randomised controlled trials of interventions to address COVID-19 mental health challenges among people not hospitalised or quarantined due to COVID-19 infection. We synthesized results descriptively due to substantial heterogeneity of populations and interventions and risk of bias concerns. Results We identified 9 eligible trials, including 3 well-conducted, well-reported trials that tested interventions designed specifically for COVID-19 mental health challenges, plus 6 other trials with high risk of bias and reporting concerns, all of which tested standard interventions (e.g., individual or group therapy, expressive writing, mindfulness recordings) minimally adapted or not specifically adapted for COVID-19. Among the 3 well-conducted and reported trials, 1 (N = 670) found that a self-guided, internet-based cognitive-behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional COVID-19 worry significantly reduced COVID-19 anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.90) and depression symptoms (SMD 0.38, 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.55) in Swedish general population participants. A lay-delivered telephone intervention for homebound older adults in the United States (N = 240) and a peer-moderated education and support intervention for people with a rare autoimmune condition from 12 countries (N = 172) significantly improved anxiety (SMD 0.35, 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.60; SMD 0.31, 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.58) and depressive symptoms (SMD 0.31, 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.56; SMD 0.31, 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.55) 6-week post-intervention, but these were not significant immediately post-intervention. No trials in children or adolescents were identified. Conclusions Interventions that adapt evidence-based strategies for feasible delivery may be effective to address mental health in COVID-19. More well-conducted trials, including for children and adolescents, are needed.

AB  - As one of the most widely used mindfulness-based psychotherapeutic intervention techniques, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has emerged as an auxiliary or alternative technique for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study conducted a meta-analysis of the effect of MBSR on the changes in symptoms in PTSD patients. The final search was conducted on 10 December 2021, and 10 eligible randomized controlled trials were identified, including 768 participants. A quality assessment was conducted. Proportional sensitivity analysis and random effects meta-analysis were performed, and the 95% confidence interval was calculated. Subgroup analyses were also conducted to identify moderators (e.g., features of population and intervention). Compared with the control condition, MBSR significantly reduced the symptoms of PTSD patients and had a moderately positive effect (g = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.31-0.62, p < 0.001). This was the case in people who suffer from PTSD for different reasons, indicating that MBSR is an effective treatment for PTSD symptoms in PTSD patients. It was feasible to implement MBSR interventions for PTSD patients caused by different reasons.

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the effects of qigong and tai chi exercise on individuals with drug addiction. MethodsA systematic search of seven English databases and three Chinese databases was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized comparative studies (NRS) assessing the effects of qigong and tai chi on drug addiction. Study quality was assessed using the Checklist for the Evaluation of Non-Pharmaceutical Trial Reports (CLEAR-NPT). ResultsTwo RCTs and nine NRS studies were included in this study, including a total of 1072 patients with drug addiction (age range, 27-43 years). The results showed that qigong and tai chi exercise had a significant overall effect on depression (SMD = -0.353, 95%CI [-0.548, -0.159]), anxiety (SMD = -0.541, 95%CI [-0.818, -0.264]), quality of life (SMD = 0.673, 95%CI [0.438, 0.907]), and sleep quality (SMD = -0.373, 95%CI [-0.631, -0.116]). The subgroup analysis found that qigong outperformed tai chi on the improving depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. ConclusionExisting studies suggest that qigong and tai chi are effective at improving depression, anxiety, and quality of life in drug users; however, the evidence from rigorous randomized controlled group trials is lacking.

AB  - Increasingly, studies have investigated cognitive functioning from the perspective of acute state- to remitted phases of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Some cognitive deficits observed in the symptomatic phase persist in remission as traits or scars. The etiological origin and clinical consequences of the neurocognitive profiles reported in the literature are still unclear and may vary across populations. Deficits are suspected to influence the association between MDD and neurodegenerative disorders and could thus be of particular clinical consequence. The aim of this review is to describe the clinical neuropsychological profile in MDD and how it is related to research during the past decade on cognitive deficits in MDD from a state, trait, and scar perspective. This review, with a clinical perspective, investigates research from the past decade regarding cognitive functioning in MDD in a long-term perspective. We focus on the clinical manifestation of deficits, and the potential neurodegenerative consequences of the neurocognitive profile in MDD. Searches in Medline, PsycINFO and Embase were conducted targeting articles published between 2010 and 2020. Examination of the evidence for long-lasting neurocognitive deficits in major depression within the cognitive domains of Memory, Executive Functions, Attention, and Processing Speed was conducted and was interpreted in the context of the State, Scar and Trait hypotheses. Defining the neurocognitive profiles in MDD will have consequences for personalized evaluation and treatment of residual cognitive symptoms, and etiological understanding of mood disorders, and treatments could potentially reduce or delay the development of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - In this systematic review, we examined quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies on loneliness in autistic adults. A total of 1460 articles were identified, and 34 of these met inclusion criteria. Results demonstrated that (1) there is a paucity of qualitative data providing first-hand descriptions of loneliness from autistic adults; (2) few empirical studies have used reliable/valid measures of loneliness developed specifically for autistic adults, and in just one study was a measure of loneliness developed for, and validated in, autistic adults; (3) the collective dimension of loneliness (i.e. belonging in society) has been described by autistic adults, yet has not been investigated as frequently as the intimate (i.e. romantic relationships) or relational (i.e. friend/family relationships) dimensions of loneliness; (4) the factors associated with increased loneliness in autistic adults include autistic characteristics, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, negative experiences and learned helplessness, a lack of autism understanding and acceptance, sensory avoidance, camouflaging and unemployment; and (5) the factors associated with decreased loneliness in autistic adults include having relationships, participation in social skill interventions and/or experiencing fewer difficulties with social skills, positive views and acceptance of oneself, being female and time spent engaging in activities (e.g. online gaming). Directions for future research are considered. Lay abstract Recently, researchers have been interested in how autistic people experience loneliness. Yet, most of this research has focused on loneliness in autistic children and young people. We present the results of a systematic review on loneliness in autistic adults. A systematic review is a rigorous way of searching for all existing research on a topic and summarizing the findings about specific questions. We searched for all research published on this topic until 9 April 2021. We found 34 articles that investigated loneliness in autistic adults. This research showed that (1) there is fairly little research that has involved directly asking autistic adults about their first-hand experiences of loneliness (e.g. what loneliness feels like for them); (2) few research studies have used loneliness questionnaires specifically developed for autistic adults (this was attempted in just one research study); (3) collective loneliness (i.e. loneliness associated with how much an autistic person feels they 'fit in' to society) seems important to autistic adults but has not been investigated as commonly as other aspects of loneliness (e.g. loneliness associated with romantic relationships or friendships); (4) things that might increase loneliness in autistic adults include anxiety and depression, and a lack of autism understanding and acceptance, for example; and (5) things that might reduce loneliness in autistic adults include having relationships and self-acceptance, for example. In our article, we discuss the kinds of future research on loneliness in autistic adults that might be useful.

AB  - In recent years, a growing corpus of research has been conducted utilizing a variety of behavioral and neurophysiological methodologies to investigate the relationship of emotion and cognition, yielding unique insights into fundamental concerns about the human mind and mental disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been utilized to investigate how emotional states alter neural markers of cognitive control. The current study is a systematic analysis of EEG research that looks at affective modulation (mood, emotion) of cognitive control and its many sub-processes (e.g., cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, and working memory). The PRISMA standards were followed in this review, which looked at experimental designs and tasks, as well as methodological elements of EEG recording and analysis across research. A total of 35 articles were chosen for qualitative synthesis as a consequence of the search. The examination of event-related potentials (ERPs), which showed affective modulation of 19 different components, was the most common electrophysiological approach used across research. The majority of the investigations focused on N2 and P3, indicating that affective induction has a strong influence on attentional processes and response inhibition. Future research should look into different methodologies such as source location and connection metrics to better understand the brain's areas and dynamic response during affective induction activities. It is also suggested that the technical components of the report be more explicit in order to promote study comparability and replication.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Computational psychiatry studies have investigated how reinforcement learning may be different in individuals with mood and anxiety disorders compared with control individuals, but results are inconsistent.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether there are consistent differences in reinforcement-learning parameters between patients with depression or anxiety and control individuals.
   DATA SOURCES Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar searches were performed between November 15, 2019, and December 6, 2019, and repeated on December 3, 2020, and February 23, 2021, with keywords (reinforcement learning) AND (computational OR model) AND (depression OR anxiety OR mood).
   STUDY SELECTION Studies were included if they fit reinforcement-learning models to human choice data from a cognitive task with rewards or punishments, had a case-control design including participants with mood and/or anxiety disorders and healthy control individuals, and included sufficient information about all parameters in the models.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Articles were assessed for inclusion according to MOOSE guidelines. Participant-level parameters were extracted from included articles, and a conventional meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Subsequently, these parameters were used to simulate choice performance for each participant on benchmarking tasks in a simulation meta-analysis. Models were fitted, parameters were extracted using bayesian model averaging, and differences between patients and control individuals were examined. Overall effect sizes across analytic strategies were inspected.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were estimated reinforcement-learning parameters (learning rate, inverse temperature, reward learning rate, and punishment learning rate).
   RESULTS A total of 27 articles were included (3085 participants, 1242 of whom had depression and/or anxiety). In the conventional meta-analysis, patients showed lower inverse temperature than control individuals (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.215; 95% CI, -0.354 to -0.077), although no parameters were common across all studies, limiting the ability to infer differences. In the simulation meta-analysis, patients showed greater punishment learning rates (SMD, 0.107; 95% CI, 0.107 to 0.108) and slightly lower reward learning rates (SMD, -0.021; 95% CI, -0.022 to -0.020) relative to control individuals. The simulation meta-analysis showed no meaningful difference in inverse temperature between patients and control individuals (SMD, 0.003; 95% CI, 0.002 to 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The simulation meta-analytic approach introduced in this article for inferring meta-group differences from heterogeneous computational psychiatry studies indicated elevated punishment learning rates in patients compared with control individuals. This difference may promote and uphold negative affective bias symptoms and hence constitute a potential mechanistic treatment target for mood and anxiety disorders.

AB  - Objective: Brain's aerobic energy metabolism, abundance of the fatty acids and unsaturated lipids, generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by hormones, physiological roles of transition metals (i.e., iron and copper), and free radicals in the nervous system may cause inclination to oxidative stress in psychiatric disorders. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may cause oxidative stress by the electrical field or by the induced seizure. It was aimed to review the literature in terms of the influence of ECT on levels of oxidant and antioxidant compounds.
   Methods: The literature search was performed with the keywords that were oxidative stress or "DNA damage" or "RNA damage" or "lipid peroxidase" or "superoxide dismutase" or "catalase" or "glutathione" or "nitrite" or "nitric oxide" and "electroconvulsive therapy" or "electroconvulsive shock" or "electroconvulsive seizure". Twenty of 1480 records were included.
   Results: Eleven studies were performed in human subjects, whereas 9 studies were performed in rats. Human studies are conducted with serum, plasma, or urine samples; rat studies include brain tissues from various sites. In rats, four independent studies showed increased levels of lipid oxidation markers, and four independent studies reported increased levels of oxidative stress markers in brain samples. In human studies, studies were performed with circulating blood samples and the results were more inconsistent.
   Conclusion: Although some markers like superoxide dismutase or thioredoxin imply that ECT may increase the balance for oxidative stress, this notion is not supported by other markers of ECT. The current literature does not clearly suggest that the ECT is associated with oxidative stress in psychiatric disorders. Further studies with similar methods should be performed in big samples.

This systematic review's aims are to examine the interventions for CSOs, evaluate potential benefits, and thematically describe treatment processes. The Stress-Strain-Coping-Support model (SSCS) served as the theoretical framework. Methods: Database searches were conducted in: MEDLINE, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science Core Collection, Social Services Abstracts, Applied Social Science Index and Abstracts, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and APA Psyclnfo (between 01/Jan 2011-10/Jun 2021). Other search methods were also utilized. Inclusion criteria: interventions for CSOs with CSO specific outcomes. The Evidence Project Risk of Bias Tool was used for assessment. Results: 19/768 records were included. Nine interventions were utilized: 3 CSO directed, 4 for couples, and 2 low threshold online interventions. A quantitative synthesis (N = 7 studies) of effect size estimates for depression and anxiety measures didn't indicate any intervention to have better outcomes than others. Core themes in the treatment process identified in the qualitative synthesis (N = 7) included: information and understanding, social support, coping skills, communication, and strain. Limitations in the evidence related to sampling, control-conditions and outcome measurements. Discussion and conclusion: Several interventions were identified, yet no specific interventions appeared more beneficial than others. Using the SSCS model, commonalities and differences in intervention content were identified, along with themes that influence treatment processes. The need for tailored interventions is discussed. Future treatment efficacy research should carefully select study designs and outcome measurements.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic literature review is to provide an exhaustive summary of current research to explore the prospects of compassion-based approaches in treating persons with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD). Thereby, studies investigating the relationship between clinical parameters and self-compassion in SSD, as well as the acceptability, feasibility, and effects of compassion-based approaches for individuals with SSD were considered. The review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and checklist. Eight studies were included for qualitative synthesis. The results indicate an important role of self-compassion for several clinical parameters, including negative associations to positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive disorganization, and emotional distress. All studies reported good acceptability and feasibility. Regarding the clinical effectiveness of compassion-based approaches, a variety of clinical benefits, such as improvements of mood, affect regulation, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive disorganization, and variables relating to psychological recovery were found in individuals with SSD. It is concluded that compassion-based approaches are a promising form of intervention in the treatment of SSD. However, further research, especially randomized controlled trials, in this field is needed to understand the full potential of compassion-based approaches for individuals with SSD.

AB  - Background. Sleep is a vital physiological process regulated by the circadian clock and homeostatic mechanisms. Shift work is necessary to ensure continuity of healthcare provision. Worldwide, nurses work night shifts on a rotational or permanent basis. Objective. To analyse the impact of circadian rhythm disruption due to night shift work on the mental wellbeing of nurses. Methods. The literature search was conducted using PubMed and Scopus electronic databases. Selection criteria include studies published in English between 1997 and 2021 that examined the impact of night-shift work on the mental health of nurses. Results. The searches generated a total of 22 records on the PubMed database, and 9 records on the Scopus database, and a total of 31 studies. 29 papers were identified after removal of duplicates. However, 29 articles were screened based on the review of titles and abstracts. 19 articles were identified for full-test review. Seven papers were included in this review. Conclusions. Disrupted circadian rhythms and poor sleep quality and quantity have been identified as two of the most significant elements in the long-term effects of night-shift work on nurses' mental health. Strategies and policies to promote workplace health may reduce the occurrence of mental health disorders among night-shift nurses, whether the shifts are rotational or permanent. Nursing supervisors and hospital administrators should consider developing new guidelines to minimize the negative impact of night shift rotations on mental health and the quality of life among nurses.

AB  - The rising popularity of medical marijuana and its potential therapeutic uses has resulted in passionate discussions that have mainly focused on its possible benefits and applications. Although the concept itself seems promising, the multitude of presented information has noticeable ramifications-terminological chaos being one. This work aimed to synthesize and critically analyze scientific evidence on the therapeutic uses of cannabinoids in the field of psychiatry. Emphasis was placed on the anxiolytic effects of cannabis constituents and their effects on post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia spectrum, and other psychotic disorders. The review was carried out from an addictological perspective. A database search of interchangeably combined keywords resulted in the identification of subject-related records. The data were then analyzed in terms of relevance, contents, methodologies, and cited papers. The results were clear in supporting one common conclusion: while most findings provide support for beneficial applications of medical marijuana in psychiatry, no certain conclusions can be drawn until larger-scaled, more methodologically rigorous, and (preferably) controlled randomized trials verify these discoveries.

Regarding ADHD (n = 3), PTSD (n = 3), and pedophilic disorder (n = 1), a few studies had been performed since 2016. The majority of the included studies compared patient groups to healthy control groups.& nbsp;Discussion:& nbsp;Recent studies on VR-assisted psychiatric assessments have been conducted to validate VR environments, to assess symptoms for diagnostics or therapy goals, search for biomarkers, and to gain knowledge on psychiatric disorders. VR tasks were able to detect some difference between patient and healthy control groups, mainly with regard to self-report measures. Despite previous, promising prospects, the use of VR as a tool in clinical assessments must still be considered as a field in need of continued developments and evaluations.

AB  - Depression and anxiety are common in adolescents, but most affected will not get any formal help. Digital mental health technologies (i.e. resources and interventions to support and improve mental health) are a potential way to extend the reach and increase adolescents' access to therapies, at a relatively low cost. Many young people can access the internet and mobile technologies, including in low- and middle-income countries. There has been increased interest in integrating technologies in a range of settings, especially because of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health, at a time when services are under pressure. This clinical review gives an overview of digital technologies to support the prevention and management of depression and anxiety in adolescence. The technologies are presented in relation to their technological approaches, underlying psychological or other theories, setting, development, evaluations to date and how they might be accessed. There is also a discussion of the potential benefits, challenges and future developments in this field.

AB  - Sleep and circadian rhythms disturbances (SCRD) in young people at high risk or with early onset of bipolar disorders (BD) are poorly understood. We systematically searched for studies of self, observer or objective estimates of SCRD in asymptomatic or symptomatic offspring of parents with BD (OSBD), individuals with presentations meeting recognised BD-at-risk criteria (BAR) and youth with recent onset of full-threshold BD (FT-BD). Of 76 studies eligible for systematic review, 35 (46%) were included in random effects meta-analyses. Pooled analyses of self-ratings related to circadian rhythms demonstrated greater preference for eveningness and more dysregulation of social rhythms in BAR and FT-BD groups; analyses of actigraphy provided some support for these findings. Meta-analysis of prospective studies showed that pre-existing SCRD were associated with a 40% increased risk of onset of BD, but heterogeneity in assessments was a significant concern. Overall, we identified longer total sleep time (Hedges g: 0.34; 95% confidence intervals:.1, .57), especially in OSBD and FT-BD and meta-regression analysis indicated the effect sizes was moderated by the proportion of any sample manifesting psychopathology or receiving psychotropic medications. This evolving field of research would benefit from greater attention to circadian rhythm as well as sleep quality measures.

AB  - Background Lay Health Workers (LHW) are important providers of community mental health services and help mitigate access and treatment gaps in Africa. However, there is a paucity of knowledge about the role and performance of these workers, as well as about the extent to which the interventions delivered are culturally adapted to the African context. Aims This scoping review aimed to explore the content and aspects concerning the cultural adaptation and sustainability of psychological interventions delivered by LHW to people with mental disorders in Africa. Methods We conducted a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature published from January 2000 to December 2018 to identify psychological interventions delivered by LHW for people with mental disorders in Africa. We systematically searched PubMed, Google scholar and Hinari to select relevant publications. The articles were evaluated for risk of bias according to study design with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Quality Assessment Tools. Expert consultation was performed according to Arksey & O'Malley framework and cultural adaptation analysis was performed according to Bernal framework. Results Out of 14,549 retrieved records, we identified ten peer-reviewed articles conducted in Zimbabwe, Uganda, South Africa and Zambia describing four distinct interventions. Six were randomized controlled trials; none addressed implementation outcomes. Group-based interpersonal therapy (n = 5), trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy (n = 1), problem solving therapy (n = 3) and narrative exposure therapy (n = 1) emerged as psychological interventions delivered by LHW for people with depression, anxiety, trauma and suicidal behavior. Psychological interventions delivered by LHW in Africa were all culturally adapted to meet the competence of LHW. All the interventions were associated with symptom improvement, but the quality of this evidence varied widely with study design. Conclusion Task-shifting psychological interventions delivered by LHW after appropriate cultural adaptation show promise for addressing unmet mental health care needs in Africa. More effectiveness and implementation evidence is needed, especially with regard to psychological interventions delivered by LHW for adolescence, older people and those with severe mental disorders and suicidal behaviors.

AB  - Background: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is frequently complicated by the presence of dissociative symptoms. Pathological dissociation is linked with earlier and more severe trauma exposure, emotional dysregulation and worse treatment outcomes in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Dissociative Disorders, with implications for BPD. Objective: A systematic scoping review was conducted to assess the extent of current literature regarding the impact of dissociation on BPD and to identify knowledge gaps. Methods: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus) were searched, and English peer-reviewed studies with adults with BPD were included, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 2018 guidelines. Results: Most of the 70 included studies were observational (98%) with first authors from Germany (59%). Overall, dissociation was associated with increased BPD symptom severity, self-harm and reduced psychotherapy treatment response; findings regarding suicide risk were mixed. Dissociation was associated with working memory and cognitive deficits, decreased pain perception, altered body ownership, no substance abuse or the abuse of sedative substances, increased fantasy proneness, personality fragmentation, fearful attachment, dream anxiety, perceived stress and altered stress responses, increased cumulative body mass index, decreased water consumption, several neurological correlates and changes in gene expression. Conclusion: BPD with significant dissociative symptoms may constitute a more severe and at-risk subgroup of BPD patients. However, there are significant research gaps and methodological issues in the area, including the possibility of unrecognized Dissociative Disorders in BPD study populations confounding results. Further studies are needed to better understand the impact of dissociation on BPD course and treatment, and to clarify the most appropriate assessment tools for clinical practice. In addition, interventional studies are needed to develop dissociation-specific BPD treatments to determine whether targeting dissociation in BPD can improve treatment outcomes.

AB  - This study systematically reviewed available evidence regarding associations between polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene and socio-emotional and behavioral functioning in children and adolescents. The search yielded 69 articles, which were grouped into nine categories: depression, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms, alcohol abuse, borderline personality disorder, conduct disorder symptoms or diagnosis, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, early childhood attachment and behavior, pro-social skills, and resilience. Direct and/or gene x environment interactions were identified in over half of the studies. ASD and conduct disorder (including callous unemotional traits) were the diagnoses that were most studied and for which there was the strongest evidence of direct links with OXTR polymorphisms. In most studies identifying gene x environment interactions, the candidate OXTR polymorphism was rs53576. Results suggest that OXTR polymorphisms are associated with social, emotional or behavioural functioning in children and adolescents. The mixed findings do, however, highlight the need for further research.

Methods Based on the keywords, scientific databases were systematically searched to identify articles. The search included the three databases PubMed, Google Scholar and Research Gate until June 2020. The analysis was performed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and PTSD; subgroups were examined based on anxiety disorders. Results The prevalence of agoraphobia, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social phobia and specific phobia were 4, 25, 9, 4, 3, 5 and 8%, respectively. Conclusions Considering the findings of the present study regarding the significant prevalence of anxiety and PTSD in the immigrant population, it is necessary to pay special attention to the mental health of this population.

AB  - Background Seafarers are often reported to be engaged in a dangerous physical and psychosocial work environment. However, mental health status among seafarers has not been focused on compared with physical health issues. Systematic, comprehensive reviews of mental health problems and their relevant factors are lacking. This review aimed to clarify beneficial approaches to the mental health problems faced among seafarers using a scoping review to systematically map the evidence regarding mental health issues and their related factors. Methods Studies were searched on MEDLINE/PubMed, Science Direct, Academic search complete using EBSCOhost databases, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Web of science on 20, August 2020. This scoping review was conducted based on the framework of Arksey and O'Malley and Preferred Reporting items for Scoping Reviews flow diagram. The inclusion criteria were studies which determined the relationship between factors relevant to working conditions or working environment, and mental health in seafarers, and etc. Data were narratively summarized and reported. Results Twenty-four were included in this review while two major findings were clarified. Firstly, the prevalence of stress, depressive symptoms, and burnout have been mentioned for decades. Secondly, factors related to mental health and psychological issues can be categorized as individual and work environmental factors. The individual factors include experience, age, health status (high BMI, poor sleep, and diabetics), and resilience. The work environmental factors consist of two parts. Job demands comprise pressure from contractors/customers/time, working hours, ship department, job title, voyage episodes, period of seafaring, noise, and vibration. The job resources included instrumental support, team cohesion, shipboard caring and effort-reward imbalance. Conclusions A beneficial approach to mental health problems faced among seafarers is necessary to understand comprehensively at individual and organization levels. Promoting health behaviors, training resilience, and managing obesity and chronic diseases comprise individual level strategies. Providing seafarers with adequate instrumental support, and practical support to communicate with customers, managing their distinct work-rest hours and adequate effort-reward balance comprise organization level methods.

AB  - Basic pain research has shed light on key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nociceptive and phenomenological aspects of pain. Despite these advances, we still yearn for the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies to address the unmet needs of about 70 % of chronic neuropathic pain patients whose pain fails to respond to opioids as well as to other conventional analgesic agents. Importantly, a substantial body of clinical observations over the past decade cumulatively suggests that the psychedelic class of drugs may possess heuristic value for understanding and treating chronic pain conditions. The present review presents a theoretical framework for hitherto insufficiently understood neuroscience-based mechanisms of psychedelics' potential analgesic effects. To that end, searches of PubMed-indexed journals were performed using the following Medical Subject Headings' terms: pain, analgesia, inflammatory, brain connectivity, ketamine, psilocybin, functional imaging, and dendrites. Recursive sets of scientific and clinical evidence extracted from this literature review were summarized within the following key areas: (1) studies employing psychedelics for alleviation of physical and emotional pain; (2) potential neuro-restorative effects of psychedelics to remediate the impaired connectivity underlying the dissociation between pain-related conscious states/cognitions and the subcortical activity/function leading to the eventual chronicity through immediate and long-term effects on dentritic plasticity; (3) antineuroinflammatory and pro-immunomodulatory actions of psychedelics as the may pertain to the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain; (4) safety, legal, and ethical consideration inherent in psychedelics' pharmacotherapy. In addition to direct beneficial effects in terms of reduction of pain and suffering, psychedelics' inclusion in the analgesic armamentarium will contribute to deeper and more sophisticated insights not only into pain syndromes but also into frequently comorbid psychiatric condition associated with emotional pain, e.g., depressive and anxiety disorders. Further inquiry is clearly warranted into the above areas that have potential to evolve into further elucidate the mechanisms of chronic pain and affective disorders, and lead to the development of innovative, safe, and more efficacious neurobiologically-based therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Introduction The inverse relation between income and depression is well established. Less is understood about the relation between wealth and depression. We therefore conducted a scoping review to answer the question: What is known from the existing literature about the relation between wealth and depression? Methods We searched for studies and articles in Medline (via PubMed), Embase, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, EconLit, and SocINDEX from inception through July 19, 2020. Ninety-six articles were included in our review. Key article characteristics were year of publication, sample size, country, study design, definition of depression, definition of wealth, and association between wealth and depression. Thirty-two longitudinal articles were included in a detailed charted review. Results Depression was defined in a relatively standard manner across articles. In contrast, definitions and measurements of wealth varied greatly. The majority of studies in the full review (n = 56, 58%) and half of the studies in the longitudinal charted review (n = 16, 50%) reported an inverse relation between wealth and depression. The longitudinal charted review showed that (1) macro-economic events influenced depression, (2) wealth status influenced depression across the lifecourse, (3) wealth protected against depression in the face of stressors such as job loss, (4) subjective or psychosocial factors such as perception of wealth, relative comparison, and social status modified the relation between wealth and depression, and (5) savings interventions were successful in reducing depression and varied by context. Conclusion These findings suggest that wealth should be included in our consideration of the forces that shape mental health.

AB  - Background: A large number of Australians experience mental health challenges at some point in their lives. However, in many parts of Australia, the wait times to see general practitioners and mental health professionals can be lengthy. With increasing internet use across Australia, web-based interventions may help increase access to timely mental health care. As a result, this is an area of increasing research interest, and the number of publicly available web-based interventions is growing. However, it can be confusing for clinicians and consumers to know the resources that are evidence-based and best meet their needs.
   Objective: This study aims to scope out the range of web-based mental health interventions that address depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, or general mental well-being and are freely available to Australian adults, along with their impact, acceptability, therapeutic approach, and key features.
   Methods: The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR [PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews]) guided the review process. Keywords for the search were depression, anxiety, suicide, and well-being. The search was conducted using Google as well as the key intervention databases Beacon, Head to Health, and e-Mental Health in Practice. Interventions were deemed eligible if they targeted depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, or general mental well-being (eg, resilience) in adults; and were web-based, written in English, interactive, free, and publicly available. They also had to be guided by an evidence-based therapeutic approach.
   Results: Overall, 52 eligible programs were identified, of which 9 (17%) addressed depression, 15 (29%) addressed anxiety, 13 (25%) addressed general mental well-being, and 13 (25%) addressed multiple issues. Only 4% (2/52) addressed distress in the form of suicidal ideation. The most common therapeutic approach was cognitive behavioral therapy. Half of the programs guided users through exercises in a set sequence, and most programs enabled users to log in and complete the activities on their own without professional support. Just over half of the programs had been evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing symptoms, and 11% (6/52) were being evaluated at the time of writing. Program evaluation scores ranged from 44% to 100%, with a total average score of 85%.
   Conclusions: There are numerous web-based programs for depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and general well-being, which are freely and publicly available in Australia. However, identified gaps include a lack of available web-based interventions for culturally and linguistically diverse populations and programs that use newer therapeutic approaches such as acceptance and commitment therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Despite most programs included in this review being of good quality, clinicians and consumers should pay careful attention when selecting which program to recommend and use, as variations in the levels of acceptability and impact of publicly available programs do exist.

AB  - One of the most consistent biological findings in the study of affective disorders is that those with depression commonly show abnormal cortisol response, which suggests dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Children of parents with mood disorders offer the opportunity to explore the biological pathways that may confer risk for psychopathology. This review explores basal and reactive cortisol in the offspring of parents who are currently depressed or have had a history of a depressive or bipolar disorder. Using PRISMA guidelines, search terms yielded 2002 manuscripts. After screening, 87 of these manuscripts were included. Results from the literature suggest that while the degree and direction of dysregulation varies, offspring of a parent with depression tend to show elevations in both basal (particularly morning and evening) and reactive (tentatively for social stressors) cortisol levels. There were few studies focused on offspring of parents with bipolar disorder. This review also discusses implications and recommendations for future research regarding the HPA axis in the intergenerational transmission of depressive disorders.

AB  - Background Typically, specialist mental health professionals deliver psychological interventions for individuals with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and related mental health problems. However, such interventions are not generalizable to low- and middle-income countries, due to the dearth of trained mental health professionals. Individuals with little or no experience in the field of mental health (referred to as non-specialists) may have an important role to play in bridging this treatment gap. Aim To synthesise evidence for the effectiveness of non-specialist delivered psychological interventions on glycaemic control and mental health problems in people with T2DM. Methods Eight databases and reference lists of previous reviews were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Outcome measures were glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), diabetes distress and depression. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool was used for risk of bias assessment. Data from the included studies were synthesized using narrative synthesis and random effects meta-analysis. Results 16 RCTs were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. The 11 studies that were pooled in the meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in HbA1c in favor of non-specialist delivered psychological interventions when compared with control groups (pooled mean difference = - 0.13; 95% CI - 0.22 to - 0.04, p = 0.005) with high heterogeneity across studies (I-2 = 71%, p = 0.0002). The beneficial effects of the interventions on diabetes distress and depression were not consistent across the different trials. Conclusion Non-specialist delivered psychological interventions may be effective in improving HbA1c. These interventions have some promising benefits on diabetes distress and depression, although the findings are inconclusive. More studies of non-specialist delivered psychological interventions are needed in low- and middle-income countries to provide more evidence of the potential effectiveness of these interventions for individuals living with T2DM.

AB  - Aim: The study aimed to critically review and synthesize the best available evidence about the effectiveness of therapist-guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) in terms of reducing sickness absence (SA). Methods: We searched Medline (PubMed), Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central (up to November 2020) for English language peer-reviewed papers that described randomized controlled trials of therapist-guided iCBT compared with usual treatment for SA in adults with common mental disorders. Eligible studies were assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1 tool, meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, and standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. A subgroup analysis investigated potential moderating variables (diagnosis, SA at baseline, and estimated accuracy of self-report). Results: We identified 2788 references, of which 68 remained after the completion of the systematic screening process. A hand search of reference lists yielded no additional studies. The full texts of these 68 studies were appraised critically, and 11 were deemed to be suitable for a meta-analysis. SA was similar for iCBT and usual treatment groups (SMD: 0.02, 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.11), and remained similar even after the removal of two studies in which the recall time was over 3 months (SMD: 0.00, -0.11 to 0.12). Similar SA levels in intervention and control groups at 6-month and 12-month follow-up were observed in studies of participants with depression symptoms. Conclusions: iCBT did not appear to be effective in terms of reducing (largely self-assessed) SA in adults with common mental disorders. There is a need to improve the method and consistency of assessing SA.

AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in affluent societies, which underscores the need to identify persons at risk. The etiology of SCA is however complex, with predisposing and precipitating factors interacting. Although anxiety and mental stress have been linked to SCA for decades, their precise role and impact remain unclear and the biological underpinnings are insufficiently understood. In this paper, we systematically reviewed various types of observational studies (total n = 20) examining the association between anxiety or mental stress and SCA. Multiple methodological considerations challenged the summarizing and interpretation of the findings. For anxiety, the overall picture suggests that it predisposes for SCA in physically healthy populations (unadjusted OR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.06-5.59; n = 3). However, in populations at risk for SCA (n = 4), associations were heterogeneous but not significant. Anxiety may partly predispose to SCA by contributing to other risk factors such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus via mechanisms such as unhealthy lifestyle and metabolic abnormalities. Mental stress appears to precipitate SCA, presumably by more directly impacting on the cardiac ion channels that control the heart's electrical properties. This may lead to ventricular fibrillation, the arrhythmia that underlies SCA. To advance this field of research, experimental studies that unravel the underlying biological mechanisms are deemed important, and most easily designed for mental stress as a precipitating factor because of the short timeframe. These proof-of-concept studies should examine the whole pathway from the brain to the autonomic nervous system, and eventually to cardiac ion channels. Ultimately, such studies may facilitate the identification of persons at risk and the development of novel preventive strategies.

AB  - Social support is considered an imperative component of healthy aging and has been found to foster resilience against mental illness. The National Institute of Health has called for research to investigate social support as a protective mechanism for health disparities populations, including LGBT older adults. This integrative review is the first to comprehensively examine the characteristics of social networks maintained by LGBT adults age 50 and older. A comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted for articles published before September 2019. A manual search was also conducted among the reference lists of articles yielded. Articles that presented empirical data, described communities and social networks, and examined participants who self-identify as LGBT adults over the age of 50 were included. Nineteen articles met inclusion criteria. The Convoy Model of Social Relations was used to synthesize findings into categories of structure (size, composition, geographic proximity, and contact frequency), function (instrumental and emotional), and quality (positive and negative) of social support. Results indicate that diverse social networks are protective against age-related illness; intersectional minorities, and individuals who struggle with homophobia in the family of origin are at greatest risk for low network diversity, functional support deficits, and risks to psychological well-being. This review identifies that future research is needed to investigate the role that online social networks play in mediating social support needs in this population.
   Public Significance Statement LGBT older adults have a history of resilience in overcoming social disparities and minority stress. In this integrative review, LGBT older adults' social networks are investigated to identify the socially protective factors that characterize wellbeing and resilience-building in this population.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity in the primary prevention of anxiety. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. RCTs were searched in seven electronic databases. We included RCTs that assessed either the incidence of anxiety or the reduction of anxiety symptoms which excluded participants with baseline anxiety. Measurements were required to have been made using validated instruments. Objective or subjective (with validated questionnaires) verification of the performance of physical activity was required. Three reviewers carried out the search, selection, data extraction, and risk assessment of Cochrane Collaboration's tool simultaneously and independently, reaching an agreement in their discrepancies by consensus. In addition, a meta-analysis of fixed-effects model was carried out. Three RCTs met inclusion criteria, comprising 350 patients from 3 different countries. A meta-analysis was performed using five comparisons extracted from the selected studies, and the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was -0.18 (95% CI: -0.44; 0.07), p = 0.158. The heterogeneity was irrelevant, I-2 = 17.7% (p = 0.30). There is no evidence that anxiety can be prevented through physical activity, although the quality of evidence was very low.

AB  - Children of mothers with serious mental health difficulties are at increased risk of developing mental health difficulties themselves in their own lifetime. Specialist interventions delivered in perinatal mental health services offer an opportunity to support the infant's development and long-term mental health. This review aimed to systematically evaluate the shared elements of successful perinatal mental health interventions that underpin improved outcomes for infants whose mothers experience perinatal mental health difficulties. Nine electronic databases were searched comprehensively for relevant controlled studies of perinatal mental health interventions, and a narrative synthesis undertaken to assess whether statistically significant benefits were noted. Sixteen studies, trialing 19 interventions, were analyzed using a narrative approach and grouped according to reported effectiveness. Eight interventions demonstrated significant improvements in infant outcomes and/or mother-infant relationship outcomes and were used to inform the analysis of the included interventions' components. While the interventions identified were diverse, there were common components which potentially underpin successful interventions for infants whose mothers are experiencing mental health difficulties, including: facilitation of positive MotherxInfant interactions; helping mothers to understand their infant's perspective or inner world; and the use of video feedback.

AB  - The high risk of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection can increase the physical and psychological strain on nurses in professional practice, which can lead to mental health problems. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to establish and estimate the combined incidence of depression and anxiety among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic using standard measurement tools. A systematic search of the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS was carried out to identify cross-sectional studies in the period from 3 March 2020 to 18 February 2021. Two reviewers independently and critically evaluated the studies which have been included, using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist. We have identified twenty-three studies (n = 44,165) from nine countries. The combined incidence of depression among nurses was 22% (95% CI 0.15-0.30, I-2 = 99.71%), and anxiety symptoms 29% (95%CI 0.18-0.40, I-2 = 99.92%). No significant difference was observed in the percentage of depression and anxiety between the study subjects working on the frontlines vs. those in a mixed group (those working on the frontlines and behind the lines). This meta-analysis shows that over one-fifth of nurses in professional practice during the COVID-19 epidemic suffer from depression disorders, and almost one-third experience anxiety symptoms. This underscores the importance of providing comprehensive psychological support strategies for nurses working in pandemic conditions. Further longitudinal research is necessary to assess the severity of mental health symptoms related to the COVID-19 epidemic factor.

AB  - Objective: Consistent evidence suggests residual depressive symptomology are the strongest predictors of depression relapse following cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medications (ADM's). Psychometric network models help detecting and understanding central symptoms that remain post-treatment, along with their complex co-occurrences. However, individual psychometric network studies show inconsistent findings. This systematic review and IPD network analysis aimed to estimate and compare the symptom network structures of residual depressive symptoms following CBT, ADM's, and their combination.& nbsp;Methods: PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and PubMed were systematically searched through October 2020 for studies that have assessed individuals with major depression at post-treatment receiving either CBT and/or ADM's (venlafaxine, escitalopram, mirtazapine). IPD was requested from eligible samples to estimate and compare residual symptom psychometric network models post-CBT and post-ADM's.& nbsp;ResultsIn total, 25 from 663 eligible samples, including 1,389 patients qualified for the IPD. Depressed mood and anhedonia were consistently central residual symptoms post-CBT and post-ADM's. For CBT, fatigue-related and anxiety symptoms were also central post-treatment. A significant difference in network structure across treatments (CBT vs. ADM) was observed for samples measuring depression severity using the MADRS. Specifically, stronger symptom occurrences were present amongst lassitude-suicide post-CBT (vs. ADM's) and amongst lassitude-inability to feel post-ADM's (vs. CBT). No significant difference in global strength was observed across treatments.& nbsp;Conclusions: Core major depression symptoms remain central across treatments, strategies to target these symptoms should be considered. Anxiety and fatigue related complaints also remain central post-CBT. Efforts must be made amongst researchers, institutions, and journals to permit sharing of IPD.& nbsp;Systematic Review Registration: A protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO & nbsp;& nbsp;(CRD42020141663; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=141663)

AB  - Background: Online peer support groups are common and can be an effective tool for mothers with young children. The purpose of this review is to examine the types of support that online-based peer groups establish, as well as its health effects on mothers and their children.
   Methods: Systematic scoping review. Systematic review of existing literature was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane and Ichushi (Japanese language) database in December 2019.
   Results: Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 1,475 articles were extracted by initial search. After the review of titles. abstracts and full texts, a total of 21 articles met the inclusion criteria, The types of support mothers received were mainly informational and emotional support. Mothers also felt a sense of connection and community. Some health effects of online-based peer support group were seen in the area of mothers' mental well-being. Minimal effects were seen in behavioral modification for child nutrition and hreastfeeding.
   Conclusion: Due to the limited evidence in interventional studies, the effects of online-based peer support groups were inconclusive. Further studies with rigorous research designs would be helpful in future research.

AB  - Purpose of the Review: The prevalence of mental and substance use disorders is three to five times higher than that of the general population. Psychosocial interventions are effective in identifying and managing mental health and substance use disorders. This article aims to review the randomized control studies which have used nonpharmacological interventions alone or in combination with pharmacological interventions for managing mental and substance use disorders in prison/correctional settings.
   Collection and Analysis of Data: Studies included were randomized control trials and pilot randomized studies that assessed the impact of psychosocial interventions for prisoners with mental disorders and substance use disorders. A comprehensive search for articles was done by the primary author (Sreekanth Nair Thekkumkara) in the following databases: PubMed, ProQuest, PsychArticles, and Google Scholar (search engine), for the period June 1, 2000, to December 31, 2020.
   Results and Conclusions: The 21 studies included in the review had a sample size of 34 to 759. The settings of all the interventions were the prison and different types of psychosocial interventions were provided across the studies. The average duration of intervention ranged between 10 min and 120 min with the frequency of one to six sessions per week for 1 to 36 months. All the 21 Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) were nonIndian studies. Overall, the results of the included studies showed significant improvement postintervention (motivational intervention, interpersonal therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, positive psychology intervention, music therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy) on primary outcome measures such as symptom severity of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse prisoners. Positive effects were observed on secondary outcome measures such as motivation, aggression, follow up rates, and recidivism. A limited number of studies have focused on evaluating psychosocial interventions in prison settings. Most of the interventions were tested in prisoners with substance use disorder alone or in those with dual diagnoses and in high-income countries.

AB  - The psychological trauma associated with events resulting in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important and frequently overlooked factor that may impede brain recovery and worsen mental health following TBI. Indeed, individuals with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and TBI have significantly poorer clinical outcomes than individuals with a sole diagnosis. Emotion dysregulation is a common factor leading to poor cognitive and affective outcomes following TBI. Here, we synthesize how acute postinjury molecular processes stemming from either physical or emotional trauma may adversely impact circuitry subserving emotion regulation and ultimately yield longterm system-level functional and structural changes that are common to TBI and PTSD. In the immediate aftermath of traumatic injury, glucocorticoids stimulate excess glutamatergic activity, particularly in prefrontal cortex-subcortical circuitry implicated in emotion regulation. In human neuroimaging work, assessing this same circuitry well after the acute injury, TBI and PTSD show similar impacts on prefrontal and subcortical connectivity and activation. These neural profiles indicate that emotion regulation may be a useful target for treatment and early intervention to prevent the adverse sequelae of TBI. Ultimately, the success of future TBI and PTSD early interventions depends on the fields' ability to address both the physical and emotional impact of physical injury.

AB  - Objective: This review explores the association between psoriasis and mental illness and the potential underlying pathophysiologic explanations for this association. Method: Using a search via the MEDLINE database in December 2020, eligible studies with a focus on systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized control trials (RCTs) were retrieved and reviewed. Results: Psoriasis patients are 1.5 times more likely to show depressive symptoms and experience a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms (20-50%) than individuals without psoriasis. Schizophrenia (2.82%) and suicidal ideation (12.7%) are found to be more prevalent among psoriasis patients than among the general population. Pro-inflammatory markers, which play an important role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, have been shown to be elevated in patients with depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia; this suggests shared inflammatory pathways may be involved. Conclusions: There is an elevated burden of psychiatric co-morbidity in psoriasis patients which may be explained by an inflammatory model. We recommend that clinicians conduct universal screening of depression, anxiety, and suicidality among their psoriasis patients and remain vigilant for any symptoms of severe psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. Collaboration between dermatologists, psychiatrists and primary care physicians is essential in supporting psychological wellbeing and clinical outcomes for psoriasis patients.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution is a critical environmental concern that exists within different mountain ecosystem compartments. This review paper highlights the source, sampling, distribution, and behavior of MPs in mountain terrains and foothills. Atmospheric transport and tourism are major sources of MP pollution in mountain ecosystems. Snow samples provide the maximum concentration of MPs compared to that of stream or ice core samples. Precipitation events considerably influence MP deposition and fallout in mountains and glaciers. PE, PP, PS, polyester, and PVC are common plastic polymers with diverse shapes, such as fibers, fragments, films, and pellets. Ecological concerns and stress due to MP accumulated in natural ecosystems have also been discussed, with considerable focus on MP transport and distribution dynamics at higher altitudes as prospects for future research. A remarkable knowledge gap was observed regarding the MP pathways in the mountainous ecosystems and the assessment of microplastic-associated additives, such as heavy metals and other toxic chemicals, including the evidence of nano-sized plastics. Furthermore, studies on the ecological and biological risks posed by MPs on remote mountains is severely limited with respect to global climate change, biodiversity loss, and influence on ecosystem services.

AB  - Background Addressing psychological trauma after childbirth requires accurate measurement of its prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes using validated instruments that distinguish perceptions of traumatic birth, subclinical post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms, and symptoms meeting a diagnostic threshold. Objective The purpose of this study was to review literature on psychological trauma following childbirth and appraise instruments that measure postpartum PTS. Methods In January 2020, the authors searched for and evaluated peer-reviewed studies that quantitatively measured PTS following hospital-based live births in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland; 37 articles were selected and evaluated. Results Levels of post-traumatic stress disorder were most commonly measured, followed by PTS symptoms. Diagnostic instruments suggested lower PTS prevalence estimates than those screening for or assessing PTS symptoms. Community samples yielded lower prevalence estimates than samples recruited from the internet or settings specifically addressing mental health. Measurement sooner after birth yielded higher estimates. Conclusion Study design, sample characteristics, instruments, and timing of measurements likely impact postpartum PTS prevalence estimates. Variation in these characteristics make it difficult to draw conclusions on the prevalence of postpartum PTS. Researchers should consider the appraisal of measurement tools presented here and use rigorous study methodology when studying traumatic birth experiences and evaluating interventions.

AB  - Background Perinatal depression in women is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and has attracted increasing attention. The investigation of risk factors of perinatal depression in women may contribute to the early identification of depressed or depression-prone women in clinical practice. Material and Methods A computerized systematic literature search was made in Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE from January 2009 to October 2021. All included articles were published in English, which evaluated factors influencing perinatal depression in women. Based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration protocols, Review Manager 5.3 was used as a statistical platform. Results Thirty-one studies with an overall sample size of 79,043 women were included in the review. Educational level (P = 0.0001, odds ratio [OR]: 1.40, 95% CI: [1.18,1.67]), economic status of families (P = 0.0001, OR: 1.69, 95%CI: [1.29,2.22]), history of mental illness (P < 0.00001, OR: 0.29, 95% CI: [0.18, 0.47]), domestic violence (P < 0.00001, OR: 0.24, 95% CI: [0.17,0.34]), perinatal smoking or drinking (P = 0.005, OR: 0.63; 95% CI [0.45, 0.87]; P = 0.008, OR: 0.43, 95% CI, [0.23 to 0.80]; respectively), and multiparity(P = 0.0003, OR: 0.74, 95% CI: [0.63, 0.87]) were correlated with perinatal depression in women. The stability of our pooled results was verified by sensitivity analysis and publication bias was not observed based on funnel plot results. Conclusion Lower educational level, poor economic status of families, history of mental illness, domestic violence, perinatal smoking or drinking, and multiparity serve as risk factors of perinatal depression in women.

AB  - IntroductionIn the last decade, the technological advances have led to increased usage of the Internet. Internet-based games are now more readily available, and they are also more attractive and engageable for individuals. Previous studies have established university students as vulnerable population with regards to IGD. Despite the unique stressors and demands of the course, there is little information about the pooled prevalence of IGD in medical students. ObjectivesThe current meta-analysis aims to establish the pooled prevalence of IGD among medical students in different countries, and factors affecting the pooled prevalence. MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted from 23 May 2021 to 30 May 2021. The following databases were searched: PubMed, PsychINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Science Direct. The search terminologies included permutations of the keywords for IGD and medical students. All statistical analysis was performed with the Comprehensive Meta-analysis Version 3.0 program based on random-effects model. ResultsThree hundred ninety-six articles were identified from the search of the databases. The final data set consisted of 6 studies with a pooled cohort size of 2,236 medical students. The pooled prevalence of IGD in each country is as follows: Egypt had the highest prevalence rate of 10.9% (95% CI: 7.3-16.1%), followed by Saudi Arabia (8.8, 95% CI: 5.7-13.2%), Indonesia (6.1, 95% CI: 0.7-37.5%) and India (3.8, 95% CI: 2.7-5.5%) (p < 0.005). ConclusionsIn conclusion, this meta-analysis reports that the pooled prevalence of IGD among medical students from different countries is 6.2%, which is around twice as high than that of the general population.

KW  - Vaccine hesitancy

KW  - Vaccine refusal
KW  - Mental illness
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - Pandemic
AB  - Background: People with mental health problems are at particular risk both for infection with COVID-19 and for more severe course of illness. Understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is crucial in promoting vaccine acceptance among people with mental health diagnoses. This review aims to identify the prevalence and discuss factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the mentally ill population.
   Main body: We conducted a detailed literature search and included 15 articles for discussion in this review. Several studies showed varying trends of vaccine hesitancy rates among different countries. Major factors involved in vaccine hesitancy in general include mistrust, misinformation, believing in conspiracy theories, and negative attitudes towards vaccines. It was surprising that none of the studies were focused on vaccine acceptance rates and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among the mentally ill population. However, studies do show that COVID-19 is associated with worse healthcare outcomes for psychiatric patients, and vaccine hesitancy correlated with a lower likelihood of receiving mental health treatment and vaccinations. Psychiatrists need to address issues among patients who are particularly vulnerable to the fear of vaccines which include anxiety, panic attacks, certain phobias including trypanophobia and agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and certain types of traumas. Psychiatrists need to communicate effectively, show respect, empathy, and deliver accurate and honest information about the vaccines. Motivational interviewing, getting people with mental health illness to organize vaccine campaigns, and involving families with mental health problems may promote vaccine acceptance among this group.
   Conclusion: Existing literature on the rates of vaccine hesitancy among people with mental health illness is limited. The mental health illness may increase the risk of hesitancy especially in patients having certain emotional disorders such as anxiety and phobia. More studies addressing vaccine hesitancy rates and factors associated with the mentally ill population need to be done in the future.

AB  - We review the still scarce but growing literature on resilience to the effects of social stress on the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse. We define the concept of resilience and how it is applied to the field of drug addiction research. We also describe the internal and external protective factors associated with resilience, such as individual behavioral traits and social support. We then explain the physiological response to stress and how it is modulated by resilience factors. In the subsequent section, we describe the animal models commonly used in the study of resilience to social stress, and we focus on the effects of chronic social defeat (SD), a kind of stress induced by repeated experience of defeat in an agonistic encounter, on different animal behaviors (depression- and anxiety-like behavior, cognitive impairment and addiction-like symptoms). We then summarize the current knowledge on the neurobiological substrates of resilience derived from studies of resilience to the effects of chronic SD stress on depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in rodents. Finally, we focus on the limited studies carried out to explore resilience to the effects of SD stress on the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse, describing the current state of knowledge and suggesting future research directions.

AB  - BACKGROUND Depression is recognized as a major public health problem with a substantial impact on individuals and society. Complementary therapies such as acupressure may be considered a safe and cost-effective treatment for people with depression. An increasing body of research has been undertaken to assess the effectiveness of acupressure in various populations with depression, but the evidence thus far is inconclusive.
   AIM To examine the efficacy of acupressure on depression.
   METHODS A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Embase, MEDLINE, and China National Knowledge (CNKI). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or single-group trials in which acupressure was compared with control methods or baseline in people with depression were included. Data were synthesized using a random-effects or a fixed-effects model to analyze the impacts of acupressure treatment on depression and anxiety in people with depression. The primary outcome measures were set for depression symptoms. Subgroups were created, and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore which factors are relevant to the greater or lesser effects of treating symptoms.
   RESULTS A total of 14 RCTs (1439 participants) were identified. Analysis of the between-group showed that acupressure was effective in reducing depression [Standardized mean differences (SMDs) = -0.58, 95%CI: -0.85 to -0.32, P < 0.0001] and anxiety (SMD = -0.67, 95%CI: -0.99 to -0.36, P < 0.0001) in participants with mild-to-moderate primary and secondary depression. Subgroup analyses suggested that acupressure significantly reduced depressive symptoms compared with different controlled conditions and in participants with different ages, clinical conditions, and duration of intervention. Adverse events, including hypotension, dizziness, palpitation, and headache, were reported in one study.
   CONCLUSION The evidence of acupressure for mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms was significant. Importantly, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to study limitations. Future research with a well-designed mixed method is required to consolidate the conclusion and provide an in-depth understanding of potential mechanisms underlying the effects.

AB  - Background: Increasing clinical evidence suggests that people with severe mental illness (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Several systematic reviews examining the association between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19-related mortality have recently been published. Although these reviews have been conducted thoroughly, certain methodological limitations may hinder the accuracy of their research findings.Methods: A systematic literature search, using the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases (from inception to July 23, 2021), was conducted for observational studies assessing the risk of death associated with COVID-19 infection in adult patients with pre-existing schizophrenia spectrum disorders, BD, or MDD. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).Results: Of 1,446 records screened, 13 articles investigating the rates of death in patients with pre-existing SMI were included in this systematic review. Quality assessment scores of the included studies ranged from moderate to high. Most results seem to indicate that patients with SMI, particularly patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, are at significantly higher risk of COVID-19-related mortality, as compared to patients without SMI. However, the extent of the variation in COVID-19-related mortality rates between studies including people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders was large because of a low level of precision of the estimated mortality outcome(s) in certain studies. Most studies on MDD and BD did not include specific information on the mood state or disease severity of patients. Due to a lack of data, it remains unknown to what extent patients with BD are at increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. A variety of factors are likely to contribute to the increased mortality risk of COVID-19 in these patients. These include male sex, older age, somatic comorbidities (particularly cardiovascular diseases), as well as disease-specific characteristics.Conclusion: Methodological limitations hamper the accuracy of COVID-19-related mortality estimates for the main categories of SMIs. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that SMI is associated with excess COVID-19 mortality. Policy makers therefore must consider these vulnerable individuals as a high-risk group that should be given particular attention. This means that targeted interventions to maximize vaccination uptake among these patients are required to address the higher burden of COVID-19 infection in this already disadvantaged group.

AB  - Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a burgeoning epidemic in children and adolescents. Adult T2D doubles the risk of depression and mental health comorbidity makes it more difficult to make the lifestyle, medication adherence and health behavior changes needed to optimize outcomes. There is limited research on the impact of depression and depressive symptoms on youth T2D. Methods A search of the literature in the last 10 years regarding youth with depression and T2D was conducted. Abstracts were screened by 2 randomly assigned authors for inclusion, and disagreement was resolved by a third author. Selected full-text articles were divided among all authors for review. Results 13 publications from 8 studies (N=2244, age 6-17) were included. 6 of 13 publications utilized Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Youth (TODAY) study data. While studies included evaluation of depressive symptoms, most did not formally assess for major depressive disorder (MDD) and excluded participants with a previous diagnosis of MDD. Depressive symptoms were common in this population and were associated with negative T2D outcomes. Conclusions While there is a growing body of adult literature highlighting the extensive relationship between T2D and mental health, there is a dearth of data in youth. Future studies are needed that include, 1.) youth with diagnosed MDD, 2.) treatment studies of both T2D and MDD, 3.) larger, more racially diverse samples of youth with T2D, and 4.) studies that evaluate the impact of social determinants of health, including mental health comorbidity on outcomes of T2D.

AB  - Measurement-based care (MBC) involves the regular administration of outcome assessments to track and evaluate treatment progress and requires psychometrically sound instruments. While there are widely used patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for several psychiatric disorders and symptom categories (e.g., depression, anxiety), there is less consensus about self-report assessments for measurement-based care of schizophrenia. The present review provides an initial guide to this area by reporting on psychometric studies that introduce or evaluate PROMs designed for the ongoing treatment of schizophrenia. Out of an initial database of 6,153 articles, and review of 141 full-text articles, an analysis of 21 articles examining 12 measures is presented in this review. Findings suggest robust options exist for clinical and research institutions aiming to assess symptom outcomes in schizophrenia, with most measures showing strengths in internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and a number of measures with evidence of convergent or criterion validity. While there exist heterogeneous options, multiple measures demonstrated promising psychometric strengths. Future work validating consistent psychometric validity could involve measures which could be valuable in context of MBC for schizophrenia.

Aims To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis into the effectiveness of gaming interventions for treating either depression or anxiety in individuals aged 12-25 years. Method An electronic search was conducted on the 30 March 2020, using PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science Core Collection, Medline and EMBASE databases. Standardised effect sizes (Hedge's g) were calculated for between-participant comparisons between experimental (therapeutic intervention) and control conditions, and within-participant comparisons between pre- and post-intervention time points for repeated measures designs. Results Twelve studies (seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and five non-randomised studies) were included. For RCTs, there was a statistically significant and robust effect (g = -0.54, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.08) favouring the therapeutic intervention when treating youth depression. For non-RCTs, using a repeated measures design, the overall effect was also strong (g = -0.75, 95% CI -1.64 to 0.14) favouring therapeutic intervention, but this was not statistically significant. Interestingly, we found no statistically significant effect for treating youth anxiety. Conclusions There is preliminary evidence to suggest that gaming interventions are an effective treatment for youth depression, but not anxiety. Further research is warranted to establish the utility, acceptability and effectiveness of gaming interventions in treating mental health problems in young people.

AB  - The evolution of the field of behavioral neuroscience is significantly dependent on innovative disruption triggered by our ability to model and phenotype animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders. The ability to adequately elicit and measure behavioral parameters are the fundaments on which the behavioral neuroscience community establishes the pathophysiological mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as contributes to the development of treatment strategies for those conditions. Herein, we review how mood disorders, in particular depression, are currently modeled in rodents, focusing on the limitations of these models and particularly on the analyses of the data obtained with different behavioral tests. Finally, we propose the use of new paradigms to study behavior using multidimensional strategies that better encompasses the complexity of psychiatric conditions, namely depression; these paradigms provide holistic phenotyping that is applicable to other conditions, thus promoting the emergence of novel findings that will leverage this field.

AB  - Olympic combat sports are unconventional physical activity strategies to train middle-aged and older people with and without health problems. This systematic review aimed to assess the available body of published peer-reviewed articles related to the effects of Olympic combat sports interventions (boxing, fencing, judo, karate, taekwondo, wrestling) on health-related quality of life in adults aged 45 and older. The search was carried out in five generic databases until July 2021 and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (code: CRD42021244161). The PRISMA guidelines were followed and the Downs and Black checklist was used to assessed the methodological quality of the studies. After reviewing 1,151 records, only seven studies met the inclusion criteria, adding 212 participants (43.4% female) with a mean age of 63.7 years. Six studies (two with middle-aged participants and four with older people) provided data to calculate the effect size (ES) in the Olympic combat sports groups (No research that used taekwondo or wrestling as an intervention modality was found). Three studies reported beneficial changes with a small ES for the total score (d < 0.40) of the health-related quality of life. Two studies reported a beneficial change with a small ES (d = 0.49) and strong ES (d = 4.45) for physical health. One study reported improvements with a small ES for emotional (d = 0.23) and functional (d = 0.26) well-being. In conclusion, interventions based on Olympic combat sports produce beneficial effects with a small and moderate ES on health-related quality of life in male and female aged 45 and older who are healthy participants, participants with Parkinson's disease, and participants with breast cancer.& nbsp;& nbsp;Systematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, PROSPERO: CRD42021244161.& nbsp;& nbsp;

AB  - Background: There is a growing need to offer appropriate services to persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia who are faced with depression and anxiety distresses beyond traditional pharmacological treatment. Dance-based interventions as multi-dimensional interventions address persons' physical, emotional, social, and spiritual aspects of well-being. However, no meta-analysis of randomized controlled treatment trials (RCTs) has examined the effectiveness of dance-based interventions on depression and anxiety among persons with MCI and dementia, and the results of RCTs are inconsistent. The study aimed to examine the effectiveness of dance-based interventions on depression (a primary outcome) and anxiety (a secondary outcome) among persons with MCI and dementia.Methods: A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted. The inclusion criteria were: population: people of all ages with MCI and dementia; intervention: dance-based interventions; control group: no treatment, usual care, or waiting list group; outcome: depression and anxiety; study design: published or unpublished RCTs. Seven electronic databases (Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, EBSCO, CNKI, WanFang) were searched from 1970 to March 2021. Grey literature and reference lists from relevant articles were also searched and reviewed. The Cochrane "Risk of Bias " tool was used to assess study quality. RevMan 5.4 was used for meta-analysis and heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup and sensitivity analysis. GRADE was applied to assess the evidence quality of depression and anxiety outcomes.Results: Five randomized controlled trials were identified. Sample sizes ranged from 21 to 204. The risk of bias was low, except for being rated as high or unclear for most included studies in two domains: allocation concealment, blinding participants and personnel. Meta-analysis of depression outcome showed no heterogeneity (I-2 = 0%), indicating that the variation in study outcomes did not influence the interpretation of results. There were significant differences in decreasing depression in favor of dance-based interventions compared with controls [SMD = -0.42, 95% CI (-0.60, -0.23), p < 0.0001] with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.3669); Compared with the post-intervention data, the follow-up data indicated diminishing effects (Cohen's d = 0.1355). Dance-based interventions were more effective in reducing depression for persons with dementia than with those having MCI, and were more effective with the delivery frequency of 1 h twice a week than 35 min 2-3 times a week. Also, one included RCT study showed no significant benefit on anxiety rating scores, which demonstrated small effect sizes at 6 weeks and 12 weeks (Cohen's d = 0.1378, 0.1675, respectively). GRADE analysis indicated the evidence quality of depression was moderate, and the evidence quality of anxiety was low.Conclusions: Dance-based interventions are beneficial to alleviate depression among persons with MCI and dementia. More trials of high quality, large sample sizes are needed to gain more profound insight into dance-based interventions, such as their effects of alleviating anxiety, and the best approaches to perform dance-based interventions.

AB  - Objectives Due to accelerating wildland fire activity, there is mounting urgency to understand, prevent, and mitigate the occupational health impacts associated with wildland fire suppression. The objectives of this review of academic and grey literature were to: Identify the impact of occupational exposure to wildland fires on physical, mental, and emotional health; and Examine the characteristics and effectiveness of prevention, mitigation, or management strategies studied to reduce negative health outcomes associated with occupational exposure to wildland fire. Methods Following established scoping review methods, academic literature as well as government and industry reports were identified by searching seven academic databases and through a targeted grey literature search. 4679 articles were screened using pre-determined eligibility criteria. Data on study characteristics, health outcomes assessed, prevention or mitigation strategies studied, and main findings were extracted from each included document. The results of this scoping review are presented using descriptive tables and a narrative summary to organize key findings. Results The final sample was comprised of 100 articles: 76 research articles and 24 grey literature reports. Grey literature focused on acute injuries and fatalities. Health outcomes reported in academic studies focused on respiratory health (n = 14), mental health (n = 16), and inflammation and oxidative stress (n = 12). The identified studies evaluated short-term outcomes measuring changes across a single shift or wildland fire season. Most research was conducted with wildland firefighters and excluded personnel such as aviation crews, contract crews, and incident management teams. Five articles reported direct study of mitigation strategies, focusing on the potential usage of masks, advanced hygiene protocols to reduce exposure, fluid intake to manage hydration and core temperature, and glutamine supplementation to reduce fatigue. Conclusions While broad in scope, the evidence base linking wildland fire exposure to any one health outcome is limited. The lack of long-term evidence on changes in health status or morbidity is a clear evidence gap and there is a need to prioritize research on the mental and physical health impact of occupational exposure to wildland fire.

AB  - Mental health problems are a leading cause of health-related disability among children and adolescents. Organized activities are a possible preventive factor for mental health problems. An aggregated overview of evidence is relevant for youth policymakers and is lacking so far.
   Thus we aim to provide an overview of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the impact of participation in organized sport and non-sport activities (e.g. arts, music) on childhood and adolescent mental health. Systematic reviews were identified through a search in five databases (Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science core collection, CINAHL and PsycINFO) on 25-March-2021. Systematic reviews about organized activities and mental health outcomes in 0-21-year-olds published in English were included. Two independent reviewers assessed titles, abstracts and full texts, performed data-extraction and quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 and assessed the quality of evidence. Out of 833 studies, six were considered eligible. Quality of the reviews ranged from critically low to moderate. Most reviews focused on organized sport activities, focusing on: team sport, level of sport involvement, extracurricular and community sport activities. Indications of a positive impact on mental health outcomes were found for participation in team sport, in (school) clubs, and in extracurricular and community sport and non-sport activities. We found a small positive impact of organized sport activities on mental health outcomes among children and adolescents. This seems not to depend on any specific type of organized sport activity. Limited evidence was found for organized non-sport activities.

AB  - The prevalence of dementia is increasing and the care needs of people living with dementia are rising. Family carers of people living with dementia are a high-risk group for psychological and physical health comorbidities. Mindfulness-based interventions such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy show potential for reducing stress experienced by family carers of people living with dementia. This study aims to systematically assess the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in reducing stress experienced by family carers of people living with dementia. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, AMED, ICTRP, and ALOIS were searched for relevant studies up to August 2020. All types of intervention studies were included. Quantitative findings were explored. Seven studies were eligible for inclusion. The analysis showed that there was a statistically significant reduction in self-rated carer stress in four studies for the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group compared to controls. One study that was adequately powered also showed reductions in carer burden, depression, and anxiety compared to control. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appears to be a potentially effective intervention for family carers of people living with dementia, but large, high-quality randomized controlled trials in ethnically diverse populations are required to evaluate its effectiveness.

AB  - Background This systematic review aims to 1) summarize the prevalence of anxiety, depression, distress, insomnia, and PTSD in the adult population during the first year of the COVID pandemic in developing countries and 2) uncover and highlight the uneven distribution of research on mental health in all developing countries across regions. Methods Several literature databases were systemically searched for meta-analyses published by September 22, 2021, on the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms in developing countries worldwide. We meta-analysed the raw data of the individual empirical results from the previous meta-analysis papers in developing countries in different regions. Results The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were summarized based on 341 empirical studies with a total of 1 704 072 participants from 40 out of 167 developing countries in Africa, Asia (East, Southeast, South, and West), Europe, and Latin America. Comparatively, Africa (39%) and West Asia (35%) had the worse overall mental health symptoms, followed by Latin America (32%). The prevalence rates of overall mental health symptoms of medical students (38%), general adult students (30%), and frontline health care workers (HCWs) (27%) were higher than those of general HCWs (25%) and general populations (23%). Among five mental health symptoms, distress (29%) and depression (27%) were the most prevalent. Interestingly, people in the least developing countries suffered less than those in emergent and other developing countries. The various instruments employed lead to result heterogeneity, demonstrating the importance of using the well-established instruments with the standard cut-off points (eg, GAD-7, GAD2, and DASS-21 for anxiety, PHQ-9 and DASS-21 for depression, and ISI for insomnia). Conclusions The research effort on mental health in developing countries during COVID-19 has been highly uneven in the scope of countries and mental health outcomes. This meta-analysis, the largest on this topic to date, shows that the mental health symptoms are highly prevalent yet differ across regions. The accumulated systematic evidence from this study can help enable the prioritization of mental health assistance efforts to allocate attention and resources across countries and regions.

AB  - Background: As the Hispanic/Latino (HL) population grows, so too does the need for HL family caregivers for persons with dementia. HL caregivers tend to have less education, lower health literacy, and lower income, each uniquely compounding burden. Research is needed to appropriately tailor interventions for this population.
   Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to 1) provide an updated review of non-pharmacologic intervention studies for HL dementia caregivers, 2) characterize promising interventions, and 3) highlight opportunities for future research.
   Methods: Databases were searched for articles evaluating non-pharmacologic interventions for HL dementia caregivers. Studies were excluded if target populations did not include HLs or if no intervention was delivered. Data were extracted and random effects meta-analysis was performed on two primary outcomes: caregiver depression and burden. Effect sizes were calculated as pre- and post-intervention standardized mean differences (SMD), and further depression subgroup meta-analysis was performed. Other secondary outcome measures (e.g., perceived social support, caregiver knowledge, anxiety) were evaluated qualitatively.
   Results: Twenty-three studies were identified. Most included multiple components pertaining to psychosocial support, caregiver education, and community resource facilitation. Many studies were successful in improving caregiver outcomes, though intervention design varied. Meta-analysis revealed minimal to moderate heterogeneity and small effect size in improving depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.31, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.16; I-2 = 50.16%) and burden (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.18; I-2 = 11.06%).
   Conclusion: Although intervention components varied, many reported outcome improvements. Future studies may benefit from targeting physical health, addressing sociocultural and economic contexts of caregivers, and leveraging technology.

AB  - Climacteric is the period in a woman's life cycle that involves perimenopause, menopause and postmenopause. It represents the end of the reproductive period and the beginning of female aging in the biological sense. Over the past 10 years, an emphasis has been placed on the study of mental health in the female climacteric. Studies about the prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and association with different factors have shown important results on the relevance of these disorders during female climacteric. Considering the importance of these findings in the field of public health and epidemiology, we conducted a narrative review aiming to discuss the current knowledge about the prevalence of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation in the female climacteric, analyzing methods and results in different studies, selected from a literature review between 2009 and 2019, in the PubMed, Lilacs, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. Our results showed that the methodology, cultural and sociodemographic differences, as well as a variety of biopsychosocial factors studied, generate some uncertainties about the exact relationship between depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and female climacteric. We conclude that more research, greater methodological rigor, more accurate results and a biopsychosocial view are needed and urgent for effective interventions, cost reduction in mental health care, as well as prevention and control of depression, anxiety and suicide in climacteric.

AB  - BackgroundThis systematic review aimed to uncover the evidence and benefits of employers' commitment to delivering workplace wellness programs for working mothers. MethodsThe articles published in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and AgeLine-Medline databases between 2012 and 2021 were searched to evaluate the workplace wellness programs for working mothers with at least one resultant wellness or wellbeing (e.g., physical health, less stress, mental health, burnout, depression, smoking, bullying, alcohol consumption, overweight), work-life balance outcome, or job satisfaction. ResultsEight studies that met the criteria were retrieved from databases. They showed some effective workplace wellness programs that can reduce depression, stress, and burnout, improve mental health, healthy behaviors, work-family balance and work-life balance. Working mothers participating in a workplace wellness program generally gain some benefits; one of which is reduced stress typically related to childcare, economic, and personal health issues. ConclusionsThe implementation of workplace wellness programs for working mothers showed positive effects on their health problems and health costs. These eight studies revealed that workplace wellness programs specifically designed for working mothers can lead to time efficiency by holding the programs in or near the workplace and implementing them during the workdays. This greatly suits the conditions of many working mothers whose limited time and energy to balance the household, family and work tasks.

AB  - The prevalence, correlates, and management of tobacco use disorder (TUD) or nicotine dependence (ND) among people with severe mental illness (SMI), namely schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), remain unclear. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to July 12, 2020, for observational studies documenting the prevalence, odds, and correlates of TUD/ND among people with SMI; randomized controlled trials (RCTs) informing the management of TUD/ND in people with SMI were also included. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Sources of heterogeneity were explored. Nineteen observational studies, including 7527 participants with SMI met inclusion criteria. TUD/ND co-occurred in 33.4-65% of people with SMI. Rates were higher among males. While bupropion and varenicline represent promising treatment opportunities for schizophrenia with TUD/ND, non-pharmacological interventions require further research, mainly for people with primary mood disorders. TUD/ND represent prevalent co-occurring conditions among people with SMI. Further well-designed RCTs are warranted to inform their management.

AB  - Introduction: The study of noise has always been of interest to occupational health professionals as a harmful physical factor in the workplace. However, the psychological and psychoacoustic aspects of noise in the workplace have been less studied. This study has dealt with different colors of noise and their applications in psychoacoustics. Material and Methods: This review study was conducted by searching the databases of Google Scholar, ProQuest, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus to extract the articles related to the research subject within a 50-year interval from 1970 to 2020. Results: Based on the results of the present study, colored noises and white noise seem to have the potential to be used as acoustic stimuli to improve the sleep of employees, especially shift workers, to improve memory and attention, especially in jobs that require high care and attention. Colored noise and white noise have potential applications to improve cognitive function in different occupations to reduce the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and anxiety and stress, especially in jobs with high job stress. Also, these noises are helpful for people's privacy, especially in the open workplace, for noise masking and noise control purposes, as well as for medicine and treatment of disorders such as tinnitus, ADHD, and hyperacusis. Conclusion: Paying attention to the colors of noise and their psychoacoustic impacts shows us that the noise impacts are not limited to their undesirable and damaging effects. Instead, their positive and applied aspects should also note. Familiarity with such aspects and their introduction can identify the existing information gaps in this field and pave the way to fill them.

AB  - The stigma of men's mental illness has been described as having wide-reaching and profound consequences beyond the condition[s] itself. Stigma negatively impacts men's mental health help-seeking and the use of services amid impeding disclosures, diminishing social connection and amplifying economic hardship. Although men often face barriers to discussing their struggles with, and help-seeking for mental illness challenges, research focused on men's lived experiences of mental illness stigma is, at best, emergent. This scoping review explores men's mental illness related stigmas synthesizing and discussing the findings drawn from 21 published qualitative articles over the last 10 years. Four thematic findings were derived: (a) the weight of societal stigma, (b) stigma in male-dominated environments, (c) inequity driven stigmas, and (d) de-stigmatizing strategies. Despite evidence that stigma is a common experience for men experiencing diverse mental illness challenges, the field remains underdeveloped. Based on the scoping review findings, research gaps and opportunities for advancing the field are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As interest in job-related psychology increased, the need to focus on understanding workplace stress was emphasized. Negative emotional states such as anxiety and stress permeate the organization and, if uncontrolled, can negatively impact the health and work performance of workers. Therefore, attempts to analyze various signals to understand human emotional states or attitudes may be important for future technological development.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify what biological variables can discriminate emotions that can significantly affect work results.
   METHODS: Databases (Embase, PsychINFO, PubMed, and CINAHL) were searched for all relevant literature published as of December 31, 2019.
   RESULTS: Brain activity (BA) and heart rate (HR) or heart rate variability (HRV) are adequate for assessing negative emotions, while BA, galvanic skin response (GSR), and salivary samples (SS) can confirm positive and negative emotions.
   CONCLUSION: In the future, researchers should study measurement tools and bio-related variables while workers perform tasks and develop intervention strategies to address emotions associated with work. This may enable workers to perform tasks more efficiently, prevent accidents, and satisfy clients.

AB  - Introduction: Covid-19 pandemic has imposed a significant effect on mental health of the health care workers. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at determining the pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression among Iranian health care workers during the Covid-19 pandemic.
   Material and Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Web of Science, Scopus, Medline (PubMed), Embase, SID, Magiran databases and Google Scholar search engine were investigated to find studies over the prevalence of anxiety and depression among health care workers during the Covid-19 pandemic from December 2019 to lune 10, 2021. Quality of the primary studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool and the random effects model was applied to estimate the pooled prevalence. Furthermore, chi(2) test and I-2 index were used to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity among the studies. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression in different subgroups was reported based on the severity of anxiety and depression, assessment tools, and staff jobs.
   Results: Of 488 articles obtained as a result of the initial search, 10 related studies were identified and entered into the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 42% (95% CI: 25-75) and the pooled prevalence of depression was 35% (95% CI: 19-55). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 54% (95% CI: 39-70) in the occupational group of nurses and 29% (95% CI: 17-44) among all health care workers. The pooled prevalence of depression was 46% (95% CI: 30 to 63) and 17% (95% CI: 10 to 26) among nurses and all health workers, respectively.
   Conclusion: According to the findings, a high prevalence of anxiety and depression was observed among the health care workers of Iran during the Covid-19 epidemic. The authorities are required to plan for preventive and therapeutic interventions to reduce the psychological burden of the epidemic.

AB  - Inflammatory phenomena are found in many psychiatric disorders-notably, depression, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Inflammation has been linked to severity and treatment resistance, and may both contribute to, and result from, the pathophysiology of some psychiatric illnesses. Emerging research suggests that inflammation may contribute to symptom domains of reward, motor processing, and threat reactivity across different psychiatric diagnoses. Reward-processing deficits contribute to motivational impairments in depression and schizophrenia, and motor-processing deficits contribute to psychomotor slowing in both depression and schizophrenia. A number of experimental models and clinical trials suggest that inflammation produces deficits in reward and motor processing through common pathways connecting the cortex and the striatum, which includes the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and putamen. The observed effects of inflammation on psychiatric disorders may cut across traditional conceptualizations of psychiatric diagnoses. Further study may lead to targeted immunomodulating treatments that address difficult-to-treat symptoms in a number of psychiatric disorders. In this review, we use a Research Domain Criteria framework to discuss proposed mechanisms for inflammation and its effects on the domains of reward processing, psychomotor slowing, and threat reactivity. We also discuss data that support contributing roles of metabolic dysregulation and sex differences on the behavioral outcomes of inflammation. Finally, we discuss ways that future studies can help disentangle this complex topic to yield fruitful results that will help advance the field of psychoneuroimmunology.

AB  - Background: Depression is the third leading cause of worldwide disease burden among youth, and nutrition-and diet-related behaviors have been considered as an effective strategy for reducing the risk of depressive symptoms. This systematic review aims to examine associations between dietary intake and diet quality with depressive symptoms among youth.Methods: In this systematic review, a search of scientific articles published between 2000 and 2021 was performed in four databases (CINAHL, Embase, PsycInfo, and PubMed) according to the PRISMA checklist. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, observational studies that focused on associations between micronutrient, macronutrient, food group intake, and diet quality and depressive symptoms among youth, ages 3 to 18, were selected for review.Results: Thirty-two articles met the review criteria. Dietary intake of magnesium, vitamin B12, fiber, fruits, vegetables, and fish were consistently inversely related to depressive symptoms. However, the evidence of associations between intake of vitamins B6, C, D, and E, iron, copper, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, carbohydrate, and dietary fat and depressive symptoms was mixed. Dietary effects on decreased depressive symptoms were more pronounced in children than adolescents. Additionally, most studies failed to adjust for potential confounding variables.Conclusion: This review provides preliminary and comprehensive evidence for a relationship between dietary intake, diet quality, and depressive symptoms in youth. Although the results are heterogeneous and more research is needed, our findings indicate the importance of nutrition interventions for youth for decreasing depressive symptoms or for preventing further symptom exacerbation.

AB  - Background: In the United States, most patients who require behavioral health care do not receive it owing to an overall shortage of behavioral health specialists. The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is a team-based, highly-coordinated approach to treating common mental health conditions in primary care that has a robust evidence base. Several recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams. As telehealth technology advances and uptake expands, understanding the evidence for remote CoCM becomes increasingly crucial to inform CoCM practice and implementation. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams in treating common psychiatric conditions in primary care and medical settings. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to structure our review. Our search strategy and development of search terms was informed by knowledge and review of the CoCM literature. Articles were reviewed by 3 authors, and once selected, they were sent to 2 authors for further data extraction to describe various study characteristics and process measures relating to remote CoCM. Results: The literature search identified 13,211 articles, 9 of which met inclusion criteria. The 9 studies collectively demonstrate effectiveness of remote CoCM in treating a range of behavioral health conditions (depression [n = 7] anxiety [n = 2] and PTSD [n = 1] ), across various populations and settings. Sample sizes ranged from 191 patients to 704 patients, publication dates from 2004 to 2018, and studies were conducted from 2000 to 2014. Various process measures were also reported. Conclusions: As the 9 studies included in our systematic review demonstrate, remote CoCM can be effective in treating a range of behavioral health conditions in various primary care and specialty medical settings. These findings suggest organizations may have more flexibility in building their CoCM team and drawing upon wider workforces than previously recognized. As recent shifts in telehealth policy and practice continue to motivate telehealth approaches, further research that can inform best practices for remote CoCM will be useful and valuable to those making organizational decisions when implementing integrated care models.

AB  - The prevalence of mental health disorders and suicide amongst agricultural producers is a global problem. Community leaders, researchers, policymakers, and clinicians have mobilized to develop programs to address this issue. This study reviewed a wide range of mental health interventions targeting farmer mental health spanning over 50 years and examined their reported effectiveness and constraints. A total of ninety-two articles on farmer mental health were included in a final systematic review. Most articles were written concerning mental health literacy and peer and paraprofessional support interventions in the United States and Australia. Among the 56 studies reporting empirical evaluative data, 21 were mixed-method, 20 quantitative, 11 qualitative, and 5 literature synthesis. Non-experimental, self-reported, and qualitative data suggest efficacy of mental health literacy programs, peer and paraprofessional support, and community-based and agroecological interventions. However, most interventions were not subject to rigorous evaluation and only one intervention was evaluated using a control condition. The heterogeneity of existing studies and paucity of rigorous evaluation proscribes firm conclusions related to program-type efficacy. This review demonstrates that there is still a need for a stronger and broader evidence base in the field of farmer mental health interventions, which should focus on both holistic, multi-component programs and targeted approaches.

Method Using a pre-registered protocol, relevant journal articles were identified through searches of: PsycInfo; Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection; CINAHL and PsycArticles. Data were pooled using a random effects model, and effect estimates were reported as Hedges' g. Results Pooled effect estimates indicated that arts-based interventions significantly reduced PTSD symptom scores compared to pre-intervention (15 studies, g = -.67, p < .001) and a control group (7 studies, g = -.50, p < .001). Significant reductions were also found for measures of negative mood, but results were mixed for externalizing problems and anxiety. Conclusions Despite variations in study quality, intervention approaches and types of trauma experience, the results tentatively suggest that creative arts-based interventions may be effective in reducing symptoms of trauma and negative mood.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide public health concern. It continues to spread rapidly throughout the world causing multiple physical and psychological consequences in the population. Especially, people affected by severe psychiatric or neurological diseases are highly susceptible to serious health complications not only due to the direct effect of the infection but also to the indirect effect of COVID-19 following social distancing during lockdowns and its general social consequences. Indeed, lockdown and difficulties in using the care services produced psychological consequences in caregivers such as depression, anxiety, and worsening of the quality of life which in turn affected the ability to manage patients. Our aim was to systematically review the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown in caregivers of patients with cognitive impairment and dementia and the impact on the health of their patients.Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted by searching in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science by two independent researchers following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Data extraction and quality assessment were also performed. Papers were screened for eligibility by abstract and then those which met inclusion criteria were included in this review.Results: The initial search returned 410 records. After the abstract screening and the inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied, 315 were excluded because they were irrelevant, 30 because they were reviews, meta-analyses, letters to editors, editorials, guidelines, or case reports, and 10 because they were duplicates. Then, 38 out of 55 abstracts/full-text articles were excluded because they did not simultaneously assess mental health of patients and caregivers. In the end, 17 papers were deemed eligible and included in the present review.Conclusion: Based on current literature, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown caused severe psychological consequences for caregivers of patients with dementia, worsening their mental health, and increasing the psychological and physical burden, independently from the severity of the disease of their relatives, which resulted also independently globally worsened.

AB  - Chronic pain patients suffer a disrupted quality of life not only from the experience of pain itself, but also from comorbid symptoms such as depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances. The heterogeneity of these symptoms support the idea of a major involvement of the cerebral cortex in the chronic pain condition. Accordingly, abundant evidence shows that in chronic pain the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region that is critical for executive function and working memory, is severely impaired. Excitability of the mPFC depends on the integrated effects of intrinsic excitability and excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The main extracortical sources of excitatory input to the mPFC originate in the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, which allow the mPFC to integrate multiple information streams necessary for cognitive control of pain including sensory information, context, and emotional salience. Recent techniques, such as optogenetic methods of circuit dissection, have made it possible to tease apart the contributions of individual circuit components. Here we review the synaptic properties of these main glutamatergic inputs to the rodent mPFC, how each is altered in animal models of chronic pain, and how these alterations contribute to pain-associated mPFC deactivation. By understanding the contributions of these individual circuit components, we strive to understand the broad spectrum of chronic pain and comorbid pathologies, how they are generated, and how they might be alleviated.

AB  - Objective: Over the last 10 years, online interventions to improve mental health have increased significantly. This study's primary objective was to determine the effectiveness of online interventions in improving the mental health of pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (PAYA) cancer survivors. The secondary objective was to identify the independent variables associated with online intervention efficacy for mental health improvement.Methods: On June 25-30, 2021, we searched the Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for eligible English language publications that reported randomized controlled trials of online interventions aimed at improving mental health among PAYA cancer survivors. The results were analyzed using a systematic review and a three-level meta-analysis.Results: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. In six (42%) studies, the intervention focused on physical activity enhancement, while ten (77%) studies used self-directed interventions. Online interventions were more efficacious, compared to control conditions, in improving sleep g = 0.35 (95% CI 0.04-0.66) and psychological well-being g = 0.32 (95% CI 0.09-0.56), but not for reducing the symptoms of depression g = 0.17 (95% CI -0.13 to 0.47), anxiety g = 0.05 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.25), and pain g = 0.13 (95% CI -0.13 to 0.39).Conclusion: Online interventions were generally effective in improving mental health in PAYA cancer survivors, although negative results were found in some critical outcomes. More high-quality evidence is needed for definite conclusions to be drawn. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021266276).

AB  - Pollution is harmful to human physical health and wellbeing. What is less well established is the relationship between adolescent mental health - a growing public health concern - and pollution. In response, we systematically reviewed studies documenting associations between pollution and mental health in adolescents. We searched Africa Wide, Medline, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection for studies published up to 10 April 2020 that investigated exposure to any pollutant and symptoms of anxiety; depression; disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders; neurodevelopmental disorders; psychosis; or substance abuse in 10-24-year-olds (i.e., adolescents as per expanded and more inclusive definition of adolescence). This identified 2291 records and we assessed 128 papers for inclusion. We used a narrative synthesis to coalesce the studies' findings. This review is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42020176664. Seventeen studies from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America were included. Air and water pollution exposure was associated with elevated symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety, psychosis, and/or disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorder. Exposure to lead and solvents was associated with neurodevelopmental impairments. Most studies neglected factors that could have supported the mental health resilience of adolescents exposed to pollution. Notwithstanding the limited quality of most reviewed studies, results suggest that pollution exposure is a risk to adolescent mental health. High-quality research is urgently required, including the factors and processes that protect the mental health of pollution-exposed adolescents. Studies with adolescents living in low-and lower middle-income countries and the southern hemisphere must be prioritized.

AB  - Background: Face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most widely used non-pharmacological treatment approaches for insomnia. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of face-to-face delivered CBT on health outcomes and to evaluate the effect of CBT components as subgroup variables to explain the efficacy of face-to-face delivered CBT on health outcomes in adults over 18 years old with insomnia.Methods: Relevant randomized controlled trial studies published in the past 22 years were searched through the electronic databases. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used to assess the quality of the 31 included studies. The mean difference and standard deviation of outcome variables and subgroup variables were analyzed using random effect model, and the heterogeneity among the articles was assessed with the Q-test and I-2. Egger regression analysis was used to assess publication bias.Results: The meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in Insomnia Severity Index [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -2.56, 95% CI -3.81 to -1.30, p < 0.001], Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (SMD = -0.96, 95% CI -1.25 to -0.68, p < 0.001), sleep onset latency (SMD = -1.31, 95% CI -2.00 to -0.63, p < 0.001), wakening after sleep onset (SMD = -1.44, 95% CI -2.14 to -0.74, p < 0.001), number of awakenings (SMD = -1.18, 95% CI -2.10 to -0.26, p < 0.05), depression (SMD = -1.14, 95% CI -1.85 to -0.42, p < 0.01), and fatigue (SMD = -2.23, 95% CI -3.87 to -0.58, p < 0.01), and a significant increase in total sleep time (SMD = 0.63, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.98, p < 0.001), sleep efficiency (SMD = 1.61, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.29, p < 0.001), and physical health (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76, p < 0.05), in the CBT intervention group compared with the control group. There was no significant change in anxiety (SMD = -0.62, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.32, p > 0.05) and mental health (SMD = 1.09, 95% CI -0.59 to 2.77, p > 0.05) in CBT intervention group compared with control group. Group-delivered studies with larger number of intervention sessions and longer duration of single session provided a larger improvement in sleep quality.Conclusion: Face-to-face delivered CBT is effective in increasing total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and physical health, and reducing Insomnia Severity Index scores, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, sleep onset latency, wakening after sleep onset, number of awakenings, depression, anxiety, and fatigue in patients with insomnia. Face-to-face delivered CBT is more effective when delivered through a larger number of sessions with longer duration of each session, and when delivered in groups. Face-to-face CBT is recommended to provide treatment to patients with insomnia in clinical settings.

AB  - Purpose There are increasing concerns about the intersection between NEET (not in education, employment, or training) status and youth mental ill-health and substance use. However, findings are inconsistent and differ across types of problems. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO-CRD42018087446) on the association between NEET status and youth mental health and substance use problems. Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, ERIC, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1999-2020). Two reviewers extracted data and appraised study quality using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We ran robust variance estimation random-effects models for associations between NEET and aggregate groups of mental ill-health and substance use measures; conventional random-effects models for associations with individual mental/substance use problems; and subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity. Results We identified 24 studies from 6,120 references. NEET status was associated with aggregate groups of mental ill-health (OR 1.28, CI 1.06-1.54), substance use problems (OR 1.43, CI 1.08-1.89), and combined mental ill-health and substance use measures (OR 1.38, CI 1.15-1.64). Each disaggregated measure was associated with NEET status [mood (OR 1.43, CI 1.21-1.70), anxiety (OR 1.55, CI 1.07-2.24), behaviour problems (OR 1.49, CI 1.21-1.85), alcohol use (OR 1.28, CI 1.24-1.46), cannabis use (OR 1.62, CI 1.07-2.46), drug use (OR 1.99, CI 1.19-3.31), suicidality (OR 2.84, CI 2.04-3.95); and psychological distress (OR 1.10, CI 1.01-1.21)]. Longitudinal data indicated that aggregate measures of mental health problems and of mental health and substance use problems (combined) predicted being NEET later, while evidence for the inverse relationship was equivocal and sparse. Conclusion Our review provides evidence for meaningful, significant associations between youth mental health and substance use problems and being NEET. We, therefore, advocate for mental ill-health prevention and early intervention and integrating vocational supports in youth mental healthcare.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) has become a fast-growing avenue for research in psychiatry, and clinicians are challenged with understanding the implications of CBD for treating mental health disorders. The goal of this review is to serve as a guide for mental health professionals by providing an overview of CBD and a synthesis the current evidence within major psychiatric disorders. PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for articles containing the terms "cannabidiol" in addition to major psychiatric disorders and symptoms, yielding 2952 articles. Only randomized controlled trials or within-subject studies investigating CBD as a treatment option for psychiatric disorders (N = 16) were included in the review. Studies were reviewed for psychotic disorders (n = 6), anxiety disorders (n = 3), substance use disorders (tobacco n = 3, cannabis n = 2, opioid n = 1), and insomnia (n = 1). There were no published studies that met inclusion criteria for alcohol or stimulant use disorder, PTSD, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, or mood disorders. Synthesis of the CBD literature indicates it is generally safe and well tolerated. The most promising preliminary findings are related to the use of CBD in psychotic symptoms and anxiety. There is currently not enough high-quality evidence to suggest the clinical use of CBD for any psychiatric disorder.

AB  - Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex condition, impacting cardio-metabolic and reproductive health, mental health and health-related quality of life. The physical health benefits of exercise for women with PCOS are well-established and exercise is increasingly being recognised as efficacious for improving psychological wellbeing. The aim of this review was to summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of exercise interventions on mental health outcomes in women with PCOS. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted in March of 2020. Trials that evaluated the effect of an exercise intervention on mental health or health-related quality of life outcomes in reproductive aged women with diagnosed PCOS were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the modified Downs and Black checklist. Primary outcomes included symptoms of depression and anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Results Fifteen articles from 11 trials were identified and deemed eligible for inclusion. Exercise demonstrated positive improvements in health-related quality of life in all of the included studies. Half of included studies also reported significant improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms. There was large variation in methodological quality of included studies and in the interventions utilised. Conclusions The available evidence indicates that exercise is effective for improving health-related quality of life and PCOS symptom distress. Exercise also shows some efficacy for improving symptoms and/or prevalence of depression and anxiety in women with PCOS. However, due to large heterogeneity of included studies, conclusions could not be made regarding the impact of exercise intervention characteristics. High-quality trials with well reported exercise intervention characteristics and outcomes are required in order to determine effective exercise protocols for women with PCOS and facilitate translation into practice.

AB  - Background Parkinson's disease is one of the non-curable diseases and occurs by the prominent loss of neurotransmitter (dopamine) in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The main cause behind this is not yet identified and even its diagnosis is very intricate phase due to non-identified onset symptoms. Despite the fact that PD has been extensively researched over the decades, and various algorithms and strategies for early recognition and avoiding misdiagnosis have been published. The objective of this article is to focus on the current scenario and to explore the involvement of various clinical diagnostic scales in the detection of PD. Method An exhaustive literature review is conducted to synthesize the earlier work in this area, and the articles were searched using different keywords like Parkinson disease, motor/non-motor, treatment, diagnosis, scales, PPMI, etc., in all repositories such as Google scholar, Scopus, Elsevier, PubMed and many more. From the year 2017 to 2021, a total of 451 publications were scanned, but only 24 studies were chosen for a review process. Findings Mostly as clinical tools, UPDRS and HY scales are commonly used and even there are many other scales which can be helpful in detection of symptoms such as depression, anxiety, sleepiness, apathy, smell, anhedonia, fatigue, pain, etc., that affect the QoL of pateint. The recognition of non-motor manifests is typically very difficult than motor signs. Conclusion This study can give the beneficial research paths at an early stage diagnosis by focusing on frequent inspection of daily activities, interactions, and routine, which may also give a plethora of information on status changes, directing self-reformation, and clinical therapy.

AB  - Background There is a plethora of reviews that summarize much of the evidence base in Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). However, there are criticisms around variability of quality and focus of those reviews, meaning there is little strategic overview of the current state of the field. Further, there are rising concerns as to systemic gaps in the evidence base itself. An overview of reviews provides an opportunity for a comprehensive classification and corresponding critique of evidence. Aims The study sought to examine a-priori concerns regarding (1) variation in the rigour and quality of the meta-analytic and systematic evidence base, (2) comparatively less conclusive evidence for whole school approaches when compared to class-based curricula, and (3) an assumed universality of effect (i.e., lack of examination of any differential gains for sub-groups). Method and results A systematic search of the systematic and meta-analytic literature identified a total of 33 reviews examining SEL interventions. Papers were subject to a quality assessment in order to examine methodological rigour and were collated in line with the study's objectives. Conclusions We maintain the prevailing consensus that SEL programmes have an important role in education. However, variation in evidence quality remains high and there appear ambiguities regarding what constitutes whole school approaches. The review also highlights a novel and concerning lack of data for differentiating any subgroup effects. The review concludes with recommended novel directions for future research, including adoption of more complex trial architecture in evaluation alongside a move towards a wider plurality in methodological approach.

AB  - Sociotropy (anaclitic) and autonomy (introjective) are conceptualised as two personality dimensions that confer vulnerability to depression. According to Blatt and Beck's theories, sociotropic individuals exhibit distinctive patterns of symptoms such as prominent anxiety, depressed mood, helplessness, crying and somatic concerns, while self-critical ones seem to exhibit a pattern of symptoms including prominent guilt, hopelessness, feelings of failure and worthlessness and other cognitive symptoms. This systematic review was performed with the aim of investigating whether and to what extent psychological dimensions of anaclitic-sociotropic and introjective-autonomy are related to a specific core of depressive symptoms. The search was conducted in three databases (PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus) and 27 articles were selected. Results showed a weak association between somatic symptoms and dependent personality traits, while the relationship between self-criticism and cognitive symptomatology was significantly higher. These findings are discussed in the context of future research, necessary to corroborate the existence of a form of depression characterised by somatic features usually ignored by diagnostic criteria, essential to direct psychological treatments to these depressive personality differences.

AB  - Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, predicted to be the leading cause of disease burden by the next decade. There is great deal of emphasis on the central origin and potential therapeutics of depression whereby the symptomatology of depression has been interpreted and treated as brain generated dysfunctions filtering down to the periphery. This top-down approach has found strong support from clinical work and basic neuroscientific research. Nevertheless, despite great advances in our knowledge of the aetiology and therapeutics of depression, success in treatment is still by no means assured. As a consequence, a wide net has been cast by both clinicians and researchers in search of more efficient therapies for mood disorders. As a complementary view, the present integrative review advocates approaching mood and depression from the opposite perspective: a bottom-up view that starts from the periphery. Specifically, evidence is provided to show that sensory stimulation via the visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory systems can modulate depression. The review shows how-depending on several parameters-unisensory stimulation via these modalities can ameliorate or aggravate depressive symptoms. Moreover, the review emphasises the bidirectional relationship between sensory stimulation and depression. Just as peripheral stimulation can modulate depression, depression in turn affects-and in most cases impairs-sensory reception. Furthermore, the review suggests that combined use of multisensory stimulation may have synergistic ameliorative effects on depressive symptoms over and above what has so far been documented for unisensory stimulation.

TI  - Understanding Engagement Strategies in Digital Interventions for Mental Health Promotion: Scoping Review
KW  - digital interventions
KW  - mental health promotion
KW  - engagement
KW  - scoping review
KW  - mobile phone
KW  - DEPRESSION
AB  - Background: Digital interventions offer a solution to address the high demand for mental health promotion, especially when facing physical contact restrictions or lacking accessibility. Engagement with digital interventions is critical for their effectiveness; however, retaining users' engagement throughout the intervention is challenging. It remains unclear what strategies facilitate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion.
   Objective: Our aim is to conduct a scoping review to investigate user engagement strategies and methods to evaluate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion in adults.
   Methods: This scoping review adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews. The search was conducted in 7 electronic databases from inception to April 2020. The inclusion criteria for studies were as follows: adult (aged >= 18 years) users of digital interventions for mental health promotion from the general population; any digital intervention for mental health promotion; and user engagement strategies described in the intervention design. We extracted the following data items: study characteristics, digital intervention (type and engagement strategy), evaluation of engagement strategy (method and result specifying whether the strategy was effective at facilitating engagement), and features of engagement (extent of use and subjective experience of users).
   Results: A total of 2766 studies were identified, of which 16 (0.58%) met the inclusion criteria. The 16 studies included randomized controlled trials (6/16, 37%), studies analyzing process data (5/16, 31%), observational studies (3/16, 19%), and qualitative studies (2/16, 13%). The digital interventions for mental health promotion were either web based (12/16, 75%) or mobile app based (4/16, 25%). The engagement strategies included personalized feedback about intervention content or users' mental health status; guidance regarding content and progress through e-coaching; social forums, and interactivity with peers; content gamification; reminders; and flexibility and ease of use. These engagement strategies were deemed effective based on qualitative user feedback or responses on questionnaires or tools (4/16, 25%), usability data (5/16, 31%), or both (7/16, 44%). Most studies identified personalized support in the form of e-coaching, peer support through a social platform, personalized feedback, or joint videoconference sessions as an engaging feature.
   Conclusions: Personalized support during the intervention, access to social support, and personalized feedback seem to promote engagement with digital interventions for mental health promotion. These findings need to be interpreted with caution because the included studies were heterogeneous, had small sample sizes, and typically did not address engagement as the primary outcome. Despite the importance of user engagement for the effectiveness of digital interventions, this field has not yet received much attention. Further research is needed on the effectiveness of different strategies required to facilitate user engagement in digital interventions for mental health promotion.

AB  - Background: An association between gaming disorder (GD) and the symptoms of common mental disorders is unraveled yet. In this preregistered study, we quantitatively synthesized reliability, convergent and discriminant validity of GD scales to examine association between GD and other constructs.Methods: Five representative GD instruments (GAS-7, AICA, IGDT-10, Lemmens IGD-9, and IGDS9-SF) were chosen based on recommendations by the previous systematic review study to conduct correlation meta-analyses and reliability generalization. A systematic literature search was conducted through Pubmed, Proquest, Embase, and Google Scholar to identify studies that reported information on either reliability or correlation with related variables. 2,124 studies were full-text assessed as of October 2020, and 184 were quantitatively synthesized. Conventional Hedges two-level meta-analytic method was utilized.Results: The result of reliability generalization reported a mean coefficient alpha of 0.86 (95% CI = 0.85-0.87) and a mean test-retest estimate of 0.86 (95% CI = 0.81-0.89). Estimated effect sizes of correlation between GD and the variables were as follows: 0.33 with depression (k = 45; number of effect sizes), 0.29 with anxiety (k = 37), 0.30 with aggression (k = 19), -0.22 with quality of life (k = 18), 0.29 with loneliness (k = 18), 0.56 with internet addiction (k = 20), and 0.40 with game playtime (k = 53), respectively. The result of moderator analyses, funnel and forest plots, and publication bias analyses were also presented.Discussion and Conclusion: All five GD instruments have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Relatively few studies reported the test-retest reliability. The result of correlation meta-analysis revealed that GD scores were only moderately associated with game playtime. Common psychological problems such as depression and anxiety were found to have a slightly smaller association with GD than the gaming behavior. GD scores were strongly correlated with internet addiction. Further studies should adopt a rigorous methodological procedure to unravel the bidirectional relationship between GD and other psychopathologies.Limitations: The current study did not include gray literature. The representativeness of the five tools included in the current study could be questioned. High heterogeneity is another limitation of the study.

AB  - Due to its high ecological validity, virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a powerful tool for mental health research. Despite the wide use of VR simulations in research on mental illnesses, the study of addictive processes through the use of VR environments is still at its dawn. In a systematic literature search, we identified 38 reports of research projects using highly immersive head-mounted displays, goggles, or CAVE technologies to provide insight into treatment mechanisms of addictive behaviors. So far, VR research has mainly addressed the roles of craving, psychophysiology, affective states, cognition, and brain activity in addiction. The computer-generated VR environments offer very realistic, dynamic, interactive, and complex real-life simulations requesting active participation. They create a high sense of immersion in users by combining stereoscopic three-dimensional visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile perceptions, tracking systems responding to user movements, and social interactions. VR is an emerging tool to study how proximal multi-sensorial cues, contextual environmental cues, as well as their interaction (complex cues) modulate addictive behaviors. VR allows for experimental designs under highly standardized, strictly controlled, predictable, and repeatable conditions. Moreover, VR simulations can be personalized. They are currently refined for psychotherapeutic interventions. Embodiment, eye-tracking, and neurobiological factors represent novel future directions. The progress of VR applications has bred auspicious ways to advance the understanding of treatment mechanisms underlying addictions, which researchers have only recently begun to exploit. VR methods promise to yield significant achievements to the addiction field. These are necessary to develop more efficacious and efficient preventive and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Background: Social stress is an important environmental risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders. Social stress paradigms are commonly used in rats and mice to gain insight into the pathogenesis of these disorders. The social instability stress (SIS) paradigm entails frequent (up to several times a week) introduction of one or multiple unfamiliar same-sex home-cage partners. The subsequent recurring formation of a new social hierarchy results in chronic and unpredictable physical and social stress.
   Purpose: We compare and discuss the stress-related behavioral and physiological impact of SIS protocols in rat and mouse, and address limitations due to protocol variability. We further provide practical recommendations to optimize reproducibility of SIS protocols.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA statement in the following three databases: PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Our search strategy was not restricted to year of publication but was limited to articles in English that were published in peer-reviewed journals. Search terms included "social* instab*" AND ("animal" OR "rodent" OR "rat*" OR "mice" OR "mouse").
   Results: Thirty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. Fifteen articles used a SIS protocol in which the composition of two cage mates is altered daily for sixteen days (SIS16D). Eleven articles used a SIS protocol in which the composition of four cage mates is altered twice per week for 49 days (SIS49D). The remaining seven studies used SIS protocols that differed from these two protocols in experiment duration or cage mate quantity. Behavioral impact of SIS was primarily assessed by quantifying depressive-like, anxiety-like, social-, and cognitive behavior. Physiological impact of SIS was primarily assessed using metabolic parameters, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and the assessment of neurobiological parameters such as neuro-plasticity and neurogenesis.
   Conclusion: Both shorter and longer SIS protocols induce a wide range of stress-related behavioral and physiological impairments that are relevant for the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders. To date, SIS16D has only been reported in rats, whereas SIS49D has only been reported in mice. Given this species-specific application as well as variability in reported SIS protocols, additional studies should determine whether SIS effects are protocol duration- or species-specific. We address several issues, including a lack of consistency in the used SIS protocols, and suggest practical, concrete improvements in design and reporting of SIS protocols to increase standardization and reproducibility of this etiologically relevant preclinical model of social stress.

AB  - This large-scale quantitative review used publication data to track the presence of positive education terms over a 100+ year period across 35 psychology journals and education journals utilizing two analytical methods. First, computer-generated linguistic word count analysis identified that positive education terms have shown small but steady growth in psychology and education research for more than a century. From 1904 to 2016, positive education terms have risen consistently, with increases in 1952, 1982, 2010, and 2014 to over 4, 5, 6, and 7 percent, respectively. Four new terms were present in the top 20 most prevalent terms following the official launch of positive education in 2009: well-being, satisfaction, motivat*, and engag* (note: terms ending with an asterisk are word stems). Three terms also increased in rank order prevalence from 2009 onwards: emotion*; health; and goal*. The second analytical method involved in-depth human coding of a subset of positive education abstracts (n=2,805) by a team of five researchers(1) to identify trends pertaining to how positive education research has been conducted in terms of paradigms, designs, methods, tools, samples, and settings from 1950 to 2016. College students and students in secondary school make up the most common samples, with little research in the early childhood years. Quantitative, cross-sectional studies using self-report surveys have been the most common design and method used over the past six decades, suggesting room for growth in qualitative methods and the need for greater longitudinal and intervention designs. The human coding was also used to classify positive education variables into broader categories of research. Nine categories were identified: positive functioning; well-being; ill-being; strengths; agency; connection and belonging; identity and personality; school climate and outcomes; and demographics. By tracking positive education science over time, the current paper allows researchers to take stock of the field, identify gaps, outline areas of growth, and pursue fruitful topics for future research.

AB  - Study Basis: This evidence map presents a summary of studies that addressed the effects of meditation on various clinical and health conditions. Meditation is a contemplative practice that has been used for the promotion of health, and the treatment of different conditions.
   Method: The study is based on the search of four electronic databases for the period 1994-November 2019 and includes systematic reviews, meta-analyses, meta-syntheses, and integrative reviews. 3iE evidence gap map was the methodology of choice, and AMSTAR 2 was used for the analyses. Tableau was used to graphically display the confidence level, number of reviews, health outcomes, and intervention effects.
   Results: This map encompasses 191 studies, with Mindfulness being the key word that retrieved the highest number of results. Several meditation techniques were evaluated in different contexts, and the confidence levels of 22 studies were high, 84 were moderate, and 82 were low. Two 2 meta-syntheses and 1 integrative review were also included. Most of the studies reported positive effects and a beneficial potential of the practice of meditation. Health outcomes were divided into five groups out of which mental health and vitality, and well-being and quality of life stood out with the largest number of studies.
   Conclusions: Meditation has been applied in different areas. This Evidence Map intends to be an easy visual tool to access valuable evidence-based information on this complementary therapy for patients, health professionals, and managers.

AB  - The objective is to highlight the clinical and social outcomes among adults who suffered from Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in their childhood/adolescence. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases were searched for prospective studies published during the last 5 years addressing patients with ADHD in childhood/adolescence followed-up to adulthood. We also included studies published before 2015 reported in other reviews with similar outcomes. Thousand four-hundred and eighty-five studies were identified, but only 39 were included for qualitative analysis and 27 for quantitative analysis. Overall, we found that ADHD persisted into adulthood with a mean rate of 43% and was mainly associated with both substance/alcohol use disorders and antisocial behavior and, less frequently, with anxiety and depressive disorders. The prevalence of persistent ADHD in adulthood reported by studies published after 2011 (55%) was higher than that reported by studies published previously from 1985 to 2011 (34%), suggesting a greater focus on ADHD in recent years. Our results highlight that ADHD can be considered not only a neurodevelopmental disorder, but also a persistent and complex condition, with detrimental consequences for quality of life in adulthood.

AB  - Background: Sexualized drug use (SDU), also known as chemsex, refers to the use of psychoactive substances for sexual purposes among men who have sex with men (MSM), which has been associated with mental health symptoms. The objective of this review is to systematically review the available evidence on mental health outcomes in MSM who use sexualized drugs. Methods: To prepare this systematic review, search strategies were developed and applied to the Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus databases. A total of 117 articles were found, of which 12 were selected for the final review. Results: Those MSM who practiced SDU were more likely to experience from depression, anxiety, or a substance dependence, although these results were not found in all the studies analyzed. Among those who practiced the administration of intravenous drugs (referred to as slamsex), the mental health symptoms were more severe. Conclusions: This systematic review contributes to a fuller understanding of the mental health symptoms present in MSM who consume drugs for sexual purposes. Greater uniformity in data collection instruments is required, as well as the need to conduct a more in-depth assessment of the psychosocial adjustment of people who practice chemsex.

AB  - Purpose
   Although Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) implementation models recommend delivery of any CR treatment component, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) constitutes only 17% of globally available CR programs. The aims of this review were to assess the benefits of employing any CR treatment modality in SSA, and evaluate if this approach should be encouraged in this resource-constrained region.
   Methodology
   Records were identified electronically via CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, African journal online, PubMed, Web of science and google scholar, and grey literature was hand-searched. Articles reporting effectiveness of any CR treatment modality were included if participants had any cardiovascular disease and if the study was conducted in SSA. Quality assessment for each enrolled study was done using Downs and Black (1998) checklist and data was extracted using a modified standard tool.
   Results
   Searches identified 1666 records, 24 full text articles were examined and 10 were included for the review; 60%, 30% and 10% of the enrolled studies were done in South Africa, Nigeria and Benin respectively. The studies implemented exercise, psychosocial and education treatment modalities of CR, and the approach of delivery was either comprehensive or modified. Comprehensive CR and delivery of combined aerobic and resistance exercises improved physical (13%, p=0.001), social (40%, p=0.001) and mental aspects of quality of life and reduced anxiety (-12%, p<0.05) and depression (-6%, p<0.001) respectively. Comprehensive CR and aerobic training both reduced systolic blood pressure (range of mean reduction [RMR] -6 to -14mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (RMR -4 to -6mmHg) and resting heart rate (RMR -7 to -17bpm). Overall, all types of exercises showed a 1-5ml.kg-1.min-1 increase in peak oxygen consumption.
   Conclusion
   The findings support delivery of exercise treatment modality and comprehensive delivery of CR in SSA. However, efficacy of independent implementation of education and psychosocial therapeutic components of CR remains unclear; hence the need for further investigations.

KW  - meta-analysis
KW  - psychological stress
KW  - systematic review
AB  - Objectives: Ambient air pollution (AAP) is an important risk factor for increased mental health morbidity. Studies have highlighted the effect of AAP on psychological stress and anxiety disorder. However, existing evidence regarding this is largely equivocal. This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to synthesize published evidence to calculate the pooled estimate of the effect of AAP on psychological stress and anxiety disorder.
   Content: A systematic bibliographic search was undertaken using PubMed, JGateplus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library for observational human studies published in English till 31st March 2020 reporting the effect of AAP on psychological stress and anxiety disorder. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Meta-analysis was performed adopting a random-effects model using Meta-XL. Of 412 articles retrieved, a total of 30 articles [AAP and anxiety disorders, (n=17, 57%); AAP and psychological stress, (n=9, 30%) and AAP and both psychological stress and anxiety disorders, (n=4, 13%)] fulfilled the inclusion criteria covering a total population of 973,725 individuals. The pooled estimate (OR) of the effects of PM10 on psychological stress was 1.03 [(95% CI: 1.00, 1.05) (p=0.17, I-2=41%)]. The pooled estimate of the effects of NO2 and PM10 on anxiety disorder was 0.93 [(95% CI: 0.89, 0.97) (p=0.91, I-2=0%)] and 0.88 [(95% CI: 0.78, 0.98) (p=0.01, I-2=59%)] respectively. The pooled estimate of the effects of PM2.5 on anxiety Disorder was 0.88 [(95% CI: 0.72, 1.06) (p=0.00, I-2=80%)].
   Summary and Outlook: The present study provides the most updated pooled estimate of the effect of AAP on psychological stress and anxiety disorder. Future studies should focus on longitudinal studies conducted in LIC and LMIC countries using uniform and standardized criteria for exposure and outcome assessment as well as robust adjustment for confounders to minimize methodological heterogeneity resulting in reliable and comparable estimation of environmental mental health burden.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating worldwide effect on mental health. Recent studies correlate the spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with symptoms of depression, most prominent in postpartum women. Our systematic literature review scope is to identify the risk factors and predictors for postpartum depression (PPD) and describe the steps that should be taken to help postpartum women. This study will help clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to elucidate the predictors of PPD during this pandemic and prevent these adverse outcomes in future crises. Methods: We conducted a systematic search by employing databases PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase to identify articles published before March 2021. About 463 publications were generated during our search process and from those, 36 were reviewed, summarized, and synthesized. Studies qualified the criteria if they (1) utilized qualitative or quantitative design, (2) explored the risk factors for PPD, and (3) were written in English. Quality evaluation of each study was achieved by using criteria set by Lincoln and Guba. Results: Prevalence of depression symptoms ranged from 7% to 80.8% in postpartum women during the SARS-COV 2 pandemic. The risk factors for PPD were classified into 6 major categories: socio-demographic, psychological, pre-existing pathology, metabolic factors, previous events of miscarriage, and media misinformation. Conclusion: It is extremely vital to care for women's mental health during pregnancy and after childbirth during these unprecedented times. This review urges the need to design adequate interventions for this vulnerable population to prevent negative consequences of PPD.

We evaluated narrative, systematic and meta-analytic reviews of key research methodologies and how they relate to current approaches for personalising CBT, specifically. Preliminary evidence of predictors (severity of primary disorder, social anxiety disorder (SoAD), comorbid depression, parental psychopathology, parental involvement and duration of treatment), moderators (type of primary disorder) and mediators (self-talk, coping, problem-solving and comorbid symptoms) of CBT outcomes provides content for several personalised approaches to treatment. Finally, we present a novel conceptual model depicting the state of personalised intervention research in childhood anxiety and propose a research agenda for continued progress.

AB  - Museums and cultural institutions are increasingly striving to respond to the interests and needs of the society that hosts them. This means, apart from other actions, that these institutions must be involved in the health and wellbeing of society, and the creation of cultural activities aimed at people with cognitive impairment, a group of individuals that is growing worldwide due to the aging of society and the increasing prevalence of dementia. The involved sectors are aware of the potential and benefits of activities for this population, even though there is much research to be conducted. To date, no systematic review has focused on the benefits of cultural activities for cognitively impaired people. This study aimed to explore the benefits of different modalities of cultural activities with evidence from 145 studies from various databases, which met the inclusion criteria. Significant improvements in general cognition, quality of life (QoL), emotional wellbeing, socialization, and communication were generally reported after interventions, with a reduction in depression symptoms. There was not enough evidence to prove memory, language, or daily functioning improvements attributable to cultural interventions. There were no significant reductions reported in apathy, sadness, agitation, or anxiety.

AB  - Although the emotional consequences of childhood exposure to parental alienation behaviors in children and adolescents of divorced parents are known, there is scarce evidence on their long-term consequences in adulthood. Therefore, this work aims to conduct a systematic review of the state of research in this area and its main conclusions and identify gaps and limitations to guide future research. A search of the literature was performed in electronic databases PsycInfo, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, DART-Europe, ProQuest, Wiley, TESEO and Dialnet, and a secondary review of the bibliography; in February 2019 updated in December of the same year. Thirteen pieces of research were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria; twelve published articles from journals and one doctoral thesis, both with qualitative and quantitative methodology. Children exposed to parental interference and alienation show in adulthood depression and anxiety symptoms, a higher risk of psychopathology, lower self-esteem and self-sufficiency. As well as, higher alcohol and drug use rates, parental relationship difficulties, insecure attachment, lower life quality, higher divorce rates, feelings of loss, abandonment and guilt. They also report repetition of these alienating behaviors on their children by their partner or their own children's grandparents. Some limitations of the study are described, and proposals are made for future research.

Individual difference variables, such as personality and temperament have been found playing prominent role in modifying the psychological and biological aspects of infertility. This systematic review aimed to examine evidence-based research on the role of personality traits in determining vulnerability to stress in infertility, understand the gender-based differences, and deliver suggestions for future researches. Method The search for studies relating to the variables was accomplished using various electronic databases. The search was kept limited to a time span of about 20 years, that is, from January 2000 to April 2020. Additional researches were collected from library source and others were retrieved by contacting experts. Studies were selected on the basis of a predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and quality of the studies was also taken into account. Results The search of studies through above methods was fruitful in identifying 23 studies including six longitudinal and prospective studies, and 17 cross-sectional studies covering both individual- and model-based personality attributes related findings. The overall quality ratings of the studies ranged from fair to good. Conclusion The review revealed that personality factors such as neuroticism, harm avoidance, and psychoticism are the potential risk factors, whereas optimism has a protective impact in the context of fertility disorders. The long-term impact of personality on infertility needs further exploration. Trait modification interventions during the treatment of infertility were also suggested in the light of previous findings.

AB  - Persons with tuberculosis (TB) also often have a mental disorder (MD). We examined TB-MD comorbidity prevalence and its impact on TB treatment outcomes as reported in studies set in the United States or in the top five countries of origin (Mexico, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, and China) for non-US-born persons with TB. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, OVID, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus for articles published from database inception through September 2018. Of the 9 studies analyzed, one was set in the United States. The estimated pooled prevalence of comorbid TB-MD from eight non-US studies, with 2921 participants, was 34.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 21.1%-49.5%]. Comorbid TB-MD prevalence varied by country in the studies evaluated. Additional research might elucidate the extent of TB-MD in the United States and the top five countries of origin.

AB  - Purpose This systematic review summarizes and presents the current state of research quantifying the relationship between mental disorder and overdose for people who use opioids. Methods The protocol was published in Open Science Framework. We used the PECOS framework to frame the review question. Studies published between January 1, 2000, and January 4, 2021, from North America, Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand were systematically identified and screened through searching electronic databases, citations, and by contacting experts. Risk of bias assessments were performed. Data were synthesized using the lumping technique. Results Overall, 6512 records were screened and 38 were selected for inclusion. 37 of the 38 studies included in this review show a connection between at least one aspect of mental disorder and opioid overdose. The largest body of evidence exists for internalizing disorders generally and mood disorders specifically, followed by anxiety disorders, although there is also moderate evidence to support the relationship between thought disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and opioid overdose. Moderate evidence also was found for the association between any disorder and overdose. Conclusion Nearly all reviewed studies found a connection between mental disorder and overdose, and the evidence suggests that having mental disorder is associated with experiencing fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose, but causal direction remains unclear.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this narrative review is to gain insight into the appropriate intervention targets when parents of infants and young children suffer from psychopathology.Background: Psychopathology in parents is a risk factor for maladaptive parenting and is strongly related to negative cascade effects on parent-child interactions and relations in the short and long term. Children in their first years of life are especially at risk. However, in adult mental health care, this knowledge is rarely translated into practice, which is a missed opportunity for prevention.Methods: Electronic databases were searched for reviews and meta-analysis. In addition, sources were obtained via manual search, reference mining, expert opinion, and communications from conferences. In total, 56 papers, whereof 23 reviews and 12 meta-analyses were included.Results: Findings regarding targets of intervention were identified in different interacting domains, namely the parental, family, child, and environmental domains as well as the developing parent-child relationship. A "one size fits all" intervention is not appropriate. A flexible, tailored, resource-oriented intervention program, multi-faceted in addressing all modifiable risk factors and using different methods (individual, dyadic, group), seems to provide the best results.Conclusion: To address the risk factors in different domains, adult and child mental health care providers should work together in close collaboration to treat the whole family including mental disorders, relational, and contextual problems. A multi-agency approach that includes social services is needed.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted telemedicine use for mental illness (telemental health).Objective: In the scoping review, we describe the scope and domains of telemental health during the COVID-19 pandemic from the published literature and discuss associated challenges.Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and the World Health Organization's Global COVID-19 Database were searched up to August 23, 2020 with no restrictions on study design, language, or geographical, following an a priori protocol (). Data were synthesized using descriptive statistics from the peer-reviewed literature and the National Quality Forum's (NQF) framework for telemental health. Sentiment analysis was also used to gauge patient and healthcare provider opinion toward telemental health.Results: After screening, we identified 196 articles, predominantly from high-income countries (36.22%). Most articles were classified as commentaries (51.53%) and discussed telemental health from a management standpoint (86.22%). Conditions commonly treated with telemental health were depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Where data were available, most articles described telemental health in a home-based setting (use of telemental health at home by patients). Overall sentiment was neutral-to-positive for the individual domains of the NQF framework.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there was a marked growth in the uptake of telemental health during the pandemic and that telemental health is effective, safe, and will remain in use for the foreseeable future. However, more needs to be done to better understand these findings. Greater investment into human and financial resources, and research should be made by governments, global funding agencies, academia, and other stakeholders, especially in low- and middle- income countries. Uniform guidelines for licensing and credentialing, payment and insurance, and standards of care need to be developed to ensure safe and optimal telemental health delivery. Telemental health education should be incorporated into health professions curricula globally. With rapidly advancing technology and increasing acceptance of interactive online platforms amongst patients and healthcare providers, telemental health can provide sustainable mental healthcare across patient populations.Systematic Review Registration: .

AB  - Background: Increased prevalence of mental disorders has become a significant public health concern. Recent studies have linked nutrition to depression and anxiety, suggesting that dietary changes or nutritional supplementation may be beneficial in improving mental disorders. Polyphenols have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may counteract physiological changes in depression and anxiety. This study examined the effectiveness of polyphenol supplementation in improving depression, anxiety and quality of life (QoL).Methods: Randomized controlled trials in English and with polyphenol supplementation as the intervention were searched. The primary outcome was depression, and secondary outcomes were anxiety and QoL. Only studies of at least moderate quality based on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database tool were included. Comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were then used to determine the effect of polyphenol supplementations on improving depression, anxiety and quality of life (QoL) in patients with depression.Results: Nineteen studies with 1,523 participants were included; 18 studies (n = 1,523) were included in the depression meta-analysis, and 5 (n = 188) and 6 (n = 391) in the QoL and anxiety meta-analyses, respectively. Twelve of the 18 studies found significant improvements in depression with polyphenol use, while the meta-analyses results also indicated that polyphenol supplementation significantly improved depression score as compared to control conditions (MD: -2.280, 95% CI: -1.759, -0.133, I-2 = 99.465). Although subgroup analyses were conducted a significantly high heterogeneity was still found amongst subgroups. Only 2 of the 5 studies found significant improvements in QoL following polyphenol supplementation and meta-analyses found that polyphenol use did not benefit QoL (MD: -1.344, p < 0.05, I-2 = 55.763). For anxiety, 5 of the 6 studies found significant reductions in depression score following polyphenol use but meta-analyses found no significant differences in anxiety score (MD: -0.705, CI: -1.897, 0.487, I-2 = 84.06) between polyphenol supplementation and control.Conclusion: The results suggest that polyphenol supplementation is effective in improving depression. Physical illness may act as a risk factor that worsens depression, suggesting the need for preventative supplementation to improve depression. Polyphenol types may have varying effects, which suggests that different populations with depression may benefit from different polyphenols.

AB  - Diabetes has been associated with affective disorders which complicate the management of the disease. Emotional intelligence (EI), or the ability to perceive, facilitate, understand, and regulate emotions, has shown to be a protective factor of emotional disorders in general population. The main objective of this study was to systematically review the role of the EI construct in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics and to observe how EI is related to biological and psychological variables. Comprehensive searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, and Cochrane without time limitations, for studies examining the link between diabetes and EI. A total of 12 eligible studies were selected according to the inclusion criteria. We divided the results into four sections: (1) EI and hemoglobin glycosylated (HbA1c), (2) EI training effects, (3) differences in EI between persons with diabetes and without diabetes, and (4) EI and psychological adjustment and well-being. The results showed negative correlations between EI and HbA1c, positive effects of EI training on quality of life, anxiety, and glycemic control, no differences in EI between people with diabetes and healthy individuals, and, finally, negative correlations between EI and different psychological variables such as diabetes-related anxiety and distress, and positive correlations with quality of life, well-being, and marital satisfaction. This systematic review offers a starting point for a theoretical and practical understanding of the role played by EI in the management of diabetes and reveals that EI is a promising protective factor for biological and psychological variables in this population.

AB  - COVID-19 represents a threat to public health and the mental health of the aged population. Prevalence and risk factors of depression and anxiety have been reported in previous reviews in other populations; however, a systematic review on the factors associated with depression and anxiety in older adults is not currently present in the literature. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest Psychology Database, Science Direct, Cochrane Library and SciELO databases (23 February 2021). The results were obtained by entering a combination of MeSH or Emtree terms with keywords related to COVID-19, elderly, depression and anxiety in the databases. A total of 11 studies were included in the systematic review. Female gender, loneliness, poor sleep quality and poor motor function were identified as factors associated with both depression and anxiety. Aspects related to having a stable and high monthly income represent protective factors for both depression and anxiety, and exercising was described as protective for depression. This study synthesised information and analysed the main factors associated with depression and anxiety in the older population during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the cross-sectional design of most of the included studies does not allow a causal relationship between the factors analysed and depression or anxiety.

AB  - (1) Background: Following natural disasters, women have a higher prevalence of adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Given that the South and Southeast Asia regions are highly disaster prone, a review was undertaken to identify the potential health impact and key risk factors affecting women after disasters in the countries located in South and Southeast Asia regions. (2) Methods: A systematic literature search of four databases yielded 16 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidance, between July 2008 and March 2021. (3) Results: The majority of studies reported women's negative/poor mental health, identifying a significant association of socio-demographics, during disaster exposure, post-disaster, and pre-existing risk factors. The six most-cited influences on women's mental health found in the reviewed literature were being female, adult age group, having no formal education, poverty or low economic status, poor physical health/physical injuries, and death of family members. Women's health during the post-disaster period was generally reported as poor among all the countries of the South and Southeast Asia regions. (4) Conclusions: Appropriate social support and the availability of free healthcare access for women are warranted in disaster-affected areas. This review offers a valuable contribution to the knowledge of women's health complications/challenges and associated risk factors related to disasters, essential for the development of strategies to help reduce this burden in the future. Further research is required on natural disasters to identify ways to reduce women's health impacts after natural disasters, especially in the context of low-income and lower-middle-income countries.

AB  - Adversity early in life is common and is a major risk factor for the onset of psychopathology. Delineating the neurodevelopmental pathways by which early adversity affects mental health is critical for early risk identification and targeted treatment approaches. A rapidly growing cross species literature has facilitated advances in identifying the mechanisms linking adversity with psychopathology, specific dimensions of adversity and timing-related factors that differentially relate to outcomes, and protective factors that buffer against the effects of adversity. Yet, vast complexity and heterogeneity in early environments and neurodevelopmental trajectories contribute to the challenges of understanding risk and resilience in the context of early adversity. In this overview, the author highlights progress in four major areas-mechanisms, heterogeneity, developmental timing, and protective factors; synthesizes key challenges; and provides recommendations for future research that can facilitate progress in the field. Translation across species and ongoing refinement of conceptual models have strong potential to inform prevention and intervention strategies that can reduce the immense burden of psychopathology associated with early adversity.

AB  - The association between sleep problems, particularly sleep disorders, and mental health has long been studied and recognized. However, the causal relationship between sleep disorders, particularly during early childhood, on mental health problems in adolescence are yet to be established. From a preventive perspective, it is important to understand the causality of mental health problems in adolescents so that intervention measures can be derived and implemented as early as possible for maximum effectiveness. To provide more precise information on the effect of early childhood sleep disorders on mental health problems during adolescence, a systematic review was conducted on longitudinal and prospective studies reported in the literature. Following the PRISMA guidelines with an extensive search of the literature 26 studies were identified. Seven of these identified studies satisfied all selection criteria with sufficient data on the effect of early childhood sleep disorders and mental health problems in adolescence. Information was extracted and analyzed systematically from each study and tabulated. The overall results obtained from these studies indicate a significant and possible causal relationship between early childhood sleep disorders and the development of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD in adolescence. These results are discussed with regards to the theoretical and practical implications as well as preventive strategies.

AB  - Purpose of review In order to promote optimal development of children and adolescents at risk for psychiatric disorders, a better understanding of the concept resilience is crucial. Here, we provide an overview of recent work on clinical and epidemiological correlates of resilience and mental health in children and adolescents. Recent findings Our systematic literature search revealed 25 studies that unanimously show that higher levels of resilience are related to fewer mental health problems, despite the heterogeneity of study populations and instruments. Correlates of resilience included multisystem factors, such as social, cultural, family and individual aspects, which is in line with the multisystem approach as described by recent resilience theories. Longitudinal studies are scarce but confirm the dynamical character of resilience and mental health. The application of longitudinal studies and innovative measurement techniques will improve our understanding on the cascade effects of stressors on resilience and mental health outcomes. Resilience is strongly associated with mental health in children and adolescents and deserves a more prominent role in research, prevention programs and routine clinical care. Including social, cultural and family context in the evaluation of resilience is of great value, as this can identify targets for early and preventive interventions.

AB  - Background: Smartphones play a critical role in increasing human-machine interactions, with many advantages. However, the growing popularity of smartphone use has led to smartphone overuse and addiction. This review aims to systematically investigate the impact of smartphone addiction on health outcomes. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to carry out the systematic review. Five electronic databases including Medline, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus were searched to identify eligible studies. Eligible studies were screened against predetermined inclusion criteria and data were extracted according to the review questions. This review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020181404). The quality of the articles was assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: A total of 27 of 2550 articles met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies were cross-sectional and focused on physical, mental, and neurological health outcomes. The majority of the studies focused on mental health outcomes and consistent associations were observed between smartphone addiction and several mental health outcomes. Anxiety and depression were commonly found to mediate mental health problems. A wide range of physical health sequelae was also associated with smartphone addiction. Furthermore, there was an association between smartphone addiction and neurological disorders. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are consistent associations between smartphone addiction and physical and mental health, especially mental health. Social awareness campaigns about smartphone addiction and its impact on physical and mental health are needed. Further studies, especially randomized controlled trials, are warranted to validate the impacts of smartphone addiction.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe psychiatric disorder, which can be associated with music-related symptoms. Music may also be used as an adjunct treatment for OCD. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature review exploring the relationship between music and OCD by using three online databases: PubMed, the Web of Science, and PsycINFO. The search terms were "obsessive compulsive disorder", "OCD", "music", and "music therapy". A total of 27 articles were utilised (n = 650 patients/study participants) and grouped into three categories. The first category comprised case reports of patients with musical obsessions in patients with OCD. Most patients were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or a combination of an SSRI and another pharmacological or a non-pharmacological treatment, with variable success. Studies on the music perception of people with OCD or obsessive-compulsive personality traits represented the second category. People with OCD or obsessive-compulsive personality traits seem to be more sensitive to tense music and were found to have an increased desire for harmony in music. Three small studies on music therapy in people with OCD constituted the third category. These studies suggest that patients with OCD might benefit from music therapy, which includes listening to music.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Evidence indicates that mood disorders often co-occur with substance-related disorders. However, pooling comorbidity estimates can be challenging due to heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria and in the overall study design. The aim of this study was to systematically review and, where appropriate, meta-analyse estimates related to the pairwise comorbidity between mood disorders and substance-related disorders, after sorting these estimates by various study designs. Methods: We searched PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science for publications between 1980 and 2017 regardless of geographical location and language. We meta-analysed estimates from original articles in 4 broadly defined mood and 35 substance-related disorders. Results: After multiple eligibility steps, we included 120 studies for quantitative analysis. In general, regardless of variations in diagnosis type, temporal order or use of adjustments, there was substantial comorbidity between mood and substance-related disorders. We found a sixfold elevated risk between broadly defined mood disorder and drug dependence (odds ratio = 5.7) and fivefold risk between depression and cannabis dependence (odds ratio = 4.9) while the highest pooled estimate, based on period prevalence risk, was found between broadly defined dysthymic disorder and drug dependence (odds ratio = 11.3). Based on 56 separate meta-analyses, all pooled odds ratios were above 1, and 46 were significantly greater than 1 (i.e. the 95% confidence intervals did not include 1). Conclusion: This review found robust and consistent evidence of an increased risk of comorbidity between many combinations of mood and substance-related disorders. We also identified a number of under-researched mood and substance-related disorders, suitable for future scrutiny. This review reinforces the need for clinicians to remain vigilant in order to promptly identify and treat these common types of comorbidity.

AB  - The network theory of psychopathology proposes that mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. This theory provides a promising framework to understand the development and maintenance of mental disorders such as depression. In this narrative review, we summarize the literature on network studies in the field of depression. Four methodological network approaches are distinguished: (i) studies focusing on symptoms at the macro-level vs. (ii) on momentary states at the micro-level, and (iii) studies based on cross-sectional vs. (iv) time-series (dynamic) data. Fifty-six studies were identified. We found that different methodological approaches to network theory yielded largely inconsistent findings on depression. Centrality is a notable exception: the majority of studies identified either positive affect or anhedonia as central nodes. To aid future research in this field, we outline a novel complementary network theory, the momentary affect dynamics (MAD) network theory, to understand the development of depression. Furthermore, we provide directions for future research and discuss if and how networks might be used in clinical practice. We conclude that more empirical network studies are needed to determine whether the network theory of psychopathology can indeed enhance our understanding of the underlying structure of depression and advance clinical treatment.</p>

AB  - Stress has a major negative impact on the development of psychopathology and contributes to the onset of adverse physical conditions. Timely recognition and monitoring of stress-related problems are therefore important, especially in client populations that are more vulnerable to stress, such as people with mild intellectual disabilities (MID). Recent research on the use of physiological measures to assess stress levels emphasize that, in addition to these measures, self-report instruments are necessary to gain insight into the individual perception and impact of stress on daily life. However, there is no current overview of self-report stress measures that focus on the experience of stress in the present moment or in daily life. To provide an overview of the existing self-report stress measures for clinicians and researchers, a scoping review was conducted. In addition, to advise clinical professionals on the use of self-report measures of stress for people with MID, the results of an expert consultation were used to refine the preliminary findings. A systematic scoping literature search resulted in a total of 13 self-reported stress measures that met the final inclusion criteria, of which three were developed specifically for assessing stress in adults with MID (GAS-ID, LI, and SAS-ID). For each included self-report stress measure, the psychometric quality, assessment procedure, and suitability for adults with MID were reported. These were supplemented by the findings from the expert consultation. Implications for clinical practice on the use of self-report stress measures, particularly for people with MID, are discussed. Recommendations for future research and development are given.

AB  - Objective: Chronic physical illness affects not only patients but also their partners. Dyadic coping (DC)-the ways couples cope in dealing with a stressor such as chronic illness-has received increased attention over the last three decades. The aim of the current study was to summarize the state of research on DC in couples with chronic physical illnesses.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies published between 1990 and 2020, assessing DC in couples affected by severe physical illnesses. We used DC and related search terms for the literature search in Psycinfo, Psyndex, and Medline. Five thousand three hundred thirty studies were identified in three electronic databases and 49 of these were included in the review (5,440 individuals reported on 2,820 dyads). We excluded studies on cancer, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis because of existing reviews in the respective fields. Half of the studies included were on diabetes. Other studies were on arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Huntington's disease, lupus erythematosus, Parkinson's disease, renal diseases, stroke, and endometriosis. Two raters extracted data using a predefined protocol, including study quality. Results were collated in a narrative synthesis organized by illness and DC operationalization.
   Results: Overall, DC was associated with beneficial outcomes in physical health, well-being, and relationship satisfaction. Differential effects became apparent for certain chronic conditions potentially depending on certain disease characteristics, such as early-onset, sudden-onset, or life-threatening conditions.
   Conclusion: Facing challenges together as a couple seemed indispensable for adapting to a diverse range of demands related to chronic illnesses with some specific demands of particular chronic diseases. There is a need for the development of truly dyadic interventions with an eye on the specific challenges of the various chronic conditions.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study is twofold. Our first aim is to provide an overview of the prevalence rate of depression in a wide array of helping professions. Our second aim is to identify work organization conditions that seem to be associated with this depression risk. Methods Four databases were searched (CINAHL, PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science) yielding 87,626 records in total. We were interested in identifying depression prevalence rates and work-related variables that have been found to contribute to depression in helping professions. Results In total, this systematic review included 17,437 workers in more than 29 countries. Depression prevalence rate varied between 2.5% and 91.30%. The two most frequently reported professions were nurses and doctors with 73.83% and 30.84% of studies including nurses and doctors in their sample. Work factors contributing to depression included: skill utilization, decision authority, psychological demands, physical demands, number of hours worked, work schedule (irregular or regular), work schedule (daytime or night time), social support from coworkers, social support from supervisor and the family, job insecurity, recognition, job promotion, and bullying. Conclusion The results of this study highlight alarmingly high rates of depression in helping professions and should serve as a reminder to pay close attention to the mental health of those workers. Investing in employees' mental health by preventing and reducing depression risk could prove to be a valuable investment from an employer's point of view, as it is likely to increase productivity and reduce absenteeism among a host of other positive outcomes.

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorder is the most prevalent mental disorder in children and adolescents. However, evidence for efficacy and acceptability between individual cognitive behavior therapy (I-CBT) and group cognitive behavior therapy (G-CBT) in anxiety disorders in children and adolescents remains unclear.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Methods: Eight electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and LILACS) were searched from inception to October 2019. Randomized controlled trials comparing I-CBT with G-CBT for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents were included. The primary outcomes were efficacy (mean change in anxiety symptom scores) at post-treatment and acceptability (all-cause discontinuation). The secondary outcome was remission at post-treatment. Subgroup analyses were also conducted to examine whether the result would be influenced by age, number of treatment sessions, parental involvement, male/female sex, and number of participants.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Results: Nine studies were selected in this meta-analysis. The pooled analyses indicated no significant difference between I-CBT and G-CBT for efficacy at post-treatment [standardized mean difference (SMD), -0.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.37 to 0.09], acceptability [odds ratio (OR), 1.30; 95% CI, 0.61-2.77], and remission at post-treatment (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.79-1.66). In the subgroup analysis of age, I-CBT was significantly more effective than G-CBT in adolescents at post-treatment (SMD, -0.77; 95% CI, -1.51 to -0.02), but not in children (SMD, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.20). However, the findings were not materially different from those of the efficacy subgroup analysis of number of treatment sessions, parental involvement, male/female sex, and number of participants.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Conclusions: Based on those current evidence, I-CBT was shown to be more beneficial than G-CBT for anxiety disorders in adolescents, but not in children. However, further well-designed clinical studies should be performed to confirm these findings.</p>

The meta-analysis of prevalence of suicidal ideation was done using random effect model. The search returned 972 records, we examined 106 in full text and included 38 studies describing 120,076 participants. Nineteen studies described suicide or attempted self-harm, mostly in case reports. Out of 19 studies describing suicidal ideations, 12 provided appropriate data for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation in these studies was 12.1% (CI 9.3-15.2). Main risk factors for suicidal ideations were: low social support, high physical and mental exhaustion and poorer self-reported physical health in frontline medical workers, sleep disturbances, quarantine and exhaustion, loneliness, and mental health difficulties. We provide first meta-analytic estimate of suicidal ideation based on large sample from different countries and populations. The rate of suicidal ideations during COVID pandemic is higher than that reported in studies on general popu-lation prior to pandemic and may result in higher suicide rates in future.

AB  - Background: According to the WHO, the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on the mental health of individuals, such as an exacerbation of existing difficulties. Individuals with ADHD may be specifically challenged by the pandemic. Aims: To provide a systematic review of evidence regarding the COVID-19's impact on mental health of individuals with ADHD during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: This registered review (PROSPERO ID CRD42021238770) adhered to Prisma guidelines. Systematic searches in electronic databases PubMed and PsycINFO were carried out. A total of 12 studies covering 3,028 subjects were included. Results: COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased ADHD symptoms and psychological difficulties. Some studies reported that individuals experienced positive outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies was low to moderate. Conclusion: COVID-19 can affect the mental health of individuals with ADHD negatively, although methodological limitations should be considered. Further research should generate knowledge about long-term effects impact of the pandemic and about appropriate support.

AB  - Background Given the wide range of depressive disorders, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in various military studies around the world, determining the exact prevalence of these disorders in line with health planning as well as care and treatment service designing for military forces can be useful. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to determine the pooled prevalence of depressive disorders, suicide thoughts, and attempts in the military. Methods The present systematic review and meta-analysis study was performed based on PRISMA criteria in 5 steps of the search strategy, screening and selection of articles, data extraction, evaluation of article quality and meta-analysis. International databases (PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Web of science, Embase (Elsevier), PsycInfo (Ovid), Cochrane CENTRAL (Ovid)) were searched using related keywords extracted from Mesh and Emtree. After screening and final selection of articles, data were extracted and qualitative evaluation was performed using the NOS checklist. Results The results of meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression in active military forces and veterans was 23% (%95 CI: 20-26%) and 20% (%95 CI: 18-22%), respectively. In addition, the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in the military was 11% (%95 CI: 10-13%) and 11% (%95 CI: 9-13%), respectively. The prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts in drug-using military was 18% (%95 CI: 7-33%) and 30% (%95 CI: 23-36%), respectively. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in military consuming alcohol were 9% (%95 CI: 4-13%) and 8% (%95 CI: 7-10%), respectively. In militaries with AIDS / HIV, the prevalence of suicide attempts was 5% (%95 CI: 4-8%). Conclusion Therefore, it is necessary to develop and design training and intervention programs in order to increase the awareness of the military, especially veterans, to prevent the occurrence of suicide and depression.

AB  - The transition to adulthood is typically marked by changes in relationships with family members, peers, and romantic partners. Despite this, the family often maintains a prominent role in young adults' lives. A scoping review was conducted to identify the factors that influence families' ability or capacity to provide young people with emotional support during the transition to adulthood, and to understand the gaps in this research area. Title and abstract searches were conducted from January 2007 to February 2021 in multiple databases, including PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Sociological Abstracts. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were also conducted with stakeholders (professionals from relevant sectors/working within this field). In total, 277 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. Following data extraction, 19 factors were identified. Factors with the most research (more than 20 articles) included: family proximity or co-residence; mental health; sex or gender differences; and family communication. Factors with less research included: societal context; young person's sexual orientation or gender identity; social networks; and adverse life events. Gaps in the research area were also identified, including methodological issues (e.g., lack of mixed methods and longitudinal study designs), a disproportionate focus on the parent-child relationship, and a lack of contextually situated research. Our findings indicate that future research in this area could benefit from taking an intersectional, multi-method approach, with a focus on the whole family and diverse samples.

AB  - Background: The objective of this review was to identify and synthesize the findings of the existing literature that highlighted the psychosocial and mental health issues of the migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Materials and Methods: An exploration of the PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google search, and some other manual searches was undertaken so that no relevant study was missed. A search on Indian scientific literature and cross-references retrieved was also conducted to get further information. The period of the search has been one year from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. The database was searched with the terms "migrants," "migrant workers," "COVID-19 pandemic," "lockdown," "migrant population," "mental health issues," "psychosocial issues" to retrieve the published literature. Results: Initially, 48 research articles were retrieved and 10 of them were excluded as they had no sufficient information about mental and psychosocial challenges faced by the migrants. In the remaining 38 articles, 9 articles were original research work (n = 9) published from India related to the impact of COVID-19 on migrants. The second category consisted of editorials or commentary or letters to the editor or policy paper on psychosocial and mental health aspects of migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 17). The third category was 11 articles on perspectives or opinions or viewpoints (n = 11) related to various psychosocial and mental health issues among migrants in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Predominantly psychosocial issues found among migrants were living conditions, basic needs, family concerns, and joblessness. The mental health issues found among migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic included psychological distress, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders. Conclusion: Existing literature from India has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the psychosocial and mental health status of the migrants in India. This review suggests the need for more research work from the affected states of India and the development of psychosocial and mental health intervention strategies to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants.

AB  - Both malnutrition and poor mental health are leading sources of global mortality, disease, and disability. The fields of global food security and nutrition (FSN) and mental health have historically been seen as separate fields of research. Each have undergone substantial transformation, especially from clinical, primary care orientations to wider, sociopolitical approaches to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. In recent years, the trajectories of research on mental health and FSN are further evolving into an intersection of evidence. FSN impacts mental health through various pathways such as food insecurity and nutrients important for neurotransmission. Mental health drives FSN outcomes, for example through loss of motivation and caregiving capacities. They are also linked through a complex and interrelated set of determinants. However, the heterogeneity of the evidence base limits inferences about these important dynamics. Furthermore, interdisciplinary projects and programmes are gaining ground in methodology and impact, but further guidance in integration is much needed. An evidence-driven conceptual framework should inform hypothesis testing and programme implementation. The intersection of mental health and FSN can be an opportunity to invest holistically in advancing thinking in both fields.

AB  - Background Current first-line treatments for paediatric depression demonstrate mild-to-moderate effectiveness. This has spurred a growing body of literature on lifestyle recommendations pertaining to nutrition, sleep and exercise for treating paediatric depression. Aims Paediatric depression clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were reviewed for quality and to catalogue recommendations on nutrition, sleep and exercise made by higher-quality CPGs. Method Searches were conducted in Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL, and grey literature CPGs databases for relevant CPGs. Eligible CPGs with a minimum or high-quality level, as determined by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, Second Edition instrument, were included if they were (a) paediatric; (b) CPGs, practice parameter or consensus or expert committee recommendations; (c) for depression; (d) the latest version and (e) lifestyle recommendations for nutrition, sleep or exercise. Key information extracted included author(s), language, year of publication, country, the institutional body issuing the CPG, target disorder, age group, lifestyle recommendation and the methods used to determine CPG lifestyle recommendations. Results Ten paediatric CPGs for depression with a minimum or high-quality level contained recommendations on nutrition, sleep or exercise. Lifestyle recommendations were predominately qualitative, with quantitative details only outlined in two CPGs for exercise. Most recommendations were brief general statements, with 50% lacking supporting evidence from the literature. Conclusions Interest in lifestyle interventions for treatment in child and youth depression is growing. However, current CPG lifestyle recommendations for nutrition, sleep or exercise are based on expert opinion rather than clinical trials.

AB  - Modern society is reviving the practice of aromatherapy, and lavender is reported being the most worldwide purchased plant for essential oil (EO) extraction. Since recent studies reported cognitive enhancing effects of lavender besides the hypno-inducing effects, a literature review is needed. Considering EO quality and diffusion devices, we conducted a systematic review on the effects of lavender EO inhalation on arousal, attention and memory in healthy subjects. Starting from this new multidisciplinary perspective, cognitive effects were reviewed to link outcomes to effective and reproducible protocols. A systematic search on MEDLINE, ERIC, PsycInfo, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases using Cognitive Atlas and plant-related keywords was conducted. Among the 1,203 articles yielded, 11 met eligibility criteria. Subjects administered with lavender EO displayed arousal decrease and sustained attention increase. Controversial results emerged regarding memory. Lack of EO quality assessment and protocols heterogeneity did not allow assessing whether different EO composition differentially modulates cognition and whether placebo effect can be discerned from EO effect itself. However, GABAergic pathway modulation exerted by linalool, a major lavender EO constituent, might explain cognitive functions empowerment. We speculate aromatherapy could be a burgeoning cognition enhancing tool, although further investigation is required to reach robust conclusions.

AB  - A number of authors consider that exploring the interconnections between social representations and emotions is essential. However, both empirical and theoretical contributions have focused on specific aspects of these concepts and thus offer a narrow view of their articulation. Moreover, these are published in different languages, making it difficult to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the subject. Consequently, this article adopts a broader approach through a literature review articulating social representations and emotions. This is based on a search of various databases, conducted between March and April 2020 and using the terms "social representation" and "emotion" (or affect, mood, or feeling) in their singular and plural forms, both in French and in English. As a result, 41 references explicitly mentioned both terms and were published in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish were collected. This brought to light two lines of inquiry that structure this field of research: the first focuses on the role of emotions in the emergence, dynamics, and functioning of social representations, while the second explores how social representations determine emotions or emotional processes. These perspectives will be discussed from both a theoretical and methodological standpoint with the aim of highlighting new avenues for research.

AB  - Background: Eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems resulting from nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a major environmental stressor across the globe. In this systematic review, we compiled and synthesized literature on sestonic and benthic chlorophyll a (chl-a) responses to total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the water column in streams and rivers to provide a state-of-the-science summary of nutrient impacts on these endpoints. This review was motivated by the need for comprehensive information on stressor-response relationships for the most common nutrient and biotic response measures used by state-level environmental managers in the United States to assess eutrophication of lotic ecosystems and support environmental decision making.
   Methods: Searches for peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed articles were conducted using bibliographic databases, specialist websites, and search engines. These returns were supplemented with citation mapping and requests for material from experts. Articles were screened for relevance using pre-determined eligibility criteria, and risk of bias was evaluated for each included article based on study type-specific criteria. Narrative summaries and meta-analysis were used to evaluate four primary stressor-response relationships: TN-benthic chl-a, TP-benthic chl-a, TN-sestonic chl-a, and TP-sestonic chl-a. Potential effects of modifying factors and study validity on review conclusions were assessed via sensitivity and sub-group analysis and meta-regression.
   Results: Meta-analysis of 105 articles, representing 439 cause-effect pairs, showed that mean effect sizes of both benthic and sestonic chl-a responses to TN and TP were positive. Of the four stressor-response relationships examined, TP-sestonic chl-a had the most positive relationship, followed by TN-benthic chl-a, TN-sestonic chl-a, and TP-benthic chl-a. For individual U.S. states, mean effect sizes for the four stressor-response relationships were mostly positive, with a few exceptions. Chlorophyll measurement method had a moderately significant influence on mean effect size for TP-sestonic chl-a, with chl-a responding more strongly to TP if fluorometry versus spectrophotometry was used. Year of publication had a significant negative effect on mean effect size, as did mean nutrient concentration for both sestonic chl-a nutrient relationships. When the same study measured both TN and TP, chl-a tended to respond similarly to both nutrients. Sensitivity analysis indicated that conclusions are robust to studies with high risk of bias.
   Conclusions: This systematic review confirms that nutrients consistently impact primary producer biomass in streams and rivers worldwide. It builds on previous literature syntheses evaluating chl-a responses to nutrient concentrations and confirms that benthic and sestonic chl-a respond positively to nutrients across a range of stream and river conditions, but also points to limits on these relationships (e.g., potential saturation at high nutrient concentrations). Lack of consistent reporting of contextual data limited our ability to examine how moderating factors influenced these stressor-response relationships. Overall, we provide nutrient managers responsible for protecting the quality of lotic ecosystems with a comprehensive evidence base for chl-a responses to TN and TP concentrations in the water column.

AB  - Purpose of Review The field of women's mental health has grown in the military healthcare system, which has begun to acknowledge and address the sex-specific differences in mental health for service women. The purpose of this review is to examine recent research in active duty populations addressing perinatal mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and gender isolation. Recent Findings Within the examined literature focused on active duty populations, analyses by sex and gender continue to exist as notable gaps, and a majority of studies reviewed either do not aim to examine sex or gender-based differences, and/or do not analyze data with an eye towards these paradigms. Within perinatal mental health, the lack of studies led to an inability to make any notable conclusions. PTSD was the area with the most robust publications focused on active duty women, studies of major depression showed significant occupational impact, and the area of gender isolation continues to grow as a promising field with practical implications. We discuss current promising research and advance ideas for future research trajectories that will provide clinicians, policy makers, and scientists with more data to support improved mental healthcare for both military women and men.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, characterized by home confinement and other restrictive measures to reduce the spread of the infection, led to significant changes in people's habits and lifestyle. One of the most common problems is the worsening of sleep quality or quantity, which could have negative effects on psychological wellbeing, particularly in older adults. The purposes of the present literature review considering healthy aging subjects are (a) to examine the existing research on sleep alterations during the current pandemic and (b) to highlight possible relationships between sleep problems and psychological distress. A systematic search strategy was implemented according to PRISMA guidelines in the international literature online databases, up to 1 July 2021. After identification and screening phases, 11 articles were included in this review. The studies found possible associations between sleep problems and mood changes-particularly in terms of depression and anxiety. In addition, altered sleep patterns seemed to be related to changes in individual aspects, lifestyle, and attitudes adopted by older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. Thus, the pandemic could affect the sleep and psychological wellbeing of the older population, even in healthy aging.</p>

AB  - Background: International clinical practice guidelines highlight the importance of improving the psychological and mental health care of patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Psychological interventions can promote adherence to the demands of diabetes self-care, promoting high quality of life and wellbeing. Methods: A systematic review was carried out to determine whether psychological treatments with a specific focus on emotional management have an impact on glycemic control and variables related to psychological adjustment. Comprehensive literature searches of PubMed Medline, Psycinfo, Cochrane Database, Web of Science, and Open Grey Repository databases were conducted, from inception to November 2019 and were last updated in December 2020. Finally, eight articles met inclusion criteria. Results: Results showed that the management of emotions was effective in improving the psychological adjustment of patients with T1DM when carried out by psychologists. However, the evidence regarding the improvement of glycemic control was not entirely clear. When comparing adolescent and adult populations, findings yielded slightly better results in adolescents. Conclusions: More rigorous studies are needed to establish what emotional interventions might increase glycemic control in this population.

AB  - Background: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the psychological state of university students has been a cause for concern. In particular, odontology students have experienced symptoms of anxiety due to the closure of universities and the suspension of clinical training. Methods: Medline via PubMed was searched for studies on the prevalence of anxiety in dental undergraduates, published from 1 December 2019 to 1 August 2021. Results: A total of fifteen studies were included in this review. Our results show a prevalence of anxiety of 35% reported by dental students, which was independent of gender, response rate or methodological quality. The only significant finding was a lower prevalence of anxiety in studies located in Europe compared to those located in other continents. Conclusions: The results suggest dental students are experiencing significant levels of anxiety during this COVID-19 pandemic and that there seem to be differences between students from different regions of the world. Therefore, it is important to help dental students psychologically as the pandemic situation continues.

AB  - Theory of mind (ToM) is a social cognitive skill that involves the ability to attribute mental states to self and others (what they think (cognitive ToM) and feel (affective ToM)). We aim to provide an overview of previous knowledge of ToM in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the last few years more attention has been paid to the study of this construct as a non-motor manifestation of PD. In advanced stages, both components of ToM (cognitive and affective) are commonly impaired, although in early PD results remain controversial. Executive dysfunction correlates with ToM deficits and other cognitive domains such as language and visuospatial function have also been related to ToM. Recent studies have demonstrated that PD patients with mild cognitive impairment show ToM deficits more frequently in comparison with cognitively normal PD patients. In addition to the heterogeneity of ToM tests administered in different studies, depression and dopaminergic medication may also be acting as confounding factors, but there are still insufficient data to support this. Neuroimaging studies conducted to understand the underlying networks of cognitive and affective ToM deficits in PD are lacking. The study of ToM deficit in PD continues to be important, as this may worsen quality of life and favor social stigma. Future studies should be considered, including assessment of the patients' cognitive state, associated mood disorders, and the role of dopaminergic deficit.

AB  - Background: Several data suggest that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may exacerbate or trigger eating disorders (EDs). The aim of this paper was to summarize current literature studies on COVID pandemic and EDs.</p>
   <br></p>
   Methods: Literature search, study selection, methods, and quality evaluation were performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.</p>
   <br></p>
   Results: A systematic search allowed the initial selection of 172 papers; 21 (12.2%) papers were eligible and included in the review. In selected studies, a total number of 29,108 subjects were enrolled (range: 10-11,391; mean/SD: 1,386 & PLUSMN; 2,800), 6,216 were men (21.4%), 22,703 were women (77.9%), and 189 (0.7%) were gender fluid or not declared. The mean age/SD of subjects was 30.2 & PLUSMN; 7.7. About 12 studies (57.1%) were online surveys, 4 (19.0%) were retrospective studies, 2 (9.5%) were qualitative studies, 2 (9.5%) were longitudinal cohort studies, and 1 was a social media survey (4.8%). Their analysis revealed five main findings: (1) changes in the routines of physical activities were related to the worsening of preoccupation on weight/body shape; (2) food access limitation during pandemic represented the risk factors for both triggering and exacerbating EDs; (3) restriction in healthcare facilities contributed to increase anxiety levels and to modify treatment compliance; (4) social isolation was related to the exacerbation of symptoms in patients with EDs who are home-confined with family members; and (5) conflicts and difficulties in relationships with "no way out" were the maintenance factors for ED symptoms, especially in adolescents and young adults.</p>
   <br></p>
   Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on EDs that might be triggered by the exceptional conditions derived from COVID-19-related stress in predisposed subjects. Patients who were already affected by EDs experienced the worsening of their clinical conditions and related quality of life (QoL).</p>

AB  - Objective Effective interventions are needed to mitigate effects of stress and anxiety from conception and up to two years postpartum (the first 1000 days), but it is unclear what works, for what populations and at what time points. This review aimed to synthesise evidence from existing reviews of the effects of stress and anxiety interventions. Methods A systematic review of systematic reviews was conducted. PsycINFO, CINAHL, MEDLINE and the Cochrane databases were searched (inception to January 2020). Reviews were eligible if they examined effects of interventions during the first 1000 days on women's stress and/or anxiety. Extracted data were narratively synthesised. Review quality was assessed using existing recommendations including the AMSTAR tool . Results Thirty-four reviews were eligible for inclusion; 21 demonstrated high methodological quality. Cognitive behavioural therapy demonstrates some beneficial effects for anxiety across the first 1000 days for general and at-risk populations. Support-based interventions demonstrate effects for stress and anxiety for at-risk mothers in the postpartum. Music, yoga and relaxation demonstrate some effects for stress and anxiety, but studies are limited by high risk of bias. Conclusion Existing evidence is inconsistent. Cognitive behavioural therapy and support-based interventions demonstrate some benefits. Further methodologically and conceptually robust research is needed.

AB  - Background: Mental health conditions pose a major challenge to health care providers and society at large. The World Health Organization predicts that by 2030, mental health conditions will be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide. The current need for mental health care is overwhelming. In New Zealand, 1 in 6 adults has been diagnosed with common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety disorders, according to a national survey. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to effectively help patients overcome a wide variety of mental health conditions. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) might be one of the most exciting technologies emerging in the clinical setting for the treatment of anxiety and depression.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate the virtual reality (VR) technologies currently being used to help support the treatment of depression and anxiety. We also aim to investigate whether and how CBT is included as part of VRET and look at the VR technologies and interventions that have been used in recent studies on depression and anxiety.
   Methods: We performed a scoping review. To identify significant studies, we decided to use already aggregated sources from the Google Scholar database. Overall, the goal of our search strategy was to limit the number of initial results related to VR in mental health to only a relevant minimum.
   Results: Using our defined keywords, Google Scholar identified >17,300 articles. After applying all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified a total of 369 articles for further processing. After manual evaluation, 34 articles were shortlisted; of the 34 articles, 9 (26%) reported the use of CBT with VR. All of the articles were published between 2017 and 2021. Out of the 9 studies, CBT was conducted within a VR environment in 5 (56%) studies, whereas in the remaining 4 (44%) studies, CBT was used as an addition to VRET. All 9 studies reported the use of CBT either in vivo or in a virtual environment to be effective in supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression.
   Conclusions: Most studies demonstrated the use of VR to be effective for supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression in a range of settings and recommended its potential as a tool for use in a clinical environment. Even though standalone headsets are much easier to work with and more suitable for home use, the shift from tethered VR headsets to standalone headsets in the mental health environment was not observed. All studies that looked at the use of CBT either in vivo or in a virtual environment found it to be effective in supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression.

AB  - Background: Sensory deprivation (SD) is a widely prevalent condition that leads to various health-related consequences and is also an important cause of disability worldwide. Earlier, SD experiments were used as research modalities to alter human behavior. In recent years, the focus has shifted to understand how SD can affect the mental health of individuals (with congenital or acquired sensory impairments). This narrative review focuses on the current understanding about the association of SD and psychiatric disorders. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was done PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar and in the cross-references of relevant articles. Keywords included "sensory deprivation," "blindness," "deafness," "mental illness," "psychiatric disorders," "prevalence," "assessment," and "management" in various combinations. Only original articles (abstract and full text) published in English till October 2020 were included. Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, dementia, suicidality, and psychosis in persons with SD is higher than the general population (highest being in persons with dementia with comorbid SD). Several mechanisms/hypotheses have been proposed to explain these associations. Assessment of SD includes a thorough history taking, with adequate awareness about the difficulties faced during a psychiatric interview in this population. Modifications in the psychometric assessment procedures are warranted. Management depends on a multi-disciplinary approach that includes proper referral to specialties, pharmacological management (depending on diagnosis as well as taking care of ototoxic/ocular side-effect profile of the drugs), and nonpharmacological supportive measures. Conclusions: SD is a complex condition, and evidence suggests that persons with SD have higher psychiatric morbidity. A comprehensive assessment, along with holistic management approach is warranted.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to explore the relevant literature available regarding the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a mode of treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); to evaluate the evidence to support the use of rTMS as a treatment option for OCD.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors electronically conducted data search in five research databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psych INFO, SCOPUS and EMBASE) using all identified keywords and index terms across all the databases to identify empirical studies and randomized controlled trials. The authors included articles published with randomized control designs, which aimed at the treatment of OCD with rTMS. Only full-text published articles written in English were reviewed. Review articles on treatment for conditions other than OCD were excluded. The Covidence software was used to manage and streamline the review.
   Findings - Despite the inconsistencies in the published literature, the application of rTMS over the supplementary motor area and the orbitofrontal cortex has proven to be promising in efficacy and tolerability compared with other target regions such as the prefrontal cortex for the treatment of OCD. Despite the diversity in terms of the outcomes and clinical variability of the studies under review, rTMS appears to be a promising treatment intervention for OCD.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors of this scoping review acknowledge several limitations. First, the search strategy considered only studies published in English and the results are up to date as the last day of the electronic data search of December 10, 2020. Though every effort was made to identify all relevant studies for the purposes of this review per the eligibility criteria, the authors still may have missed some relevant studies, especially those published in other languages.
   Originality/value - This review brought to bare the varying literature on the application of rTMS and what is considered gaps in the knowledge in this area in an attempt to evaluate and provide information on the potential therapeutic effects of rTMS for OCD.

AB  - Depression is frequently associated with sleep problems, and clinical improvement often coincides with the normalization of sleep architecture and realignment of circadian rhythm. The effectiveness of treatments targeting sleep in depressed patients, such as sleep deprivation, further demonstrates the confluence of sleep and mood. Moreover, recent studies showing that the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine influences processes related to sleep-wake neurobiology have led to novel hypotheses explaining rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. Despite the available evidence, studies addressing ketamine's antidepressant effects have focused on pharmacology and often overlooked the role of physiology. To explore this discrepancy in research on rapid acting antidepressants, we examined articles published between 2009-2019. A keyword search algorithm indicated that vast majority of the articles completely ignored sleep. Out of the 100 most frequently cited pre clinical and clinical research papers, 89 % and 71 %, respectively, did not mention sleep at all. Furthermore, only a handful of these articles disclosed key experimental variables, such as the times of treatment administration or behavioral testing, let alone considered the potential association between these variables and experimental observations. Notably, in preclinical studies, treatments were preferentially administered during the inactive period, which is the polar opposite of clinical practice and research. We discuss the potential impact of this practice on the results in the field. Our hope is that this perspective will serve as a wake-up call to (re)-examine rapid-acting antidepressant effects with more appreciation for the role of sleep and chronobiology.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Evidence of gut microbiota perturbations has accumulated for multiple psychiatric disorders, with microbiota signatures proposed as potential biomarkers. However, no attempts have been made to evaluate the specificity of these across the range of psychiatric conditions.
   OBJECTIVE To conduct an umbrella and updated meta-analysis of gut microbiota alterations in general adult psychiatric populations and perform a within- and between-diagnostic comparison.
   DATA SOURCES Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched up to February 2, 2021, for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and original evidence.
   STUDY SELECTION A total of 59 case-control studies evaluating diversity or abundance of gut microbes in adult populations with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis and schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were included.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Between-group comparisons of relative abundance of gut microbes and beta diversity indices were extracted and summarized qualitatively. Random-effects meta-analyses on standardized mean difference (SMD) were performed for alpha diversity indices.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Alpha and beta diversity and relative abundance of gut microbes.
   RESULTS A total of 34 studies provided data and were included in alpha diversity meta-analyses (n = 1519 patients, n = 1429 control participants). Significant decrease in microbial richness in patients compared with control participants were found (observed species SMD = -0.26; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.06; Chao1 SMD = -0.5; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.21); however, this was consistently decreased only in bipolar disorder when individual diagnoses were examined. There was a small decrease in phylogenetic diversity (SMD = -0.24; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.001) and no significant differences in Shannon and Simpson indices. Differences in beta diversity were consistently observed only for major depressive disorder and psychosis and schizophrenia. Regarding relative abundance, little evidence of disorder specificity was found. Instead, a transdiagnostic pattern of microbiota signatures was found. Depleted levels of Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus and enriched levels of Eggerthella were consistently shared between major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis and schizophrenia, and anxiety, suggesting these disorders are characterized by a reduction of anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria, while pro-inflammatory genera are enriched. The confounding associations of region and medication were also evaluated.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This systematic review and meta-analysis found that gut microbiota perturbations were associated with a transdiagnostic pattern with a depletion of certain anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria and an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria in patients with depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety.

AB  - Background: Whether the clubhouse model of psychiatric rehabilitation is well-implemented in China and whether patients with schizophrenia successfully achieve symptom remission and functional recovery through engaging in the clubhouse remain unclear.
   Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched for relevant articles from inception to April 21, 2021. Quality assessment, data synthesis, and subgroup analysis were performed on the included studies.
   Results: Seven randomized controlled studies with 682 participants were included in the present meta-analysis. The clubhouse model of psychiatric rehabilitation has a significant effect on promoting the remission of psychiatric symptoms, especially negative symptoms. However, it does not show a definite effect on promoting recovery of positive symptoms. The clubhouse model of psychiatric rehabilitation has a significant effect on promoting social functioning recovery, reducing the family burden, improving the quality of life, and promoting the remission of depressive and anxiety symptoms of patients with schizophrenia in China.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the clubhouse model of psychiatric rehabilitation can promote the remission of symptoms and functional recovery of Chinese with schizophrenia. It may be suitable to address the urgent need for better mental health services in China.

AB  - Background Adults with cystic fibrosis have unique barriers that may decrease their ability to receive adequate social support and socialization, leading to social isolation. Social isolation has been correlated with negative health outcomes in other populations. In those with cystic fibrosis, social isolation may present additional physiological and psychological challenges, potentially interfering with clinical outcomes and quality of life. However, there is a lack of understanding as to how social isolation presents in this population. Methods The purpose of this integrative review is to identify and critically analyze how social support and social isolation are reported for adults with cystic fibrosis. PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Complete were searched for related publications, resulting in an initial yield of 1767 articles. After eligibility screening, 21 studies met the criteria for this review, which were all then critically analyzed and synthesized. Results There is a scarcity of literature focusing on social isolation and social support in this population. Reduced physical and mental health were the most commonly reported variables associated with reduced social functioning and social support. Conclusion Preliminary studies are warranted to understand how adults with cystic fibrosis experience social isolation, as well as its relationship to social support. This knowledge can guide future research focusing on physical and psychological effects of social isolation, along with interventions that facilitate socialization and support.

AB  - Clinical studies suggest the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, including ayahuasca, DMT, psilocybin, and LSD, in stress-related disorders. These substances induce cognitive, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive effects suggested to arise from biological changes similar to conventional antidepressants or the rapid-acting substance ketamine. The proposed route is by inducing brain neuroplasticity. This review attempts to summarize the evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity by focusing on psychedelics' cellular and molecular neuroplasticity effects after single and repeated administration. When behavioral parameters are encountered in the selected studies, the biological pathways will be linked to the behavioral effects. Additionally, knowledge gaps in the underlying biology of clinical outcomes of psychedelics are highlighted. The literature searched yielded 344 results. Title and abstract screening reduced the sample to 35; eight were included from other sources, and full-text screening resulted in the final selection of 16 preclinical and four clinical studies. Studies (n = 20) show that a single administration of a psychedelic produces rapid changes in plasticity mechanisms on a molecular, neuronal, synaptic, and dendritic level. The expression of plasticity-related genes and proteins, including Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), is changed after a single administration of psychedelics, resulting in changed neuroplasticity. The latter included more dendritic complexity, which outlasted the acute effects of the psychedelic. Repeated administration of a psychedelic directly stimulated neurogenesis and increased BDNF mRNA levels up to a month after treatment. Findings from the current review demonstrate that psychedelics induce molecular and cellular adaptations related to neuroplasticity and suggest those run parallel to the clinical effects of psychedelics, potentially underlying them. Future (pre)clinical research might focus on deciphering the specific cellular mechanism activated by different psychedelics and related to long-term clinical and biological effects to increase our understanding of the therapeutic potential of these compounds.

AB  - The putative risk/protective factors for several personality disorders remain unclear. The vast majority of published studies has assessed personality characteristics/traits rather than disorders. Thus, the current umbrella review of meta-analyses (MAs) aims to systematically assess risk or protective factors associated with personality disorders. We searched PubMed-MEDLINE/PsycInfo databases, up to August 31, 2020. Quality of MAs was assessed with AMSTAR-2, while the credibility of evidence for each association was assessed through standard quantitative criteria. Out of 571 initial references, five meta-analyses met inclusion criteria, encompassing 56 associations of 26 potential environmental factors for antisocial, dependent, borderline personality disorder, with a median of five studies per association, and median 214 cases per association. Overall, 35 (62.5%) of the associations were nominally significant. Six associations met class II (i.e., highly suggestive) evidence for borderline personality disorder, with large effect sizes involving childhood emotional abuse (OR = 28.15, 95% CI 14.76-53.68), childhood emotional neglect (OR = 22.86, 95% CI 11.55-45.22), childhood any adversities (OR = 14.32, 95% CI 10.80-18.98), childhood physical abuse (OR = 9.30, 95% CI 6.57-13.17), childhood sexual abuse (OR = 7.95, 95% CI 6.21-10.17), and childhood physical neglect (OR = 5.73, 95% CI 3.21-10.21), plus 16 further associations supported by class IV evidence. No risk factor for antisocial or dependent personality disorder was supported by class I, II, and III, but six and seven met class IV evidence, respectively. Quality of included meta-analyses was rated as moderate in two, critically low in three. The large effect sizes found for a broad range of childhood adversities suggest that prevention of personality disorders should target childhood-related risk factors. However, larger cohort studies assessing multidimensional risk factors are needed in the field.

AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a frequently occurring skin disorder in Asia that substantially impacts the social, financial, and psychological lives of individuals. However, there is uncertainty regarding the psychological instruments for this domain. Hence, this review systematically assessed the existing measurement instruments used, developed, and/or validated for the measurement of psychological outcomes in Asian adult patients with AD as well as the scope of those assessment tools (e.g. validity and reliability). Electronic searches were performed using six databases (inception to February 2020) to identify studies. Thematic analysis of 44 included studies revealed that the commonly employed tools to assess the quality of life were the Dermatology Life Quality Index followed by the Skindex-16 questionnaire, the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, and the Quality of Life Hand Eczema Questionnaire. Similarly, the Patient Health Questionnaire, Self-rating depression scale (SDS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were frequently employed to assess depressive symptoms. Additionally, symptoms of anxiety were frequently assessed through Interaction Anxiousness Scale and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Although a variety of psychological assessment measures have been used in research, data on their reliability and validity is limited. Also, information on the cultural applicability of these instruments is scantier. More research is needed to ascertain the suitability of tools for use in clinical practice.

AB  - The aim is to provide meta-analytical evidence on eHealth interventions' efficacy in supporting the psychosocial and physical well-being of adults with type 1 or type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and to investigate differences in interventions primarily targeted at providing glycemic control vs. psychosocial support. A PRISMA-guided systematic search was conducted. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) regarding eHealth interventions for adults (18-65 years) with DM were included. Data were pooled using Standard Mean Difference (SMD); sub-group analysis and meta-regressions were performed when appropriate. Outcomes were Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), diabetes distress, quality of life, anxiety, stress, and depression. Intervention acceptability was assessed performing the Odds Ratio (OR) of drop-out rates. Thirteen RCTs comprising 1315 participants were included (52.09% females; M-age = 46.18, SD = 9.98). Analyses showed intervention efficacy on HbA1c (SMD = -0.40; 95% CI = -0.70, -0.12; k = 13) and depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.18; 95% CI = -0.33, -0.02; k = 6) at RCTs endpoint and were well accepted (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 0.72, 2.81; k = 10). However, efficacy on HbA1c was not maintained at follow-up (SMD = -0.13; 95% CI = -0.31, 0.05; k = 6). eHealth interventions providing medical support were acceptable and effective in fostering glycemic control and decreasing depressive symptoms in the short-term only. Digital solutions should be developed on multiple levels to fully support the psychophysical well-being of people with DM.

AB  - Familism is a key cultural value that emphasizes support and attachment, loyalty, honor, and obligation to the family and is hypothesized to be critical in shaping family dynamics and individual adjustment among Hispanic/Latino individuals. To advance the field, we drew from cultural-ecological and developmental models to examine familism as a cultural promotive and risk factor for individual adjustment and family relationship quality. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis via a search between 2017 and 2020 and identified 126 records (23% unpublished dissertations) from 73 independent studies (12% longitudinal) in PsycINFO/Proquest, PubMed, and ERIC databases between 1993 and 2019. The multilevel meta-analysis revealed significant effects: educational outcomes, r = .16, 95% CI [.08, .23]; family relationships, which included warmth/support, r = .24, 95% CI [.19, .29], and conflict/negativity, r = -.13, 95% CI [-.23, -.02]; internalizing symptoms, r = -.12, 95% CI [-.16, -.09]; and externalizing symptoms, r = -.10, 95% CI [-.18, -.03]. We tested conceptually driven moderators and found significant variation by sample (e.g., nativity, developmental period) and context characteristics (i.e., U.S. states characterized as "established" or "new/emerging" for Hispanic/Latino populations). Findings suggest that familism may function more as a promotive and less as a risk factor and that continued attention is needed to the conditions that strengthen or weaken these associations. Although conclusions are limited because most effect sizes were from cross-sectional designs with U.S. Mexican-origin participants and relied on self-reports, findings highlight the complex associations between familism and adjustment/relationship quality and can guide future research.
   Public Significance Statement This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that higher levels of familism are linked to more positive development and family supports among Hispanic/Latino individuals, including a small to medium size correlation between familism and family warmth/support, and a small association with educational outcomes. Higher familism also was related to less negative outcomes, as reflected in a negative association with internalizing and externalizing symptoms and family conflict/negativity.

AB  - There is a lack of studies regarding the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in children and adolescents. In this study, we aimed to assess benefits and harms of ECT in children and adolescents with major psychiatric diseases. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for peer-reviewed articles written in English regarding the use of ECT as treatment for major psychiatric diseases in children and adolescents. This study consists of 192 articles, mostly case studies (n = 50), reviews and overview articles (n = 52), and retrospective studies (n = 30). We present an overview of evidence for ECT in children and adolescents with mood disorders, catatonia, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, self-injurious behavior, and other indications. This article is also a summary of international guidelines regarding the use of ECT in children and adolescents. We evaluated the overall quality of evidence by using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations and found the overall level of evidence to be of low quality. There are no absolute contra indications for ECT in children and adolescents. Fears regarding cognitive dysfunction have not been reproduced in studies. Electroconvulsive therapy should be considered in severe, treatment-resistant mood disorders, catatonia, and schizophrenia, especially in older adolescents. High-quality studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of ECT, especially in these potentially life-threatening diseases.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic represents a traumatic event that has profoundly changed working conditions with detrimental consequences for workers' health, in particular for the healthcare population directly involved in addressing the emergency. Nevertheless, previous research has demonstrated that traumatic experiences can also lead to positive reactions, stimulating resilience and feelings of growth. The aim of this narrative review is to investigate the positive aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible health prevention and promotion strategies by analyzing the available scientific evidence. In particular, we focus on the constructs of resilience, coping strategies and posttraumatic growth (PTG). A literature search was performed on the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Psycinfo databases. Forty-six articles were included in the literature synthesis. Psychological resilience is a fundamental variable for reducing and preventing the negative psychological effects of the pandemic and is associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and burnout. At the individual and organizational level, resilience plays a crucial role in enhancing wellbeing in healthcare and non-healthcare workers. Connected to resilience, adaptive coping strategies are essential for managing the emergency and work-related stress. Several positive factors influencing resilience have been highlighted in the development of PTG. At the same time, high levels of resilience and positive coping strategies can enhance personal growth. Considering the possible long-term coexistence and consequences of COVID-19, organizational interventions should aim to improve workers' adaptive coping skills, resilience and PTG in order to promote wellbeing.

AB  - Background: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly use complementary and alternative medications. Yoga is a mind-body intervention that is being increasingly explored as a tool in the therapeutic armamentarium of PD.
   Objective: To critically evaluate the studies and summarize the utility of Yoga in PD.
   Material and Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in the Medline and Cochrane databases and included randomized controlled trials (RCT) of Yoga in PD. The studies were evaluated for internal validity and the relevant data were extracted.
   Results: A total of seven studies were included in the analysis. We collated the data on the changes in motor function, gait and balance parameters, anxiety, depression and quality of life scores observed after intervention (Yoga) in patients with PD and highlighted the limitations of these studies.
   Conclusion: Anxiety, depression, and balance issues in PD may benefit from Yoga. Yoga has potential as an add-on therapy in PD.

AB  - Background: Many patients on maintenance dialysis experience financial hardship. Existing studies are mainly cost analyses that quantify financial hardship in monetary terms, but an evaluation of its impact is also warranted. This review aims to explore the definition of financial hardship and its relationship with symptom burden among patients on dialysis. Methods: A literature search was conducted in November 2020, using six electronic databases. Studies published in English that examined the associations between financial hardship and symptom burden were selected. Two reviewers independently extracted data and appraised the studies by using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists. Results: Fifty cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies were identified. Studies used income level, employment status, healthcare funding, and financial status to evaluate financial hardship. While relationships between decreased income, unemployment, and overall symptom burden were identified, evidence suggested that several symptoms, including depression, fatigue, pain, and sexual dysfunction, were more likely to be associated with changes in financial status. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that poor financial status may have a negative effect on physical and psychological well-being. However, a clear definition of financial hardship is warranted. Improving this assessment among patients on dialysis may prompt early interventions and minimize the negative impact of financial hardship.

AB  - Background. Research is crucial to the development of society. The literature on the challenges for scientific development highlights that chronic stress in researchers can affect their academic production and their physical and mental health. Although some literature reports the consequences of stress in the academic field, most studies are carried out on students, and there is very little knowledge on the characteristics of stress because of simultaneous academic, occupational, and socio-personal demands. Objective. To analyze and contrast the methodological components and main results of stress-related studies on researchers. Method. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guide was used to analyze current evidence in the literature. Full-text scientific papers from the period 2008-2019 were included in both English and Spanish, on subjects engaged in research and teaching. The databases used were Scopus, Ebsco, Dialnet, and Web of Science. Results. One hundred and eighty records were obtained, but only four met the criteria for the qualitative evaluation. Discussion and conclusion. Stress is present in the 20% of subjects associated with psychological (lack of control, emotional fatigue, overload, multi-tasking) and institutional variables (evaluation system demands, tenure track, lack of scientific recognition). The studies emphasize aspects that predispose and precipitate stress but do not highlight psychological aspects of the stressful experience.

AB  - Research related to the lives of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people has grown substantially in recent years. One area of such growth has been research on TGD people's sexuality. Sexuality can include sexual behaviors, sexual attraction, and sexual identity, among other domains. Historically, sexuality of TGD people was often policed by providers with expectations of heterosexuality or the conflation of sexuality and gender experiences. This resulted in a lag in understanding the lived experiences of TGD people in relation to sexuality. In this review, we examine research that has been conducted over the past 5 years with any measurement of sexuality with TGD participants. The initial search revealed 11,891 articles. After removing duplicates, there were 6,538 articles in the abstract review stage, with 1,669 retained for full text review and 179 retained for extraction. Most studies included majority white samples, and about half were conducted solely in the United States. Most studies measured a single dimension of sexuality, specifically sexual identity, whereas only 2.2% asked about all three dimensions of identity, behavior, and attraction. Of those that inquired about sexual identity, most samples were majority sexual minorities. Many studies had issues related to inclusivity, such as the language used in response options or questions. These findings are placed within the context of the revised 2021 guidelines for practice with sexual minorities and emphasize the importance of diversifying our field's understandings and assessments of sexuality for TGD people.

AB  - Objective: This study used meta-analysis to assess disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening and treatment in people with mental disorders, a group that has elevated CVD incidence and mortality.
   Methods: The authors searched PubMed and PsycInfo through July 31, 2020, and conducted a random-effect meta-analysis of observational studies comparing CVD screening and treatment in people with and without mental disorders. The primary outcome was odds ratios for CVD screening and treatment. Sensitivity analyses on screening and treatment separately and on specific procedures, subgroup analyses by country, and by controlling for confounding by indication, as well as meta-regressions, were also run, and publication bias and quality were assessed.
   Results: Forty-seven studies (N=24,400,452 patients, of whom 1,283,602 had mental disorders) from North America (k=26), Europe (k=16), Asia (k=4), and Australia (k=1) were meta-analyzed. Lower rates of screening or treatment in patients with mental disorders emerged for any CVD (k-47, odds ratio=0.773, 95% CI=0.742, 0.804), coronary artery disease (k=34, odds ratio=0.734, 95% CI=0.690, 0.781), cerebrovascular disease (k=8, odds ratio=0.810, 95% CI=0.779, 0.842), and other mixed CVDs (k=11, odds ratio=0.839, 95% CI=0.761, 0.924). Significant disparities emerged for any screening, any intervention, catheterization or revascularization in coronary artery disease, intravenous thrombolysis for stroke, and treatment with any and with specific medications for CVD across all mental disorders (except for CVD medications in mood disorders). Disparities were largest for schizophrenia, and they differed across countries. Median study quality was high (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score, 8); higher-quality studies found larger disparities, and publication bias did not affect results.
   Conclusions: People with mental disorders, and those with schizophrenia in particular, receive less screening and lower-quality treatment for CVD. It is of paramount importance to address underprescribing of CVD medications and underutilization of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures across all mental disorders.

AB  - Background Mental disorders might be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. We aimed to assess the specific risks of COVID-19-related mortality, hospitalisation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission associated with any pre-existing mental disorder, and specific diagnostic categories of mental disorders, and exposure to psychopharmacological drug classes.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases between Jan 1, 2020, and March 5, 2021, for original studies reporting data on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with psychiatric disorders compared with controls. We excluded studies with overlapping samples, studies that were not peer-reviewed, and studies written in languages other than English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. We modelled random-effects meta-analyses to estimate crude odds ratios (OR) for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection as the primary outcome, and hospitalisation and ICU admission as secondary outcomes. We calculated adjusted ORs for available data. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-2 statistic, and publication bias was tested with Egger regression and visual inspection of funnel plots. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall strength of the evidence and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to assess study quality. We also did subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to assess the effects of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting, patient age, country, pandemic phase, quality assessment score, sample sizes, and adjustment for confounders. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021233984.
   Findings 841 studies were identified by the systematic search, of which 33 studies were included in the systematic review and 23 studies in the meta-analysis, comprising 1 469 731 patients with COVID-19, of whom 43938 had mental disorders. The sample included 130 807 females (8.9% of the whole sample) and 130 373 males (8.8%). Nine studies provided data on patient race and ethnicity, and 22 studies were rated as high quality. The presence of any mental disorder was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR 2.00 [95% CI 1.58-2.54]; I-2=92.66%). This association was also observed for psychotic disorders (2.05 [1.37-3.06]; I-2=80.81%), mood disorders (1.99 [1.46-2.71]; I-2=68.32%), substance use disorders (1.76 [1.27-2.44]; I-2=47.90%), and intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders (1.73 [1.29-2.31]; I-2=90.15%) but not for anxiety disorders (1.07 [0.73-1.56]; I-2=11.05%). COVID-19 mortality was associated with exposure to antipsychotics (3.71 [1.74-7.91]; I-2=90.31%), anxiolytics (2.58 [1.22-5.44]; I-2=96.42%), and antidepressants (2.23 [1.06-4.71]; I-2=95.45%). For psychotic disorders, mood disorders, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics, the association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and other confounders. Mental disorders were associated with increased risk of hospitalisation (2.24 [1.70-2.94]; I-2=88.80%). No significant associations with mortality were identified for ICU admission. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions showed significant associations of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting (p=0.013) and country (p<0.0001) with mortality. No significant associations with mortality were identified for other covariates. No evidence of publication bias was found. GRADE assessment indicated high certainty for crude mortality and hospitalisation, and moderate certainty for crude ICU admission.
   Interpretation Pre-existing mental disorders, in particular psychotic and mood disorders, and exposure to antipsychotics and anxiolytics were associated with COVID-19 mortality in both crude and adjusted models. Although further research is required to determine the underlying mechanisms, our findings highlight the need for targeted approaches to manage and prevent COVID-19 in at-risk patient groups identified in this study.

AB  - Introduction: The recovery approach aims to have users' perspectives at the heart of service development and research; it is a holistic perspective that considers social needs, personal growth and inclusion. In the last decade recovery-oriented research and practice has increased greatly, however, a comprehensive model of recovery considering exclusively the perspectives of people with lived experience has not been devised.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Aims: This review aimed to develop a framework and contextualize service users' and informal caregivers' understanding of recovery from severe mental health problems.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Methods: We systematically searched 6 databases including key terms related to knowledge, experience and narratives AND mental health AND personal recovery. The search was supplemented with reference sourcing through gray literature, reference tracking and expert consultation. Data analysis consisted of a qualitative meta-synthesis using constant comparative methods.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Results: Sixty-two studies were analyzed. A pattern emerged regarding the recovery paradigms that the studies used to frame their findings. The resulting recovery framework included the domains Social recovery; Prosperity (Legal, political, and economic recovery); Individual Recovery; and Clinical Recovery Experience (SPICE). Service users' definitions of recovery tended to prioritize social aspects, particularly being accepted and connecting with others, while caregivers focused instead on clinical definitions of recovery such as symptom remission. Both groups emphasized individual aspects such as becoming self-sufficient and achieving personal goals, which was strongly linked with having economic means for independence.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Conclusions: The recovery model provided by this review offers a template for further research in the field and a guide for policy and practice. Predominant definitions of recovery currently reflect understandings of mental health which focus on an individual perspective, while this review found an important emphasis on socio-political aspects. At the same time, only a small number of studies took place in low-income countries, focused on minoritized populations, or included caregivers' perspectives. These are important gaps in the literature that require further attention.</p>

AB  - Objective: Psychiatric patients have increased rates of comorbid physical illness. There are less data on dental disease, especially decay, despite risk factors including lifestyle and psychotropic side effects such as xerostomia. We therefore undertook an umbrella review of all meta-analyses on the association between mental illness and oral health. Methods: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase and CINAHL. Articles were independently assessed. Outcomes were caries, periodontal disease, erosion, and partial or total tooth loss (edentulism), measured where possible with standardised measures such as the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth or surfaces. Quality was assessed in line with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Results: We identified 11 meta-analyses. The most information and strongest association was between dental decay and severe mental illness or substance use, as well as erosion and eating disorders. Depressive, anxiety and eating disorders were also associated with caries, but the datasets were small. People with severe mental illness had nearly three times the odds of having lost all their teeth than the general community (odds ratio = 2.81, 95% confidence interval = [1.73, 4.57]) and those with depression between 1.17 and 1.32. Findings for periodontal disease were more equivocal, possibly because of study heterogeneity. Conclusion: Mental health clinicians should screen for oral diseases when treating those with mental illness and facilitate referral to affordable dental clinics when indicated. Prevention should be a priority, including the promotion of dental care, as well as the management of xerostomia when psychopharmacologic agents are prescribed.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a number of complications in everyday life, greatly affecting public health. Estimating its impact on mental health constitutes a priority issue. The current study aims to summarize the scales that have been specifically developed for this reason and are not adaptations of already existing scales. A comprehensive search was conducted by two reviewers during the period 28/09/2020-30/09-2020 in the following databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, ScieLo, Mendeley, Google Scholar. A quality appraisal of the identified scales was made by three reviewers using the COSMIN checklist for methodological issues and the Terwee criteria for measurement properties. Our search strategy yielded a total of 855 results. Of these, 832 articles were excluded according to exclusion criteria, 23 were assessed for eligibility and 10 were finally included. These are presented in the text with additional useful information found separately. The identified scales tended to be quite short and examine stress, anxiety or fear. All studies were cross-sectional and the majority was conducted online. Most of them had a good Cronbach value (> 0.80) and adequate fit indices. It is however noted that the evaluation of their quality may be untimely due to relevant lack of data.

AB  - Paternal mental health is beginning to be recognized as an essential part of perinatal health. Historically, fathers were not recognized as being at risk for perinatal mental illnesses or relevant to maternal and infant health outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of paternal perinatal mental health, leading tools to assess paternal depression and anxiety, the impact of paternal mental health on mother and child health, and future directions for the field. An international team of paternal perinatal mental health experts summarized the key findings of the field. Fathers have an elevated risk of depression and anxiety disorders during the perinatal period that is associated with maternal depression and can impact their ability to support mothers. Paternal mental health is uniquely associated with child mental health and developmental outcomes starting from infancy and continuing through the child lifespan. Tailored screening approaches for paternal mental health are essential to support fathers early in the perinatal period, which would offset health risks for the family. Recommendations on paternal mental health are provided on four key areas to support father perinatal mental health: (1) intervention research, (2) clinical training, (3) national policy, and (4) the inclusion of fathers in the focus of the International Marce Society for Perinatal Mental Health.

AB  - Background Problem-solving training is a common ingredient of evidence-based therapies for youth depression and has shown effectiveness as a versatile stand-alone intervention in adults. This scoping review provided a first overview of the evidence supporting problem solving as a mechanism for treating depression in youth aged 14 to 24 years. Methods Five bibliographic databases (APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science) and the grey literature were systematically searched for controlled trials of stand-alone problem-solving therapy; secondary analyses of trial data exploring problem-solving-related concepts as predictors, moderators, or mediators of treatment response within broader therapies; and clinical practice guidelines for youth depression. Following the scoping review, an exploratory meta-analysis examined the overall effectiveness of stand-alone problem-solving therapy. Results Inclusion criteria were met by four randomized trials of problem-solving therapy (524 participants); four secondary analyses of problem-solving-related concepts as predictors, moderators, or mediators; and 23 practice guidelines. The only clinical trial rated as having a low risk of bias found problem-solving training helped youth solve personal problems but was not significantly more effective than the control at reducing emotional symptoms. An exploratory meta-analysis showed a small and non-significant effect on self-reported depression or emotional symptoms (Hedges' g = - 0.34; 95% CI: - 0.92 to 0.23) with high heterogeneity. Removing one study at high risk of bias led to a decrease in effect size and heterogeneity (g = - 0.08; 95% CI: - 0.26 to 0.10). A GRADE appraisal suggested a low overall quality of the evidence. Tentative evidence from secondary analyses suggested problem-solving training might enhance outcomes in cognitive-behavioural therapy and family therapy, but dedicated dismantling studies are needed to corroborate these findings. Clinical practice guidelines did not recommend problem-solving training as a stand-alone treatment for youth depression, but five mentioned it as a treatment ingredient. Conclusions On its own, problem-solving training may be beneficial for helping youth solve personal challenges, but it may not measurably reduce depressive symptoms. Youth experiencing elevated depressive symptoms may require more comprehensive psychotherapeutic support alongside problem-solving training. High-quality studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of problem-solving training as a stand-alone approach and as a treatment ingredient.

AB  - Since the 1970s, when ATP was identified as a co-transmitter in sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, it and its active metabolite adenosine have been considered relevant signaling molecules in biological and pathological processes in the central nervous system (CNS). Meanwhile, inosine, a naturally occurring purine nucleoside formed by adenosine breakdown, was considered an inert adenosine metabolite and remained a neglected actor on the purinergic signaling scene in the CNS. However, this scenario began to change in the 1980s. In the last four decades, an extensive group of shreds of evidence has supported the importance of mediated effects by inosine in the CNS. Also, inosine was identified as a natural trigger of adenosine receptors. This evidence has shed light on the therapeutic potential of inosine on disease processes involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here, we highlight the clinical and preclinical studies investigating the involvement of inosine in chronic pain, schizophrenia, epilepsy, depression, anxiety, and in neural regeneration and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson and Alzheimer. Thus, we hope that this review will strengthen the knowledge and stimulate more studies about the effects promoted by inosine in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - This systematic review was conducted to determine the prevalence of mental disorders among children and adults in Uganda. A comprehensive systematic search for relevant studies reporting prevalence of mental disorders in children or adults in Uganda was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science databases and grey literature sources. Study was eligible if, validated instrument based on the International Classification of Diseases or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria to assess a mental disorder was used. Eligible studies were critically appraised, prevalence data extracted and pooled using the random-effects model. Certainty in the pooled prevalence estimates was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. A total of 632 records were obtained, of which 26 articles from 24 studies conducted in Uganda were included in the review. Overall and with moderate level of certainty, the prevalence of any mental disorder in Uganda was 22.9% (95% C.I 11.0% - 34.9%) in children and 24.2% (95% C.I 19.8% - 28.6%) in adults. Prevalence of anxiety disorders was 14.4% (95% C.I 4.9% - 24.0%) in children and 20.2% (95% C.I 14.5% - 25.9%) in adults. The prevalence of current depressive disorders was 22.2% (95% C.I 9.2% - 35.2%) in children and 21.2% (95% C.I 16.8% - 25.6%) in adults. Eating disorder and psychotic syndrome disorder were also reported. Our findings suggest that depression and anxiety disorders are common mental disorders in Uganda, affecting approximately one in four persons. The findings provide essential insights for health service planning, clinical practice, and future epidemiological research in Uganda.

AB  - BACKGROUND Nowadays there is an increasing use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) both in neurological and psychiatric fields. After Food and Drug Administration approval of TMS for the therapy of treatment-resistant depression, TMS has been widely used in the context of mood disorders (MD). However, growing reports regarding the possibility of developing hypomanic/manic switch (HMS) have generated concern regarding its use in MDs. AIM To investigate the actual risk of developing HMS due to TMS in the treatment of MD. METHODS We led our research on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science on March 22, 2020, in accordance to the PRISMA guidelines for systematic review. Only double blind/single blind studies, written in English and focused on the TMS treatment of MD, were included. A meta-analysis of repetitive TMS protocol studies including HMS was conducted using RevMan 5.4 software. The assessment of Risk of Bias was done using Cochrane risk of bias tool. This protocol was registered on PROSPERO with the CRD42020175811 code. RESULTS Twenty-five studies were included in our meta-analysis: Twenty-one double blind randomized controlled trials (RCT) and four single blind-RCT (no. of subjects involved in active stimulation = 576; no. of subjects involved in sham protocol = 487). The most frequently treated pathology was major depressive episode/major depressive disorder, followed by resistant depression, bipolar depression and other MD. The majority of the studies used a repetitive TMS protocol, and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was the main target area. Side effects were reported in eight studies and HMS (described as greater energy, insomnia, irritability, anxiety, suicidal attempt) in four studies. When comparing active TMS vs sham treatment, the risk of developing HMS was not significantly different between conditions. CONCLUSION Applying the most usual protocols and the appropriate precautionary measures, TMS seems not to be related to HMS development.

AB  - Background: The novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide and poses a global health threat.
   Aims: This study assessed the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese students during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored potential moderating factors.
   Methods: We searched English and Chinese databases using pertinent keywords for articles published and unpublished, up until November 2020. The estimate of the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression was conducted through a random-effects model.
   Results: A total of 31 cross-sectional studies were included. The overall prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese students during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.0% (95% CI [20.0-29.0%]) and 22.0% (95% CI [18.0-27.0%]) respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that Chinese middle school students were at heightened risk of anxiety, while university students were at heightened risk of depression. Students who lived in higher-risk areas presented severe anxiety and depression, especially during the late period of the COVID-19 epidemic.
   Conclusions: Overall, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a high prevalence of anxiety in Chinese students and a high prevalence of depression among Chinese students in high-risk areas. Therefore, comprehensive and targeted psychological interventions should be developed to address the mental health of students in different grades, especially in high-risk areas and during the late period of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Depression has a devastating impact on young people around the world. This impact is pervasive and long-long lasting, still causing havoc as young people transition into adulthood. Prevention and timely early intervention efforts are necessary to lessen the disease burden of depression in young people. There is some evidence for the effectiveness of existing prevention and early intervention programs when delivered early. However, there is no consensus on what the active ingredients of these programs are. Identifying these ingredients is important because focusing on those that have maximal benefit will help to minimise the costs and resourcing of (already intensive) therapeutic approaches. We explored whether, and in what circumstances, affective awareness (i.e., knowing how one feels) is a candidate for protecting against and decreasing vulnerability to depression in young people. We specifically looked at how Ecological Momentary Assessment methods (EMA) were used to measure and/or increase affective awareness. We integrated three streams of data, including narrative review findings, perspectives from young people and psychologists, and publicly available information online (e.g., discussion forums). Across data sources, we found converging evidence that affective awareness is important in the prevention and early intervention of depression although there were considerable gaps in knowledge. More work needs to be done with young people and their health care teams to build affective awareness in the right way, at the right time, with individual differences in mind. The identification of how EMA can be best incorporated into young people's lives to facilitate these outcomes is also needed.

AB  - Background: Using commercial off-the-shelf video games rather than custom-made computer games could have several advantages for reducing stress and anxiety, including their low cost, advanced graphics, and the possibility to reach millions of individuals worldwide. However, it is important to emphasize that not all commercial video games are equal, and their effects strongly depend on specific characteristics of the games.
   Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to describe the literature on the use of commercial off-the-shelf video games for diminishing stress and anxiety, examining the research outcomes along with critical variables related to computer game characteristics (ie, genre, platform, time of play).
   Methods: A systematic search of the literature was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. The search databases were PsycINFO, Web of Science, Medline, IEEExplore, and the Cochrane Library. The search string was: [("video game*") OR ("computer game*")] AND [("stress") OR ("anxiety") OR ("relaxation")] AND [("study") OR ("trial") OR ("training")].
   Results: A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria for the publication period 2006-2021. The findings demonstrate the benefit of commercial off-the-shelf video games for reducing stress in children, adults, and older adults. The majority of the retrieved studies recruited young adults, and fewer studies have involved children, middle-aged adults, and older adults. In addition to exergames and casual video games, other genres of commercial off-the-shelf games helped to reduce stress and anxiety.
   Conclusions: Efficacy in reducing stress and anxiety has been demonstrated not only for exergames and casual video games but also for other genres such as action games, action-adventure games, and augmented reality games. Various gaming platforms, including consoles, PCs, smartphones, mobile consoles, and virtual reality systems, have been used with positive results. Finally, even single and short sessions of play had benefits in reducing stress and anxiety.

AB  - Art therapy, as a non-pharmacological medical complementary and alternative therapy, has been used as one of medical interventions with good clinical effects on mental disorders. However, systematically reviewed in detail in clinical situations is lacking. Here, we searched on PubMed for art therapy in an attempt to explore its theoretical basis, clinical applications, and future perspectives to summary its global pictures. Since drawings and paintings have been historically recognized as a useful part of therapeutic processes in art therapy, we focused on studies of art therapy which mainly includes painting and drawing as media. As a result, a total of 413 literature were identified. After carefully reading full articles, we found that art therapy has been gradually and successfully used for patients with mental disorders with positive outcomes, mainly reducing suffering from mental symptoms. These disorders mainly include depression disorders and anxiety, cognitive impairment and dementias, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and autism. These findings suggest that art therapy can not only be served as an useful therapeutic method to assist patients to open up and share their feelings, views, and experiences, but also as an auxiliary treatment for diagnosing diseases to help medical specialists obtain complementary information different from conventional tests. We humbly believe that art therapy has great potential in clinical applications on mental disorders to be further explored.

AB  - Many types of intervention are used to boost adults' self-esteem but their relative efficacy and the characteristics that moderate this efficacy remain unclear. We addressed these questions via a meta-analysis of 119 studies. Results obtained using a random-effects model showed a significant effect of interventions on adults' global selfesteem, d = 0.38, 95% CI [0.33, 0.43]. This efficacy is moderated by some types of intervention, session format, experimenter contact, population type, and type of control group. We discuss these findings by addressing the limitations of our analyses and some issues related to this field of research (e.g., lack of power, heterogeneity of the studies included, publication bias, confounding effects) and by providing recommendations for future research and clinical practice.

KW  - ADAPTATION
KW  - IMPACTS
AB  - Background The global literature on the links between climate change and human health is large, increasing exponentially, and it is no longer feasible to collate and synthesise using traditional systematic evidence mapping approaches. We aimed to use machine learning methods to systematically synthesise an evidence base on climate change and human health. Methods We used supervised machine learning and other natural language processing methods (topic modelling and geoparsing) to systematically identify and map the scientific literature on climate change and health published between Jan 1, 2013, and April 9, 2020. Only literature indexed in English were included. We searched Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and PubMed using title, abstract, and keywords only. We searched for papers including both a health component and an explicit mention of either climate change, climate variability, or climate change-relevant weather phenomena. We classified relevant publications according to the fields of climate research, climate drivers, health impact, date, and geography. We used supervised and unsupervised machine learning to identify and classify relevant articles in the field of climate and health, with outputs including evidence heat maps, geographical maps, and narrative synthesis of trends in climate health-related publications. We included empirical literature of any study design that reported on health pathways associated with climate impacts, mitigation, or adaptation. Findings We predict that there are 15 963 studies in the field of climate and health published between 2013 and 2019. Climate health literature is dominated by impact studies, with mitigation and adaptation responses and their co benefits and co-risks remaining niche topics. Air quality and heat stress are the most frequently studied exposures, with all-cause mortality and infectious disease incidence being the most frequently studied health outcomes. Seasonality, extreme weather events, heat, and weather variability are the most frequently studied climate-related hazards. We found major gaps in evidence on climate health research for mental health, undernutrition, and maternal and child health. Geographically, the evidence base is dominated by studies from high-income countries and China, with scant evidence from low-income counties, which often suffer most from the health consequences of climate change. Interpretation Our findings show the importance and feasibility of using automated machine learning to comprehensively map the science on climate change and human health in the age of big literature. These can provide key inputs into global climate and health assessments. The scant evidence on climate change response options is concerning and could significantly hamper the design of evidence-based pathways to reduce the effects on health of climate change. In the post-2015 Paris Agreement era of climate solutions, we believe much more attention should be given to climate adaptation and mitigation options and their effects on human health.

KW  - Insomnia
KW  - RISK
AB  - Background: Health care workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic experience numerous psychological problems, including stress and anxiety. These entities can affect their sleep quality and predispose them to insomnia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of insomnia among HCWs during the COVID-19 crisis via an umbrella review. Methods: The PRISMA guideline was used to conduct this review. By searching relevant keywords in databases of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, studies that reported the prevalence of insomnia among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020 to the end of January 2021) and had been published in English were identified and evaluated. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I2 index was used to assess heterogeneity. The Egger test was used to determine publication bias. Based on the results of the primary search, 96 studies were identified, and ultimately 10 eligible studies entered the meta-analysis phase. Results: The results of the umbrella review of meta-analyses showed that the prevalence of insomnia among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic was 36.36% (95% CI: 33.36-39.36, I2 = 59.6%, p = 0.006). Conclusions: The results of this umbrella review of meta-analyses showed a relatively high prevalence of insomnia among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. As insomnia can be associated with other psychological problems, policymakers and health managers should regularly screen HCWs for psychological disorders as well as a possible tendency for suicide. Furthermore, by treating insomnia, one can reduce the incidence of these psychological disorders.

AB  - Purpose To examine mental health outcomes of unaccompanied refugee minors during global policy shift. Additionally, to consider mental health service delivery and placement type for this group. Methods A rapid systematic search of research published since 2018 which related to mental health outcomes of unaccompanied refugee minors. Data extracted, risk of bias assessed and outcomes reviewed qualitatively. Research Findings We found 181 papers, of which 14 met inclusion criteria. This review found consistently high levels of PTSD and PTSS among URMs in various contexts. Exposure to trauma, being unaccompanied (compared to accompanied), being female and being older are associated with poor outcomes. Depression and anxiety were consistently high among URMs and associated with discrimination, limited language attainment and daily hassles. High rates of mental illness and symptoms among unaccompanied refugee minors were consistent across national and settlement contexts but the quality of the evidence is variable with significant heterogeneity of assessment. We relate persistence of poor mental health outcomes with problems accessing mental health services and discuss the role of key post-migration factors influencing outcomes-in particular placement type and the use of detention centres.

AB  - Question There is a large worldwide gap between the service need and provision for mental, neurological and substance use disorders. WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) intervention guide (IG), provides evidence-based guidance and tools for assessment and integrated management of priority disorders. Our 2017 systematic review identified 33 peer-reviewed studies describing mhGAP-IG implementation in low-income and middle-income countries. Study selection and analysis We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, 3ie, Google Scholar and citations of our review, on 24 November 2020. We sought evidence, experience and evaluations of the mhGAP-IG, app or mhGAP Humanitarian IG, from any country, in any language. We extracted data from included papers, but heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. Findings Of 2621 results, 162 new papers reported applications of the mhGAP-IG. They described mhGAP training courses (59 references), clinical applications (n=49), research uses (n=27), contextual adaptations (n=13), economic studies (n=7) and other educational applications (n=7). Most were conducted in the African region (40%) and South-East Asia (25%). Studies demonstrated improved knowledge, attitudes and confidence post-training and improved symptoms and engagement with care, post-implementation. Research studies compared mhGAP-IG-enhanced usual care with task-shared psychological interventions and adaptation studies optimised mhGAP-IG implementation for different contexts. Economic studies calculated human resource requirements of scaling up mhGAP-IG implementation and other educational studies explored its potential for repurposing. Conclusions The diverse, expanding global mhGAP-IG literature demonstrates substantial impact on training, patient care, research and practice. Priorities for future research should be less-studied regions, severe mental illness and contextual adaptation of brief psychological interventions.

AB  - The evidence supporting the idea that natural disaster-related prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) influences the child's development has been accumulating for several years. We conducted a meta-analytical review to quantify this effect on different spheres of child development: birth outcomes, cognitive, motor, physical, socio-emotional, and behavioral development. We systematically searched the literature for articles on this topic (2756 articles retrieved and 37 articles included in the systematic review), extracted the relevant data to calculate the effect sizes, and then performed a meta-analysis for each category of outcomes (30 articles included across the meta-analyses) and meta-regressions to determine the effect of some factors of interest on the association between PNMS and child development: type of PNMS (objective, psychological, cognitive, diet), type of natural disaster (ice storm, flood/cyclone), type of report (maternal, third-party observer, medical), timing of exposure (preconception exposure included or not) and child age at assessment (under 10 or 10 years and older). We found that PNMS significantly influences all spheres of child development. Higher PNMS levels were associated with longer gestational age, larger newborns, and higher BMI and adiposity levels, as well as worse cognitive, motor, socio-emotional, and behavioral outcomes.

AB  - Context: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an emerging treatment for improving psychological well-being. Objective: To summarize research evaluating the effects of ACT on psychological well-being in children with special health care needs (SHCN) and their parents. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid/EMBASE and PsycINFO (January 2000-April 2021). Study Selection: Included were studies that assessed ACT in children with SHCN (ages 0-17y) and/or parents of children with SHCN and had a comparator group. Data Extraction: Descriptive data were synthesized and presented in a tabular format, and data on relevant outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, stress, avoidance and fusion) were used in the meta-analyses to explore the effectiveness of ACT (administered independently with no other psychological therapy) compared to no treatment. Results: Ten studies were identified (child (7) and parent (3)). In children with SHCN, ACT was more effective than no treatment at helping depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -4.27, 95% CI: -5.20, -3.34; p < 0.001) and avoidance and fusion (SMD = -1.64, 95% CI: -3.24, -0.03; p = 0.05), but not stress. In parents of children with SHCN, ACT may help psychological inflexibility (SMD = -0.77, 95% CI: -1.07, -0.47; p < 0.01). Limitations: There was considerable statistical heterogeneity in three of the six meta-analyses. Conclusions: There is some evidence that ACT may help with depressive symptoms in children with SHCN and psychological inflexibility in their parents. Research on the efficacy of ACT for a variety of children with SHCN and their parents is especially limited, and future research is needed.

However, maladaptive grief could cause significant impairment in an individual's life, leading to psychopathologies such as major depressive disorder. Research on grief has shifted to a biopsychosocial approach, leaving behind outdated models-such as the Kubler-Ross theory-that have shown poor consistency. The field of psychoneuroimmunology has identified adverse life events such as social loss as being associated with major depressive disorder, and inflammatory processes in chronic health conditions. Likewise, scientists in the field of affective neuroscience have theorized that prolonged and sustained activation of the grief neurological pathway can cause a cascade of neurotransmitters that inhibits the reward-seeking system, causing symptoms of depression. The objective of this review is to highlight findings on the grief process using a biopsychosocial approach to explore grief's impact on psychopathophysiology.

AB  - Lebanon has been under continuous conflict for more than four decades, putting millions of Lebanese at a high risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and creating a complex collective trauma. This paper aimed to review all studies from Lebanon reporting on PTSD in order to describe the prevalence of PTSD and its associated risk factors among Lebanese adults. A search of the MEDLINE/PubMed database was conducted in February/March 2021 to identify research articles on PTSD in Lebanese adults. A total of 1064 articles were identified, out of which 11 articles (5875 participants) published between 2003 and 2020 were included. PTSD prevalence estimates were highly variable across the individual studies, ranging from 2 % to 98 %. Female sex, economic hardship, lower educational level, being unemployed, number of witnessed/experienced traumatic events, and presence of comorbid psychological disorders were associated with higher PTSD rates. In light of the increasing PTSD risk in the Lebanese population as a result of the recent Beirut blast and ongoing social and economic crises, further culturally competent research is needed to provide rigorous evidence on the prevalence, course, and severity of PTSD in Lebanon.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in traumatic events. It is a great hazard of physical and mental health due to their severity and frequency. Traumatic fractures are one of the major causes of PTSD. The incidence of traumatic fractures has been high in recent years, which will directly or indirectly result in PTSD. Our target is to estimate the pooled incidence of PTSD in fracture patients after traumatic events and to explore possible influencing factors by a meta-analysis. The systematic searches in the electronic bibliographic databases of Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wangfang , and Veipu Databases. Not only were heterogeneity and 95% confidence interval (CI) used for comprehensive assessing each pooled, but also was the P value. Subgroup analyses for some sample characteristics were calculated the pooled incidence of PTSD among patients suffered from fractures. In total, 2619 patients suffered from fracture, and were assessed PTSD in the 12 eligible studies. The heterogeneity was not low (I-2 = 97.6%, P < 0.001) in the 12 eligible studies. The pooled incidence of PTSD in fracture patients was 29% (95% CI, 20% to 39%) using random-effects model. Subgroup analyses revealed that the pooled incidence of PTSD among patients after traumatic fracture was statistically significant differences according to the study design, the study location, tools to assess the symptoms of PTSD, the mean age and injury mechanism (all P < 0.001). Fracture sites, injury mechanism and pain were the main influencing factors of PTSD in fracture patients. Our results highlight the phenomenon that high incidence of PTSD in patients after fracture and they should be followed up regularly and be provided effective interventions. Future efforts to improve and control the main influencing factors of PTSD for this population still needed.

AB  - Objective: Inadequate medication adherence is a significant limitation for achieving optimal health outcomes across chronic health conditions. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been increasingly applied to promote medical regimen adherence as MBIs have been shown to improve patient-level barriers to adherence (i. e., depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, stress). The purpose of this review is to investigate the state of research regarding MBIs targeting medication adherence in chronic illnesses and to identify evidence gaps to inform future studies. Methods: The search reviewed 5 databases (e.g., PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, Proquest Thesis/Dissertations) to identify trials that quantitatively evaluated the effect of MBIs on medication adherence. Study abstracts and full texts were screened identifying eligible studies, and findings were summarized using a narrative synthesis. Results: A total of 497 studies were reviewed; 41 were eligible for full text review and 9 were included in narrative synthesis: seven were RCTs and two were pre-post designs. Study quality varied, with five rated moderate or high risk for bias. Clinical populations tested included living with HIV (k = 3), cardiovascular disease (k = 3), psychological disorders (k = 2), and men who underwent a radical prostatectomy (k = 1). Four studies found significant improvements in medication adherence, however only two of these studies had low risk of bias. Conclusions: Research on MBI's for medication adherence is developing, but the effectiveness of MBIs remains unclear due to the nascent stage of evidence and methodological limitations of existing studies. Researchers should prioritize rigorous experimental designs, theory-driven investigations of behavioral mechanisms, and the use of objective measurements of adherence.

AB  - Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability, burdened by high levels of non-response to conventional antidepressants. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting non-monoaminergic pathways are sorely needed. The widely available and safe statins have several putative mechanisms of action, especially anti-inflammatory, which make them ideal candidates for repurposing in the treatment of depression. A large number of articles has been published on this topic. The aim of this study is to assess this literature according to evidence-based medicine principles to inform clinical practise and research. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the electronic databases MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, CINAHL, and , and an unstructured Google Scholar and manual search, until the 9th of April 2021, for all types of clinical studies assessing the effects of statins in depression. Results: Seventy-two studies were retrieved that investigated the effects of statins on the risk of developing depression or on depressive symptoms in both depressed and non-depressed populations. Fifteen studies specifically addressed the effects of statins on inflammatory-related symptoms of anhedonia, psychomotor retardation, anxiety, and sleep disturbances in depression. Most studies suggested a positive effect of statins on the occurrence and severity of depression, with fewer studies showing no effect, while a minority indicated some negative effects. Limitations: We provide a narrative report on all the included studies but did not perform any quantitative analysis, which limits the strength of our conclusions. Conclusions: Robust evidence indicates that statins are unlikely to lead to depressive symptoms in the general population. Promising data suggest a potential role for statins in the treatment of depression. Further clinical studies are needed, especially in specific subgroups of patients identified by pre-treatment assessments of inflammatory and lipid profiles.

AB  - Objective Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a demanding chronic illness that may result in poorer psychological health in youth. Fortunately, certain parenting practices may be protective against adverse outcomes. However, a systematic review of these relationships in youth with T1D is lacking. Thus, the current systematic review examined the literature on parenting and child psychological health outcomes (both internalizing and externalizing symptoms) in youth with T1D. Particular attention is paid to how demographic factors are associated with these relationships. Methods PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed, and a literature search (PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL) was conducted for studies of youth with T1D that examined the relationship between specific parenting practices or characteristics of the parent-child relationship and youth (<19 years old) internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Forty studies met inclusion criteria. Studies were examined for risk of bias. Results Results support that family conflict, critical parenting, support, involvement, and relationship quality are associated with psychological health outcomes in youth with T1D, with some associations varying by parent gender, child age, demographic factors, and internalizing versus externalizing outcomes. Conclusions Findings highlight the importance of bolstering supportive parenting and decreasing family conflict to improve psychological health in this population. Gaps in the literature related to the dearth of father and secondary caregiver report, lack of sample diversity and attention to the influence of demographic factors, and a limited number of studies examining anxiety were identified. Directions for future research and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - Chronic stress is associated with dysregulations in the physiological stress system, resulting in diverse negative developmental outcomes. Since adolescence is a period characterized by increased stress-sensitivity, and schools are an important environment for the developing adolescent, school-based interventions promoting psychosocial functioning are of particular interest to prevent adverse outcomes. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the effectiveness of such interventions on hypothalamic pituitary adrenal-axis (i.e., cortisol) and cardiovascular (i.e., blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]/heart rate variability [HRV]) parameters of stress in adolescents, and examined moderators of effectiveness. The search resulted in the inclusion of k = 9 studies for cortisol, k = 16 studies for BP, and k = 20 studies for HR/HRV. The results indicated a significant small overall effect on reducing BP, but no significant effect for HR/HRV. For cortisol, large methodological variation in the few primary studies did not allow for quantitative analyses, but a qualitative review demonstrated inconsistent results. For BP and HR/HRV, larger effects were observed for intervention programs with a mindfulness and/or meditation component, for interventions without a cognitive-behavioural component and for interventions with a higher intensity. Providing adolescents with techniques to improve indicators of physiological stress may prevent emerging mental health problems.

AB  - Introduction Anxiety and depressive disorders are a significant problem that starts in childhood or adolescence and should be addressed early to avoid chronic mental conditions. There is strong evidence to demonstrate that psychological treatments are effective for these disorders, however, little is known on mediators and mechanisms of change of psychological treatment in adolescents and young adults. Understanding the pathways through which psychological treatments operate will facilitate more effective treatments.
   Aim We aim to conduct a systematic review, exploring the available evidence on mediators of psychological treatments for anxiety and depression in adolescents and young adults.
   Methods A systematic search has been performed on PubMed and PsycINFO databases to identify studies from inception to 23rd February 2020. Eligible studies include randomized controlled trials and trials (quasi-experimental) designs that have enrolled adolescents and young adults presenting with depression and/or anxiety and that have examined mediators of psychological treatments. A group of 20 reviewers from the COST-Action TREATme (CA16102) divided into 10 pairs independently screen studies for inclusion, extract information from the included studies, and assess the methodological quality of the included studies and the requirements for mediators. The methodological quality will be assessed by The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Extracted data from the included studies will be collected and presented using a narrative approach.
   Discussion This systematic review will summarize and provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on mediators of psychological treatments for anxiety and depression for adolescents and young adults. Results will allow the identification of strategies to optimize intervention to enhance clinical outcomes.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required. Findings from this systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated at conferences and meetings. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021234641.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have great difficulties when their routines change, and this may affect the psychological wellbeing of their parents. For this reason, it is important to examine studies that address the mental health of parents in order to adapt to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
   AIM
   To determine the mental health status of parents with children diagnosed with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic.
   METHODS
   The study, which is a systematic review, was conducted between December 15, 2020 and December 30, 2020 by scanning articles in English. The Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were used for scanning. The keywords COVID-19 AND ("autism" OR "autistic" OR "autism spectrum disorder") AND parent AND ("mental health" OR "anxiety" OR "stress") were used in the search process. The inclusion criteria in the study were findings regarding the mental health of parents with children diagnosed with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing their anxiety and stress situations, being a research article, and accessing the full text of the article.
   RESULTS
   In the study, a total of 6389 articles were reached, and the full texts of 173 articles were evaluated for eligibility. After the articles excluded by the full-text search were eliminated, 12 studies involving 7105 parents were included in the analysis. The findings obtained from the articles containing data on mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic of parents with children with autism spectrum disorder were discussed in three groups. These were findings on the experiences of parents with children with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the areas where parents with children with ASD need support in the COVID-19 pandemic and methods of coping with the COVID-19 pandemic for parents with children with ASD. In the systematic review, it was determined that the anxiety and stress of the parents increased, they needed more support compared to the pre- pandemic period, and they had difficulty coping.
   CONCLUSION
   In this systematic review, it was concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the mental health of the parents of children with ASD.

AB  - Introduction: Compared to old people who live at home, depressive symptoms are more prevalent in those who live in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Different kinds of non-pharmacological treatment approaches in LTCFs have been studied, including behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive bibliotherapy, problem-solving therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy and life review/reminiscence. The aim of the current review was to systematically review non-pharmacological treatments used to treat depressed older adults with no or mild cognitive impairment (as described by a Mini Mental State Examination score > 20) living in LTCFs.
   Methods: A research was performed on PubMed and Scopus databases. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) flowchart, studies selection was made. The quality of each Randomized Controlled Trial was scored using the Jadad scale, Quasi-Experimental Design studies and Non-Experimental studies were scored based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)
   Results: The review included 56 full text articles; according to the type of intervention, studies were grouped in the following areas: horticulture/gardening (n = 3), pet therapy (n = 4), physical exercise (n = 9), psychoeducation/rehabilitation (n = 15), psychotherapy (n = 3), reminiscence and story sharing (n = 14), miscellaneous (n = 8).
   Discussion and Conclusion: Despite mixed or negative findings in some cases, most studies included in this systematic review reported that the non-pharmacological interventions assessed were effective in the management of depressed elderly in the LTCFs context. Regrettably, the limitations and heterogeneity of the studies described above hinder the possibility to generalize and replicate results.

AB  - Question Mental disorders typically start in childhood and persist, causing high individual and collective burdens. To inform policymaking to address children's mental health in high-income countries we aimed to identify updated data on disorder prevalence. Methods We identified epidemiological studies reporting mental disorder prevalence in representative samples of children aged 18 years or younger-including a range of disorders and ages and assessing impairment (searching January 1990 through February 2021). We extracted associated service-use data where studies assessed this. We conducted meta-analyses using a random effects logistic model (using R metafor package). Findings Fourteen studies in 11 countries met inclusion criteria, published from 2003 to 2020 with a pooled sample of 61 545 children aged 4-18 years, including eight reporting service use. (All data were collected pre-COVID-19.) Overall prevalence of any childhood mental disorder was 12.7% (95% CI 10.1% to 15.9%; I-2=99.1%). Significant heterogeneity pertained to diagnostic measurement and study location. Anxiety (5.2%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity (3.7%), oppositional defiant (3.3%), substance use (2.3%), conduct (1.3%) and depressive (1.3%) disorders were the most common. Among children with mental disorders, only 44.2% (95% CI 37.6% to 50.9%) received any services for these conditions. Conclusions An estimated one in eight children have mental disorders at any given time, causing symptoms and impairment, therefore requiring treatment. Yet even in high-income countries, most children with mental disorders are not receiving services for these conditions. We discuss the implications, particularly the need to substantially increase public investments in effective interventions. We also discuss the policy urgency, given the emerging increases in childhood mental health problems since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (PROSPERO CRD42020157262).

AB  - Recently, the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based interventions for patients with hypertension have been recognized, but there has been no systematic review that has comprehensively analyzed the efficacy of CBT on health outcomes in this population. We aimed to explore the therapeutic effect of CBT-based interventions on hypertension patients through a meta-analysis. Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were obtained by searching electronic databases. The primary outcomes were physiological indicators (blood pressure, blood lipid profile). Secondary outcomes were psychological indicators (anxiety, depression), and the quality of sleep. Stata version 15.0 software was used to analyze the results. A total of 15 RCTs were included. The main analysis revealed that CBT-based interventions reduced systolic pressure: -8.67 (95% CI: -10.67 to -6.67, P = 0.000); diastolic pressure: -5.82 (95% CI: -7.82 to -3.81, P = 0.000); total cholesterol levels: -0.43 (95% CI: -0.76 to -0.10, P = 0.010); depressive symptoms: -3.13 (95% CI: -4.02 to -2.24, P = 0.000); anxiety symptoms: -3.63 (95% CI: -4.40 to -2.87, P = 0.000); and improved quality of sleep: -2.93 (95% CI: -4.40 to -1.47, P = 0.000). Additionally, the results of subgroup analysis indicated that long-term group-based CBT-based interventions were particularly beneficial for blood pressure management in hypertension patients. CBT-based interventions are effective in reducing systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, total cholesterol levels, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and improving quality of sleep in hypertension patients.

The purpose of this paper is a review of research evidence on interventions with sleep as an outcome (2000 to 2020) and rates of insomnia prevalence and associated factors in prisons (2015 to 2020). Design/methodology/approach An internet-based search used Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), Embase, Web of Science and Scopus. Seven interventions and eight sleep prevalence or sleep-associated factor papers were identified. Findings Intervention research was very limited and the quality of the research design was generally poor. Interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), yoga and mindfulness can be beneficial in a prison setting. This review identified a high prevalence of insomnia in prisons across the world, which was supported by recent evidence. Factors associated with insomnia include anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, personality disorder and pain. Research limitations/implications There is a need for appropriately powered randomised control trials of CBT-I in prisons and a need to use objective measures of sleep quality. Originality/value Due to a lack of an up-to-date review, this paper fulfils the need for a review of the evidence on interventions in prison settings with sleep as an outcome, rates of insomnia prevalence and associated factors in prisons.

AB  - Bipolar disorders (BDs) exhibit high heritability and symptoms typically first occur during late adolescence or early adulthood. Affected individuals may experience alternating bouts of mania/hypomania and depression, with euthymic periods of varying lengths interspersed between these extremes of mood. Clinical research studies have consistently demonstrated that BD patients have disturbances in circadian and seasonal rhythms, even when they are free of symptoms. In addition, some BD patients display seasonal patterns in the occurrence of manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes as well as the time of year when symptoms initially occur. Finally, the age of onset of BD symptoms is strongly influenced by the distance one lives from the equator. With few exceptions, animal models useful in the study of BD have not capitalized on these clinical findings regarding seasonal patterns in BD to explore molecular mechanisms associated with the expression of mania- and depression-like behaviors in laboratory animals. In particular, animal models would be especially useful in studying how rates of change in photoperiod that occur during early spring and fall interact with risk genes to increase the occurrence of mania- and depression-like phenotypes, respectively. Another unanswered question relates to the ways in which seasonally relevant changes in photoperiod affect responses to acute and chronic stressors in animal models. Going forward, we suggest ways in which translational research with animal models of BD could be strengthened through carefully controlled manipulations of photoperiod to enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying seasonal patterns of BD symptoms in humans. In addition, we emphasize the value of incorporating diurnal rodent species as more appropriate animal models to study the effects of seasonal changes in light on symptoms of depression and mania that are characteristic of BD in humans.

AB  - Objective The uptake of evidence-based guideline recommendations appears to be challenging. In the midst of the discussion on how to overcome these barriers, the question of whether the use of guidelines leads to improved patient outcomes threatens to be overlooked. This study examined the effectiveness of evidence-based guidelines for all psychiatric disorders on patient health outcomes in specialist mental health care. All types of evidence-based guidelines, such as psychological and medication-focused guidelines, were eligible for inclusion. Provider performance was measured as a secondary outcome. Time to remission when treated with the guidelines was also examined. Method Six databases were searched until 10 August 2020. Studies were selected, and data were extracted independently according to the PRISMA guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool estimates across studies. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Review Group criteria. PROSPERO:CRD42020171311. Results The meta-analysis included 18 studies (N = 5380). Guidelines showed a positive significant effect size on the severity of psychopathological symptoms at the patient level when compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) (d = 0.29, 95%-CI = (0.19, 0.40), p < 0.001). Removal of a potential outlier gave globally the same results with Cohen's d = 0.26. Time to remission was shorter in the guideline treatment compared with TAU (HR = 1.54, 95%-CI = (1.29, 1.84), p = 0.001, n = 3). Conclusions Patients cared for with guideline-adherent treatments improve to a greater degree and more quickly than patients treated with TAU. Knowledge on the mechanisms of change during guideline-adherent treatment needs to be developed further such that we can provide the best possible treatment to patients in routine care.

AB  - BackgroundRacism is increasingly recognised as a significant health determinant that contributes to health inequalities. In Australia efforts have been made to bridge the recognised health gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians. This systematic scoping review aimed to assess, synthesise, and analyse the evidence in Australia about the impacts of racism on the mental and physical health of Aboriginal and Torrens Strait Islander peoples.MethodsA systematic search was conducted to locate Australian studies in English published between 2000 and 2020. Five electronic databases were used: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science and the Australia's National Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research. The search strategy included a combination of key words related with racism, mental health, physical health and Indigenous people. Data were extracted based on review questions and findings were synthesized in a narrative summary.ResultsOf total 338 searched studies from five databases, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria for narrative synthesis where eight were cross-sectional studies and four prospective cohorts. General mental health and general health perception were the most frequently studied outcomes followed by child behaviour, smoking and substance consumption and specific health conditions. The prevalence of racism varied between 6.9 and 97%. The most common health outcomes associated with racism were general poor mental health and poor general health perception. More specific health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, child behaviour, asthma, increased BMI and smoking were also associated with racism but were analysed by a limited number of studies. Three studies analysed psychological distress, negative mental health, sleeping difficulties and negative perceived mental health according to severity of exposition to racism.ConclusionRacism is associated with negative overall mental and negative general health outcomes among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Strategies to prevent all forms and sources of racism are necessary to move forward to bridging the health gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous Australians. Further research is needed to understand in more detail the impact of racism from an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander definition of health and wellbeing.

Libosch. ex Fisch. & Mey., and Gardenia, the fruit of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis from Rubiaceae, both are famous traditional Chinese medicines that have been traditionally used in China. Catalpol and geniposide, as two kinds of iridoid glycosides with high activities, are the main bioactive components in Rehmannia glutinosa and Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, respectively. Over the past few decades, catalpol and geniposide have been widely studied for their therapeutic effects. The preclinical experiments demonstrated that they possessed significant neuroprotective activities against Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and depression, etc. In this paper, the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of catalpol and geniposide on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease from 2005 to now were systematically summarized and comprehensively analyzed. At the same time, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the analyzed compounds were also described, hoping to provide some enlightenment for the design, research, and development of iridoid glycosides.

AB  - Background: The perinatal period is a particularly vulnerable period in women's lives that implies significant physiological and psychological changes that can place women at higher risk for depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is likely to increase this vulnerability and the prevalence of mental health problems. This review aimed to investigate the existing literature on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women during pregnancy and the first year postpartum. Method: The literature search was conducted using the following databases: Pubmed, Scopus, WOS-web of science, PsycInfo and Google Scholar. Out of the total of 116 initially selected papers, 17 have been included in the final work, according to the inclusion criteria. Results: The reviewed contributions report a moderate to severe impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health of pregnant women, mainly in the form of a significant increase in depression-up to 58% in Spain-and anxiety symptoms-up to 72% in Canada. In addition to the common psychological symptoms, COVID-19-specific worries emerged with respect to its potential effects on pregnancy and the well-being of the unborn child. Social support and being engaged in regular physical activities appear to be protective factors able to buffer against the effects of the pandemic on maternal mental health. Conclusions: Despite the limitations of the study design, the evidence suggests that it is essential to provide appropriate psychological support to pregnant women during the emergency in order to protect their mental health and to minimize the risks of long-term effects on child development.

AB  - For many Indigenous communities, decreased participation in traditional land-based activities has led to higher rates of chronic disease and a decrease in well-being. This systematic review explores how traditional land-based activities impact self-reported health and well-being of Indigenous adults, using Indigenous and Western perspectives. A search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) identified nine studies which explored the experiences and perspectives of Indigenous adults taking part in land-based subsistence and ceremonial activities. A thematic analysis of these studies identified many interconnected physical, spiritual, mental, emotional, and community benefits. Community engagement throughout all stages of the interventions was an important factor in effectively addressing challenges and barriers stemming from colonization, decreased knowledge transfer, and increased use of technology. Participants reported developing more effective stress management techniques, a greater awareness of modifiable risk factors along with increased engagement with Elders. Ultimately, land-based subsistence and ceremonial activities were identified as playing an influential role in the lives of Indigenous adults. The involvement of community members allowed for the development of more culturally relevant interventions. Future community-specific research is needed to increase engagement in traditional physical-activities, improve well-being and overall reduce the risk of chronic disease.

AB  - Background: Psychedelic compounds such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and 3,4-Methyl-enedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) share a long and complex history with psychiatry. A half century ago, psychedelics were widely employed by psychiatrists in investigational and clinical settings, with studies demonstrating promising findings for their use in the treatment of mental illness and substance use disorders. However, concerns were also raised about their abuse potential and other adverse effects. Owing to these worries and psychedelics' association with the counter-culture movement, psychedelics were largely outlawed in the United States in 1970, bringing research on their therapeutic potential to a halt. However, in recent years, a resurgence of psychedelic research has revealed compelling, though early, evidence for the use of psychedelic-assisted therapy in treating alcohol use disorder, nicotine use disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression. Objective: Here we provide an overview of psychiatry's complicated relationship with psychedelics, while reviewing contemporary findings on psychedelic-assisted therapy, safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy, and risks of nonmedical use. We also make the case that psychiatry should consider preparing now for the possibility of Food and Drug Administration approval of psychedelic-assisted therapies in the near future. We conclude by discussing how growing societal interest in psychedelics could impact the work of consult-liaison psychiatrists, while also exploring how consult-liaison psychiatrists might contribute to future delivery of psychedelic treatments. Methods: We reviewed literature on psychedelic-assisted therapies and adverse events resulting from nonmedical psychedelic use. Results: We found a small, but rapidly growing literature indicating that psychedelic-assisted therapies may have treatment potential for mental illness and addiction. Our search also revealed a variety of rare adverse events stemming from nonmedical psychedelic use. Conclusions: Despite past concerns about psychedelics, current data indicate psychedelic-assisted therapy may potentially reduce suffering owing to mental illness and addiction if administered thoughtfully and cautiously by trained professionals in medical settings.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers and informal caregivers were at an increased risk of adverse mental health effects. This systematic review provides a summary of the available evidence on the content and efficacy of the psychological support interventions in increasing mental health among healthcare providers and informal caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychINFO, and Scopus databases were systematically searched for relevant articles, and the methodological quality of selected articles was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Results: A search of electronic databases identified five reports based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. All psychological support interventions for caregivers were delivered digitally. Despite the large heterogeneity of the selected studies, the findings support the efficacy of mental health interventions in reducing distress and burnout, while promoting self-efficacy and well-being in both healthcare providers and informal caregivers. Conclusion: Since mental health problems are expected to increase during, and as a result of, the COVID-19 pandemic, and digital tools might offer a range of mental health treatments to meet the unique and immediate needs of people, further research is needed to test the cost-effectiveness of digital psychological interventions.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) may influence the secretion of neurotransmitters and thereby have positive consequences for an individual's vulnerability (i.e., reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms). This systematic review aims to analyse the potential bidirectional effects of exercise on dopamine from young adulthood to old age. The article search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in December 2020. The inclusion criteria were longitudinal and experimental study design; outcomes included dopamine and exercise; effect of exercise on dopamine and vice versa; adults; and articles published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Fifteen articles were included in the review. We observed robust findings concerning the potential effects of PA on dopamine, which notably seem to be observable across a wide range of participants characteristics (including age and sex), a variety of PA characteristics, and a broad set of methods to analyse dopamine. By contrast, regarding the potential effects of dopamine on PA, findings were mixed across studies. Thus, there are robust effects of physical exercise on dopamine. These findings further strengthen the idea that innovative approaches could include PA interventions for treating and preventing mental disorders. Therefore, it seems that PA is a potential alternative to deal with mental health issues.

AB  - The obsessive-compulsive spectrum refers to disorders drawn from several diagnostic categories that share core features related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), such as obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors and anxiety. Disorders that include these features can be grouped according to the focus of the symptoms, e.g., bodily preoccupation (i.e., eating disorders, ED) or impulse control (i.e., substance use disorders, SUD), and they exhibit intriguing similarities in phenomenology, etiology, pathophysiology, patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonist ketamine has been indicated to produce remarkable results in patients with treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and OCD in dozens of small studies accrued over the past decade, and it appears to be promising in the treatment of SUD and ED. However, despite many small studies, solid evidence for the benefits of its use in the treatment of OCD spectrum and addiction is still lacking. Thus, the aim of this perspective article is to examine the potential for ketamine and esketamine in treating OCD, ED and SUD, which all involve recurring and intrusive thoughts and generate associated compulsive behavior. A comprehensive and updated overview of the literature regarding the pharmacological mechanisms of action of both ketamine and esketamine, as well as their therapeutic advantages over current treatments, are provided in this paper. An electronic search was performed, including all papers published up to April 2021, using the following keywords ("ketamine" or "esketamine") AND ("obsessive" OR "compulsive" OR "OCD" OR "SUD" OR "substance use disorder" OR "addiction" OR "craving" OR "eating" OR "anorexia") NOT review NOT animal NOT "in vitro", on the PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science online databases. The review was conducted in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The use and efficacy of ketamine in SUD, ED and OCD is supported by glutamatergic neurotransmission dysregulation, which plays an important role in these conditions. Ketamine's use is increasing, and preliminary data are optimistic. Further studies are needed in order to better clarify the many unknowns related to the use of both ketamine and esketamine in SUD, ED and OCD, and to understand their long-term effectiveness.

AB  - Aims: Chronic loneliness is experienced by around a third of parents, but there is no comprehensive review into how, why and which parents experience loneliness. This scoping review aimed to provide insight into what is already known about parental loneliness and give directions for further applied and methodological research. Methods: Searches for peer-reviewed articles were undertaken in six databases: PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus, during May 2019 to February 2020. We searched for English studies which examined loneliness experienced during parenthood, including studies that involved parents with children under 16 years and living at home and excluding studies on pregnancy, childbirth or postbirth hospital care. Results: From 2566 studies retrieved, 133 were included for analysis. Most studies (n = 80) examined the experience of loneliness in specific groups of parents, for example, teenage parents, parents of a disabled child. Other studies examined theoretical issues (n = 6) or health and wellbeing impacts on parents (n = 16) and their offspring (n = 17). There were 14 intervention studies with parents that measured loneliness as an outcome. Insights indicate that parental loneliness may be different to loneliness experienced in other cohorts. There is evidence that parental loneliness has direct and intergenerational impacts on parent and child mental health. Some parents (e.g. with children with chronic illness or disability, immigrant or ethnic minority parents) also appear to be at increased risk of loneliness although evidence is not conclusive. Conclusion: This work has identified key gaps with further international, comparative and conceptual research needed.

AB  - Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is associated with several disease-related impairments contributing to the psycho-social burden of those patients, such as deterioration of well-being and overall quality of life (QOL). The aim of this study is to present the wide range of factors potentially impacting patients' overall well-being and possible preventive interventions. Methods: This systematic review was conducted in October 2020 with a search in the PubMed, MedLine, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar databases. We used the keywords "gastric cancer," "gastric neoplasm," and each of them combined with "quality of life," "depression," and "anxiety" to identify all relevant articles reporting about potential impact factors influencing the overall well-being of patients suffering from gastric cancer. Results: Finally, 125,490 articles were found, of which 125,431 were excluded in several steps of screening. Inclusion criteria were studies carried out on human >= 18 years of age, studies in English or German language, clinical trials, registry-based studies, cohort studies, population-based studies, and certain titles and abstracts. After screening for eligibility 35 potential factors influencing overall well-being in patients with GC were identified and classified into 9 important categories: genetic condition, treatment method, blood markers, nutritional status, daily living, state of health, mental state, supportive care, and alternative treatment. Conclusion: Since various factors are involved in the development of patients' overall well-being, timely treatment of psycho-social impairments by physicians and psychologists is of enormous importance. Preventing psycho-social burden by improving patients' QOL should be of high importance in the treatment regimen of patients with GC.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to analyse the studies centered on the effects of Olympic combat sports (OCS [i.e., boxing, fencing, judo, karate, taekwondo, wrestling]) on older adults' physical-functional, physiological, and psychoemotional health status. The review comprised randomised-controlled trials with OCS interventions, including older adults (>= 60 years), and measures of physical-functional, physiological, and/or psychoemotional health. The studies were searched through SCOPUS, PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and EBSCO databases until 5 January 2021. The PRISMA-P and TESTEX scales were used to assess the quality of the selected studies. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (code: CRD42020204034). Twelve OCS intervention studies were found (scored >= 60% for methodological quality), comprising 392 females and 343 males (mean age: 69.6 years), participating in boxing, judo, karate, and taekwondo. The qualitative analysis revealed that compared to controls, OCS training improved muscle strength, cardiorespiratory capacity, agility, balance, movement, attention, memory, mental health, anxiety, and stress tolerance. Meta-analysis was available only for the chair stand test, and an improvement was noted after OCS training compared to control. In conclusion, OCS interventions improves older adults' physical-functional, physiological, and psychoemotional health. Our systematic review confirms that OCS training has high adherence (greater than 80%) in older adults.

AB  - Background and objectives Suicide mortality has not decreased in recent decades, partly due to the lack of valid predictors. A small number of systematic reviews have been published on the different integrated theoretical models of suicide, although no attempts have been made to bring together the different perspectives into a single integrated model.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases up to January 2020 to identify studies on integrated theoretical models of suicidal behaviour.
   Results: Eleven articles met the selection criteria and were included in the review. Some of the key risk factors indicated by most of the models are traumatic events, childhood abuse, feelings of defeat and entrapment, emotional dysregulation, and social exclusion.
   Conclusions: Suicidal behaviour remains a complex phenomenon involving multiple factors. The synergistic effect between all the factors involved should be considered.

AB  - Depression is a serious mental and mood disorder with global health and economic burden. This burden may be overwhelming in low income countries, although there are insufficient data. Most antidepressant formulations are predicated on the monoamine, neuroendocrine and neum-inflammation hypotheses, with little or no cognizance to other neurochemicals altered in depression. A nutritional strategy with or without conventional antidepressants is recommended, as nutrition plays vital roles in the onset, severity and duration of depression, with poor nutrition contributing to its pathogenesis. This review discusses nutritional potentials of utilizing omega-3 fatty acids, proteins, vitamins, minerals and herbs or their phytochemicals in the management of depression with the aim of reducing depression burden. Literature search of empirical data in books and journals in data bases including but not limited to PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science and Google Scholar that might contain discussions of sampling were sought, their full text obtained, and searched for relevant content to determine eligibility. Omega-3 fatty and amino acids had significant positive anti-depression outcomes, while vitamins and minerals although essential, enhanced omega-3 fatty and amino acids activities. Some herbs either as whole extracts or their phytochemicals/metabolites had significant positive anti-depression efficacy. Nutrition through the application of necessary food classes or herbs as well as their phytochemicals, may go a long way to effectively manage depression. This therefore will provide inexpensive, natural, and noninvasive therapeutic means with reduced adverse effects that can also be applied alongside clinical management. This nutritional strategy should be given more attention in research, assessment and treatment for those with depression and other mental illness in low income countries, especially in Africa.

AB  - Background and aims: The outbreak of COVID-19 led to a significant psychological impact on individuals, particularly those belonging to vulnerable groups. This study aimed to synthesize literature on the psychological impact of COVID-19 among children and adolescents. Methods: Electronic search engines were used to identify studies till March 2021 that reported symptoms of psychological origin in children and adolescents. Information was extracted using a predefined template, and qualitative analysis was conducted using STROBE. Results: One hundred and two relevant papers were identified. Most of the studies were conducted online or telephonically. The study designs were primarily single group cross-sectional, though a few prospective/retrospective designs were also identified. Studies assessing emotional distress showed variable levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the study population, with greater severity of anxiety symptoms among females and older adolescents. Reduced physical activity; delayed sleep time; increased sleep duration, screen time, internet use, and sedentary habits, poor quality of life were other notable findings, often correlating with anxiety/depression. Efforts to address bias, discussion on generalizability of their results, and sample size calculation were not reported in most studies. Conclusion: Psychological impact on children/adolescents is significant, either due to the fear of the illness or social isolation related to COVID-19. One may focus on improving sleep habits and physical activity and regulating internet use for maintaining psychological well-being.

AB  - Despite decades of research on the neurobiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), the mechanisms underlying its expression remain unknown. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a hub region involved in emotional processing and stress response elaboration, is highly impacted in MDD patients and animal models of chronic stress. Recent advances showed alterations in the morphology and activity of mPFC neurons along with profound changes in their transcriptional programs. Studies at the circuitry level highlighted the relevance of deciphering the contributions of the distinct prefrontal circuits in the elaboration of adapted and maladapted behavioral responses in the context of chronic stress. Interestingly, MDD presents a sexual dimorphism, a feature recognized in the molecular field but understudied on the circuit level. This review examines the recent literature and summarizes the contribution of the mPFC circuitry in the expression of MDD in males and females along with the morphological and functional alterations that change the activity of these neuronal circuits in human MDD and animal models of depressive-like behaviors.

AB  - The human gut microbiome influence on brain function and mental health is an emerging area of intensive research. Animal and human research indicates adolescence as a sensitive period when the gut-brain axis is fine-tuned, where dietary interventions to change the microbiome may have long-lasting consequences for mental health. This study reports a systematic review and meta-analysis of microbiota-targeted (psychobiotics) interventions on anxiety in youth, with discussion of a consultation on the acceptability of psychobiotic interventions for mental health management amongst youth with lived experience. Six databases were searched for controlled trials in human samples (age range: 10-24 years) seeking to reduce anxiety. Post intervention outcomes were extracted as standard mean differences (SMDs) and pooled based on a random-effects model. 5416 studies were identified: 14 eligible for systematic review and 10 eligible for meta-analysis (total of 324 experimental and 293 control subjects). The meta-analysis found heterogeneity I-2 was 12% and the pooled SMD was -0.03 (95% CI: -0.21, 0.14), indicating an absence of effect. One study presented with low bias risk, 5 with high, and 4 with uncertain risk. Accounting for risk, sensitivities analysis revealed a SMD of -0.16 (95% CI: -0.38, 0.07), indicative of minimal efficacy of psychobiotics for anxiety treatment in humans. There is currently limited evidence for use of psychobiotics to treat anxiety in youth. However, future progress will require a multidisciplinary research approach, which gives priority to specifying mechanisms in the human models, providing causal understanding, and addressing the wider context, and would be welcomed by anxious youths.

AB  - Lactobacillus species play a critical role in the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. Consequently, they have the potential to aid in the treatment of psychological disorders. The impact of Lactobacillus supplementation on the stress responses triggering psychological disorders has not been systematically reviewed. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis is to summarize the body of research assessing the effects of Lactobacillus-based probiotics in rodents that underwent an experimental stress treatment or not. The duration of immobility in a Forced Swim Test (FST) was the outcome used to measure changes induced by various treatments. Four online databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published in English. Fourteen studies meeting the criteria were included in the meta-analysis. The effects of probiotic supplementation and stress treatment on the duration of immobility in the FST were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots. Our analysis shows that Lactobacillus-based probiotic supplements significantly reduce immobility in the FST (P < 0.001) in stressed rodents. However, probiotics did not affect the rodents that did not undergo the stress treatment (P = 0.168). These findings provide a better understanding of the potential of Lactobacillus-based probiotics for the management of stress-induced behavior.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease and Injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates), supported by a large number of individual experts. Evidence from previous reviews suggests that exposure to long working hours may cause depression. In this article, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating (if feasible) the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from depression that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.
   Objectives: We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and >55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on depression (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality).
   Data sources: We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including the WHO International Clinical Trial Registers Platform, Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsycInfo. We also searched grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews; and consulted additional experts.
   Study eligibility and criteria: We included working-age (>15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged <15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and >55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on depression (prevalence, incidence and/or mortality). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined odds ratios using random-effects meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project.
   Results: Twenty-two studies (all cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 109,906 participants (51,324 females) in 32 countries (as one study included multiple countries) in three WHO regions (Americas, Europe and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with a clinical diagnostic interview (four studies), interview questions about diagnosis and treatment of depression (three studies) or a validated self-administered rating scale (15 studies). The outcome was defined as incident depression in all 22 studies, with first time incident depression in 21 studies and recurrence of depression in one study. We did not identify any study on prevalence of depression or on mortality from depression. For the body of evidence for the outcome incident depression, we had serious concerns for risk of bias due to selection because of incomplete outcome data (most studies assessed depression only twice, at baseline and at a later follow-up measurement, and likely have missed cases of depression that occurred after baseline but were in remission at the time of the follow-up measurement) and due to missing information on life-time prevalence of depression before baseline measurement.
   Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we are uncertain about the effect on acquiring (or incidence of) depression of working 41-48 h/week (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.29, 8 studies, 49,392 participants, I2 46%, low quality of evidence); 49-54 h/week (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21, 8 studies, 49,392 participants, I2 40%, low quality of evidence); and > 55 h/week (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, 17 studies, 91,142 participants, I2 46%, low quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences by WHO region, sex, age group and socioeconomic status. Sensitivity analyses found no statistically significant differences by outcome measurement (clinical diagnostic interview [gold standard] versus other measures) and risk of bias ("high"/ "probably high" ratings in any domain versus "low"/"probably low" in all domains).
   Conclusions: We judged the existing bodies of evidence from human data as "inadequate evidence for harmfulness" for all three exposure categories, 41-48, 48-54 and >55 h/week, for depression prevalence, incidence and mortality; the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects of the exposure. Producing estimates of the burden of depression attributable to exposure to long working appears not evidence-based at this point. Instead, studies examining the association between long working hours and risk of depression are needed that address the limitations of the current evidence.

KW  - MENTAL-HEALTH
KW  - ERA
AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to assess the various psychological effects of the Coronavirus on those in isolation, the factors that cause these effects during the pandemic, as well as to discuss the recommendations and strategies that can be implemented to help reduce the negative psychological impact.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid), excerpta medica dataBASE (Ovid) and cumulative index of nursing and allied health literature (Elton B. Stephens Company), as well as grey literature, were used as a part of the search design to locate articles published on this subject. The search design was formatted in a way that aided in locating articles concerning a variety of mental health effects. Title and abstract screening and full text screening were conducted by two reviewers. The risk of bias assessment was conducted using AMSTAR2. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and was confirmed by the other.
   Findings
   A total of 28 articles were obtained, and of those, 11 were included in the review. From the data that was reviewed, the majority of the isolated individuals felt depressed and anxious. This negative psychological distress contributes to deteriorating health and quality of life in many people.
   Research limitations/implications
   Few limitations include limited published research papers pertaining to the subject of the mental health effects of COVID-19 on individuals in social isolation. Therefore, this suggests the need for higher quality studies to be performed on this topic.
   Originality/value
   This review provides a unique viewpoint on the effects of COVID-19, allowing for others to have a better understanding of the wide range of psychological impacts the pandemic has brought on.

NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV XX(X) XXX-XXX, 2020. - Heterogeneous alterations of the cortisol stress response in Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) were recently reported by a systematic literature review. To investigate the moderating effect of frequent psychiatric comorbidities, we systematically searched for studies on cortisol stress response to psychosocial stress in ADHD compared to Conduct Disorder (CD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) following PRISMA guidelines. EBSCOhost and PubMed databases were searched in July 2020, employing relevant keywords. Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. While blunted cortisol stress response was consistently reported in individuals with CD and/or Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), alterations of cortisol stress response were less pronounced in ADHD. Consistently blunted cortisol stress response in ADHD was only found in children with comorbid CD/ODD. Results on cortisol stress response in children and adolescents with MDD were mixed, and no indication for influence of comorbid MDD on cortisol stress response in ADHD was found. Taken together, altered cortisol stress response in ADHD is driven by comorbidity with disruptive behavior disorders. Limitations of previous research and suggestions for future studies are discussed.

AB  - Objective Review and synthesise Australian and New Zealand research on correlates and predictors of child to parent violence. Method Ten electronic databases were searched for relevant empirical studies. An integrative review methodology was adopted, with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool used to assess methodological quality. Results Twenty-one relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. Assessment of methodological quality revealed a moderate level of bias resulting from small sample sizes and a lack of representative sampling, missing outcome data, definitional variations, and inconsistencies in categorising variables across studies. The primary factors identified as correlates were prolonged or early childhood exposure to adult intimate partner violence and adversity, a childhood behavioural pattern of aggressive behaviour, mental health or emotional or behavioural disorders, other criminality and negative peer associations. Conclusion Extracting and understanding developmental pathways in the Australian and New Zealand context that contribute towards child to parent violence was limited by the amount and quality of research. Thus, highlighting the need for further research in this field. What is already known about this topic:
   A small amount of research has been conducted in Australia and New Zealand relating to child to parent violence. The factors contributing to a young person engaging in child to parent violence are complex and interrelated. Exposure to adult intimate partner violence in childhood is a known correlate of child to parent violence. What this topic adds:
   This is the first integrative review of Australian and New Zealand evidence on child to parent violence. While childhood behavioural and emotional disorders were identified as correlates for young people engaging in violence towards parents, this research evidence is not strong. This review reveals a need to examine further the developmental pathways towards child to parent violence, identifying points of intervention best suited to service engagement.

AB  - Purpose Relaxation has significant restorative properties and implications for public health. However, modern, busy lives leave limiting time for relaxation. Virtual reality (VR) experiences of pleasant and calming virtual environments, accessed with a head-mounted display (HMD), appear to promote relaxation. This study aimed to provide a systematic review of feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of studies that use VR to promote relaxation in the general population (PROSPERO 195,804). Methods Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase, and MEDLINE were searched until 29th June 2020. Studies were included in the review if they used HMD technology to present virtual environments that aimed to promote or measure relaxation, or relaxation-related variables. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool was used to assess methodological quality of studies. Results 6403 articles were identified through database searching. Nineteen studies published between 2007 and 2020, with 1278 participants, were included in the review. Of these, thirteen were controlled studies. Studies predominantly used natural audio-visual stimuli to promote relaxation. Findings indicate feasibility, acceptability, and short-term effectiveness of VR to increase relaxation and reduce stress. Six studies received an EPHPP rating of 'strong', seven were 'moderate', and six were 'weak'. Conclusions VR may be a useful tool to promote relaxation in the general population, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when stress is increasing worldwide. However, methodological limitations, such as limited randomised controlled trials and longer-term evidence, mean that these conclusions should be drawn with caution. More robust studies are needed to support this promising area of VR relaxation.

AB  - Introduction: Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare and malignant neoplasms characterized by their potential to produce metabolically active substances with the capacity to bring about clinical syndromes. The clinical expression of serotonin-producing NETs is known as carcinoid syndrome (CS). The synthesis of serotonin in the brain is dependent on tryptophan availability. At the central level, serotonin is indispensable for mood, anxiety, and sleep regulation. In CS patients, around 60% of all tryptophan is reported to be consumed by tumor cells for the peripheral synthesis of serotonin, increasing the risk of a central deficiency and thus psychiatric disorders.
   Materials and methods: This manuscript reviews the existing literature about psychiatric disorders associated with NETs and addresses the safety of psychiatric drugs in these patients. A systematic search of the biomedical literature was performed using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycInfo (OVID), and Cochrane CENTRAL (Wiley). The database search included articles published between January 1965 and February 2021. Relevant information were charted using a calibrated charting-form.
   Results: Twenty-two articles were included in the present review. The overall population size of the studies came to 3319 patients. All patients presented a confirmed diagnosis of NET. The information about the presence of CS was confirmed in 351 cases. The psychiatric symptoms reported included mood disturbances (including, depression and anxiety), psychoses, impulse control disorders and sleeping alterations. We also evaluated the presence of cognitive impairments in NET patients. Finally, we summarize the available data regarding the safety of psychiatric drugs in this setting.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric disorders among NET patients are poorly recognized, and therefore have received very little research attention. As a result, no standardized algorithm is presently available. Our findings support detailed psychiatric evaluation in NET patients, especially in those presenting CS and symptoms suggestive of psychiatric involvement. Not only do cognitive impairment and psychiatry symptoms negatively impact health related quality of life in cancer patients, they can also reduce survival rates. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Problem: College students report high levels of mental and emotional exhaustion. As part of the 24-hour activity cycle (24-HAC), sleep, sedentary behavior (SED), and physical activity are health habits that may exert inde-pendent and interactive effects on daily aspects of wellbeing and health in this cohort. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the available evidence on relationships between the individual components of the 24-HAC and feelings of energy and fatigue among college students. Method: Three databases were searched using terms related to sleep, SED, light-intensity physical activity (LIPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), energy, fatigue, and college students. Peer-reviewed, pri-mary studies published in English using valid and reliable measures were included. Results: Fifty-two unique studies were identified for inclusion. Sleep quality and quantity are likely positively associated with feelings of energy and negatively associated with feelings of fatigue; however, studies on LIPA and SED were less common leading to inconclusive findings. Most studies reported on associations between MVPA and feelings of energy or fatigue and indicate positive and negative relationships, respectively. Conclusions: To date, most research has focused on relationships between MVPA and feelings of energy and fa-tigue. More research is needed to further characterize relationships between the other behavioral components and these outcomes of interest. Additionally, future research should include measurements of all four behavioral components within the framework of the 24-HAC to more fully elucidate how these behaviors interact to impact feelings of energy and fatigue in college students.

AB  - Background: Uncertainty surrounds the ethical and legal implications of algorithmic and data-driven technologies in the mental health context, including technologies characterized as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and other forms of automation.
   Objective: This study aims to survey empirical scholarly literature on the application of algorithmic and data-driven technologies in mental health initiatives to identify the legal and ethical issues that have been raised.
   Methods: We searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies on the application of algorithmic technologies in mental health care in the Scopus, Embase, and Association for Computing Machinery databases. A total of 1078 relevant peer-reviewed applied studies were identified, which were narrowed to 132 empirical research papers for review based on selection criteria. Conventional content analysis was undertaken to address our aims, and this was supplemented by a keyword-in-context analysis.
   Results: We grouped the findings into the following five categories of technology: social media (53/132, 40.1%), smartphones (37/132, 28%), sensing technology (20/132, 15.1%), chatbots (5/132, 3.8%), and miscellaneous (17/132, 12.9%). Most initiatives were directed toward detection and diagnosis. Most papers discussed privacy, mainly in terms of respecting the privacy of research participants. There was relatively little discussion of privacy in this context. A small number of studies discussed ethics directly (10/132, 7.6%) and indirectly (10/132, 7.6%). Legal issues were not substantively discussed in any studies, although some legal issues were discussed in passing (7/132, 5.3%), such as the rights of user subjects and privacy law compliance.
   Conclusions: Ethical and legal issues tend to not be explicitly addressed in empirical studies on algorithmic and data-driven technologies in mental health initiatives. Scholars may have considered ethical or legal matters at the ethics committee or institutional review board stage. If so, this consideration seldom appears in published materials in applied research in any detail. The form itself of peer-reviewed papers that detail applied research in this field may well preclude a substantial focus on ethics and law. Regardless, we identified several concerns, including the near-complete lack of involvement of mental health service users, the scant consideration of algorithmic accountability, and the potential for overmedicalization and techno-solutionism. Most papers were published in the computer science field at the pilot or exploratory stages. Thus, these technologies could be appropriated into practice in rarely acknowledged ways, with serious legal and ethical implications.

AB  - The utility of cannabinoids and cannabinoid-based products (CBPs) as a pharmacological aid to treat psychiatric disorders in adulthood is still poorly understood despite a number of comprehensive general reviews discussing the topic. With a focus on randomized controlled trial (RCT) data, this review and meta-analysis aimed to aggregate and evaluate all current high-quality (Level-1) research that specifically assessed the effectiveness of a CBP on a diagnosed adult psychiatric disorder. The following databases, from their inception to September 2020, were included in the search: Academic Search Premier, PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE (R), Web of ScienceTM, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, CINAHL (Nursing and Allied Health), and Scopus. Risk of bias for each study was individually assessed using the revised Cochrane tool. Of the 2397 papers identified, thirty-one RCTs met criteria for inclusion: ten trials focused on treating cannabis use disorder, six on schizophrenia, five on opioid/tobacco use disorder, three on anxiety disorders, two on Tourette's disorder, two on anorexia nervosa, and one trial each for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. This review finds limited evidence for the effectiveness of CBPs to acutely treat a narrow range of psychiatric symptoms. We report no evidence supporting the mid- to long-range effectiveness of any currently available CBP. In general, quality of the evidence was assessed as low- to moderate. Importantly, none of the studies discussed in this review presently endorse the use of cannabis flower as a method of treatment for any recognized psychiatric disorder. Larger, hypothesis driven RCTs are required prior to making further therapeutic recommendations.

AB  - Background: Bipolar Disorder (BD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) have clinically been evolving as separate disorders, though there is still debate on the nosological valence of both conditions, their interaction in terms of co-morbidity or disorder spectrum and their distinct pathophysiology. Objective: The objective of this review is to summarize evidence regarding clinical features, neuropsychological performance and neuroimaging findings from cross-diagnostic studies comparing BD and BPD, to further caracterize their complex interplay. Methods: Using PubMed, PsycINFO and TripDataBase, we conducted a systematic literature search based on PRISMA guidelines of studies published from January 1980 to September 2019 which directly compared BD and BPD. Results: A total of 28 studies comparing BD and BPD were included: 19 compared clinical features, 6 neuropsychological performance and three neuroimaging abnormalities. Depressive symptoms have an earlier onset in BPD than BD. BD patients present more mixed or manic symptoms, with BD-I differing from BPD in manic phases. BPD patients show more negative attitudes toward others and self, more conflictive interpersonal relationships, and more maladaptive regulation strategies in affective instability with separate pathways. Impulsivity seems more a trait in BPD rather than a state as in BD. Otherwise, BD and BPD overlap in depressive and anxious symptoms, dysphoria, various abnormal temperamental traits, suicidal ideation, and childhood trauma. Both disorders differ and share deficits in neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings. Conclusion: Clinical data provide evidence of overlapping features in both disorders, with most of those shared symptoms being more persistent and intense in BPD. Thus, categorical classifications should be compared to dimensional approaches in transdiagnostic studies investigating BPD features in BD regarding their respective explanatory power for individual trajectories. Systematic Review Registration: The search strategy was pre-registered in PROSPERO: CRD42018100268.

AB  - The scoping review examines and summarises the available knowledge base on intervention techniques focused on positive memories. An iterative series of PsycInfo and Medline searches was conducted up to April 2021 following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Thirty-nine studies, spanning 12 intervention techniques, were selected and described including: (1) theoretical basis; (2) type of study, sample, and measures; (3) intervention protocol; and (4) results of empirical studies if applicable. Results indicated that most techniques have only been tested in one-two studies with modest sample sizes and, when follow-ups are conducted, they are typically short. Results indicate that working with positive memories has the greatest impact on improving positive affect and reducing depressive symptoms, and that these effects are often temporary. This review serves as a quick reference guide to help professionals' access to descriptions and information on empirical evidence of positive memory techniques, improving their therapeutic arsenal to enhance well-being and therapeutic outcomes in their patients.

AB  - The uses of mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) are expanding and allow for more direct study of the neurophysiological signals associated with behavior in psychotherapeutic encounters. Neuroaesthetics is concerned with the cognitive and neural basis of art appreciation, and scientific correlations are being made in the field that might help to clarify theories claimed in the creative arts therapies. Yet, most neuroaesthetics studies are confined to the laboratory and do not propose a translation for research methods and clinical applications. The creative arts therapies have a long history of clinical success with various patient populations and will benefit from increased scientific explanation to support intervention strategies. Examining the brain dynamics and motor behaviors that are associated with the higher complex processes involved in artistic expression offers MoBI as a promising instrumentation to move forward in linking ideas from neuroaesthetics to the creative arts therapies. Tracking brain dynamics in association with behavioral change allows for more objective and quantitative physiological monitors to evaluate, and together with subjective patient reports provides insight into the psychological mechanisms of change in treatment. We outline a framework that shows how MoBI can be used to study the effectiveness of creative arts therapy interventions motivated by the 4E approach to cognition with a focus on visual art therapy. The article illuminates how a new partnership among the fields of art therapy, neuroscience, and neuroaesthetics might work together within the 4E/MoBI framework in efforts to advance transdisciplinary research for clinical health populations.

AB  - Urbanization is an ongoing global process that is influencing and shaping individual mental health and wellbeing. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current literature containing state-of-the-art neuroscientific and mobile technologies that have been used to investigate the mental health implications of urban environments. Searches for peer-reviewed primary research articles were conducted in PubMed and SCOPUS, returning 33,443 papers; 90 empirical articles published from 1981 to 2021 were included in the final synthesis. Central findings suggest virtual reality and mobile electroencephalography to be the most commonly used methods, and demanding mood, affect, and health phenomena or states to be the most common concepts of study in both physical built settings and natural urban spaces. Recommendations for both future practice and study noting particular opportunities for future methodological contributions are discussed.

AB  - Background Mental health issues and disorders are major public health challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in Southeast Asia, where chronic shortages in mental health services and human resources exist. The development of effective and accessible mental health systems in Southeast Asia will require evidence based psychological and social interventions. This systematic review provides a narrative synthesis of the evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions for mental health issues and disorders in Southeast Asia. Methods A comprehensive literature search of 7 electronic databases (PsycINFO, Medline (Ovid), Cochrane library, EMBASE, SCOPUS, APA PsycArticles, and Social Care Online) was undertaken. Results Thirty two studies employing RCT designs to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of psychological and social mental health interventions on a number of different mental health outcomes were included in this review. The disparate intervention programmes reviewed were categorised as: lay delivered, yoga, aerobic and/or meditation based, cognitive behavioural therapy oriented, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing based (EMDR), health worker delivered, and hybrid programmes. The majority of the studies included in this review were of low to moderate quality due to the variability in the quality of the study design. The highest quality, and most promising evidence came from the evaluations of lay delivered interventions. This evidence demonstrates the feasibility and potential sustainability of implementing such interventions in resource constrained contexts. Conclusions The review findings indicate that a disparate array of mental health interventions can be implemented effectively in a range of Southeast Asian mental health and health settings. There is a clear need for significantly more research however, through higher quality and larger scale RCTs before it will be known more definitively, if these interventions are effective, and for whom they are most effective in different Southeast Asian contexts.

AB  - Numerous studies addressed the topic of behavioral and symptomatic changes in eating disorders. Rates of transition vary widely across studies, ranging from 0 to 70.8%, depending on the diagnoses taken into account and the study design. Evidence shows that the specific transition from restrictive-type anorexia nervosa (AN-R) to disorders involving binging and purging behaviors (BPB) is related to a worsening of the clinical picture and worse long-term outcomes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to focus on this specific transition, review existing literature, and summarize related risk factors. Medline and PsycINFO databases were searched, including prospective and retrospective studies on individuals with AN-R. The primary outcome considered was the rate of onset of BPB. Twelve studies (N = 725 patients) were included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. A total of 41.84% (95% CI 33.58-50.11) of patients with AN-R manifested BPB at some point during follow-up. Risk factors for the onset of BPB included potentially treatable and untreatable factors such as the family environment, unipolar depression and higher premorbid BMI. These findings highlight that patients with AN-R frequently transition to BPB over time, with a worsening of the clinical picture. Existing studies in this field are still insufficient and heterogeneous, and further research is needed. Mental health professionals should be aware of the frequent onset of BPB in AN-R and its risk factors and take this information into account in the treatment of AN-R.

AB  - Research examining trauma, memory, and mental health among refugee and asylum-seeking people has increased in recent years. We systematically reviewed empirical work focusing on the link between autobiographical memory and mental health among these populations. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018095888). Six major databases were searched in August-2020 with no time limit for publication. Following PRISMA Statement guidelines, 22 articles reporting ten quantitative, nine qualitative, and three mixed-method studies were selected from 254 articles identified in the initial search. A basic convergent and qualitative meta-integration technique was employed for data extraction. Four recurrent themes were extracted: (1) memory activation method, (2) memory features, (3) memory content, and (4) refugee mental health. Theme 1 illustrates that narrative interviews, important event recall, and cue word methods were used in most studies. Theme 2 highlights that memories of refugee people were often less specific, inconsistent, and negative-focused. Retrieval failure was also common among these people. Theme 3 reveals that refugee and asylum-seeking people frequently discussed their abandoned identities, lost resources, injustices, ongoing sufferings, and pointless futures. Finally, theme 4 identifies the prevalence of various mental health conditions like Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, depression, helplessness, and anger among these people. The results are discussed in the context of the current autobiographical memory and mental health theories, considering refugee-specific experiences in the asylum process and refugee status.

AB  - Purpose: This article aims to identify how the term "resilience" is addressed in adult health science due to ongoing criticism about the lack of consistency in its conceptualization.
   Method: Two databases (PubMed and PsycArticles) were searched to retrieve reviews published from 2015 up until 2020 on the general conceptualization of resilience. All reviews had to meet specific inclusion criteria, which resulted in the inclusion of 18 articles. After discussing different conceptualizations regarding the process-oriented approach of resilience in adult health research, we will highlight some mechanisms that are supposed to be involved in the resilience process.
   Results: Research on resilience in health sciences confronts three core difficulties: defining positive outcome for a processual construct, describing different trajectories within the process, and identifying mechanisms that mediate resilience.
   Conclusion: The definition of resilience in mental health research as a multidimensional adaptation process is widely accepted, and multiple research paradigms have contributed to a better understanding of the concept. However, the definition of a processual construct in a way that allows for high expert consensus and a valid operationalization for empirical studies remains a challenge. Future research should focus on the assessment of multiple cross-domain outcomes and international and interdisciplinary prospective mixed-method longitudinal designs to fill in the missing links.

AB  - Background
   Children and young people with intellectual disability and/or Autism Spectrum Disorder (autism) experience higher rates of mental health problems, including depression, than their typically developing peers. Although international guidelines suggest psychological therapies as first-line intervention for children and young people, there is limited evidence for psychological therapy for depression in children and young people with intellectual disability and/or autism.
   Aims
   To evaluate the current evidence base for psychological interventions for depression in children and young people with intellectual disability and/or autism, and examine the experiences of children and young people with intellectual disability and/or autism, their families and therapists, in receiving and delivering psychological treatment for depression.
   Method
   Databases were searched up to 30 April 2020 using pre-defined search terms and criteria. Articles were independently screened and assessed for risk of bias. Data were synthesised and reported in a narrative review format.
   Results
   A total of 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Four identified studies were clinical case reports and six were quasi-experimental or experimental studies. All studies were assessed as being of moderate or high risk of bias. Participants with intellectual disability were included in four studies. There was limited data on the experiences of young people, their families or therapists in receiving or delivering psychological treatment for depression.
   Conclusions
   Well-designed, randomised controlled trials are critical to develop an evidence base for psychological treatment for young people with intellectual disability and/or autism with depression. Future research should evaluate the treatment experiences of young people, their families and therapists.

AB  - Stress resilience studies focus on resilience operationalised within the context of stressors. Currently, there is no clear operationalisation of stress resilience in humans. To identify and critically examine measures used to assess stress resilience. A systematic review of English and non-English articles using PubMed (including MEDLINE), Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and CINAHL was conducted. No date limits were set. Search terms included stress resilience, resilience to stress, stress resilient, and humans. Studies were selected based on pre-determined eligibility criteria. Empirical, quantitative research studies that measured individual stress resilience in humans were eligible for inclusion in this review. Two researchers conducted independent extraction of articles based on predefined fields, focusing on types of measures used. A narrative synthesis was used to present the findings, structured around the types of instruments used and conceptual focuses of these measures. We identified a number of measures, both self-report and performance based. We highlight the heterogeneity in operationalisation of stress resilience and suggest that, in future, researchers' state operationalised definitions of stress resilience overtly to decrease confusion.

AB  - Stigmatization from work-related COVID-19 exposure has not been investigated in detail yet. Therefore, we systematically searched three databases: Medline, Embase, and PsychInfo (until October 2020), and performed a grey literature search (until February 2021). We identified 46 suitable articles from 24 quantitative and 11 qualitative studies, 6 systematic reviews, 3 study protocols and 1 intervention. The assessment of stigmatization varied widely, ranging from a single-item question to a 22-item questionnaire. Studies mostly considered perceived self-stigma (27 of 35 original studies) in healthcare workers (HCWs) or hospital-related jobs (29 of 35). All articles reported on stigmatization as a result of work-related COVID-19 exposure. However, most quantitative studies were characterized by convenience sampling (17 of 24), and all studies-also those with an adequate sampling design-were considered of low methodological quality. Therefore, it is not possible to determine prevalence of stigmatization in defined occupational groups. Nevertheless, the work-related stigmatization of occupational groups with or without suspected contact to COVID-19 is a relevant problem and increases the risk for depression (odds ratio (OR) = 1.74; 95% confidence interval CI 1.29-2.36) and anxiety (OR = 1.75; 95% CI 1.29-2.37). For promoting workers' health, anti-stigma strategies and support should be implemented in the workplace.

AB  - Depression and anxiety are common problems in patients with cancer which may interfere with the daily activities of these patients. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a type of third-wave behavioral that increases psychological flexibility in relation to personal events. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ACT on the psychological distress of patients with cancer. In this study, a systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, Science Direct, Cochrane, CINHAL, Google Scholar, Scopus, SID, Mag Iran databases with no lower time limit and until May 2020. A total of 15 studies entered the final review with the total sample size of 965 of which 470, and 495 were in the ACT, and the comparison groups respectively. The results of the study showed that ACT in all studies reduced the mean score of anxiety and depression after treatment, as well as during follow-up. This reduction was significant in most studies. The present systematic review study showed that ACT can be used as an appropriate intervention in improving the psychological state of patients with cancer. In most studies that measured the effect size, the effect of the intervention on anxiety and depression was observed.

AB  - Background: Parent-child interaction is essential to promote adaptive emotional, cognitive, and social development. The majority of previous research on parent-child interaction is largely dependent on face-to-face exchanges that require the interactive partners to visually recognize reciprocal communicative bids. Therefore, previous findings in the field can only partially apply to the early interactive patterns occurring between visually impaired infants and their parents. The present study was aimed to systematically review the available evidence on parent-child interaction in the context of developmental visual impairment.
   Methods: Fourteen papers were finally selected after literature search on PubMed and Scopus. Data synthesis was focused on three core topics: visually impaired children's contribution to the interaction, parental caregiving behaviors with visually impaired children, and the association between parents' behaviors and the developmental outcomes of children with visual impairment.
   Results: Visually impaired children may exhibit reduced reactivity to maternal stimuli and less-than-optimal levels of interactive initiations in social exchanges. Parents of children with visual impairment may use more descriptive communicative acts and greater directiveness compared to mothers of sighted counterparts. Specific caregiving behaviors (e.g., responsiveness and goal setting) of parents of children with visual impairment may significantly support language and socio-emotional development as well as sensorimotor integration.
   Discussion: Children with visual impairment may be less responsive and they may produce less clear communicative bids while interacting with their parents. Their parents may face specific challenges while engaging with them and they may become increasingly directive and intrusive. Nonetheless, even in the presence of visual impairment, the quality of parental caregiving behaviors appears to play a potential preventive role in the face of children's socio-emotional and cognitive outcomes. These results suggest that early interventions focused on parent-child interactions are especially needed in this population.

AB  - Objective: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the best-evaluated psychological approach to treat patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). We still need a better understanding of what characterizes patients with MUS who benefit more or less from CBT. This systematic review aimed to identify patients' cognitive-emotional characteristics predicting the outcome of CBT for MUS.
   Methods: A systematic literature search (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science) revealed 37 eligible studies, 23 of these provided data for meta-analyses. Mean correlation coefficients between predictor variables and the outcomes (symptom intensity, physical or social-emotional functioning) were calculated using a random-effects model. Differences between syndromes of MUS were investigated with moderator analyses.
   Results: Meta-analyses showed that patients with a comorbid mood disorder (r = 0.32, p < .01) or anxiety disorder (r = 0.18, p < .01), symptom catastrophizing and worries (r = 0.34, p < .01), tendencies of somatosensory amplification (r = 0.46, p = .04), and low symptom acceptance or self-efficacy (r = 0.25, p < .01) have a less favorable CBT outcome. Moderator analyses revealed that these associations between predictors and treatment outcome are pronounced in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome.
   Conclusions: Our results show that pre-treatment differences in patients' cognitive-emotional characteristics predict patients' outcome in CBT. Patient-tailored CBT could be a promising approach to address MUS patients' widely varying needs more effectively.

AB  - Background: In the clinical field, anger has generally been studied in terms of aggressive behavior. However, in Asians, anger suppression is more common than anger expression. Hwabyung is a culture-related anger syndrome in Korea and is known to occur due to the continued repression of anger. Investigating Hwabyung should lead to a better understanding of the multiple dimensions of anger. To explore Hwabyung patients' experiences and perspectives, a meta-aggregation approach was used to conduct a systematic review and a qualitative synthesis.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycARTICLES, and four Korean databases [Korean Medical Database (KMbase), Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS), National Digital Science Library (NDSL), and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS)] in September 2020. Studies were included if they collected and analyzed qualitative data from Hwabyung patients. Qualitative research findings on the experiences and perspectives of Hwabyung patients in Korea were critically appraised and synthesized using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology.
   Results: Seven eligible studies were included. The findings from those studies (i.e., theme or subtheme of qualitative research) were aggregated into categories (a group of similar findings) and synthesized findings (a group of categorized findings). Ultimately, 116 findings were aggregated into 15 categories. Finally, four synthesized findings were derived from the 15 categories: (i) anger arousal, (ii) blame, (iii) uncontrollable physical and emotional symptoms, and (iv) compromise and temporary coping.
   Conclusions: Patients with Hwabyung experience chronic anger through the complex cognitive processes involved in blame. Hwabyung negatively affects patients' physical, psychological, and social functions. Because Hwabyung patients feel as if they are losing control, due to emotional dysregulation and physical symptoms, professional support should be provided to facilitate their coping strategies. Further studies on Hwabyung can serve as a new model of pathological anger.

AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) continues to be a serious problem worldwide. South Africa has a high prevalence of women experiencing IPV. Although much research reports on the prevalence rates, risk factors, and consequences of IPV, fewer studies report on how women deal with the experiences of IPV.
   Objective: This systematic review of the empirical literature aimed to identify and synthesize the best available evidence on women's experiences of coping with IPV in South Africa.
   Methods: A four-level search and retrieval strategy using PRISMA and JBI guidelines was conducted, which included critical appraisal, study selection, data extraction, and data synthesis. Ten studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. They were assessed to meet a set threshold (7/10) based on the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. All studies were conducted between 2010 and 2020, conducted in South Africa, and used qualitative methodologies to accomplish the overall aim of investigating IPV experiences of women and their responses to it.
   Results: The total number of women included in the studies was 159. The data extraction yielded 49 findings of which 47 were aggregated into 14 categories and three themes: (1) help- and support-seeking coping, (2) emotional regulation coping, and (3) problem avoidance and distraction coping. Help- and support-seeking coping refers to women's responses when they seek instrumental aid, advice, comfort, and/or understanding from others. Emotional regulation includes responses of women in which their emotions were expressed or regulated. Problem avoidance and distraction coping represent responses of women in which they take efforts to avoid thinking about the problem situation and rather reshift their focus.
   Conclusion: Overall, this review found that a variety of coping responses are used by South African women experiencing IPV. The findings point to the need for understanding IPV and responses to it within a broader social context rather than just at the personal level. Approaching IPV at many levels may lead to a change in societal norms, better access to and delivery of services to IPV survivors, more functional family affairs, and personal well-being and improved quality of life.

AB  - Psychedelics are a hallucinogenic class of psychoactive drugs with the primary effect of activating non-ordinary states of consciousness. Due to the positive preliminary findings of these drugs in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, the number of registered clinical studies has risen significantly. In this paper, clinical studies registered on clinicaltrials.gov that evaluate the treatment of any psychiatric disorder with psychedelics (excluding ketamine) are summarized and analyzed. 70 registered studies were identified from a clinicaltrials.gov search on December 3, 2020. The majority of studies aim to investigate methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (45.7%) and psilocybin (41.4%). Studies evaluating ayahuasca, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ibogaine hydrochloride, salvia divinorum, 5-MeO-DMT and DMT fumarate were less common at 1.4%, 4.2%, 2.8%, 1.4%, 1.4% and 1.4% of total registered studies, respectively. Most of the studies on MDMA, psilocybin, ayahuasca and salvia divinorum investigated their therapeutic effect on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). LSD was investigated for MDD, anxiety, and severe somatic disorders and ibogaine hydrochloride was investigated for substance and alcohol use disorders. 5-MeO-DMT and DMT fumarate were both investigated for MDD. Only 21/70 registered studies had published results with the majority not yet completed. In view of the large number of ongoing studies investigating psychedelics, it is imperative that these studies are considered by researchers and stakeholders in deciding the most relevant research priorities for future proposed studies.

AB  - The published evidence on whether workplace health and well-being interventions are as effective in male-dominated industries compared with mixed-gender environments has not been synthesised. We performed a systematic review of workplace interventions aimed at improving employee health and well-being in male-dominated industries. We searched Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Database and Web of Science for articles describing workplace interventions in male-dominated industries that address employee health and well-being. The primary outcome was to determine the effectiveness of the intervention and the process evaluation (intervention delivery and adherence). To assess the quality of evidence, Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool was used. Due to the heterogeneity of reported outcomes, meta-analysis was performed for only some outcomes and a narrative synthesis with albatross plots was presented. After full-text screening, 35 studies met the eligibility criteria. Thirty-two studies delivered the intervention face-to-face, while two were delivered via internet and one using postal mail. Intervention adherence ranged from 50% to 97%, dependent on mode of delivery and industry. 17 studies were considered low risk of bias. Albatross plots indicated some evidence of positive associations, particularly for interventions focusing on musculoskeletal disorders. There was little evidence of intervention effect on body mass index and systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Limited to moderate evidence of beneficial effects was found for workplace health and well-being interventions conducted within male-dominated industries. Such interventions in the workplace can be effective, despite a different culture in male-dominated compared with mixed industries, but are dependent on delivery, industry and outcome.

AB  - Background: Evidence from previous virus epidemics has shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Hence, to collect high-quality data on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be the immediate priority. Methods: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was conducted from January 1, 2020 to December 26, 2020 for eligible studies reporting on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) included patients with COVD-19; (2) recorded the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or insomnia symptom; (3) sample size >= 30; (4) with validated screening tools; and (5) passed through the international peer-review process. Data extraction and quality assessment was independently performed by two reviewers. The quality effects meta-analysis was conducted further to calculate the pooled prevalence. Results: Twenty-two studies were included for analysis with a total of 4318 patients. The pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was 38% (95% CI = 25-51), 38% (95% CI = 24-52), and 48% (95% CI = 11-85), respectively. Neither subgroup analysis nor sensitivity analysis can explain the source of high heterogeneity. In addition, the prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms varied based on different screening tools. Conclusions: The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms are prevalent in a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19. Thus, early detection and properly intervention for mental illness in this population are of great significance. Additionally, the quality of included studies to date has been variable, and ongoing surveillance is essential.

AB  - Background
   We review original papers on ovarian-hormone status in two areas of emotional processing: facial emotion recognition and emotional memory. Ovarian-hormone status is operationalized by the levels of the steroid sex hormones 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), fluctuating over the natural menstrual cycle and suppressed under oral contraceptive (OCs) use. We extend previous reviews addressing single areas of emotional processing. Moreover, we systematically examine the role of stimulus features such as emotion type or stimulus valence and aim at elucidating factors that reconcile the inconsistent results. Methods
   We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included papers published until September 2020 indexed in PubMed and Web of Science databases. Search terms were MeSH terms (emotional OR emotion) AND (X) AND (estrogen OR progesterone OR menstrual cycle OR oral contraceptives) with (X) representing our separately searched areas, resulting in (processing OR recognition OR empathy), and (memory OR recall). To be included, articles had to (1) be written and published in English, (2) examine healthy, non-pregnant adult women in their reproductive age, and (3) measure or at least estimate levels of E2 and P4. In PubMed, the search was (4) limited to humans and (5) to the search term present in the title or abstract. Results
   Features of the provided stimulus material (emotion type and/or valence) constitute a relevant influence that interacts with E2- and P4-related ovarian-hormone status. For instance, recognition of basic emotions appears to be more related to P4- than E2-levels. Quite consistent, OC intake (vs. natural menstrual cycling) was accompanied by impaired recognition accuracy of basic and also complex emotions, although not in a recent large-sample study assessing complex emotions. Memory recall of negative content was mainly enhanced by P4, especially after having been stressed. Discussion and Conclusion
   We document the methodological diversity in the field, presumably contributing to the heterogeneity of results. More studies explicitly contrasting the early follicular phase, mid-cycle phase, mid-luteal, and OC intake while standardizing tasks are needed. Research would take advantage of using within-subject designs and accounting for the recognition of complex emotions.

AB  - Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a higher probability of developing co-occurring mental or physical health conditions. However, little is known about how these health conditions develop and impact the lives of the adult ASD population. This paper reviewed existing studies concerning factors affecting the health status of adults with ASD and described their outcomes and prevalence. A systematic search of electronic databases yielded 21 studies eligible to be included. The most common physical problems affecting health were epilepsy and immune, gastrointestinal, and sleep disorders. Mental health disorders, most prominently mood and anxiety disorders and OCD, were also strong factors for determining health in adults. Future research should focus on measuring the overall health status of the adult ASD population.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine had a significant impact on mental health which resulted in an increase of anxiety and depression in adult, child and adolescent clinical populations. Less is known about the potential effect of pandemic on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) so there is a lack of review work to illustrate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD.
   Purpose: The main objective is to review all the empirical contributions published after March 2020 that dealt with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD in adults, children and adolescents, investigating the state-of-the-art literature concerning the impact on OCD and detailing limitations.
   Methods: The literature search was conducted using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. This review analyzed all studies from January 2020 to 8 January 2021, focusing on clinical populations of children, adolescents, and adults with OCD.
   Results: A total of 102 articles were screened, resulting in the identification of 64 full-text articles to be further scrutinized. Upon closer examination, there was consensus that 39 articles met the study inclusion criteria and 14 of these were selected for study. Analysis of the results revealed that COVID-19 had an impact on OCD in both adults and young people and seems to have caused exacerbation of symptoms, especially of the contamination/washing subtypes. Eight studies in adult samples showed an increase in the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms; two studies underlined a minimal impact of COVID-19 on OCD patients and one study showed a slight improvement in symptoms. Two out of three studies on children and adolescents showed an exacerbation of OCD and a worsening even in the presence of an ongoing treatment.
   Conclusions: The studies reviewed are few. There are more studies on adult OCD than on children and adolescents. The results are controversial: few studies examined OCD subtypes; in most studies the typology of treatment was not clear and the samples covered a wide age range; a large number of studies did not use the same monitoring period or quantitative measures, both of which make it difficult to compare or rely on the results.

AB  - Objective: A recent meta-analysis of 17 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showed that Short-term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) for functional somatic disorders (FSD) reduced somatic symptoms compared to wait list, minimal treatment, and treatment-as-usual controls. A clinically important yet unanswered question is how much improvement patients experience within STPP treatment.
   Methods: Following a systematic search, we identified STPP trials presenting data at baseline and post-treatment/follow-up. Meta-analyses determined the magnitude of changes in somatic symptoms and other outcomes from before to after STPP, and analyses examined effect sizes as a function of study, therapy, and patient variables.
   Results: We identified 37 trials (22 pre-post studies and 15 RCTs) totaling 2094 patients treated an average of 13.34 sessions for a range of FSD. Across all studies, somatic symptoms improved significantly from pre-treatment to short-term follow-up with a large effect size (SMD = 1.07), which was maintained at long-term follow-up (SMD = 0.90). After excluding two outlier studies, effects at short- and medium-term follow-up remained significant but were somewhat reduced in magnitude (e.g., short-term SMD = 0.73). Secondary outcomes including anxiety, depression, disability, and interpersonal problems had medium to large effects. Effects were larger for studies of STPP that were longer than 12 sessions or used an emotion-focused type of STPP, and for chronic pain or gastrointestinal conditions than for functional neurological disorders.
   Conclusions: STPP results in moderate to large improvements in multiple outcome domains that are sustained in long-term follow-up. STPP is an effective treatment option for FSD and should be included in treatment guidelines.

AB  - Background Worldwide, hepatobiliary cancers are frequent diseases and often accompanied by a poor prognosis. These cancers, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) being the most frequent, are often associated with a considerable amount of psychological burden such as anxiety, depressiveness, and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) which may lead to psychiatric comorbidities. This systematic review gives an overview on psychological burden and on the effectiveness of psycho-oncological interventions for patients with HCC and CHC. Methods The databases PubMed, PubPsych, and PsycINFO were used and searched using the following combination of terms: (Neoplasm OR Cancer OR Tumor OR Carcinoma) AND (Psycho-Oncology OR Psychotherapy OR Psychiatr*) AND (Liver OR Hepatic OR Hepatocellular OR Gallbladder OR Bile*). Studies were eligible for inclusion if investigating patients affected with tumors of the liver (HCC/CHC) and using diagnostic instruments to assess mental health symptoms and research concerning specific psycho-oncological interventions. In total, 1027 studies were screened by one author with regard to title and abstracts. Afterward, the two authors of the paper discussed inclusion of possible articles. Results Twelve studies focusing on distress, anxiety, and depression symptoms as well as quality of life among patients with HCC/CHC and three studies on psycho-oncological interventions were included. Patients suffering from hepatobiliary cancers often experience considerable psychological burden. A quarter of patients suffer from depressive symptoms; anxiety is even more common among these patients with almost 40%. The HRQOL of those affected is reduced in almost all areas, suicide rates increased and the level of distress is considerably increased in one third of patients even in comparison to those with other kinds of cancer. By psycho-oncological intervention the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety can be reduced, while the quality of life and also the survival rate of patients with hepatobiliary cancer can be increased. Discussion and Conclusion Psychological burden is high in patients with hepatobiliary cancers as reflected in high levels of depressiveness and anxiety as well as reduced quality of life. The use of psycho-oncological interventions can reduce psychological burden and increase quality of life compared to patients receiving standard support only.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to offer an overview of literature relating to the topic of arts as activity within the context of military and veteran health and to consider the implications of current knowledge on future research with visually impaired veterans.
   Study design: A search for literature addressing the topic of visual art activities with visually impaired veterans was undertaken. No research addressing this topic was identified. A review of literature on the related topics of mental health and well-being in military veterans, visual impairment and mental health and well-being, and art therapy for veteran populations was carried out to offer an overview of current knowledge.
   Results: While there is growing evidence of the benefits of arts engagement among both general and military populations, the role of the visual arts in the everyday lives of broader veteran samples, and the impact of these activities on holistic well-being, remains underexplored. The current article highlights the need for art as activity to be differentiated from art as therapy and argues that the former might offer a tool to positively impact the holistic well-being of visually impaired veterans.
   Conclusions: Future research relating to the use of visual art activities in the context of veteran health and well-being should endeavour to explore the potential impacts of engagement on holistic well-being. Research is needed to build on anecdotal evidence of the positive impact of arts engagement on visually impaired veterans by systematically exploring if, and how, holistic well-being in this population may be impacted by engagement with visual art activities.

AB  - Background
   Psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are commonly associated with epilepsy in the general population, but the relationship between psychiatric disorders and epilepsy among adults with intellectual disabilities is unclear.
   Aims
   To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether epilepsy is associated with an increased rate of psychiatric disorders in adults with intellectual disabilities.
   Method
   We included literature published between 1985 and 2020 from four databases, and hand-searched six relevant journals. We assessed risk of bias by using SIGN 50 and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Several meta-analyses were carried out.
   Results
   We included 29 papers involving data on 9594 adults with intellectual disabilities, 3180 of whom had epilepsy and 6414 did not. Of the 11 controlled studies that compared the overall rate of psychiatric disorders between the epilepsy and non-epilepsy groups, seven did not show any significant inter-group difference. Meta-analysis was possible on pooled data from seven controlled studies, which did not show any significant inter-group difference in the overall rate of psychiatric disorders. The rates of psychotic disorders, depressive disorders and anxiety disorders were significantly higher in the non-epilepsy control groups compared with the epilepsy group, with effect sizes of 0.29, 0.47 and 0.58, respectively. Epilepsy-related factors did not show any definite association with psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusions
   It is difficult to pool data from such heterogeneous studies and draw any definitive conclusion because most studies lacked an appropriately matched control group, which will be required for future studies.

AB  - Background This study aimed to compile and synthesize studies investigating explicit emotion regulation in patients with bipolar disorder and individuals at risk of developing bipolar disorder. The importance of explicit emotion regulation arises from its potential role as a marker for bipolar disorders in individuals at risk and its potent role in therapy for bipolar disorder patients. Methods To obtain an exhaustive compilation of studies dealing specifically with explicit emotion regulation in bipolar disorder, we conducted a systematic literature search in four databases. In the 15 studies we included in our review, the emotion-regulation strategies maintenance, distraction, and reappraisal (self-focused and situation-focused) were investigated partly on a purely behavioral level and partly in conjunction with neural measures. The samples used in the identified studies included individuals at increased risk of bipolar disorder, patients with current affective episodes, and patients with euthymic mood state. Results In summary, the reviewed studies' results indicate impairments in explicit emotion regulation in individuals at risk for bipolar disorder, patients with manic and depressive episodes, and euthymic patients. These deficits manifest in subjective behavioral measures as well as in neural aberrations. Further, our review reveals a discrepancy between behavioral and neural findings regarding explicit emotion regulation in individuals at risk for bipolar disorders and euthymic patients. While these groups often do not differ significantly in behavioral measures from healthy and low-risk individuals, neural differences are mainly found in frontostriatal networks. Conclusion We conclude that these neural aberrations are a potentially sensitive measure of the probability of occurrence and recurrence of symptoms of bipolar disorders and that strengthening this frontostriatal route is a potentially protective measure for individuals at risk and patients who have bipolar disorders.

AB  - Background. Abuse in early life stages has been proposed as an etiological risk factor for developing menstrually-related mood disorders (MRMDs). Objetive. To evaluate whether there is a relation between the occurrence of physical and/or sexual violence in childhood and/or adolescence and the development of MRMDs in adulthood. Method. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, with the route ("Premenstrual Syndrome"[Mesh]) OR ("Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder"[MeSH]) AND ("Violence"[Mesh]) / ("menstrually-related mood disorders" AND "abuse"). Fifty-four articles were initially reviewed and 32 were excluded based on the criteria. Twenty-two articles were thoroughly reviewed. Finally, five articles (publication years 2014, 2013, 2012, 2007, and 2003) were included in the systematic review and submitted to a meta-analysis. Results. Results indicate that having been exposed to physical and/or sexual violence in childhood and/or adolescence increases 1.99 times the risk of experiencing MRMDs in adulthood in comparison with women who did not experience that type of violence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.99; 95% confidence interval [1.58, 2.51]). Discussion and conclusion. The present work provides evidence that a woman who experienced violence through physical and/or sexual abuse during childhood and/or adolescence has a greater risk of developing MRMDs in adulthood.

AB  - Background
   Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disabling, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is often associated with psychiatric comorbidities. Some studies suggest increased prevalence of bipolar disorder (BD) in MS.
   Objective
   To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the prevalence of BD in adults with MS.
   Methods
   We registered this review with PROSPERO and searched electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Central, Embase, PsycINFO and Scopus) for eligible studies from earliest inception to October 2020. Prevalence data of BD in adult patients with MS were extracted. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model.
   Findings
   Of the 802 articles that were screened, 23 studies enrolling a total of 68 796 patients were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence rate of BD in patients with MS was 2.95% (95% CI 2.12% to 4.09%) with higher prevalence in the Americas versus Europe. The lifetime prevalence of BD was 8.4% in patients with MS. Subgroup analysis showed a higher prevalence of BD in MS in females (7.03%) than in males (5.64%), which did not reach statistical significance (p=0.53).
   Conclusions
   This meta-analysis suggests a high lifetime prevalence of BD in patients with MS. Patients with MS should be routinely screened for BD. Further assessment of bipolar comorbidity in MS through prospective studies may help in developing effective management strategies and may improve treatment outcomes in patients with MS.

AB  - A maternal experience of perinatal mental health conditions can have serious short- and long-term consequences for child development and family relationships. Women with perinatal depression and/or anxiety are primarily supported by their partner/spouse and family. The aim of this review was to synthesise data from studies that have examined the inclusion of partners or family members in psychosocial interventions for women at risk of or experiencing perinatal depression and/or anxiety. A systematic search of five databases was conducted to identify literature published between 2010 and 2020. Nine empirical studies met the eligibility criteria and were independently assessed by two authors using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tools and data were extracted and narratively synthesised guided by TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) checklist. Eligible studies detailed diverse interventions facilitated by a variety of programme facilitators, with no central model of intervention or study outcome measures evident across the studies. All studies except one reported a significant change in maternal depression and anxiety scores. The interventions had limited evaluation of the woman's, partner's or family member's experiences of involvement in the intervention. Further research is required to firmly establish the effectiveness of co-designed interventions to support the sustainable integration of such interventions into routine perinatal mental health services.

AB  - Perinatal psychological distress (PPD) may cause delays in help-seeking in the perinatal period, which is crucial for families with small children. Help-seeking theories focus on rational processes of behavior wherein 'help-seeking' is viewed as a decision-making process, in which action is preceded by recognizing a problem. We identified the phase prior to actual help-seeking actions as a life situation and a phenomenon through which to gain a deeper understanding from women's own perspectives. The aim of this study was to integrate and synthesize knowledge of women's experiences of contemplating seeking help for PPD. We chose interpretative meta-ethnography by Noblit and Hare (1988) and implemented eMERGe guidelines in reporting. The search was performed systematically, and the 14 included studies were evaluated with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist (CASP). We identified seven themes and a metaphor in a lines-of-argument synthesis, showing that contemplating help-seeking is a multidimensional phenomenon. We did not observe a straightforward and linear process (as previous research suggests) but instead a complex process of contemplating help-seeking. A clinical implication is that service providers should work with outreach and develop their tools to connect with mothers with PPD. Another suggestion is to improve training in mental health literacy prior to or during pregnancy.

AB  - In this review, we aim to summarize research findings and marketplace apps for women with perinatal mood disorders with the goal of informing clinicians and patients about current risks and benefits, as well as proposing clinical implementation advice and a harmonized agenda for both academic and industry advancement in this space. Multiple searches were run of academic databases in 2018-2020, examining literature on mobile apps for peripartum mental health. Multiple searches were also run of the iOS and Android app stores in 2019 and 2020, looking at apps for peripartum mental health. Results were compared within the academic dataset as well within the commercial app dataset; the two datasets were also examined for overlap. The academic search results were notable for small sample sizes and heterogeneous endpoints. The app store search results were notable for apps of generally poor quality (as assessed by a modified Silberg scale). Very few of the mHealth interventions studied in the academic literature were available in the app store; very few of the apps from the commercial stores were supported by academic literature. The disconnect between academically developed apps and commercially available apps highlights the need for better collaboration between academia and industry. More collaboration between the two approaches may benefit both app developers and patients in this demographic moving forwards. Additionally, we present a set of practice guidelines for mHealth in perinatal psychiatry based on the trends identified in this review.

AB  - Research traditions on cognition and depression focus on relatively unconnected aspects of cognitive functioning. On one hand, the neuropsychological perspective has concentrated on cognitive control difficulties as a prominent feature of this condition. On the other hand, the clinical psychology perspective has focused on cognitive biases and repetitive negative patterns of thinking (i.e., rumination) for emotional information. A review of the literature from both fields reveals that difficulties are more evident for mood-congruent materials, suggesting that cognitive control difficulties interact with cognitive biases to hinder cognitive switching, working memory updating, and inhibition of irrelevant information. Connecting research from these two traditions, we propose a novel integrative cognitive model of depression in which the interplay between mood-congruent cognitive control difficulties, cognitive biases, and rumination may ultimately lead to ineffective emotion-regulation strategies to downregulate negative mood and upregulate positive mood.

AB  - Background: An estimated 1 in 5 adolescents experience a mental health disorder each year; yet because of barriers to accessing and seeking care, most remain undiagnosed and untreated. Furthermore, the early emergence of psychopathology contributes to a lifelong course of challenges across a broad set of functional domains, so addressing this early in the life course is essential. With increasing digital connectivity, including in low- and middle-income countries, digital health technologies are considered promising for addressing mental health among adolescents and young people. In recent years, a growing number of digital health interventions, including more than 2 million web-based mental health apps, have been developed to address a range of mental health issues.
   Objective: This review aims to synthesize the current evidence on digital health interventions targeting adolescents and young people with mental health conditions, aged between 10-24 years, with a focus on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability to low-resource settings (eg, low- and middle-income countries).
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases between January 2010 and June 2020 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health interventions targeting adolescents and young people aged between 10-24 years. Two authors independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the reviews.
   Results: In this systematic overview, we included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We found evidence on the effectiveness of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy on anxiety and depression, whereas the effectiveness of other digital mental health interventions remains inconclusive. Interventions with an in-person element with a professional, peer, or parent were associated with greater effectiveness, adherence, and lower dropout than fully automatized or self-administered interventions. Despite the proposed utility of digital interventions for increasing accessibility of treatment across settings, no study has reported sample-specific metrics of social context (eg, socioeconomic background) or focused on low-resource settings.
   Conclusions: Although digital interventions for mental health can be effective for both supplementing and supplanting traditional mental health treatment, only a small proportion of existing digital platforms are evidence based. Furthermore, their cost-effectiveness and effectiveness, including in low- and middle-income countries, have been understudied. Widespread adoption and scale-up of digital mental health interventions, especially in settings with limited resources for health, will require more rigorous and consistent demonstrations of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness vis-a-vis the type of service provided, target population, and the current standard of care.

AB  - Purpose Honest, Open, Proud (HOP; formerly "Coming Out Proud"/COP) is a peer-led group program to support people with mental illness in their disclosure decisions and in their coping with stigma. The aims of this study were to provide (i) a conceptual review of HOP, including versions for different target groups and issues related to outcome measurement and implementation; and (ii) a meta-analysis of program efficacy. Methods Conceptual and empirical literature on disclosure and the HOP program was reviewed. Controlled trials of HOP/COP were searched in literature databases. A meta-analysis of HOP efficacy in terms of key outcomes was conducted. Results HOP program adaptations for different target groups (e.g. parents of children with mental illness; veterans or active soldiers with mental illness) exist and await evaluation. Recruitment for trials and program implementation may be challenging. A meta-analysis of five HOP RCTs for adults or adolescents with mental illness or adult survivors of suicide attempts found significant positive effects on stigma stress (smd = - 0.50) as well as smaller, statistically non-significant effects on self-stigma (smd = - 0.17) and depression (smd = - 0.11) at the end of the HOP program. At 3- to 4-week follow-up, there was a modest, not statistically significant effect on stigma stress (smd = - 0.40, 95%-CI -0.83 to 0.04), while effects for self-stigma were small and significant (smd = - 0.24). Long-term effects of the HOP program are unknown. Conclusion There is initial evidence that HOP effectively supports people with mental illness in their disclosure decisions and in their coping with stigma. Implementation issues, future developments and public health implications are discussed.

AB  - Self-compassion, sharing some commonalities with positive psychology 2.0 approaches, is associated with better mental health outcomes in diverse populations, including workers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is heightened awareness of the importance of self-care for fostering mental health at work. However, evidence regarding the applications of self-compassion interventions in work-related contexts has not been systematically reviewed to date. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize and evaluate the utility of self-compassion interventions targeting work-related well-being, as well as assess the methodological quality of relevant studies. Eligible articles were identified from research databases including ProQuest, PsycINFO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. The quality of non-randomized trials and randomized controlled trials was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Quality Assessment Table, respectively. The literature search yielded 3,387 titles from which ten studies met the inclusion criteria. All ten studies reported promising effects of self-compassion training for work-related well-being. The methodological quality of these studies was medium. All ten studies recruited workers in a caring field and were mostly conducted in Western countries. The Self-Compassion Scale or its short-form was used in almost all instances. Findings indicate that self-compassion training can improve self-compassion and other work-related well-being outcomes in working populations. However, in general, there is need for greater methodological quality in work-related self-compassion intervention studies to advance understanding regarding the applications and limitations of this technique in work contexts. Furthermore, future studies should focus on a broader range of employee groups, including non-caring professions as well as individuals working in non-Western countries.

AB  - Background: Published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2015, the mental health Gap Action Programme Humanitarian Intervention Guide (mhGAP-HIG) recommends brief versions of structured psychological interventions for people experiencing symptoms of common mental disorders (CMDs). mhGAP-HIG acknowledges a growing body of evidence suggesting these interventions can be delivered by lay workers to people affected by humanitarian crises in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there has not yet been a systematic review and synthesis of this evidence. This paper reports the results of a systematic review of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies assessing the implementation and/or effectiveness of talk therapies for CMDs when provided by lay workers in LMICs to adults who have survived or are currently living in humanitarian situations.
   Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA, Global Health, Cochrane Library, and . We also hand-searched the contents pages of three academic journals, reference lists of 30 systematic reviews, and online resource directories of two mental health networks. A preliminary list of included studies was circulated to topical experts for review, and all included studies were backward and forward searched. All titles, abstracts, and full-texts were independently double-screened. Quality appraisal and data extraction were carried out by a single reviewer and checked by a second reviewer, using standardised tools. Any disagreements were discussed and referred to a third reviewer as needed.
   Results: We identified 23 unique studies and carried out a narrative synthesis of patient and implementation outcome data. Every evaluation of the effectiveness of lay-delivered talk therapies for adults affected by humanitarian crises in LMICs showed some treatment effect for at least one CMD, and often multiple CMDs. Implementation research generally found these interventions to be acceptable, appropriate and feasible to implement, with good fidelity to manualised therapies.
   Conclusion: Although results are promising, particularly for individually-delivered talk therapies based on cognitive behavioural therapy techniques, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in this literature. We make several recommendations on how to improve the quality and generalisability of research on this topic, to facilitate further evidence synthesis.

AB  - Introduction: There is an emerging interest in modulating the gut microbiota to target the gut-brain axis and improve maternal mental health in the perinatal period. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics supplementation during pregnancy to reduce the risk of maternal mental health problems in the perinatal period.
   Methods: Electronic biomedical databases and clinical trial registries were searched from database inception through August 2020 to identify randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic supplements administered to women during pregnancy on measures of perinatal depression, anxiety, and other mental health outcomes. Study selection, risk of bias appraisal, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. Pooled mean differences (MD) and odds ratios (pOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses for the outcomes of interest in the review.
   Results: From 3,868 studies identified through the search strategy, three RCTs of low risk of bias involving 713 participants were included, all three testing probiotics. There were no differences between probiotics and control groups in the mean depression scores (MD -0.46; 95% CI -2.16, 1.25) at end of follow-up. Although statistical significance was not achieved, probiotics showed an advantage in the proportion of participants scoring below an established cut-off for depression (pOR 0.68; 95% CI 0.43, 1.07). Compared to placebo, probiotics in pregnancy reduced anxiety symptoms (MD -0.99; 95% CI -1.80, -0.18); however, this advantage was not translated in a reduction in the proportion of participants scoring above an established cut-off for anxiety (pOR 0.65; 95% CI 0.23, 1.85). There were no differences between probiotics and control groups in global mental health scores at end of follow-up (MD 1.09; 95% CI -2.04, 4.22).
   Conclusion: There is limited but promising evidence about the effectiveness of probiotics during pregnancy to reduce anxiety symptoms and reduce the proportion of women scoring ABOVE a cut-off depression score. There is a lack of RCT evidence supporting prebiotics and synbiotics supplementation for similar purposes in the perinatal period. More research is needed before prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics are recommended to support maternal mental health and well-being in the perinatal period.

AB  - Various psychiatric disorders are treated with mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), although the efficacy of MBIs in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) is unclear. In this meta-analysis, we investigated the efficacy of MBIs on SAD symptoms. Systematic searches were performed in various databases, and 11 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5 single-arm trials were identified. The between-groups analysis of the 11 RCTs showed that Hedges' g = 0.00, while the within-group analysis showed a large pre-post effect size (g = 1.20). MBIs were superior to the no-treatment comparator (g = 0.89), equivalent to specific active treatment (g = -0.19), and less effective than evidence-based treatment (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapies) (g = -0.29).MBIs significantly alleviated depressive symptoms and improved mindfulness, quality of life, and self-compassion. Meta-regression analysis showed a dose-response relationship between the alleviation of SAD symptoms and the duration of the MBIs (beta = 0.659). Follow-up analysis showed that the effects of MBIs on SAD persisted for 12 months (g = 0.231). An analysis of the 5 single-arm trials found that MBIs had a medium effect in alleviating SAD symptoms (g = 0.48). Future research is needed regarding the design of large RCTs of MBIs on SAD patients.

AB  - Purpose To assess the quality of the research about how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young workers, and to summarize the available evidence. Methods We undertook a systematic search of three databases using a tiered search strategy. Studies were included if they: (a) assessed employment conditions such as working hours, precarious employment, contract type, insecurity, and flexible work, or psychosocial workplace exposures such as violence, harassment and bullying, social support, job demand and control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational justice; (b) included a validated mental health measure; and (c) presented results specific to young people aged <= 30 years or were stratified by age group to provide an estimate for young people aged <= 30 years. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. Results Nine studies were included in the review. Four were related to employment conditions, capturing contract type and working hours. Five studies captured concepts relevant to psychosocial workplace exposures including workplace sexual harassment, psychosocial job quality, work stressors, and job control. The quality of the included studies was generally low, with six of the nine at serious risk of bias. Three studies at moderate risk of bias were included in the qualitative synthesis, and results of these showed contemporaneous exposure to sexual harassment and poor psychosocial job quality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes among young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that exposure to low job control was associated with incident depression diagnosis among young workers. Conclusions The findings of this review illustrate that even better studies are at moderate risk of bias. Addressing issues related to confounding, selection of participants, measurement of exposures and outcomes, and missing data will improve the quality of future research in this area and lead to a clearer understanding of how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young people. Generating high-quality evidence is particularly critical given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on young people's employment. In preparing for a post-pandemic world where poor-quality employment conditions and exposure to psychosocial workplace exposures may become more prevalent, rigorous research must exist to inform policy to protect the mental health of young workers.

AB  - Background: The effects of aging and its associated cognitive decline is particularly acute in Asia given the exponential growth of older adults as a proportion of the population as a whole. Many structured cognitive interventions have been proposed to prevent the cognitive decline typically seen in older age, but their utility as a viable means of achieving these goals is questionable.
   Objectives: To summarize and synthesize evidence on the utility and methodological quality of cognitive-based interventions on cognitive performance and associated secondary outcomes among healthy older adults in Asia, as well as novel, culture-specific components of cognitive interventions across the region.
   Data sources: The PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases were searched through May 2020.
   Eligibility: Studies including individuals aged 60 years and above, who had no previous history of physical and/or mental illness. Few restrictions placed on intervention design, duration and mode of delivery, provided that participants were randomized to study conditions, and intervention included components addressing at least one cognitive domain.
   Results: A total of 17 studies from six countries met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. Evidence from those studies indicated that cognitive interventions may be most effective when the design and aims were directed towards improvement in specific cognitive domains, but evidence regarding long-term effectiveness in preventing progression to clinical-level cognitive deficits is still unclear. Several studies highlighted culture-specific activities as components of their interventions, though these will need to be further outlined and standardized clearly in future research.

AB  - Background: Social cognition is impaired in patients with severe mental disorders. We aimed to investigate impairments in social cognition in youth with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) through a systematic review of the literature and the meta-analysis.
   Method: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies reporting on the theory of mind (ToM) and emotion recognition (ER) abilities of patients with PBD compared to healthy controls (HC). We conducted a random-effects model meta-analysis for the contrast between PBD and HC. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted for demographic and clinical variables as appropriate.
   Results: A total of thirteen studies involving 429 patients with PBD and 394 HC were included. Patients with PBD had significantly poorer social cognitive abilities (Hedges' g for ER, g = -0.74, CI = -0.91, -0.57; and for ToM, g = -0.98, CI = -1.41 to -0.55). Subgroup analysis also revealed significant impairment in ER for patients in a euthymic state (g = -0.75). Age, gender, sample size, the severity of mood symptoms, estimated IQ, the frequencies of bipolar-I disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, medications, study quality and euthymia did not moderate the difference in meta-regression. Heterogeneity was low in all analyses and there was no evidence for publication bias.
   Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis supported the notion that PBD is associated with a deficit in social cognitive abilities at a medium to a large level. Impairments in social cognition could be an illness-related trait of PBD. Meta-regression results did not find a moderator of the deficits in social cognition.

AB  - Background As one of the most widely researched consequence of traumatic events, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak varies greatly across studies. This review aimed at examining the pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak. Methods Systematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, PsycArticle, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure until October 14, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020180309). Results A total of 106,713 people exposed to the trauma resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak were identified in the 76 articles, of which 33,810 were reported with post-traumatic stress symptoms. The pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak was 28.34%, with a 95% confidence interval of 23.03-34.32%. Subgroup analysis indicated that older age, male and bigger sample size were associated with higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. After controlling for other factors, the results of meta-regression showed that the influence of gender and sample size on prevalence is no longer significant. Conclusions Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were very common among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak. Further research is needed to explore more possible risk factors for post-traumatic stress symptoms and identify effective strategies for preventing PTSD-related symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - No existing review has synthesized key questions about acculturation experiences among international migrant workers. This review aimed to explore (1) What are global migrant workers' experiences with acculturation and acculturative stress? (2) What are acculturative stress coping strategies used by migrant workers? And (3) how effective are these strategies for migrant workers in assisting their acculturation in the host countries? Peer-reviewed and gray literature, without time limitation, were searched in six databases and included if the study: focused on acculturative stress and coping strategies; was conducted with international migrant workers; was published in English; and was empirical. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Three-layered themes of acculturation process and acculturative stress were identified as: individual layer; work-related layer; and social layer. Three key coping strategies were identified: emotion-focused; problem-focused; and appraisal-focused. These coping strategies were used flexibly to increase coping effectiveness and evidence emerged that a particular type of acculturative stress might be solved more effectively by a specific coping strategy. Migrant workers faced numerous challenges in their acculturative process. Understanding this process and their coping strategies could be used in developing research and interventions to improve the well-being of migrant workers.

AB  - This article aims to evaluate the sleep quality in individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Searches were conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PEDro databases, on May 22, 2020. In the publications, 208 articles were found and, considering the eligibility criteria, 10 articles were included at the end, showing the effects on sleep quality during the pandemic, in populations hospitalized, quarantined, and in frontline health professionals. The PSQI measured sleep disorders and a higher score indicated poor sleep quality. Nine articles were classified with evidence level IV and one as level III-2. Eight studies present a "serious" risk of bias and two in "moderate". The studies investigated different populations and described the results as "poor" sleep quality, considering the PSQI on quarantined individuals and frontline health professionals as the most committed. A poor sleep quality was found in the populations evaluated in the selected publications, probably, due to the COVID-19 to contribute as a risk factor for mental health. Psychological interventions must be made to minimize the consequences through social support and social capital.

AB  - Background
   Public Safety Personnel (e.g., firefighters, paramedics, and police officers) are routinely exposed to human suffering and need to make quick, morally challenging decisions. Such decisions can affect their psychological wellbeing. Participating in or observing an event or situation that conflicts with personal values can potentially lead to the development of moral injury. Common stressors associated with moral injury include betrayal, inability to prevent death or harm, and ethical dilemmas. Potentially psychologically traumatic event exposures and post-traumatic stress disorder can be comorbid with moral injury; however, moral injury extends beyond fear to include spiritual, cognitive, emotional or existential struggles, which can produce feelings of severe shame, guilt, and anger.
   Objective
   This scoping review was designed to identify the extant empirical research regarding the construct of moral injury, its associated constructs, and how it relates to moral distress in firefighters, paramedics, and police officers.
   Methods
   A systematic literature search of peer-reviewed research was conducted using databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, APA PsychInfo, CINHAL PLUS, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar. Included studies were selected based on the inclusion criteria before being manually extracted and independently screened by two reviewers.
   Results
   The initial database search returned 777 articles, 506 of which remained after removal of duplicates. Following review of titles, abstracts, and full texts, 32 studies were included in the current review. Participants in the articles were primarily police officers, with fewer articles focusing on paramedics and firefighters. There were two studies that included mixed populations (i.e., one study with police officers, firefighters, and other emergency service workers; one study with paramedic and firefighter incident commanders). Most studies were qualitative and focused on four topics: values, ethical decision-making, organizational betrayal, and spirituality.
   Conclusion
   Public safety organizations appear to recognize the experience of moral distress or moral injury among public safety personnel that results from disconnects between personal core values, formal and informal organizational values, vocational duties, and expectations. Further research is needed to better understand moral distress or moral injury specific to public safety personnel and inform training and treatment in support of public safety personnel mental health.

AB  - Neuroinflammation represents a common trait in the pathology and progression of the major psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders have emerged as a global crisis, affecting 1 in 4 people, while neurological disorders are the second leading cause of death in the elderly population worldwide (WHO, 2001; GBD 2016 Neurology Collaborators, 2019). However, there remains an immense deficit in availability of effective drug treatments for most neurological disorders. In fact, for disorders such as depression, placebos and behavioral therapies have equal effectiveness as antidepressants. For neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, drugs that can prevent, slow, or cure the disease have yet to be found. Several non-traditional avenues of drug target identification have emerged with ongoing neurological disease research to meet the need for novel and efficacious treatments. Of these novel avenues is that of neuroinflammation, which has been found to be involved in the progression and pathology of many of the leading neurological disorders. Neuroinflammation is characterized by glial inflammatory factors in certain stages of neurological disorders. Although the meta-analyses have provided evidence of genetic/proteomic upregulation of inflammatory factors in certain stages of neurological disorders. Although the mechanisms underpinning the connections between neuroinflammation and neurological disorders are unclear, and meta-analysis results have shown high sensitivity to factors such as disorder severity and sample type, there is significant evidence of neuroinflammation associations across neurological disorders. In this review, we summarize the role of neuroinflammation in psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and introduce current research on the potential of immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) as a new treatment strategy for these disorders.

AB  - Globally, parents and children in same-sex parent families are impacted by many laws related to the parental sexual orientation. These laws vary considerably from one country to another, ranging from full legal recognition to criminalization. The psychological consequences of living in an ambiguous or hostile legal climate likely interfere with parental health, family functioning, and child development. However, a systematic evidence synthesis of the pertinent literature and its placement within a broader psychological model are currently lacking. The aims of this review were thus (1) to systematically review qualitative and quantitative evidence on the impact of sexual orientation laws on same-sex parent families in key domains and (2) to place these findings within a broader model informed by minority stress and family theories. Our review was preregistered and conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. We searched for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies on the impact of sexual orientation laws on target outcomes (parental health, family functioning, child outcomes) via systematic database search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) and forward-backward searches. Fifty-five studies published between 1999 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion and were synthesized using a data-based convergent synthesis design. Thirteen descriptive and three overarching analytical themes were identified through thematic synthesis. Linking our findings with minority stress and family theories, we propose a novel legal vulnerability model for same-sex parent families. The model posits that legal vulnerability constitutes an increased risk for parental and child health as well as family functioning through individual and shared pathways between family members. Additionally, the model introduces counteractions that families engage in on the personal, familial, and systemic level to mitigate the impact of legal vulnerability, as well as moderators on the contextual, familial, couple, and individual level that modulate this impact. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.

AB  - Background: A non-pharmaceutical treatment offered as psychological support is bibliotherapy, which can be described as the process of reading, reflecting, and discussing literature to further a cognitive shift. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demands a response to prevent a peak in the prevalence of mental health problems and to avoid the collapse of mental health services, which are scarce and inaccessible due to the pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to review articles on the effectiveness of bibliotherapy on different mental health problems.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted to examine relevant studies that assess the effectiveness of bibliotherapy in different clinical settings as a treatment capable of enhancing a sense of purpose and its surrounding values. To achieve this, a systematic review, including a bioethical meta-analysis, was performed. A variant of the PICO (Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) model was used for the search strategy, and the systematic review was conducted in three databases: PubMed, Bireme, and OVID. Inclusion criteria were relevant studies that included the keywords, excluding documents with irrelevant topics, studies on subjects 15 years or younger, and in languages besides Spanish or English. Starting with 707 studies, after three rounds of different quality criteria, 13 articles were selected for analysis, including a hermeneutic analysis, which was followed by a fourth and final recovery round assessing bibliotherapy articles concerning healthcare workers.
   Results: Our findings showed that through bibliotherapy, patients developed several capacities, including the re-signification of their own activities through a new outlook of their moral horizon. There are no research road maps serving as guides to conduct research on the use of bibliotherapy to enhance mental health. Additionally, values such as autonomy and justice were closely linked with positive results in bibliotherapy. This implies that bibliotherapy has the potential to have a positive impact in different settings.
   Conclusions: Our contribution is to offer a road map that presents state-of-the-art bibliotherapy research, which will assist institutions and healthcare professionals to plan clinical and specific interventions with positive outcomes.

AB  - The genetic basis of mood disorders can, theoretically, provide diagnostic information in scenarios of clinical uncertainty. Therefore, we examined the available body of knowledge on the association between polygenic risk scores for bipolar disorder (BP-PRSs) and pediatric bipolar spectrum and related disorders. We performed a literature search through PubMed in March of 2020. The following variables were extracted from relevant studies: population age, study sample size, source of polygenic risk scores, source of data, the primary goal of the study, the assessments used during the course of the study, and the main findings/outcomes of each study. BPPRSs were associated with deficits in executive functioning and the diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Three studies included in our analysis directly compared major depressive disorder (MDD)PRSs to BP-PRSs in youth. Results showed that MDD-PRSs, and not BP-PRSs, were associated with ADHD symptoms, internalizing problems, and social problems. ADHD-PRSs were associated with conduct problems, depressive symptomatology, and externalizing disorders symptoms. Findings revealed that ADHD-PRSs were more clearly associated with emotional reactivity, emotional dysregulation, and irritability?frequent correlates of pediatric BP disorder. These findings suggest that ADHD-PRSs may have an important contribution to the development of mood related problems in youth.

AB  - Women face complicated decisions regarding psychotropic medication use during pregnancy. Patient decision aids (PDAs) could be a valuable tool to assist with decision-making. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of PDAs in this population. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. Three major databases were searched to identify articles published between 2006 and June 2020. Studies were included if they evaluated use of a PDA for women considering medication for mental illness during pregnancy. A total of 4629 titles were returned from the search; however, only three studies met inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis. Two were pilot randomised controlled trials in women considering antidepressant use during pregnancy, and one was a non-randomised study in women considering medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). The PDAs had good acceptability across all three studies. The randomised trials assessed knowledge, decisional conflict, depression, and anxiety, with non-significant trends towards reduced decisional conflict and anxiety in the PDA groups. PDAs have the potential to assist women with mental illnesses to make decisions regarding medication use during pregnancy; however, current evidence is too limited to evaluate the effectiveness of PDAs for this population.

KW  - treatment trials
AB  - Background Mental health problems in children and young people are common and can lead to poor long-term outcomes. Despite the availability of effective psychological interventions for mental health disorders, only a minority of affected children and young people access treatment. Digital interventions, such as applied games and virtual reality (VR), that target mental health problems in children and young people may hold a key to increasing access to, engagement with, and potentially the effectiveness of psychological treatments. To date, several applied games and VR interventions have been specifically developed for children and young people. This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize current data on the experience and effectiveness of applied games and VR for targeting mental health problems in children and young people (defined as average age of 18 years or below).
   Methods Electronic systematic searches were conducted in Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science.
   Results Nineteen studies were identified that examined nine applied games and two VR applications, and targeted symptoms of anxiety, depression, and phobias using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Existing evidence is at a very early stage and studies vary extensively in key methodological characteristics. For applied games, the most robust evidence is for adolescent depressive symptoms (medium clinical effect sizes). Insufficient research attention has been given to the efficacy of VR interventions in children and young people.
   Conclusions The evidence to date is at a very early stage. Despite the enthusiasm for applied games and VR, existing interventions are limited in number and evidence of efficacy, and there is a clear need for further co-design, development, and evaluation of applied games and VR before they are routinely offered as treatments for children and young people with mental health problems.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a number of negative health related consequences, including impacts on mental health. More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial.
   Objective: The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention.
   Methods: This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canada's guidance on app assessment and selection.
   Results: A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity.
   Conclusions: A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group. While some research and digital interventions addressed equity-related considerations, more research and focused attention should be given to this area.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioural models of auditory verbal hallucinations (voices) predict that the interpretation of voices determines the levels of distress experienced by voice-hearers. Examining the contribution of these voice appraisals is central to the delivery of effective psychological interventions for the management of distressing psychotic symptoms. This meta-analysis synthesised evidence from studies that tested the relationship between a range of appraisals and several distress measures (voice-related and emotional distress) in individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses. A database search (PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science) was conducted for articles published up to August 2020. Twenty-eight eligible studies, comprising of 1497 clinical participants examined the association between eight voice appraisals and distress. Moderate to large summary effects (r ranging between 0.30 and 0.50) were observed in several analyses focusing on 'maladaptive' appraisals and beliefs about voices (malevolence, power, metaphysical beliefs, beliefs about loss of control, voice intrusiveness), with voice dominance having a large summary effect, r = 0.58, 95% CI [0.43, 0.69]. Positive appraisals and beliefs had small negative summary effects on distress. The magnitude of the observed effects was similar across subgroup analyses considering measures of voice-related distress, anxiety and depression. The findings of this evidence synthesis broadly corroborate cognitive-behavioural models of distressing voices, but suggested that factors other than voice appraisals may also predict the distress and impairment caused by hallucinatory experiences in people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Nonetheless, our findings confirm that voice appraisals are an important and meaningful target for treatment in help-seeking voice hearers with psychosis. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is among the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, which are considered high mortality risk medical conditions. To date, several studies have reported positive effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) interventions on physical and psychological well-being in other medical conditions, but no meta-analysis on MBSR programs for hypertension has been conducted. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of MBSR programs for hypertension. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of MBSR on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), anxiety, depression, and perceived stress in people with hypertension or pre-hypertension was conducted. The PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched in November 2020 to identify relevant studies. Results: Six studies were included. The comparison of MBSR versus control conditions on diastolic BP was associated with a statistically significant mean effect size favoring MBSR over control conditions (MD = -2.029; 95% confidence interval (CI): -3.676 to -0.383, p = 0.016, k = 6; 22 effect sizes overall), without evidence of heterogeneity (I-2 = 0.000%). The comparison of MBSR versus control conditions on systolic BP was associated with a mean effect size which was statistically significant only at a marginal level (MD = -3.894; 95% CI: -7.736-0.053, p = 0.047, k = 6; 22 effect sizes overall), without evidence of high heterogeneity (I-2 = 20.772%). The higher the proportion of participants on antihypertensive medications was, the larger the effects of MBSR were on systolic BP (B = -0.750, z = -2.73, p = 0.003). Conclusions: MBSR seems to be a promising intervention, particularly effective on the reduction of diastolic BP. More well-conducted trials are required.

AB  - Background
   There is strong public belief that polyunsaturated fats protect against and ameliorate depression and anxiety.
   Aims
   To assess effects of increasing omega-3, omega-6 or total polyunsaturated fat on prevention and treatment of depression and anxiety symptoms.
   Method
   We searched widely (Central, Medline and EMBASE to April 2017, trial registers to September 2016, ongoing trials updated to August 2019), including trials of adults with or without depression or anxiety, randomised to increased omega-3, omega-6 or total polyunsaturated fat for >= 24 weeks, excluding multifactorial interventions. Inclusion, data extraction and risk of bias were assessed independently in duplicate, and authors contacted for further data. We used random-effects meta-analysis, sensitivity analyses, subgrouping and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) assessment.
   Results
   We included 31 trials assessing effects of long-chain omega-3 (n = 41 470), one of alpha-linolenic acid (n = 4837), one of total polyunsaturated fat (n = 4997) and none of omega-6. Meta-analysis suggested that increasing long-chain omega-3 probably has little or no effect on risk of depression symptoms (risk ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.92-1.10, I-2 = 0%, median dose 0.95 g/d, duration 12 months) or anxiety symptoms (standardised mean difference 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.26, I-2 = 0%, median dose 1.1 g/d, duration 6 months; both moderate-quality evidence). Evidence of effects on depression severity and remission in existing depression were unclear (very-low-quality evidence). Results did not differ by risk of bias, omega-3 dose, duration or nutrients replaced. Increasing alpha-linolenic acid by 2 g/d may increase risk of depression symptoms very slightly over 40 months (number needed to harm, 1000).
   Conclusions
   Long-chain omega-3 supplementation probably has little or no effect in preventing depression or anxiety symptoms.

   Mental disorders are increasingly common among adults in both the developed and developing world and are predicted by the WHO to be the leading cause of disease burden by 2030. Many common physical conditions are more common among people who also have a common mental disorder. This scoping review aims to examine the current literature about the prevention, identification and treatment of physical problems among people with pre-existing mental health disorders in primary care in Europe.

   The scoping review framework comprised a five-stage process developed by Arksey & O'Malley (2005). The search process was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Both quantitative and qualitative studies were included, with no restriction on study design.
   Results:
   The initial search identified 299 studies, with a further 28 added from the hand-search (total n = 327) of which 19 were considered relevant to the review research question and included for full analysis. Depression was the mental health condition most commonly studied (nine studies), followed by depression and anxiety (seven studies), with three studies examining any mental disorder. Eleven studies examined the effects of various interventions to address physical and mental comorbidity, with the most commonly studied intervention being collaborative care.
   Conclusions:
   With just 19 studies meeting our criteria for inclusion, there is clearly a paucity of research in this area. Further research is essential in order to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between mental disorders and chronic conditions.

AB  - Freshwater unionid mussels are among the most imperiled fauna in North America, and their decline has been partially attributed to sediment from anthropogenic activities. However, there remains a debate regarding the role played by sediment in mussel declines due to a lack of field and laboratory evidence. If sediment is responsible for mussel declines, then a lack of information will likely impede efforts to mitigate species declines and protect remaining habitat. However, if the impacts of sediment are overstated, time and resources may be wasted on a threat that has little bearing on mussel declines or habitat loss. Given this knowledge gap, the purpose of this paper is to review the literature focused on the potential impact of suspended sediment and sedimentation on freshwater mussels. We focused our search on suspended sediment, expressed either as suspended sediment concentration (SSC) or total suspended solids (TSS), and sediment deposition and scour. We found increases in suspended solids could impact mussels by decreasing food availability, physically interfering with filter feeding and respiration, and impeding various aspects of the mussel-host relationship. We also found mussel-sediment thresholds, wherein certain concentrations of sediment caused significant declines in population performance, which could serve as reference points for ecological research and management. Specifically, we found clearance rates (a measure of feeding) were negatively impacted by TSS concentrations >8 mg/L, and respiratory stress occurred at similar to 600 mg/L. Declines in fertilization success and glochidial (i.e., mussel larvae) development were observed at TSS values of 15 mg/L, and reproductive failure occurred at 20 mg/L. Impacts on host fish attachment and glochidial encystment occurred at TSS concentrations of 1250-5000 mg/L. Impacts on fish varied depending on the biological endpoint but typically occurred at TSS values ranging from 20 to 5000 mg/L. We also found mussels were sensitive to smothering and mortality occurred at depths as low as 0.6-2.5 cm of substrate. Finally, we found relative shear stress (RSS) values >1, which is a measure of substrate stability in response to scour and entrainment, resulted in significant declines in mussel biodiversity.

AB  - Background: The impact of precision psychiatry for clinical practice has not been systematically appraised. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of validated prediction models to estimate the individual risk of being affected with a condition (diagnostic), developing outcomes (prognostic), or responding to treatments (predictive) in mental disorders. Methods: PRISMA/RIGHT/ CHARMS-compliant systematic review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, and Ovid/PsycINFO databases from inception until July 21, 2019 (PROSPERO CRD42019155713) to identify diagnostic/prognostic/predictive prediction studies that reported individualized estimates in psychiatry and that were internally or externally validated or implemented. Random effect meta-regression analyses addressed the impact of several factors on the accuracy of prediction models. Findings: Literature search identified 584 prediction modeling studies, of which 89 were included. 10.4% of the total studies included prediction models internally validated (n = 61), 4.6% models externally validated (n = 27), and 0.2% (n = 1) models considered for implementation. Across validated prediction modeling studies (n = 88), 18.2% were diagnostic, 68.2% prognostic, and 13.6% predictive. The most frequently investigated condition was psychosis (36.4%), and the most frequently employed predictors clinical (69.5%). Unimodal compared to multimodal models (beta = .29, P = .03) and diagnostic compared to prognostic (beta = .84, p < .0001) and predictive (beta = .87, P = .002) models were associated with increased accuracy. Interpretation: To date, several validated prediction models arc available to support the diagnosis and prognosis of psychiatric conditions, in particular, psychosis, or to predict treatment response. Advancements of knowledge are limited by the lack of implementation research in real-world clinical practice. A new generation of implementation research is required to address this translational gap.

AB  - The experience of breast cancer and related treatments has notable effects on women's mental health. Among them, the subjective perception of the body or body image (BI) is altered. Such alterations deserve to be properly treated because they augment the risk for depression and mood disorders, and impair intimate relationships. A number of studies revealed that focused psychological interventions are effective in reducing BI issues related to breast cancer. However, findings are inconsistent regarding the dimension of such effects. This meta-analysis synthesizes and quantifies the efficacy of psychological interventions for BI in breast cancer patients and survivors. Additionally, since sexual functioning emerged as a relevant aspect in the BI distortions, we explored the efficacy of psychological interventions on sexual functioning related to BI in breast cancer patients and survivors. The literature search for relevant contributions was carried out in March 2020 through the following electronic databases: Scopus, PsycINFO, and ProQUEST. Only articles available in English and that featured psychological interventions for body image in breast cancer patients or survivors with controls were included. Seven articles with 17 dependent effect sizes were selected for this meta-analysis. Variables were grouped into: Body Image (six studies, nine dependent effect sizes) and Sexual Functioning Related to the Body Image in breast cancer patients and survivors (four studies, eight dependent effect sizes). The three-level meta-analysis showed a statistically significant effect for Body Image [g = 0.50; 95% CI (0.08; 0.93); p < 0.05] but no significant results for Sexual Functioning Related to Body Image [g = 0.33; 95% CI (-0.20; 0.85); p = 0.19]. These results suggest that psychological interventions are effective in reducing body image issues but not in reducing sexual functioning issues related to body image in breast cancer patients and survivors. Future review efforts may include gray literature and qualitative studies to better understand body image and sexual functioning issues in breast cancer patients. Also, high-quality studies are needed to inform future meta-analyses.

AB  - Purpose of Review Informed by the evidence of links between physiology of stress and parturition, we review recent epidemiologic evidence (2015-2020) of antenatal depression as a risk factor for preterm birth (PTB). We also explain racial/ethnic disparities in depression and preterm birth as a consequence of structural racism. Recent Findings Epidemiologic evidence is consistent in linking antepartum depression with an elevated risk of PTB. Antidepressant usage has been linked with an elevated risk of PTB. However, recent evidence suggests that severity of depression is the underlying driver of the elevated risk attributed to antidepressant usage. The number of depressive symptoms, as a proxy for severity of maternal stress, may be a more informative predictor of PTB than criterion based predictors. Across various study designs, measurement modalities, and populations, antenatal depression predicts an elevated risk of delivering preterm. The physiology of stress provides a plausible explanation for this observation. Excessive stress-induced elevations in maternal and then fetal HPA hormones can alter maternal and fetal homeostasis and hasten the timing of parturition. Antenatal depression and exposure to structural racism are two stressors that can trigger the maternal stress response. Chronically elevated levels of stress hormones among women of color in the USA provide a likely physiologic explanation for Black-White disparities in the risk of PTB. Focusing on the number of depressive symptoms as the more informative predictor of PTB raises several questions. We consider these questions as well as directions for future research in the context of recent advances in the field.

AB  - Comprising approximately 7500 living species of various corals and sea anemones, Anthozoa ranks among the most ecologically and economically valuable marine taxa. However, the taxonomy and systematics of anthozoans remain in flux as several facets of their biology (e.g. cryptic speciation, hybridisation and introgression, morphological plasticity and convergence) confound taxonomists even today. Rapid advancements in molecular sequencing and analyses have made available vast quantities of genomic data on an increasing number of species across the anthozoan tree of life. While whole genome assemblies are expected to result in the most robust phylogenetic trees, reduced-representation techniques such as genome skimming, RAD-seq, phylotranscriptomics and hybrid capture have led to well-supported inferences at various taxonomic levels and may still be favoured at this stage due to the high cost associated with even a single genome assembly. Here, we examine the different genotyping and analytical approaches used in anthozoan phylogeny reconstructions, their applicability across different divergences, and the coverage of studies among anthozoan clades to date. Based on our review of 82 phylogenomic studies, we describe the suitability of methods employed relative to their aims, highlight the imbalanced coverage of taxonomic groups studied and assess immediate and long-term needs where consolidation and streamlining of approaches would further advance the field. Overall, we find that Scleractinia (Anthozoa) is the most phylogenetically sampled group and studies on Octocorallia (Anthozoa) and its subclades are emerging. Nevertheless, we emphasise the need for more phylotranscriptomic, hybrid capture and whole genome sequencing across all anthozoans to increase topological support and generate more precise divergence time estimates. The enhanced phylogenetic understanding of Anthozoa is expected to provide insights into the evolution of genes and adaptations to environmental stressors amidst the current climate and mass extinction crises.

AB  - Objective: The objective of our current research is to compare the different psychological interventions and distinguish the most effective way to treat psychological crisis according to different clinical manifestations in people affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). No previous systematic review has provided a comprehensive overview by performing a Bayesian network meta-analysis of this current topic.
   Method: A systematic review and a Bayesian network meta-analysis were conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, case-control studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS), cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies of all the available interventions for psychological crisis in people affected by COVID-19. We searched the electronic databases EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library, as well as the Chinese databases such as Sinomed, Chinese Biomedicine Literature (CBM), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), WanFang Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), from 2019 to April 30, 2020. The main outcomes were self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), and symptom checklist (SCL-90). The study is registered with Inplasy, number 202050076.
   Result: Sixteen self-controlled case series (SCCS) comprising 1,147 participants compared five different psychological interventions with four different measurement scales were included in this study. For effectiveness, all the psychological therapies were significantly more effective than before intervention. Our results showed that supportive therapy (ST), which is adjusted to the COVID-19-related mental crisis, is the best treatment compared with behavioral therapy (BT), nursing-based psychological therapy (NBPT), traditional Chinese medicine therapy (TCMT), and COVID-19-related standard training (CRST) at reducing the anxiety-related symptoms assessed by SAS. When measured by SDS, BT was better than ST and NBPT treatment for reducing the depression symptoms. And ST was better than BT and ST+BT as assessed by PHQ-9. In the end, the last network meta-analysis indicated that NBPT was more effective than ST by the measurement of SCL-90.
   Conclusion: Our research suggested the potential effectiveness of psychological interventions for decreasing psychological crisis in people affected by COVID-19 and try to introduce the best effective treatment options for clinical practice according to the clinical manifestations of psychological problems, but further confirmation from high-quality RCTs is needed.

AB  - Objectives:
   Plant-based medicines have had a long-standing history of use in psychiatric disorders. Highly quantified and standardized extracts or isolates may be termed "phytoceuticals," in a similar way that medicinal nutrients are termed as "nutraceuticals." Over the past 2 decades, several meta-analyses have examined the data for a range of plant-based medicines in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this international project is to provide a "meta-review" of this top-tier evidence.
   Methods:
   We identified, synthesized, and appraised all available up to date meta-analyses... of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy and effectiveness of individual phytoceuticals across all major psychiatric disorders.
   Results:
   Our systematic search identified 9 relevant meta-analyses of RCTs, with primary analyses including outcome data from 5,927 individuals. Supportive meta-analytic evidence was found for St John's wort for major depressive disorder (MDD); curcumin and saffron for MDD or depression symptoms, and ginkgo for total and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Kava was not effective in treating diagnosed anxiety disorders. We also provide details on 22 traditional Chinese herbal medicine formulas' meta-analyses (primarily for depression studies), all of which revealed highly significant and large effect sizes. Their methodology, reporting, and potential publication bias were, however, of marked concern. The same caveat was noted for the curcumin, ginkgo, and saffron meta-analyses, which may also have significant publication bias.
   Conclusions:
   More rigorous international studies are required to validate the efficacy of these phytoceuticals before treatment recommendations can be made. In conclusion, the breadth of data tentatively supports several phytoceuticals which may be effective for mental disorders alongside pharmaceutical, psychological therapies, and standard lifestyle recommendations.

AB  - Objectives: Healthcare workers (HWs) experienced high levels of work stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a high risk of sleep disturbances. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the prevalence of sleep disturbances and sleep quality in Chinese HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: English (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) and Chinese databases (WanFang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and SinoMed) were systematically and independently searched for relevant studies published from December 1, 2019, to May 20, 2020. The pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances and sleep quality were calculated using a random-effects model.
   Results: A total of 17 studies involving 12,682 Chinese HWs were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances in Chinese HWs was 45.1% (95% CI: 37.2-53.1%). We found that the prevalence of sleep disturbances varied among frontline, infected, and non-frontline HWs (Q = 96.96, p < 0.001); females and males (Q = 9.10, p = 0.003); studies using different assessment instruments (Q = 96.05, p < 0.001); and studies with different sample sizes (Q = 5.77, p = 0.016) and cut-off values (Q = 62.28, p < 0.001). The pooled mean total score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was 9.83 (95% CI: 8.61-11.04). HWs in Wuhan had a higher total PSQI score than those in other regions (Q = 9.21, p = 0.002).
   Conclusion: Sleep disturbances were common in Chinese HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in frontline and infected HWs. Our results indicate the heavy mental health burden on HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and can provide other countries with valuable information to assist HWs during the crisis.

AB  - In response to questions regarding the scientific basis for mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), we evaluated their empirical status by systematically reviewing meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched six databases for effect sizes based on four or more trials that did not combine passive and active controls. Heterogeneity, moderators, tests of publication bias, risk of bias, and adverse effects were also extracted. Representative effect sizes based on the largest number of studies were identified across a wide range of populations, problems, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes (PICOS). A total of 160 effect sizes were reported in 44 meta-analyses (k = 336 RCTs, N = 30,483 participants). MBIs showed superiority to passive controls across most PICOS (ds = 0.10-0.89). Effects were typically smaller and less often statistically significant compared with active controls. MBIs were similar or superior to specific active controls and evidence-based treatments. Heterogeneity was typically moderate. Few consistent moderators were found. Results were generally robust to publication bias, although other important sources of bias were identified. Reporting of adverse effects was inconsistent. Statistical power may be lacking in meta-analyses, particularly for comparisons with active controls. Because MBIs show promise across some PICOS, future RCTs and meta-analyses should build on identified strengths and limitations of this literature.

AB  - Introduction: The mental health of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women is a relatively understudied area. This review formally explores the prevalence of depression in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women in India.
   Methods: Databases like PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science and Scopus were systematically searched for cross-sectional or cohort studies, providing prevalence of depression in Indian perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Systematic study selection and data extraction procedures were followed. Quality assessment of individual study was done using AXIS tool. For pooling of effect sizes, the random effects model was used. Funnel plot and Egger?s test were used to ascertain publication bias. Subgroup analyses and metaregression analysis were used to explore heterogeneity in the summary estimates.
   Results: After a thorough search, ten studies were found to be eligible and included in this review. Pooled estimate for prevalence of depression (random effects model) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women in India is 42.47 % (95 % CI: 28.73?57.49, I-2 = 97.7 %). On visual inspection of the funnel plot and interpreting egger?s test (bias: 3.49, SE bias: 3.68, p = 0.37), there was absence of publication bias.
   Conclusion: We documented 42.47 % pooled prevalence of depression in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women in India.

AB  - Background: Evidence on technology-based psychological interventions (TBIs) for the treatment of depression is rapidly growing and covers a broad scope of research. Despite extensive research in this field, guideline recommendations are still limited to the general effectiveness of TBIs.
   Objective: This study aims to structure evidence on TBIs by considering different application areas (eg, TBIs for acute treatment and their implementation in health care, such as stand-alone interventions) and treatment characteristics (eg, therapeutic rationale of TBIs) to provide a comprehensive evidence base and to identify research gaps in TBIs for diagnosed depression. Moreover, the reporting of negative events in the included studies is investigated in this review to enable subsequent safety assessment of the TBIs.
   Methods: Randomized controlled trials on adults diagnosed with unipolar depression receiving any kind of psychotherapeutic treatment, which was at least partly delivered by a technical medium, were eligible for inclusion in our preregistered systematic review. We searched for trials in CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; until August 2020), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, CINAHL; until the end of January 2018), clinical trial registers, and sources of gray literature (until the end of January 2019). Study selection and data extraction were conducted by 2 review authors independently.
   Results: Database searches resulted in 15,546 records, of which 241 publications were included, representing 83 completed studies and 60 studies awaiting classification (ie, preregistered studies, study protocols). Almost all completed studies (78/83, 94%) addressed the acute treatment phase, being largely either implemented as stand-alone interventions (66/83, 80%) or blended treatment approaches (12/83, 14%). Studies on TBIs for aftercare (4/83, 5%) and for bridging waiting periods (1/83, 1%) were scarce. Most TBI study arms (n=107) were guided (59/107, 55.1%), delivered via the internet (80/107, 74.8%), and based on cognitive behavioral treatment approaches (88/107, 79.4%). Almost all studies (77/83, 93%) reported information on negative events, considering dropouts from treatment as a negative event. However, reports on negative events were heterogeneous and largely unsystematic.
   Conclusions: Research has given little attention to studies evaluating TBIs for aftercare and for bridging waiting periods in people with depression, even though TBIs are seen as highly promising in these application areas; thus, high quality studies are urgently needed. In addition, the variety of therapeutic rationales on TBIs has barely been represented by identified studies hindering the consideration of patient preferences when planning treatment. Finally, future studies should use specific guidelines to systematically assess and report negative events.

AB  - In Germany, large, population-based cohort studies have been implemented in order to identify risk and protective factors for maintaining health across the life span. The purpose of this systematic review is to analyse findings from three large ongoing cohorts and to identify sex-specific prevalence rates, risk and protective factors for mental health. Published studies from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region Augsburg (KORA), the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) and the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS)), representing the southern, north-eastern and middle parts of Germany, were identified through searches of the databases PubMed and Web of Science. A total of 52 articles was identified from the start of each cohort until June 2019. Articles reporting prevalence rates of mental health [N = 22], explanatory factors for mental health [N = 25], or both [N = 5] were identified. Consistent across cohorts, higher prevalence rates of internalizing disorders were found for women and more externalizing disorders for men. Risk and protective factors for mental health included social factors, lifestyle, physical health, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, genetic and biological factors. In all areas, differences and similarities were found between women and men. The most evident were the sex-specific risk profiles for depression with mostly external risk factors for men and internal risk factors for women. Gender was not assessed directly, therefore we examined whether socioeconomic and family-related factors reflecting gender roles or institutionalized gender could be used as a proxy for gender. Overall, this systematic review shows differences and similarities in prevalence rates and determinants of mental health indicators between women and men. They underline the importance of focussing on sex specific approaches in mental health research and in the development of prevention measures. Current research on mental health still lacks focus on gender aspects. Therefore, an increased focus on sex and gender in mental health research is of great importance.

KW  - Combined pollution
AB  - Phthalates (PAEs) are of wide concern because they are commonly used in various plastic products as plasticizers, and can found their way into the environment. However, their interaction with the environment and their toxicity in aquatic animals is still a matter of intense debate. In this review on PAEs in aquatic environments (lakes, rivers and seas), it is found that there is a large variety and abundance of PAEs in developing countries, and the total concentration of PAEs even exceeds 200 mu g / L. The interaction between metabolic processes involved in the toxicity induced by various PAEs is summarized for the first time in the article. Exposure of PAEs can lead to activation of the detoxification system CYP450 and endocrine system receptors of aquatic animals, which in turn causes oxidative stress, metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, and immunosuppression. Meanwhile, each system can activate / inhibit each other, causing genotoxicity and cell apoptosis, resulting in the growth and development of organisms being blocked. The mixed PAEs shows no cumulative toxicity changes to aquatic animals. For the combined pollution of other chemicals and PAEs, PAE can act as an agonist or antagonist, leading to combined toxicity in different directions. Phthalate monoesters (MPEs), the metabolites of PAEs, are also toxic to aquatic animals, however, the toxicity is weaker than the corresponding parent compounds. This review summarizes and analyzes the current ecotoxicological effects of PAEs on aquatic animals, and provides guidance for future research. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Experiencing psychological trauma during childhood and/or adolescence is associated with an increased risk of psychosis in adulthood. However, we lack a clear knowledge of how developmental trauma induces vulnerability to psychotic symptoms. Understanding the psychological processes involved in this association is crucial to the development of preventive interventions and improved treatments. We sought to systematically review the literature and combine findings using meta-analytic techniques to establish the potential roles of psychological processes in the associations between developmental trauma and specific psychotic experiences (i.e., hallucinations, delusions and paranoia). Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria. We found mediating roles of dissociation, emotional dysregulation and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (avoidance, numbing and hyperarousal) between developmental trauma and hallucinations. There was also evidence of a mediating role of negative schemata, i.e. mental constructs of meanings, between developmental trauma and delusions as well as paranoia. Many studies to date have been of poor quality, and the field is limited by mostly cross-sectional research. Our findings suggest that there may be distinct psy-chological pathways from developmental trauma to psychotic phenomena in adulthood. Clinicians should carefully ask people with psychosis about their history of developmental trauma, and screen patients with such a history for dissociation, emotional dysregulation and PTSD symptoms. Well conducted research with prospective designs, including neurocognitive assessment, is required in order to fully understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying the association between developmental trauma and psychosis.

AB  - Background: Mastalgia or breast pain common benign breast disorder in women in her reproductive life. Mastalgia estimate prevalence 41-71%. It affects to overall quality of life and associated with anxiety, stress, and other psychological factors. Objective: The purpose of the study was to conduct a review of alternative therapy in the management of mastalgia. Method: A review was conducted using search terms cyclical mastalgia (CM), yoga therapy, breast treatment, primrose oil, oestrogen, progesterone and all the probable term in national and international data repositories such as PubMed, Scopus, science direct, google scholar, web of science in English language. Result: The review of alternative therapies in the management of CM suggests that most of the studies used primrose oil, vitamins, and physical activity. There are very few studies conducted in relation to yoga and cyclical mastalgia. Further, most of the studies explored effect of alternative therapies on psychological outcomes. None of the studies investigated efficacy of these therapies on hormonal changes. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that biochemical clinical trial is effective with side effect, primrose oil and seeds treatment is less effective. One evidence-based study with integrated yoga therapy should be considered in the management of cyclical mastalgia. More high-quality trial with yogic approach needed to first line management of patients presenting with CM.

AB  - Biological effects of extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) and its consequences on human health have become the subject of important and recurrent public debate. ELF-MF evokes cell/organism responses that are characteristic to a general stress reaction, thus it can be regarded as a stress factor. Exposure to ELF-MF "turns on" different intracellular mechanisms into both directions: compensatory or deleterious ones. ELF-MF can provoke morphological and physiological changes in stress-related systems, mainly nervous, hormonal, and immunological ones. This review summarizes the ELF-MF-mediated changes at various levels of the organism organization. Special attention is placed on the review of literature from the last decade. Most studies on ELF-MF effects concentrate on its negative influence, e.g., impairment of behavior towards depressive and anxiety disorders; however, in the last decade there was an increase in the number of research studies showing stimulating impact of ELF-MF on neuroplasticity and neurorehabilitation. In the face of numerous studies on the ELF-MF action, it is necessary to systematize the knowledge for a better understanding of the phenomenon, in order to reduce the risk associated with the exposure to this factor and to recognize the possibility of using it as a therapeutic agent.

AB  - Background:
   The kynurenine (KYN) pathway has been implicated in many diseases associated with inflammation and aging ("inflammaging"). Targeting the kynurenine pathway to modify disease outcomes has been trialled pharmacologically, but the evidence of non-pharmacological means (ie, exercise) remains unclear.
   Objective:
   We aim to assess the evidence of the effects of exercise on the kynurenine pathway and psychological outcomes.
   Methods:
   Under Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials. The main outcomes were changes in kynurenine pathway metabolite levels and psychological outcomes.
   Results:
   Six studies were analyzed (total n = 379) with exercise demonstrating significant concomitant effects on kynurenine pathway metabolite levels and associated psychological outcomes in domains of somatization, anxiety, and depression.
   Conclusion:
   Exercise has significant concomitant effect on kynurenine pathway metabolite levels and psychological outcomes. However, clear limitations exist in determining if the changes in the kynurenine pathway can fully explain the changes in psychological outcomes, or whether different diseases and exercise interventions act as confounding factors.

AB  - Anxiety has been identified as one of the most severe and long-lasting symptoms experienced by hospitalized children with cancer. Self-reports are especially important for documenting emotional and abstract concepts, such as anxiety. Children may not always be able to communicate their symptoms due to language difficulties, a lack of developmental language skills, or the severity of their illness. Instruments with sufficient psychometric quality and pictorial support may address this communication challenge. The purpose of this review was to systematically search the published literature and identify validated and reliable self-report instruments available for children aged 5-18 years to use in the assessment of their anxiety to ensure they receive appropriate anxiety-relief intervention in hospital. What validated self-report instruments can children with cancer use to self-report anxiety in the hospital setting? Which of these instruments offer pictorial support? Eight instruments were identified, but most of the instruments lacked pictorial support. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL (TM)) 3.0 Brain Tumor Module and Cancer Module proved to be useful in hospitalized children with cancer, as they provide pictorial support. It is recommended that faces or symbols be used along with the VAS, as pictures are easily understood by younger children. Future studies could include the adaptation of existing instruments in digital e-health tools.

AB  - Background: It is estimated that approximately 13% of expectant fathers experience a pathological and debilitating fear of childbirth. Objective: The aim of this integrative review was to examine and synthesise the current body of research relating to paternal experience of fear of childbirth. Methods: A systematic literature search of five databases-CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycArticles and PsycInfo-identified seventeen papers. Methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. Results: Thematic data analysis identified three themes: the focus of fathers' childbirth-related fears, the impact of fear of childbirth on health and wellbeing, and fear of childbirth as a private burden. Discussion: Fear of childbirth is a significant and distressing experience for expectant fathers who may benefit from an opportunity to express their childbirth-related fears in an environment where they feel validated and supported. Antenatal education is recommended to enhance fathers' childbirth-related self-efficacy to reduce fear of childbirth. Conclusions: Fear of childbirth may negatively impact the lives of men and consequently their families. Further investigation into methods and models for identifying and supporting men at risk of or experiencing fear of childbirth is required to improve outcomes for this population of men.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays an important role in neurological diseases via the gut-brain axis. Many factors such as diet, antibiotic therapy, stress, metabolism, age, geography and genetics are known to play a critical role in regulating the colonization pattern of the microbiota. Recent studies have shown the role of the low carbohydrate, adequate protein, and high fat "ketogenic diet" in remodeling the composition of the gut microbiome and thereby facilitating protective effects in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Gut microbes are found to be involved in the pathogenesis of various CNS disorders like epilepsy, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stress, anxiety and depression. In vivo studies have shown an intricate link between gut microbes and KD and specific microbes/probiotics proved useful in in vivo CNS disease models. In the present review, we discuss the gut-brain bidirectional axis and the underlying mechanism of KD-based therapy targeting gut microbiome in in vivo animal models and clinical studies in neurological diseases. Also, we tried to infer how KD by altering the microbiota composition contributes towards the protective role in various CNS disorders. This review helps to uncover the mechanisms that are utilized by the KD and gut microbiota to modulate gut-brain axis functions and may provide novel opportunities to target therapies to the gut to treat neurologic disorders.

AB  - Objective:
   Patients with major depressive disorder often have limited response to first-line and second-line medications; hence, novel pharmacological treatments are needed for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in patients with TRD. The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) convened a task force to review the evidence for efficacy and safety of racemic ketamine and to provide recommendations for its use in clinical practice.
   Methods:
   A systematic review was conducted with computerized search of electronic databases up to January 31, 2020 using combinations of search terms, inspection of bibliographies, and review of other ketamine guidelines and consensus statements. The level of evidence and lines of treatment were assigned according to CANMAT criteria. Recommendations were given in question-answer format.
   Results:
   Intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine given as a single infusion has Level 1 evidence for efficacy in adults with TRD. The evidence for multiple infusions, given as an acute series or as ongoing maintenance treatment, is limited to Level 3. Adverse events associated with ketamine infusions include behavioral (e.g., dissociative symptoms) and physiological (e.g., hypertension) events. There is only Level 3 or 4 evidence for non-IV formulations of racemic ketamine. Consensus recommendations are given for clinical administration of IV ketamine including patient selection, facility and personnel issues, monitoring, and maintaining response.
   Conclusions:
   Single-dose IV racemic ketamine is a third-line recommendation for adults with TRD. The need for repeated and maintenance ketamine infusions should be carefully assessed on a case-by-case basis with consideration of potential risks and benefits. Because of limited evidence for efficacy and risk for misuse and diversion, the use of oral and other formulations of racemic ketamine should be limited to specialists with ketamine-prescribing expertise and affiliations with tertiary or specialized centers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Panic disorder (PD) is a devastating illness, with numer-ous patients experiencing significant functional disability and many not achieving full remission with first-line pharmacologic and psychothera-peutic treatments. METHODS: A search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO data-bases was used to identify publications focused on evidence-based treat-ment of PD. RESULTS: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiaze-pines are standard first-line pharmacologic treatments for PD. Many other antidepressants can be considered as alternatives to SSRIs, including sero-tonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, serotonin multimodal agents, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and mirtazap-ine. Certain anticonvulsants and antipsychotics may be helpful; however, the evidence base is limited. Buspirone, beta blockers, and hydroxyzine can be considered third-line agents. Currently, there is minimal data sup-port the use of electroconvulsive therapy or repetitive transcranial mag-netic stimulation (rTMS). There is very little evidence justifying the use of medical cannabis or over-the-counter supplements for PD, and these treatments have risk for adverse effects. Research strongly supports the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PD. CONCLUSIONS: Many options exist for the management of PD. Treatments with the strongest evidence include SSRIs, other antidepressants, and CBT. Newer interventions approved for the treatment of depression, such as serotonin multimodal agents, esketamine, and rTMS, merit further investigation for use in PD.

KW  - Trace Amine-Associated Receptor
KW  - SEP-363856
KW  - schizophrenia
KW  - drug target
AB  - There are nine subfamilies of TAARs. They are predominantly intracellular, located in the central nervous system and peripherally. They have a role in homeostasis and rheostasis, and also in olfaction. They demonstrate significant cross-talk with the monoamine system and are involved in the regulation of cAMP signalling and K+ channels. There is evidence to suggest that TAAR1 may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of schizophrenia, psychosis in Parkinson's disease, substance use disorders, and the metabolic syndrome and obesity. TAAR1 expression may also be a prognostic biomarker for cancers.
   A number of TAAR modulators have been identified, including endogenous ligands and new chemical entities. Some of these agents have shown efficacy in animal models of addiction behaviours, depression and anxiety. Only one agent, SEP-363856, has progressed to randomised clinical trials in humans; however further, larger studies with SEP-363856 are required to clarify its suitability as a new treatment for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. SEP-363856 is an agonist of TAAR1 and 5HT1A and it is not clear to what extent its efficacy can be attributed to TAAR1 rather than to other drug targets. However, current research suggests that TAAR1 has an important role in human physiology and pathophysiology. TAAR1 modulators may become an important new drug class for the management of a wide array of mental disorders in the future.

AB  - Background: Anxiety is associated with poor health outcomes among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This review summarizes the prevalence and risk factors associated with elevated anxiety symptoms and disorders among CKD patients.
   Methods: Articles evaluating the prevalence and risk factors associated with elevated anxiety symptoms and disorders among CKD patients, as diagnosed via DSM 4th or 5th edition criteria, clinical interviews or validated questionnaires, were searched in Medline (R), Embase (R), PsychINFO (R) and CINAHL (R). Using random-effects meta-analyses, the prevalence of elevated anxiety symptoms and disorders were estimated. A narrative review on the risk factors associated with elevated anxiety symptoms and disorders was presented.
   Results: From 4941 articles, 61 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of anxiety disorders (9 studies, n = 1071) among CKD patients across studies was 19% while that of elevated anxiety symptoms (52 studies, n =10,739) was 43%. Across continents, prevalence of elevated anxiety symptoms was highest in Europe and Asia. Between pre-dialysis and dialysis patients, the prevalence of elevated anxiety symptoms was not statisti-cally different at 31% and 42% respectively. Common risk factors associated with elevated anxiety symptoms included concomitant depression, lower parathyroid hormone levels, increased comorbidities, increased duration of hospitalization, reduced perceived quality of life, and decreased vitality levels.
   Conclusion: Given the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and elevated anxiety symptoms, more studies are required to assess the role and outcomes of anxiety screening among CKD patients. This could facilitate early identification of at-risk patients and potentially improve their clinical outcomes.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This scoping review provides a summary of current evidence on the mental health consequences of COVID on HCWs.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted searching PubMed and Embase for articles relevant to mental health conditions among HCWs during COVID-19. Relevant articles were screened and extracted to summarize key outcomes and findings.
   Results: A total of fifty-one studies were included in this review. Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychological trauma, insomnia and sleep quality, workplace burnout and fatigue, and distress were the main outcomes reviewed. Most studies found a high number of symptoms endorsed for depression, anxiety, and other conditions. We found differences in symptoms by sex, age, and HCW role, with female, younger-aged, frontline workers, and non-physician workers being affected more than other subgroups.
   Conclusion: This review highlights the existing burden of mental health conditions reported by HCWs during COVID-19. It also demonstrates emerging disparities among affected HCW subgroups. This scoping review emphasizes the importance of generating high quality evidence and developing informed interventions for HCW mental health with a focus on LMICs.

AB  - The number of psychiatric patients requesting Euthanasia or Assisted Suicide (EAS) continues to increase. The aims of this systematic review were to: 1) describe the available data related to psychiatric patients having received or requesting EAS (pEAS) for each country in which is allowed; 2) and describe the ethically salient points that arise.
   PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases were searched to identify articles published up to September 2020. Among the retrieved publications, only studies on pEAS cases (pEAS-C), pEAS requests, or physician reports/attitude towards pEAS reporting some quantitative data on patients having received or requesting pEAS were retained. Among the 24 included studies, thirteen (54%) were about pEAS in the Netherlands, four (17%) in Belgium, and seven (29%) in Switzerland. Results were different across different countries. In the Netherlands, pEAS-C were mostly women (70-77%) and often had at least two psychiatric disorders (56-97%). Mood disorders were mainly represented (55-70%) together with personality disorders (52-54%). History of suicide attempts was present in 34-52%. Moreover, 37-62% of them had at least one comorbid medical condition. In Belgium pEAS-C were mostly women (75%), but the majority (71%) had a single diagnosis, mood disorder. In Switzerland available data were less detailed.
   As pEAS-C seem to be very similar to 'traditional suicides', pEAS procedures should be carefully revised to establish specific criteria of access and guidelines of evaluation of the request. A deeper focus on unbearable suffering, decision capacity and possibilities of improvements is warranted as well as the involvement of mental health professionals.

AB  - An increasing number of studies examined the potential effects of ambient particulate matter (PM: PM2.5 and PM10-PMs with diameters not greater than 2.5 and 10 mu m, respectively) pollution on the risk of depression and suicide; however, the results have been inconclusive. This study aimed to determine the overall relationship between PM exposure and depression/suicide based on current evidence. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of current available studies. Thirty articles (20 for depression and 10 for suicide) with data from 1,447,313 participants were included in the meta-analysis. For a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in short-term exposure to PM2.5, we found a 2% (p < 0.001) increased the risk of depression and a 2% (p = 0.001) increased risk of suicide. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with a more apparent increase of 18% (p = 0.005) in depression risk. In addition, a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in short-term exposure to PM10 was associated with a 2% (p = 0.003) increase in depression risk and a 1% (p = 0.002) increase in suicide risk. Subgroup analyses showed that associations between PM and depression were more apparent in people over 65 years and from developed regions. Besides, the study design and study quality might also have an impact on their associations. The meta-analysis found that an increase in ambient PM concentration was strongly associated with an increased risk of depression and suicide, and the associations for depression appeared stronger for smaller particles (PM2.5) and at a long-term time pattern.

AB  - The heterogeneous class of what we nowadays call antipsychotics was born almost 70 years ago with the serendipitous discovery of chlorpromazine. Their utilization is constantly growing because they are used to treat a diverse group of diseases and patients across all age groups: schizophrenia, bipolar disease, depression, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia, among others. They possess a complex pharmacological profile, acting on multiple receptors: dopaminergic, serotoninergic, histaminergic, adrenergic, and cholinergic, leading scientists to call them "agents with rich pharmacology" or "dirty drugs". Serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, histamine and their respective receptors are evolutionary ancient compounds, and as such, are found in many different living beings in the environment.
   Antipsychotics do not disappear once excreted by patient's urine or faeces and are transported to wastewater treatment plants. But as these plant's technology is not designed to eliminate drugs and their metabolites, a variable proportion of the administered dose ends up in the environment, where they have been found in almost every matrix: municipal wastewater, hospital sewage, rivers, lakes, sea and even drinking water.
   We believe that reported concentrations found in the environment might be high enough to exert significant effect to aquatic wildlife. Besides, recent studies suggest antipsychotics, among others, are very likely bioaccumulating through the web food. Crucially, psychotropics may provoke behavioural changes affecting populations' dynamics at lower concentrations.
   We believe that so far, antipsychotics have not received the attention they deserve with regards to drug pollution, and that their role as environmental pollutants has been underrated. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The long-term effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not well understood. This rapid review was aimed at synthesizing evidence on the long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection among survivors. We considered both randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies eligible for inclusion in this review. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database. The reference lists of all the included studies were also searched. Two authors independently screened the search outputs and reviewed full texts of potentially eligible articles. Data extraction was done by one author and checked by a second author. A meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity among the included studies. Results are presented narratively. Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria. All these studies were conducted in high-income countries. Study findings demonstrate that COVID-19 survivors can experience persistent symptoms after recovering from their initial illness, especially among previously hospitalized persons. The majority of symptoms reported were fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and sleep disorders. Mental conditions, such as depression and anxiety disorders, were also reported. In conclusion, this study showed that COVID-19 survivors can experience persistent symptoms after recovering from their initial illness. Therefore, there is a need for a long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients and rehabilitation services for survivors. More research is needed in this area, especially in Africa.

AB  - Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic affects maternal health both directly and indirectly, and direct and indirect effects are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an emergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates. Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing of pregnant people. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence.
   Results: The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included. Pregnant individuals were found to be at a heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more likely to lose their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands.
   Conclusion: Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences. High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced significant struggles. Further resources should be directed towards quality epidemiological studies.
   Plain English summary: The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through infection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic circumstances. The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review. Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine and breastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely. The guidelines for labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty and unnecessary harm. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries. The social and economic impact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked. A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries. This likely reflects an increase in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking. Domestic violence appeared to spike.
   Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to epidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and more focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed.

AB  - When stress becomes chronic it can trigger lasting brain and behavioral changes including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). There is conflicting evidence regarding whether acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) may have antidepressant properties. In a recent publication, we demonstrated a strong dose-dependency of the effect of AChEIs on antidepressant-related behavior in the mouse forced swim test: whereas the AChEI donepezil indeed promotes depression-like behavior at a high dose, it has antidepressant-like properties at lower doses in the same experiment. Our data therefore suggest a Janus-faced dose-response curve for donepezil in depression-related behavior. In this review, we investigate the mood-related properties of AChEIs in greater detail, focusing on both human and rodent studies. In fact, while there have been many studies showing pro-depressant activity by AChEIs and this is a major concept in the field, a variety of other studies in both humans and rodents show antidepressant effects. Our study was one of the first to systematically vary dose to include very low concentrations while measuring behavioral effects, potentially explaining the apparent disparate findings in the field. The possibility of antidepressant roles for AChEIs in rodents may provide hope for new depression treatments. Importantly, MDD is a psychosocial stress-linked disorder, and in rodents, stress is a major experimental manipulation for studying depression mechanisms, so an important future direction will be to determine the extent to which these depression-related effects are stress-sensitive. In sum, gaining a greater understanding of the potentially therapeutic mood-related effects of low dose AChEIs, both in rodent models and in human subjects, should be a prioritized topic in ongoing translational research.

AB  - Introduction: Five to 10 percentage of fathers experience perinatal depression and 5-15% experience perinatal anxiety, with rates increasing when mothers are also experiencing perinatal mental health disorders. Perinatal mental illness in either parent contributes to adverse child and family outcomes. While there are increasing calls to assess the mental health of both parents, universal services (e.g., maternity) and specialist perinatal mental health services usually focus on the mother (i.e., the gestational parent). The aim of this review was to identify and synthesize evidence on the performance of mental health screening tools and the acceptability of mental health assessment, specifically in relation to fathers, other co-parents and partners in the perinatal period.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Maternity, and Infant Care Database and CINAHL). Articles were eligible if they included expectant or new partners, regardless of the partner's gender or relationship status. Accuracy was determined by comparison of screening tool with diagnostic interview. Acceptability was predominantly assessed through parents' and health professionals' perspectives. Narrative synthesis was applied to all elements of the review, with thematic analysis applied to the acceptability studies.
   Results: Seven accuracy studies and 20 acceptability studies were included. The review identified that existing evidence focuses on resident fathers and assessing depression in universal settings. All accuracy studies assessed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale but with highly varied results. Evidence on acceptability in practice is limited to postnatal settings. Amongst both fathers and health professionals, views on assessment are mixed. Identified challenges were categorized at the individual-, practitioner- and service-level. These include: gendered perspectives on mental health; the potential to compromise support offered to mothers; practitioners' knowledge, skills, and confidence; service culture and remit; time pressures; opportunity for contact; and the need for tools, training, supervision and onward referral routes.
   Conclusion: There is a paucity of published evidence on assessing the mental health of fathers, co-mothers, step-parents and other partners in the perinatal period. Whilst practitioners need to be responsive to mental health needs, further research is needed with stakeholders in a range of practice settings, with attention to ethical and practical considerations, to inform the implementation of evidence-based assessment.

AB  - Objective: This study is a meta-analysis that considers the association between dyadic coping and emotional functioning, and between dyadic coping and the quality of the relationship as perceived by cancer patients and their life partners.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect and those peer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudinal studies published up until April 2020 that investigated these relationships were selected.
   Results: A total of 1,168 studies were identified, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria (N = 1,727 couples). These evidenced statistically significant positive relationships between common dyadic coping and emotional functioning and between common dyadic coping and the quality of the relationship as perceived by patients and their partners. There was also a statistically significant positive association between stress communication (by oneself), supportive dyadic coping (by oneself and by partner), and the quality of the relationship. In addition, a statistically significant negative association was found between negative dyadic coping (by oneself and by partner) and the quality of the relationship as perceived by patients' partners and also between negative dyadic coping (by oneself) and the quality of the relationship as perceived by patients.
   Conclusions: The results suggest the existence of a significant association between dyadic coping and emotional functioning and between dyadic coping and the quality of the relationship as perceived by members of couples facing cancer. However, these results must be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies included in the analysis. Clinically, an understanding of the existence of such relationships is helpful for the implementation, and study of the effectiveness of, interventions aimed at improving dyadic coping in order to improve both quality of life and quality of relationship in couples where there is an oncological diagnosis.

AB  - What are the main learning difficulties or advantages encountered by students with learning disabilities (LDs) within e-environments? As a result of the Covid-19 emergency, e-learning is being increasingly used to support students' learning processes. A number of countries closed their schools altogether, so face-to-face lessons were and have been replaced by distance lessons. A search of current literature via Scopus, Eric and Google Scholar electronic databases was conducted according to Prisma Guidelines. Other sources of literature were also considered, starting from the references in the full text of the articles consulted. We used the following search keywords: "LDs" combined with the "AND/OR" Boolean operator and "e-learning platforms," "well-being," "psychological factors," "emotional distress," and "self-regulation." One body of literature highlights the lack of inclusive accessibility standards and a lack of attention to specific tools for addressing LDs, which causes students to develop high levels of stress/anxiety and emotional distress, in addition to low levels of well-being, self-esteem and self-efficacy. Another area of literature looks at how students can develop high levels of self-regulation and emotional awareness, as well as high levels of inclusion. Results are discussed in terms of the promotion of e-learning that focuses on the psychological well-being of students and teachers use of technological tools.

AB  - The risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) is considerably increased in young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This review explores ADHD-specific neurocognitive impairments as possible underlying mechanisms for ADHD-depression comorbidity. Two systematic literature searches were conducted in EBSCOhost, PubMED, and Cochrane Reviews databases according to PRISMA guidelines. The first search identified 18 meta-analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on cognitive dysfunctions in MDD across the lifespan. The second search identified six original studies on reaction time variability in MDD. During acute depression, children and adults showed cognitive deficits that overlapped with some of the ADHD-related impairments. Findings from remitted patients, high-risk individuals, and few prospective studies suggest that a subset of these shared impairments, specifically executive dysfunctions (selective attention, verbal fluency, working memory) and long-term memory problems, are candidate pre-existing risk markers of depression. We discuss if and how these specific neurocognitive mechanisms may mediate developmental pathways from ADHD to depression. If replicated by longitudinal studies, these findings may guide future prevention strategies.

AB  - Many reports have shown a strong association between exposure to neurotoxic air pollutants like heavy metal and particulate matter (PM) as an active participant and neurological disorders. While the effects of these toxic pollutants on cardiopulmonary morbidity have principally been studied, growing evidence has shown that exposure to polluted air is associated with memory impairment, communication deficits, and anxiety/depression among all ages. So, these toxic pollutants in the environment increase the risk of neurodegenerative disease, ischemia, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The precise mechanisms in which air pollutants lead to communicative inability, social inability, and declined cognition have remained unknown. Various animal model studies show that amyloid precursor protein (APP), processing, oxidant/antioxidant balance, and inflammation pathways change following the exposure to constituents of polluted air. In the present review study, we collect the probable molecular mechanisms of deleterious CNS effects in response to various air pollutants.

AB  - Evidence about the association between maternal mental health disorders and stillbirth and infant mortality is limited and conflicting. We aimed to examine whether maternal prenatal mental health disorders are associated with stillbirth and/or infant mortality. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus were searched for studies examining the association of any maternal prenatal (occurring before or during pregnancy) mental health disorder(s) and stillbirth or infant mortality. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the I-2 statistic. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Of 4487 records identified, 28 met our inclusion criteria with 27 contributing to the meta-analyses. Over 60% of studies examined stillbirth and 54% of them evaluated neonatal or infant mortality. Thirteen studies investigated the association between maternal depression and anxiety and stillbirth/infant mortality, pooled OR, 1.42 (95% CI, 1.16-1.73; I-2, 76.7%). Another 13 studies evaluated the association between severe maternal mental illness and stillbirth/infant mortality, pooled OR, 1.47 (95% CI, 1.28-1.68; I-2, 62.3%). We found similar results for the association of any maternal mental health disorders and stillbirth/infant mortality (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.43-1.77) and in subgroup analyses according to types of fetal/infant mortality. We found no significant evidence of publication bias. Maternal prenatal mental health disorders appear to be associated with a moderate increase in the risk of stillbirth and infant mortality, although the mechanisms are unclear. Efforts to prevent and treat these disorders may reduce the scale of stillbirth/infant deaths.

AB  - This narrative review examines current academic literature on the mental health of Filipino seafarers working internationally, including the mental health effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Framed within a rights-based approach, it aims to identify and analyse emerging themes on Filipino seafarers' mental health literature to understand what these studies potentially mean for the improvement of seafarers' education on mental health. Based on a broad selection criteria, 28 eligible papers demonstrate collectively three key findings: firstly, there is paucity in published research on seafarers' mental health; secondly, the majority of published studies are associated with a recent piracy crisis, where a significant number of mariners were attacked, taken as hostages, or killed; thirdly, three key areas emerged under which research on Filipino seafarers' mental health can be organized: the medical repatriation of seafarers, system of care for the mental health of seafarers including the diagnostic standards used, and seafarers' experiences and conceptions of mental health including the mental health effects of COVID-19.
   Though the bulk of the current understanding of the mental health problems is associated with piracy, several risk factors for which the quality of quantitative and qualitative evidence are patchy. The few sources of primary data to date lack focus on mental health needs which makes it difficult to grasp the extent of the problem. Developing policies and programmes for the promotion of mental health through mental health education among seafarers is important for a couple of reasons. Seafaring remains a dangerous and socially isolating occupation where work-related accidents are likely and will be potentially traumatic to mariners. Research on occupational stressors is increasingly providing evidence of their contributions to poor mental health outcomes among seafarers. Thus, mental health education of seafarers in the context of their work is important for proactive training and development.

AB  - Health risk factors such as tobacco smoking, inadequate fruit intake, inadequate vegetable intake, risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, obesity, anxiety and depression often commence during adolescence and young adulthood. Vocational education institutions enrol many students in these age groups making them an important setting for addressing multiple health risk factors. This systematic review examined (i) co-occurrence of health risk factors, (ii) clustering of health risk factors, and (iii) socio-demographic characteristics associated with co-occurrence and/or clusters of health risks among vocational education students. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus were searched to identify eligible studies published by 30 June 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tool. Five studies assessed co-occurrence and three studies clustering of health risks. Co-occurrence of health risk factors ranged from 29-98% and clustering of alcohol use and tobacco smoking was commonly reported. The findings were mixed about whether gender and age were associated with co-occurrence or clustering of health risks. There is limited evidence examining co-occurrence and clustering of health risk factors in vocational education students. Comprehensive assessment of how all these health risks co-occur or cluster in vocational education students is required.

AB  - This article provides a systematic review of existing research on problematic smartphone use (PSU) to guide other researchers in search of relevant studies, and to propose areas for future research. In total, 293 studies were analyzed leading to the development of an overview model in the field of PSU, presenting findings on demographic factors, explanations for smartphone use and why this use becomes problematic, consequences of PSU, and how such use can be corrected. In addition, we considered in which contexts, with which methods, and with which theoretical lenses this stream of research has been studied to date. Smartphone use is most often explained by the smartphone design, and users' emotional health and their ability to control smartphone use. Our review suggests that people who are young, female, and highly educated are more prone to PSU. Emotional health issues are the most frequently identified consequence of PSU. Strategies for correcting PSU fall into three categories: information-enhancing, capacity-enhancing, and behavior reinforcement strategies. The studies on PSU are most often conducted using quantitative surveys with university and college participants considering their personal smartphone use. Whereas a variety of theoretical frameworks have been adopted to investigate PSU, they are often related to identifying factors explaining use and problematic use, and more seldom to analyze the findings. A future research agenda for PSU is proposed consisting of seven key research questions which can be investigated by researchers going forward.

AB  - In low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), emerging digital mental health interventions should be accompanied by regular and comprehensive assessment of available scientific evidence. This review aims to support efforts to monitor progress in digital mental health research, ensuring new evidence can guide researchers, clinicians, policymakers and program managers positioned to adopt and implement these digitally enabled treatments. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, an electronic database search from 2016 to 2020 yielded 37 digital intervention studies for detection, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and/or management of a broad range of mental disorders in 13 LMICs. This date range was selected to update previous reviews. Most studies involved online interventions and many reported feasibility and acceptability, reflected by participant satisfaction or program adherence. About half the studies (N = 23) reported clinical benefits based on changes in mental health. For depression and mood disorders, some digital interventions showed improvements in depressive symptoms, quality of life, treatment adherence, and recovery. However, sample sizes were small and studies focused primarily on adults. Further limiting generalizability was the lack of consistency in clinical assessment and measurement tools between studies. No studies reported worsening symptoms, negative acceptability or dissatisfaction with digital interventions, suggesting possible publication bias. While digital interventions show promise, it remains difficult to conclude that digital interventions are effective from these studies, as it is prudent to exercise caution before drawing conclusions about clinical effectiveness. This review reflects continued growth in digital mental health research in LMICs and further highlights the need for rigorous evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Background: Numerous systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses on non-genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD) development have been published with inconsistent conclusions.
   Objective: This overview of SRs aimed to summarize evidence on non-genetic factors for the development of PD from the published SRs, and explore the reasons behind the conflicting results.
   Methods: Three international databases were searched for SRs with meta-analyses summarized evidence on non-genetic factors for PD development. The Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 tool was used to appraise the methodological quality of included SRs. Pooled effect estimations were extracted from each meta-analysis.
   Results: Forty-six SRs covered six categories, and more than 80 factors were included in this overview. Thirty-nine SRs (84.7%) were judged to be of critically low methodological quality. Evidence from prospective studies showed that physical activity, smoking, coffee, caffeine, tea, fat intake, ibuprofen use, calcium channel blocker use, statin use, thiazolidinediones, and high serum urate levels significantly reduced the risk of PD, while dairy intake, diabetes, hormone replacement therapy, depression, mood disorder, bipolar disorder, and aspirin use significantly increased the risk of PD. Differences in study designs (e.g., cohort studies, case-control studies) accounted for the conflicting results among included SRs.
   Conclusion: Modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity and tea and coffee drinking may reduce the risk of PD, which may offer PD prevention strategies and hypotheses for future research. However, the designs of primary studies on PD risk factors and related SRs need to be improved and harmonized.

AB  - Healthcare professionals are exposed not only to the ubiquitous stress, but also to the culture of perfectionism. Therefore, they need tools to achieve a balance between work and rest in order to effectively help their patients. The study objective is a review of the literature on the implementation of mindfulness in healthcare professionals and medical students. The authors searched the literature in PubMed and Google Scholar databases for publications about "mindfulness" in "healthcare professionals" and "medical students." The search included manuscripts published to July 31, 2019. Mindfulness is a process of intentional paying attention to experiencing the present moment with curiosity, openness and acceptance of each experience without judgment. Mindfulness training leads to a better mood perception, lower stress perception, and responding to stimuli more effectively. All these features can have a potentially positive effect on healthcare service. The paper describes methods of intervention as well as their effects, which may be useful both in maintaining the well-being of healthcare professionals and in patient care. Mindfulness meditation has a beneficial effect on stress, depression, burnout, well-being and empathy among doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers. However, the method has a number of limitations, including a small number of participants, a high dropout rate in the intervention group and, above all, ceasing to practice mindfulness in the longer term after the course termination. Mindfulness can be widely implemented by healthcare professionals, thus improving their well-being and the quality of care they provide. Further standard scientific research is needed to confirm this impact.

AB  - Background: Accurate measurement of mental health disorders in conflict-affected populations is crucial for improving mental health care for these populations. Most studies to develop mental health questionnaires for conflict-affected populations are conducted in high income countries despite the vast majority of conflict-affected populations residing in Low and Middle Income Countries (LAMICs). The aim of this systematic review is to assess the quality of questionnaires for mental disorders that have been either developed or validated in conflict- affected settings in LAMICs.
   Methods: A systematic review of 5 databases (CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) was conducted to identify validation studies for questionnaires measuring mental health disorders in adult conflict-affected population in LAMICs. Well-established psychometric criteria evaluating reliability, validity and responsiveness of questionnaires were applied for quality appraisal.
   Results: Thirty validation studies were included in this review, which reported on data for 33 questionnaires. Twenty-four were questionnaires that had been originally developed in different settings and adapted for use with a new conflict-affected population and 9 had been newly developed for the conflict-affected population being studied. Overall, there was high variability in the quality of evidence for the questionnaires with moderate evidence for the validity and reliability of included questionnaires but no responsiveness data reported.
   Conclusion: There has been increasing recognition of the particular importance of psychometrics in this field to facilitate the development of good quality mental health questionnaires suitable for use in LAMICs. However, this review highlighted the current limited quantity and quality of such questionnaires.

AB  - This study focuses on the mental health of undergraduate occupational therapy students through a scoping review, guided by the question: How does the scientific literature deal with issues related to the mental health of occupational therapy students? The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyzes extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist was used. Empirical and theoretical studies, published in English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese were included, with no determined time frame. The survey of the studies was carried out in the databases Scopus, Redalyc, Google Scholar, in the Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, resulting in the analysis of 15 studies. The content analysis of the articles delineated nuclei of meaning that indicated the performance of practical activities and the immersion of the student in the internship field as sources of stress and psychological suffering. In addition, studies indicate that occupational therapy students are more affected in their mental health, compared to students from other areas of health. The importance of investigating the causes underlying this student's psychological distress is emphasized, in addition to the need to consider variables such as gender and socioeconomic situation. It is considered that the study will contribute to the planning of strategies for the promotion of mental health, prevention of psychological distress, and care for these students, in addition to measures aimed at keeping this student at the university and concluding his course with quality.

AB  - Higher consumption of fruit and vegetables has been associated with a lower risk of various chronic diseases including coronary heart disease, obesity, and certain cancers. Recently, fruit and vegetable intake has also been linked with mental health, including depression; however, this area is largely unexplored studies in young people and adults. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the association between fruit and vegetable intake and depressive symptoms in young people and adults aged 15-45. The review used a predefined protocol registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (ID no: CRD42018091642). The systematic review focused on peer-reviewed cohort studies published from 1 January 2000 to 31 August 2020 using searches of six electronic databases. The exposure was fruit and vegetable consumption analysed both separately and/or together, and the outcome was depression or depressive symptoms. Data from eligible studies were extracted according to predefined criteria and the studies were appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies to evaluate for study quality and risk of bias. A total of 12 studies from seven countries were deemed eligible and included in the qualitative synthesis, one study was categorised as "very good" quality, nine studies were "good" quality, and two studies were "moderate" quality by the quality assessment based on the total score for the NOS. The majority of cohort studies support the evidence that fruit consumption is associated with decreased risk of developing depression. However, the inconsistent results were observed when the effects of vegetable consumption were analysed independently, and the effects of fruit and vegetables combined were analysed. Despite this, the evidence seems to be building that a possible association exists, and this may have implications for addressing the burden of mental illness in young people and adults aged 15-45 years. More well-designed prospective cohort studies are needed to provide more robust evidence on the relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and depression.

AB  - Replicated evidence has documented cognitive deficits in populations with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Approximately 40 % of patients with MDD present with impairment of one or more cognitive domains. As such, there is an unmet need to discover treatments that have pro-cognitive effects in TRD patients. Ketamine has demonstrated efficacy as a rapid-onset intervention for the treatment of depression. The objective of the current review was to assess the effects of ketamine on cognition in TRD patients. We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar and PsycINFO between database inception to March 24th, 2020.
   We identified five studies that evaluated cognition in TRD populations following ketamine treatment. All studies included a 0.5 mg/kg subanesthetic intravenous (IV) administration of ketamine. One study found significant improvements in complex (p = .008) and simple (p = .027) working memory and one study found improvements in visual learning memory following IV ketamine infusions (p = .014). Improvements in speed of processing and verbal learning memory were observed in anxious TRD participants only. Importantly, a sub anesthetic dose of IV ketamine does not worsen cognitive function.

AB  - Objective Extensive research has demonstrated high prevalences of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression (MD) in war-surviving populations. However, absolute estimates are lacking, which may additionally inform policy making, research and healthcare. We aimed at estimating the absolute global prevalence and disease burden of adult survivors of recent wars (1989-2019) affected by PTSD and/or MD. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis of interview-based epidemiological surveys assessing the prevalence of PTSD and/or MD in representative samples from countries with a recent war history (1989-2019). Drawing on the war definition and geo-referenced data of the Uppsala Conflict Database Programme and population estimates of the United Nations for 2019, we extrapolated the meta-analytic results to absolute global numbers of affected people. Drawing on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) data of the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019, we further calculated the PTSD-associated and MD-associated DALYs. Results Twenty-two surveys (N=15 420) for PTSD, 13 surveys for MD (N=9836) and six surveys on the comorbidity of PTSD and MD (N=1131) were included. Random effects meta-analyses yielded point prevalences of 26.51% for PTSD and 23.31% for MD. Of those affected by PTSD, 55.26% presented with comorbid MD. Prevalence rates were not significantly associated with war intensity and length, time since war, response rate or survey quality. The extrapolation yielded 316 million adult war-survivors globally who suffered from PTSD and/or MD in 2019. War-survivors were almost exclusively living in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) and carried a burden of 3 105 387 and 4 083 950 DALYs associated with PTSD and MD, respectively. Conclusions Since LMICs lack sufficient funding and qualified professionals to provide evidence-based psychological treatments for such large numbers of affected people, alternative and scalable strategies using existing resources in primary care and communities are required. Research is required to assist upscaling.

AB  - Objectives Gratitude intervention, which requires participants to engage regularly in brief activities designed to cultivate a sense of gratefulness, is known as one of the most effective positive psychological interventions. Although numerous meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been conducted on gratitude intervention, no studies have focused on the working population. This study aimed to systematically summarize the effectiveness of gratitude interventions on workers' mental health and well-being. Methods Systematic search was conducted in February 2021 using five databases. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials implementing gratitude activities among healthy workers and measuring mental health or well-being indicators and original articles or thesis in English. Results Nine out of 1957 articles met the inclusion criteria. Eight studies adopted gratitude list interventions, showing a significant improvement in perceived stress and depression; however, the effects on well-being were inconsistent. Interventions with gratitude list four times or less did not report significant changes in any outcomes. Conclusions Most gratitude interventions incorporated a gratitude list, and some studies included gratitude activities as a part of the combined program. On the other hand, no studies focused on only behavioral gratitude expression among workers. Gratitude interventions might be effective in improving mental health, but their effects on well-being remain unclear. The total number of gratitude lists and reflections might influence the effect on mental health and well-being; however, due to the high heterogeneity of the studies, further studies are needed.

AB  - Background Common mental disorders (CMDs) are highly prevalent conditions that constitute a major public health and economic burden on society in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite the increased demand for economic evidence to support resource allocation for scaled-up implementation of mental health services in these contexts, economic evaluations of psychological treatments for CMDs remain scarce. Objective The proposed systematic review aims to synthesize findings on methods and outcomes of economic evaluations of psychological treatments for CMDs in LMICs and appraise quality. Methods We will identify, select, and extract data from published economic evaluations of psychological interventions for CMDs conducted in LMICs. We will search bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, EconLit, PsycINFO, Africa-Wide Information, Cochrane library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry), and the African Journals Online (AJOL) and Google Scholar platforms. Only full economic evaluations (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), Cost-Consequence Analysis (CCA), or Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)) of psychological treatments for CMDs (defined as depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders) conducted in LMICs will be included. There will be no restrictions based on date of publication, perspective, follow-up duration or sample size. Data extraction will be guided by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Results The results presented will be examined using a narrative synthesis approach. The quality of included studies will be assessed using the Drummond & Jefferson checklist. Conclusion The fledgling evidence base in this area provides an opportunity to promote improved economic evaluation methods in line with repeated calls for economic evidence alongside effectiveness evidence in these settings. A rigorously developed economic evaluation evidence base will support resource allocation decisions for scaled up implementation of psychological interventions in LMIC settings.

AB  - Objective Electro-convulsive therapy (ECI) has been established as a treatment modality for patients with treatment-resistant depression and with some specific subtypes of depression. This narrative review intends to provide psychiatrists with the latest findings on the use of ECT in depression, devided into total eight sub-topics.
   Methods We searched PubMed for English-language articles using combined keywords and tried to analyze journals published from 1995-2020.
   Results Pharmacotherapy such as antidepressants or maintenance ECT is more effective than a placebo as prevention of recurrence after ECT. The use of ECT in treatment-resistant depression, depressed patients with suicidal risks, elderly depression, bipolar depression, psychotic depression, and depression during pregnancy or postpartum have therapeutic benefits. As possible mechanisms of ECT, the role of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and other findings in the field of neurophysiology, neuro-immunology, and neurogenesis are also supported.
   Conclusion ECT is evolving toward reducing cognitive side effects and maximizing therapeutic effects. If robust evidence for ECT through randomized controlled studies are more established and the mechanism of Ecr gets further clarified, the scope of its use in the treatment of depression will be more expanded in the future.

AB  - Suicidal risk assessment is still a major challenge not only in psychiatric practice. Clinical investigation of suicidality can be significantly improved by using standardized scales for assessing suicide risk. The choice of a method for assessing suicidality also has significant implications for the search of valid available biomarker of suicidal behavior, where a less complex suicidality assessment procedure yields inaccurate results. This article offers an overview and analyzes in detail clinical studies of suicidality by electrophysiological methods since 2005 to 5/2020, especially in connection with presumed pathophysiological mechanism of the suicidal brain" and the chosen method of sucidality assessment. Electrophysiological methods such as quantitative electroencephalography indicators, event-related potential, loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential, polysomnography and heart rate variability offer a robust battery of easily available methods for assessing impaired emotional regulation. Nowadays it is unfortunately very difficult to point out the optimal electrophysiological examination of suicidal behaviour because of conflicting conclusion of presented studies which have been probably caused by various suicidal risk assessments, not always available data on affecting medication prior to testing and small samples of suicidal participants among studies. The most consistent and hopeful results are presented by evaluation of theta power by quantitative electroencephalography, although there are also few conflicting conclusions. The authors of this paper believe that this article could be good starting point for further research of electrophysiological methods in the field of suicidality.

AB  - Background Diabetes is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This systematic review aims to explore the work-related factors among people with diabetes in developing CVD. Methods Four electronic databases were searched on 1 February 2021 using a comprehensive search strategy without any time restriction. Two independent researchers screened the articles and extracted data. The risk of bias was assessed independently using the risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomized studies (RoBANS). A narrative synthesis was conducted considering the heterogeneity of the included articles. Results A total of five articles incorporating 4 409 810 participants from three geographic regions were included that highlights the research gap. As per the included studies, Occupational drivers with diabetes were at a higher risk of CVD in comparison to the nondrivers, workers with diabetes having a long working hour were at a higher risk of CVD mortality, workers with a lower occupational status were at a higher risk of 10-years stroke risk, and occupational physical activity and occupational commuting lowered the risk of CVD deaths. Conclusions This systematic review summarized the available evidence on work-related factors influencing the risk of CVD in people with diabetes. The findings should be interpreted cautiously pondering the limited evidence and imprecision. We identified only five articles related to the topic, and there were no studies from Japan. The scarcity of studies on work-related factors on the prognosis of diabetic patients implies the need for more research in this field. We recommend further exploration of the topic designing primary studies.

AB  - Stress is the most predominant and worldwide psychological human condition that undoubtedly impedes the state of mind of the individuals. During the last few years, a tremendous change and growth in the global publishing trend for human stress have been observed. Like other professionals (doctors, bankers, teachers, and businessmen), the mariners or seafarers are also being the most common victims of this human psychological disorder (stress) these days. The keywords "seafarer" and "stress" have been exposed to mine the research trend of the articles exploring the stress among the seafarers. From 2001 to 2020, more than six thousand (6211) human stress-based articles have been reported in Scopus indexing database. However, the number of articles related to the stress among seafarer is 136 only i.e. 2.18% of the human-stress based articles. The research related to the psychological disorder (stress) among seafarer has been increased during the last two decades. Germany, United Kingdom and Italy found to be the topmost countries for exploring the stress among the seafarer. The study concluded that the human psychological conditions like bulimia, anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, generalised anxiety disorder, cyclothymia, mood, conduct, and personality disorders along with stress still need to be extensively mined to diagnose the state of mind of seafarers.

AB  - Background: Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a neuroinvasive potential, which has been discussed in various research papers. During the current pandemic, the novel CoV, i.e., SARS-CoV-2, is causing a considerable number of fatalities and posing a great danger of a recurrent epidemic. COVID-19 has been labeled as a public health emergency of international concern, and the epidemic curves are on the rise. Purpose: Some studies discuss the neurological implications of SARS-CoV-2 but in light of growing number of evidences we cannot ignore the planning of mental health care settings in COVID-19. We are discussing how this novel CoV can affect the human brain directly and indirectly, including psychiatric problems, and how neurological conditions can be explored as a diagnostic tool in COVID-19 by analyzing cohort studies and review papers that discuss the recent neurological findings in COVID-19. Method: Current research and review papers were searched to find out any relation between the COVID-19 disease and the altered mental health. This study attempts to find out neurological symptoms in a large population affected by COVID-19 and thus filtering out individual case reports and cohort studies which have a patient pool of less than 50. Results: This unique observation revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has direct neurological manifestations such as anosmia and gustatory impairment, encephalopathy, and seizures as well as an indirect effect on the psychiatric health such as anxiety, amnesia, etc. because of psychosocial stress. Conclusion: The most commonly reported neurological symptoms should not be ignored and must be tested for COVID-19. More neurological studies like medical imaging and neuropathology should be performed on these COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Objective: High levels of depression and anxiety are experienced alongside Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Psychological causal and maintenance factors are not well-understood. Perfectionism is a multifactorial, transdiagnostic risk factor for various physical and mental health conditions. This systematic review assesses the association between perfectionism and depression and/or anxiety in people with CFS/ME.
   Method: Systematic literature searches used a combination of terms for 'perfectionism', 'depression', 'anxiety' and 'CFS/ME'. Peer-reviewed English-language papers reporting quantitative data regarding the relationship between perfectionism and depression and/or anxiety in adults (aged 18-65 years) with a clinical diagnosis of CFS/ME were included. Screening, selection and assessment of risk of bias was completed independently by two authors. Bivariate and multivariate associations between perfectionism and anxiety and depression were extracted. Data were synthesised narratively.
   Results: Seven studies, reported in eight papers, were included. Seven examined the relationship between perfectionism and depression. Moderate-strong significant positive associations were found between depression and maladaptive perfectionism (r = 0.42 to .48, p < .01), and its component factors of concern over mistakes (r = 0.40 to .60, p < .01) and doubts about actions (r = 0.51 to .60, p < .01). Methodological limitations included sample size justification and selection, psychometric measures, and control of potential confounders.
   Conclusion: Maladaptive perfectionism is consistently associated with depression in patients with CFS/ME. The relationship between perfectionism and anxiety is under-researched. Corroboration is required from longitudinal, cross-cultural studies. Clinical understanding may be increased through examining the interplay between maladaptive perfectionism, depression and anxiety and the physical and cognitive symptoms of CFS/ME.

AB  - Background: Stress can frequently occur in the driving context. Its cognitive effects can be deleterious and lead to uncomfortable or risky situations. While stress detection in this context is well developed, regulation using dedicated advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) is still emergent.
   Objectives: This systematic review focuses on stress regulation strategies that can be qualified as "subtle" or "mindless": the technology employed to perform regulation does not interfere with an ongoing task. The review goal is 2-fold: establishing the state of the art on such technological implementation in the driving context and identifying complementary technologies relying on subtle regulation that could be applied in driving.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted using search operators previously identified through a concept analysis. The patents and scientific studies selected provide an overview of actual and potential mindless technology implementations. These are then analyzed from a scientific perspective. A classification of results was performed according to the different stages of emotion regulation proposed by the Gross model.
   Results: A total of 47 publications were retrieved, including 21 patents and 26 studies. Six of the studies investigated mindless stress regulation in the driving context. Patents implemented strategies mostly linked to attentional deployment, while studies tended to investigate response modulation strategies.
   Conclusions: This review allowed us to identify several ADAS relying on mindless computing technologies to reduce stress and better understand the underlying mechanisms allowing stress reduction. Further studies are necessary to better grasp the effect of mindless technologies on driving safety. However, we have established the feasibility of their implementation as ADAS and proposed directions for future research in this field.

AB  - Crisis events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can have a devastating effect on communities and the care professionals within them. Over recent years, arts-based interventions have helped in a wide range of crisis situations, being recommended to support the workforce during and after complex crisis but there has been no systematic review of the role of arts-based crisis interventions and whether there are cogent themes regarding practice elements and outcomes. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review to (i) define the arts-based change process used during and after crisis events, and (ii) explore the perceptions of intermediate and long-term mental health benefits of arts-based interventions for professionals in caring roles. Our search yielded six studies (all qualitative). All data were thematically aggregated and meta-synthesized, revealing seven practice elements (a safe place, focusing on strengths and protective factors, developing psychosocial competencies to support peers, emotional expression and processing, identifying and naming the impact of the crisis, using an integrative creative approach, and cultural and organizational sensitivity) applied across all six studies, as well as a range of intermediate and long-term benefits shared common features (adapting, growing, and recovering; using the community as a healing resource; reducing or preventing symptoms of stress or trauma reactions, psychophysiological homeostasis). The ways in which these studies were designed independently from one another and yet used the same practice elements in their crisis interventions indicates that there is comparability about how and why the arts-based practice elements are being used and to what effect. Our findings provide a sound basis and meaningful parameters for future research incorporating quantitative and qualitative approaches to firmly establish the effectiveness of art-based interventions, and how arts can support cultural sensitivity, acceptability and indicated outcomes, particularly those relating to stress and trauma during or following a crisis.

AB  - Background The impact of COVID-19 towards psychology and mental health is anticipated to be significant and may affect the population disproportionately, especially adolescent as the vulnerable category. We aimed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 towards adolescents' mental health. Main body A systematic search was conducted from Cochrane, Google Scholar, Scielo, and PubMed. Inclusion criteria included all types of studies which observed the effect of COVID-19 and its related causes, such as lockdown, on adolescents' mental health. All studies were assessed for its level of evidence according to Oxford 2011 criteria and Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Three studies (Secer and Ulas, Int J Ment Health Addict: 1-14, 2020; Zhou et al., Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry 29:749-58, 2020; Qu et al., Lancet: 1-17, 2020) showed that COVID-19 was a risk factor for mental health problems in adolescents while Oosterhoff et al. (J Adolesc Health 67: 179-185, 2020) showed that adolescents who preferred to stay at home during this pandemic reported less anxiety and depressive symptoms Conclusion COVID-19 has been found to be associated with mental health changes in adolescents which meant management of COVID-19 should also focus on mental health as well.

Methods PubMed, PsychInfo, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Searches were restricted by date (2000 until present). All empirical quantitative and qualitative studies in which relaxation techniques of various types implemented on health care providers caring for patients during severe coronavirus pandemics and articles that consider the implementation of mental health care services considered to be pertinent, such as commentaries, were included. Results Fourteen studies met the selection criteria, most of which were recommendations. Only one study described a digital intervention, and user satisfaction was measured. In the recommendations, both organizational and individual self-care interventions were suggested. Conclusions Further research is necessary to establish tailor-made effective stress reduction interventions for this population, during these challenging and particular times.

AB  - The current worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has changed the modus operandi of all segments of society. While some pandemic-related stressors affect nearly everyone, many especially affect women. Purpose: To review what is known about the pandemic's effect on women's mental health, what makes them more predisposed to vulnerabilities and adverse impacts, and strategies for preventing and treating these mental health consequences in the female population during specific stages across the lifespan. Methods: The authors performed a narrative review in combination with their observations from clinical experience in the field of women's mental health and reproductive psychiatry. Articles on women's mental health and COVID-19 up to May 30, 2020, were searched using the electronic PubMed and PsychInfo databases, as well as publications by major health entities (e.g., World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations) and press releases from prime communication outlets (e.g., National Public Radio). Results and conclusions: Women who are pregnant, postpartum, miscarrying, or experiencing intimate partner violence are at especially high risk for developing mental health problems during the pandemic. Proactive outreach to these groups of women and enhancement of social supports could lead to prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment. Social support is a key protective factor. Similarly, parenting may be substantially more stressful during a pandemic. Gender disparities may be accentuated, particularly for employed women or single parents, as women are disproportionately responsible for the bulk of domestic tasks, including childcare and eldercare.

Although the main focus was on efficacy and safety, study characteristics, duration of antidepressants effects across studies, and the role of the subjective drug experiences were also reviewed and presented.
   Method A systematic literature search (1 Jan 2000 to 1 May 2020) was conducted in PubMed and PsychINFO for studies of patients undergoing treatment with a serotonergic psychedelic.
   Results Data from 16 papers, representing 10 independent psychedelic-assisted therapy trials (psilocybin = 7, ayahuasca = 2, LSD = 1), were extracted, presented in figures and tables, and narratively synthesized and discussed. Across these studies, a total of 188 patients suffering either cancer- or illness-related anxiety and depression disorders (C/I-RADD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or substance use disorder (SUD) were included. The reviewed studies established feasibility and evidence of safety, alongside promising early data of efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, OCD, and tobacco and alcohol use disorders. For a majority of patients, the therapeutic effects appeared to be long-lasting (weeks-months) after only 1 to 3 treatment session(s). All studies were conducted in line with guidelines for the safe conduct of psychedelic therapy, and no severe adverse events were reported.
   Conclusion The resurrection of clinical psychedelic research provides early evidence for treatment efficacy and safety for a range of psychiatric conditions, and constitutes an exciting new treatment avenue in a health area with major unmet needs.

AB  - Introduction
   Chronic diseases are common among African Americans, but the extent to which research has focused on addressing chronic diseases across multiple members of African American families is unclear. This systematic scoping review summarizes the characteristics of research addressing coexisting chronic conditions among African American families, including guiding theories, conditions studied, types of relationships, study outcomes, and intervention research.
   Methods
   The literature search was conducted in Psyclnfo, PubMed, Social Work Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, CINAHL, and Family and Society Studies Worldwide to identify relevant articles published from January 2000 through September 2016. We screened the title and abstracts of 9,170 articles, followed by full-text screening of 530 articles, resulting in a final sample of 114 articles. Fifty-seven percent (n = 65) of the articles cited a guiding theory/framework, with psychological theories (eg, social cognitive theory, transtheoretical model) being most prominent. The most common conditions studied in families were depression (70.2%), anxiety (23.7%), and diabetes (22.8%), with most articles focusing on a combination of physical and mental health conditions (47.4%).
   Results
   In the 114 studies in this review, adult family members were primarily the index person (71.1%, n = 81). The index condition, when identified (79.8%, n = 91), was more likely to be a physical health condition (46.5%, n = 53) than a mental health condition (29.8%, n = 34). Among 343 family relationships examined, immediate family relationships were overwhelmingly represented (85.4%, n = 293); however, extended family (12.0%, n = 41) and fictive kin (0.6%, n = 2) were included. Most (57.0%, n = 65) studies focused on a single category of outcomes, such as physical health (eg, obesity, glycemic control), mental health (eg, depression, anxiety, distress), psychosocial outcomes (eg, social support, caregiver burden), or health behaviors (eg, medication adherence, disease management, health care utilization); however, 43.0% (n = 49) of studies focused on outcomes across multiple categories. Sixteen intervention articles (14.0%) were identified, with depression the most common condition of interest.
   Conclusion
   Recognizing the multiple, simultaneous health issues facing families through a lens of family comorbidity and family multimorbidity may more accurately mirror the lived experiences of many African American families and better elucidate intervention opportunities than previous approaches.

AB  - Cognitive impairment, associated with ageing, stress, hypertension and various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, is a major health issue. The present review focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD), since it is the most important cause of cognitive impairment. It is characterized by progressive memory loss, language deficits, depression, agitation, mood disturbances and psychosis. Although the hallmarks of AD are cholinergic dysfunction, beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle formation, it is also associated with derangement of other neurotransmitters, elevated levels of advanced glycation end products, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, genetic and environmental factors. On one hand, this complex etiopathology makes a response to commonly used drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine less predictable and often unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it supports the use of herbal medicines due to their nonspecific antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and specific cholinesterase inhibitory activity. The popularity of herbal medicines is also increasing due to their perceived effectiveness, safety and affordability. In the present article, the experimental and clinical evidence have been reviewed for various Indian herbal medicines such as Centella asiatica, Bacopa monnieri, Curcuma longa, Clitoria ternatea, Withania somnifera, Celastrus paniculatus, Evolvulus alsinoides, Desmodium gangeticum, Eclipta alba, Moringa oleifera and Convolvulus pluricaulis, which have shown potential in cognitive impairment. Some commonly available herbal formulations for memory impairment in India have also been reviewed.

AB  - Background
   The prevalence of mental health conditions and national suicide rates are increasing in many countries. Lithium is widely and effectively used in pharmacological doses for the treatment and prevention of manic/depressive episodes, stabilising mood and reducing the risk of suicide. Since the 1990s, several ecological studies have tested the hypothesis that trace doses of naturally occurring lithium in drinking water may have a protective effect against suicide in the general population.
   Aims
   To synthesise the global evidence on the association between lithium levels in drinking water and suicide mortality rates.
   Method
   The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify eligible ecological studies published between 1 January 1946 and 10 September 2018. Standardised regression coefficients for total (i.e. both genders combined), male and female suicide mortality rates were extracted and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016041375).
   Results
   The literature search identified 415 articles; of these, 15 ecological studies were included in the synthesis. The random-effects meta-analysis showed a consistent protective (or inverse) association between lithium levels/concentration in publicly available drinking water and total (pooled beta = -0.27, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.08; P = 0.006, I-2 = 83.3%), male (pooled beta = -0.26, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.03; P = 0.08, I-2 = 91.9%) and female (pooled beta = -0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.02; P = 0.03, I-2 = 28.5%) suicide mortality rates. A similar protective association was observed in the six studies included in the narrative synthesis, and subgroup meta-analyses based on the higher/lower suicide mortality rates and lithium levels/concentration.
   Conclusions
   This synthesis of ecological studies, which are subject to the ecological fallacy/bias, supports the hypothesis that there is a protective (or inverse) association between lithium intakes from public drinking water and suicide mortality at the population level. Naturally occurring lithium in drinking water may have the potential to reduce the risk of suicide and may possibly help in mood stabilisation, particularly in populations with relatively high suicide rates and geographical areas with a greater range of lithium concentration in the drinking water. All the available evidence suggests that randomised community trials of lithium supplementation of the water supply might be a means of testing the hypothesis, particularly in communities (or settings) with demonstrated high prevalence of mental health conditions, violent criminal behaviour, chronic substance misuse and risk of suicide.

AB  - Microdosing psychedelic drugs-that is, taking sub-behavioral doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or psilocybin-is a growing practice in Western societies. Taken mainly for creative or mood-enhancing purposes, thousands of users are increasingly being exposed to (micro)doses of psychedelic drugs. In this systematic review, we searched the available evidence from human studies, focusing our results in terms of three main axes: efficacy, safety, and the influence of the placebo effect in microdosing practices. While the available evidence has some strengths (e.g. large sample sizes, robust methodologies) there are also remarkable limitations (e.g. gender bias, heterogeneity of dosing schedules and drugs used). Highly contradictory results have been found, showing both the benefits and detriments of microdosing in terms of mood, creative processes, and energy, among other regards. This review provides a general overview of the methods and approaches used, which could be useful for improving future studies.

AB  - Demographic changes have placed age-related mental health disorders at the forefront of public health challenges over the next three decades worldwide. Within the context of cognitive impairment and neurocognitive disorders among elderly people, the fragmentation of the self is associated with existential suffering, loss of meaning and dignity for the patient, as well as with a significant burden for the caregiver. Psychosocial interventions are part of a person-centered approach to cognitive impairment (including early stage dementia and dementia). Dignity therapy (DT) is a therapeutic intervention that has been shown to be effective in reducing existential distress, mood, and anxiety symptoms and improving dignity in persons with cancer and other terminal conditions in palliative care settings. The aims of this paper were: (i) To briefly summarize key issues and challenges related to care in gerontology considering specifically frail elderly/elderly with cognitive decline and their caregivers; and (ii) to provide a narrative review of the recent knowledge and evidence on DT in the elderly population with cognitive impairment. We searched the electronic data base (CINAHL, SCOPUS, PSycInfo, and PubMed studies) for studies regarding the application of DT in the elderly. Additionally, given the caregiver's role as a custodian of diachronic unity of the cared-for and the need to help caregivers to cope with their own existential distress and anticipatory grief, we also propose a DT-dyadic approach addressing the needs of the family as a whole.

AB  - There is evidence suggesting that occupational trauma leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. However, there is a lack of high-quality reviews studying this association. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review with a meta-analysis to summarize the evidence of occupational trauma on PTSD and depression. After a database search on studies published between 1994 and 2018, we included 31 studies, of which only four had a low risk of bias. For soldiers exposed to wartime deployment, the pooled relative risk (RR) was 2.18 (95% CI 1.83-2.60) for PTSD and 1.15 (95% CI 1.06-1.25) for depression. For employees exposed to occupational trauma, there also was an increased risk for PTSD (RR = 3.18; 95% CI 1.76-5.76) and for depression (RR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.44-2.08). The overall quality of the evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was moderate; the evidence was high only for the association between workers after exposure to trauma and development of PTSD. The study results indicate an increased risk of PTSD and depression in soldiers after participation in war and in employees after occupational trauma.

AB  - Introduction: The problems of oral health of people diagnosed with depression are not adequately recognized, either in developed or developing countries. Social stigma, lack of self-interest, or even inadequate approaches of dental doctors towards the unique situation of this group of people this lead to excessive oral health problems.
   Methods: The bibliographic database PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and Whiley online library were searched using the following text and MeSH as separate key terms and in combination: depression and oral health/dental caries/periodontal disease/tooth loss/utilization of oral health services/and barriers. The content of documents was analysed using qualitative methodology.
   Results: Twenty-six original studies were included in the review. Level/severity of depression, medication and medical comorbidity are the most important medical barriers influencing the oral health of people diagnosed with depression. Dental fear and anxiety are mostly combined with low oral hygiene and bad oral health. Socioeconomic status, dental insurance, bad habits and education also have important roles in the oral health status of people diagnosed with depression.
   Conclusion: Including individuals with depression and oral health problems in national health programs, creating specific prevention programs, or subsidizing the cost of treatment are some of the recommendations suggested as solutions.

   Methods: A literature search was conducted between April-May 2019 including qualitative and quantitative research articles published between 2009-2019 in Pubmed, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Turkish Psychiatric Index and Ulakbim Medical Databases. A total of 18 articles in English (n = 17) and Turkish (n = 1) were included.
   Results: The majority of studies were quantitative (n=17) and 1 had a qualitative design. 22.2% were carried out in the Americas, 61.1% in Europe and 16.7% in Asia. In 16 of the studies, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale was used to diagnose postpartum depression in fathers, and 4 of them assessed psychometric properties. According to the results of the findings, unemployment, age, economic status and social support were among the factors affecting postpartum depression in fathers.
   Conclusion: Besides the factors affecting the mothers such as age, education, social support, whether the pregnancy was planned, parenting stress, parental stress/sense of competence, quality of the relationship with the spouse, history of depression, number of people living at home; factors such as housing status, economic situation and unemployment affect postnatal depression in fathers. Since there was only one research article from Turkey, we believe that there is a need for research on this subject in our country.

AB  - The menopausal transition constitutes a phase of major biopsychosocial changes associated with an elevated risk for the development of depression. Perimenopausal depression is highly prevalent and usually characterized by core symptoms of a major depressive disorder combined with menopausal complaints such as vasomotor symptoms or other physical complaints. However, a distinct definition of the condition is lacking. The aim of this review is to portray the symptoms assessed in studies on perimenopausal depression in order to provide relevant information on the current understanding of this condition.
   A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. A total of 37 studies were included.
   Various assessment tools have been used to measure symptoms related to perimenopausal depression. Fifteen symptoms were identified. Depressed mood was assessed across all studies. Low energy or sleep disturbances, as acknowledged symptoms of a major depressive disorder, were surveyed in most studies. However, the assessment of menopausal complaints was rather heterogeneous. While vasomotor symptoms were often measured, other menopausal symptoms such as mood swings or pain were investigated less frequently. Sexual problems were only rarely assessed.
   Studies on perimenopausal depression regularly include the assessment of core symptoms of a major depressive disorder, but the assessment of menopausal complaints is inconsistent. While certain symptoms are commonly measured, others are not assessed. Such inconsistencies underline an ambiguous understanding of perimenopausal depression, which in turn affects the evaluation and treatment of the condition. Thus, the use of the existing guidelines on perimenopausal depression is recommended.

AB  - BackgroundThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in changes to the working arrangements of millions of employees who are now based at home and may continue to work at home, in some capacity, for the foreseeable future. Decisions on how to promote employees' health whilst working at home (WAH) need to be based on the best available evidence to optimise worker outcomes. The aim of this rapid review was to review the impact of WAH on individual workers' mental and physical health, and determine any gender difference, to develop recommendations for employers and employees to optimise workers' health.MethodA search was undertaken in three databases, PsychInfo, ProQuest, and Web of Science, from 2007 to May 2020. Selection criteria included studies which involved employees who regularly worked at home, and specifically reported on physical or mental health-related outcomes. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, one author extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments with review by a second author.ResultsTwenty-three papers meet the selection criteria for this review. Ten health outcomes were reported: pain, self-reported health, safety, well-being, stress, depression, fatigue, quality of life, strain and happiness. The impact on health outcomes was strongly influenced by the degree of organisational support available to employees, colleague support, social connectedness (outside of work), and levels of work to family conflict. Overall, women were less likely to experience improved health outcomes when WAH.ConclusionsThis review identified several health outcomes affected by WAH. The health/work relationship is complex and requires consideration of broader system factors to optimise the effects of WAH on workers' health. It is likely mandated WAH will continue to some degree for the foreseeable future; organisations will need to implement formalised WAH policies that consider work-home boundary management support, role clarity, workload, performance indicators, technical support, facilitation of co-worker networking, and training for managers.

AB  - The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is used extensively as the "gold standard" perinatal depression and anxiety screening tool. This study contributes to an emerging discussion about the tool's shortcomings, specifically around cultural suitability for use with Indigenous women. A systematic search was conducted in ProQuest, PsycINFO, MEDLINE (Web of Science), PubMed, Scopus, Informit, and CINAHL research databases, and grey literature. The quality of the body of evidence was assessed using the NHMRC Level of Evidence framework. Three studies supported the cultural validation of the EPDS with Indigenous groups in Canada (n = 2) and the USA (n = 1). The remaining eleven Australian studies demonstrated that cultural concerns were suggested by either Indigenous mothers, healthcare professionals (Indigenous and non-Indigenous), or both, though cultural concerns were more weighted from the perspectives of healthcare professionals. The quality of the evidence was not strong, and thus, there is a critical and urgent need for targeted research in this area. This review identified and recommended Indigenous-specific methodologies that can be adopted for more trustworthy, culturally safe, and effective research in this area. Given that the EPDS is currently considered gold standard in routine perinatal mental health screening practice in countries around the world, these findings raise significant concerns. Using culturally relevant research methodologies, such as the use of mixed-methods design, could lay stronger groundwork for further investigation of the broader utility and cultural relevance of the tool.

AB  - Chronic pain is a significant public health problem with emotional and disabling factors, which may not completely respond to current medical treatments such as opioids. The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effectiveness and safety of MBCT for patients with chronic pain. Database searches of PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and CINAHL up to 15 October 2019. Included studies assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Eight RCTs involved 433 patients, including chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis and mix etiology. MBCT intervention demonstrated a short-term improvement on depression mood [standardized mean difference -0.72; 95% confidence interval = -1.22 to -0.22, p = 0.005] compared with usual care and was associated with short-term improvement in mindfulness compared with non-MBCT [SMD 0.51; 95% CI = 0.01 to 1.01, p = 0.04]. Between-group differences in pain intensity, pain inference and pain acceptance were not signi?cant at short- or long-term follow-up. Compared to active treatments, MBCT intervention not found significant differences in either short- or long-term outcomes. MBCT showed short-term efficacious on depressed mood and mindfulness of chronic pain patients. Longer follow-ups, large sample and rigorous RCTs that can be best understand remaining uncertainties needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Recently, there has been a range of studies about smartphone-based interventions and monitoring for reducing symptoms of bipolar disorder (BD). However, their efficacy for BD remains unclear.
   AIM
   To compare the effect of smartphone-based interventions and monitoring with control methods in treating patients with BD.
   METHODS
   A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Clinical trials, psycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or single-group trials in which smartphone-based interventions and monitoring were compared with control methods or baseline in patients with symptoms of BD were included. Data were synthesized using a random-effects or a fixed-effects model to analyze the effects of psychological interventions and monitoring delivered via smartphone on psychiatric symptoms in patients with BD. The primary outcome measures were set for mania and depression symptoms. Subgroups were created to explore which aspects of smartphone interventions are relevant to the greater or lesser efficacy of treating symptoms.
   RESULTS
   We identified ten articles, including seven RCTs (985 participants) and three single-group trials (169 participants). Analysis of the between-group study showed that smartphone-based interventions were effective in reducing manic [g = -0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.33 to -0.04, P = 0.01] and depressive (g = -0.28, 95%CI: -0.55 to -0.01, P < 0.05) symptoms. In within-group analysis, smartphone-based interventions significantly reduced manic (g = 0.17, 95%CI: 0.04 to 0.30, P < 0.01) and depressive (g = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.18 to 0.78) symptoms compared to the baseline. Nevertheless, smartphone-based monitoring systems significantly reduced manic (g = 0.27, 95%CI: 0.02 to 0.51, P < 0.05) but not depressive symptoms. Subgroup analysis indicated that the interventions with psychoeducation had positive effects on depressive (g = -0.62, 95%CI: -0.81 to -0.43, P < 0.01) and manic (g = -0.24, 95%CI: -0.43 to -0.06, P = 0.01) symptoms compared to the controlled conditions, while the interventions without psychoeducation did not (P > 0.05). The contacts between therapists and patients that contributed to the implementation of psychological therapy reduced depression symptoms (g = -0.47, 95%CI: -0.75 to -0.18, P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSION
   Smartphone-based interventions and monitoring have a significant positive impact on depressive and manic symptoms of BD patients in between-group and within-group analysis.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has gained growing interest for the treatment of major depression (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Most knowledge on rTMS comes from human studies as preclinical application has been problematic. However, recent optimization of rTMS in animal models has laid the foundations for improved translational studies. Preclinical studies have the potential to help identify optimal stimulation protocols and shed light on new neurobiological-based rationales for rTMS use. To assess existing evidence regarding rTMS effects on depressive-like symptoms in rodent models, we conducted a comprehensive literature search in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019157549). In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine rTMS efficacy, performing subgroup analyses to examine the impact of different experimental models and neuromodulation parameters. Assessment of the depressive-like phenotype was quite homogeneous whilst rTMS parameters among the 23 included studies varied considerably. Most studies used a stress-induced model. Overall, results show a largely beneficial effect of active rTMS compared to sham stimulation, as reflected in the statistically significant recovery of both helplessness (SDM 1.34 [1.02;1.66]) and anhedonic (SDM 1.87 [1.02;2.72]) profiles. Improvement of the depressive-like phenotype was obtained in all included models and independently of rTMS frequency. Nonetheless, these results have limited predictive value for TRD patients as only antidepressant-sensitive models were used. Extending rTMS studies to other MDD models, corresponding to distinct endophenotypes, and to TRD models is therefore crucial to test rTMS efficacy and to develop cost-effective protocols, with the potential of yielding faster clinical responses in MDD and TRD.

AB  - Objectives: Heart Rate Variability has gained substantial interest in both clinical and athletic settings as a measurement tool for quantifying autonomic nervous system activity and psychophysiological stress. However, its uses in tactical work settings, such as military, police, and firefighting environments, remain controversial. Given the physical, mental, and emotional stress public safety personnel face both operationally and in training, heart rate variability measurement may be key in promoting their health, safety and operational effectiveness.
   Methods: This study identified, critically appraised, and summarized primary studies investigating relationships between heart rate variability and outcomes of interest to tactical personnel. Key literature databases were searched, and quality assessment checklists were applied to analyze retained literature. The results of the screening and assessment processes, along with key data extracted from each study were summarized and tabulated. Research gaps were also identified to facilitate improvements to how tactical personnel and health or performance providers may best utilize heart rate variability to monitor or promote personnel health and performance, and thereby facilitate public safety.
   Results: Twenty studies were included and were all of generally high quality. Cohort size, length of follow-up, measurement objectives, data acquisition, and data analysis all varied considerably across studies, precluding meta-analysis. However, study results correlating heart rate variability and relevant outcomes indicated that overall, heart rate variability is an effective indicator of key fitness and performance elements in the tactical work setting.
   Conclusions: Heart rate variability can be an effective health and performance tool in tactical work environments. However, measurement methods must be carefully selected and applied. Further research is required to understand causal relationships. Specifically, larger cohort inclusion and the isolation and study of specific variables unique to public safety work and training may improve the effectiveness of heart rate variability measurement to provide meaningful information to end users and providers.

AB  - Background A considerable number of qualitative studies have been published in recent years on the issues that the quantitative studies have limitations on. This study aimed at performing a meta-synthesis on qualitative studies on Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) with a scoping review approach. Methods This meta-synthesis study was conducted as a scoping review in 2019. The Arkesy and O'Malley framework was applied which has six steps of identifying the research question, identifying the relevant studies, selecting the studies, charting the data, data analysis and reporting the results, and consultation exercise. The required data were gathered by searching the relevant keywords in databases of PubMed, web of knowledge, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Google scholar, Sid, IranMedex. Extracted data were analyzed by the Content-Analysis method. Results Finally, 30 studies were included. Extracted data summarized in five main themes and 17 sub-themes. The main themes were: consequences (individual, family, social, financial), the needs of survivors (social support and healthcare), risk factors (general risk factors, risk factors for motorcyclists, risk factors for children and adolescents), barriers of prevention (general barriers, pre-hospital barriers, emergency, and hospital barriers), and prevention solutions (increasing safety, rules and regulations, education, increasing equipment, scientific solutions) of RTIs. Conclusion This study combined the methods of the scoping review and the meta-synthesis to mapping all qualitative studies on the RTIs, with this approach, this study provides extensive and practical information for policy-makers, managers, practitioners, and researchers in the field of RTIs. Also, by applying this approach, the gaps in the existing knowledge and areas in need of further research are identified.

AB  - Background Chronic symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) vary greatly and are difficult to treat; we investigate the impact of meditation, yoga, and mindfulness-based interventions on this treatment group.
   Method Search included four databases, allowing studies of any design containing pre/post outcomes for meditation, yoga, or mindfulness-based interventions in people suffering from brain injury acquired by mechanical force. Analyses used robust variance estimation to assess overall effects and random-effects models for selected outcomes; we evaluated both between- and within-group changes.
   Results Twenty studies (N = 539) were included. Results revealed significant improvement of overall symptoms compared to controls (d = 0.41; 95% CI [0.04, 0.77]; tau(2) = 0.06), with significant within-group improvements in mental health (d = 0.39), physical health (d = 0.39), cognitive performance (d = 0.24), quality of life (d = 0.39), and self-related processing (d = 0.38). Symptoms showing greatest improvement were fatigue (d = 0.96) and depression (d = 0.40). Findings were homogeneous across studies. Study quality concerns include lack of randomisation, blinding, and recording of adverse events.
   Conclusions This first-ever meta-analysis on meditation, yoga, and mindfulness-based interventions for chronic symptoms of mTBI offers hope but highlights the need for rigorous new trials to advance clinical applications and to explore mechanistic pathways.

AB  - This article aims to provide a critical review of the scientific research on technostress. As such, global references in this field are identified and highlighted in order to manage pre-existing knowledge and establish future 'bridges' among researchers, and to enhance the presently dispersed understanding of this subject. A scientometric meta-analysis of publications on technostress was conducted to achieve this objective. Mainstream journals from the Web of Science (WoS) were used to identify current topics, relevant journals, prolific authors, institutions, and countries, 'schools of thought' and the thematic areas around which current technostress debate revolves. In this article a significant contribution comes from the use of the scientific activity itself, together with scientometric meta-analysis techniques and the application of this scientific activity, its impact and relational character, to discover relevant countries, research organizations and authors which can constitute a global reference to demarcate this knowledge frontier, and who lead the 'critical mass' of global technostress researchers. This study also distinguishes between the relevant themes studied, with co-keywords plus bibliographic coupling citation, and examines the kind of stress the most prolific authors have considered and, therefore, to discover those topics which should be studied further to deepen this research field, in search of a post-disciplinary knowledge that allows unity of focus in technology and psychology.

AB  - Background: Parental depression and anxiety are relevant factors that may influence child externalizing and internalizing behavior; also influenced by stigmatized knowledge about such mental illnesses. Objectives: To identify which instruments were used in studies on the effects of parental depression and anxiety on child behavior from 6 to 12 years old; to analyze the main results in offspring's behaviors on articles published between 2011 to 2019. Methods: we did a literature review searching PubMed, BVS, ISI, and Scopus databases; keywords: "Maternal Depression", "Maternal Anxiety", "Paternal Depression", "Paternal Anxiety", "Mother's (also Mothers') Depression", "Mother's (also Mothers') Anxiety", "Father's (also Fathers') Depression", "Father's (also Fathers') Anxiety", "Parental Depression", "Parental Anxiety" AND "Child Behavior", in Portuguese and English. Results: We found 1,500 articles, after applying the inclusion criteria, n = 23 were selected and analyzed. 78.3% of studies were performed with mothers, 17.4% with both parents, and 0% with fathers alone. Different instruments were used to assess depression or anxiety in parents, and child behavior. Discussion: studies that included both parents and parental anxiety assessments were scarce; no study in this review evaluated only fathers. Social abilities, personality traits, self-conceptions, and knowledge about anxiety and depression could enhance the quality of studies' results.

AB  - Background
   Structural differences associated with depression have not been confirmed in brain regions apart from the hippocampus. Comorbid anxiety has been inconsistently assessed, and may explain discrepancies in previous findings. We investigated the link between depression, comorbid anxiety and brain structure.
   Methods
   We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42018089286). We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, PubMed and Scopus, from database inception to Sept. 13, 2018, for MRI case-control studies that reported brain volumes in healthy adults and adults with clinical depression. We summarized mean volumetric differences using meta-analyses, and we assessed demographics, depression factors and segmentation procedure as moderators using meta-regressions.
   Results
   We included 112 studies in the meta-analyses, assessing 4911 healthy participants and 5934 participants with depression (mean age 49.8 yr, 68.2% female). Volume effects were greater in late-onset depression and in multiple episodes of depression. Adults with depression and no comorbidity showed significantly lower volumes in the putamen, pallidum and thalamus, as well as significantly lower grey matter volume and intracranial volume; the largest effects were in the hippocampus (6.8%, p < 0.001). Adults with depression and comorbid anxiety showed significantly higher volumes in the amygdala (3.6%, p < 0.001). Comorbid anxiety lowered depression effects by 3% on average. Sex moderated reductions in intracranial volume.
   Limitations
   High heterogeneity in hippocampus effects could not be accounted for by any moderator. Data on symptom severity and medication were sparse, but other factors likely made significant contributions.
   Conclusion
   Depression-related differences in brain structure were modulated by comorbid anxiety, chronicity of symptoms and onset of illness. Early diagnosis of anxiety symptomatology will prove crucial to ensuring effective, tailored treatments for improving long-term mental health and mitigating cognitive problems, given the effects in the hippocampus.

AB  - Objective A systematic review of mental health outcomes and needs of children and families during past pandemics was conducted based on the PRISMA protocol. The objectives were to evaluate the quality of existing studies on this topic, determine what is known about mental health outcomes and needs of children and families, and provide recommendations for how COVID-19 policies can best support children and families. Methods Seventeen studies were identified through a search of PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Results Studies examining child outcomes indicate that social isolation and quarantining practices exert a substantial negative impact on child anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and fear symptoms. Potential risk factors such as living in rural areas, being female, and increasing grade level may exacerbate negative mental health outcomes for children. Studies examining parental and family outcomes indicate that parents experience high stress, anxiety, and financial burden during pandemics. The age of the parent and family socioeconomic status (SES) appeared to mitigate negative outcomes, where older parents and higher SES families had lower rates of mental health problems. Parents' fear over the physical and mental health of their children, concerns over potential job loss and arranging childcare contributes to elevated stress and poorer well-being. Conclusions Findings from this review suggest current gaps in COVID-19 policies and provide recommendations such implementing "family-friendly" policies that are inclusive and have flexible eligibility criteria. Examples include universal paid sick leave for parents and financial supports for parents who are also frontline workers and are at an elevated risk for contracting the disease.

   Results: Twenty studies (k = 16 unique comparisons, N = 898) were included. At post-treatment, MBIs were superior to non-specific controls (e.g., waitlist, attentional placebos) on measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, general psychological symptoms (i.e., aggregated across symptom domains), quality of life / functioning, and mindfulness (Hedges' gs = 0.32 to 0.80), but not physical health. At follow-up (mean length = 3.19 months), MBIs continued to outperform non-specific controls on general psychological symptoms, but not PTSD. MBIs were superior to specific active controls (i.e., other therapies) at post-treatment on measures of PTSD and general psychological symptoms (gs = 0.19 to 0.25). Participants randomized to MBIs showed higher rates of attrition than those randomized to control interventions (odds ratio = 1.98). Several models were not robust to tests of publication bias. Study quality and risk of bias assessment indicated several areas of concern.
   Conclusions: MBIs may improve psychological symptoms and quality of life / functioning in veterans. Questionable acceptability and few high-quality studies support the need for rigorous RCTs, potentially adapted to veterans.

AB  - Objectives: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling mental illnesses and it has a significant impact on society. This review aims to provide updated scientific evidence about the epidemiology of MDD.
   Methods: A systematic literature review of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases was performed to identify articles on the prevalence of MDD and its correlates. The search was restricted to manuscripts published between January 2001 and December 2018.
   Results: Sixty-three articles were included in the review. The lifetime prevalence of MDD ranged from 2 to 21%, with the highest rates found in some European countries and the lowest in some Asian countries. The main sociodemographic correlates were separated/divorced marital status and female gender. Child abuse, intimate partner violence, and comorbidity with other physical and mental disorders also were consistently associated with MDD across the reviewed studies.
   Conclusions: MDD is a highly prevalent condition worldwide. There are remarkable interregional differences in the disorder's prevalence, as well as in certain sociodemographic correlates. MDD is also highly comorbid with physical and mental health problems.

AB  - Loneliness and social isolation have negative consequences on physical and mental health in both adult and pediatric populations. Children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) are often excluded and experience more loneliness than their typically developing peers. This scoping review aims to identify the type of studies conducted in children with NDD to determine the effects of loneliness and/or social isolation. Three electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO) were searched from inception until 5 February 2019. Two independent reviewers screened the citations for inclusion and extracted data from the included articles. Quantitative (i.e., frequency analysis) and qualitative analyses (i.e., content analysis) were completed. From our search, 5768 citations were screened, 29 were read in full, and 12 were included. Ten were case-control comparisons with cross-sectional assessment of various outcomes, which limited inference. Autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and learning disorder were the most commonly studied NDD. This review showed that loneliness among children with NDD was associated with negative consequences on mental health, behaviour, and psychosocial/emotional development, with a likely long-term impact in adulthood. Lack of research in this area suggests that loneliness is not yet considered a problem in children with NDD. More studies are warranted using prospective designs and a larger sample size with a focus on the dynamic aspect of loneliness development.

AB  - Urban soils have been changed much by human impacts in terms of structure, composition and use. This review paper gives a general introduction into changes from compaction, mixing, water retention, nutrient inputs, sealing, gardening, and pollution. Because pollutions in particular have caused concerns in the past, metal pollutions and platinum group metal inputs have been treated in more detail. Though it is not possible to cover the entire literature done on this field, it has been tried to give examples from all continents, regarding geochemical background levels. Urban metal soil pollution depends on the age of the settlement, current emissions from traffic and industry, and washout. It seems that in regions of high precipitation, pollutants are swept away to the watershed, leaving the soils less polluted than in Europe. Health hazards, however, are caused by ingestion and inhalation, which are higher in 3rd world countries, and not by concentrations met in urban soils as such; these are not treated within this paper in detail. With respect to pollutants, this paper is focused on metals. Contrary to many reviews of the past, which mix all data into one column, like sampling depth, sieved grain sizes, digestion and determination methods, these have been considered, because this might lead to considerable interpretation changes. Because many datasets are not Gaussian distributed, medians and concentration ranges are given, wherever possible. Urban dust contains about two to three fold the hazardous metal concentrations met in urban soils. Some data about metal mobilities obtained from selective and sequential leaching procedures, are also added. Soil compaction, pollution, sealings and run-offs cause stress situations for green plants growing at roadside locations, which is discussed in the Section 5. Environmental protection measures have led to decrease metal pollutions within the last decade in many places.

AB  - Faced with a constant inundation of information and increasing pressures brought by the continuous development of modern civilization, people are increasingly faced with mental health challenges that are only now being actively researched. Mental illness is caused by brain dysfunction due to internal and external pathogenic factors that destroy the integrity of the human brain and alter its function. Regular participation in physical exercise can stimulate the cerebral cortex and simultaneously increase the supply of oxygen and nutrients, helping to preserve or restore normal functioning of the nervous system. In conjunction with other systems of the body, the nervous system constitutes the neuro-humoral regulation system responsible for maintaining the stable state of the human body. This paper is a systematic review of studies investigating the effects of exercise intervention on several common neuropsychological diseases, including depression, anxiety disorder, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Furthermore, we discuss possible physiological mechanisms underlying exercise-induced benefits and study limitations that must be addressed by future research. In many cases, drug therapy is ineffective and brings unwanted side effects. Based on the literature, we conclude that exercise intervention plays a positive role and that certain standards must be established in the field to make physical activity consistently effective.

AB  - Background
   People living with serious mental illness (SMI) experience debilitating symptoms that worsen their physical health and quality of life. Regular physical activity (PA) may bring symptomatic improvements and enhance wellbeing. When undertaken in community-based group settings, PA may yield additional benefits such as reduced isolation. Initiating PA can be difficult for people with SMI, so PA engagement is commonly low. Designing acceptable and effective PA programs requires a better understanding of the lived experiences of PA initiation among people with SMI.
   Methods
   This systematic review of qualitative studies used the meta-ethnography approach by Noblit and Hare (1988). Electronic databases were searched from inception to November 2017. Eligible studies used qualitative methodology; involved adults (>= 18 years) with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder, or psychosis; reported community-based group PA; and captured the experience of PA initiation, including key features of social support. Study selection and quality assessment were performed by four reviewers.
   Results
   Sixteen studies were included in the review. We identified a "journey" that depicted a long sequence of phases involved in initiating PA. The journey demonstrated the thought processes, expectations, barriers, and support needs of people with SMI. In particular, social support from a trusted source played an important role in getting people to the activity, both physically and emotionally.
   Discussion
   The journey illustrated that initiation of PA for people with SMI is a long complex transition. This complex process needs to be understood before ongoing participation in PA can be addressed. Registration-The review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 22/03/2017 (registration number CRD42017059948).

AB  - Molecular hydrogen (H-2) is a physiologically inert gas. However, during the last 10 years, increasing evidence has revealed its biological functions under pathological conditions. More specifically, H(2)has protective effects against a variety of diseases, particularly nervous system disorders, which include ischemia/reperfusion injury, traumatic injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, neuropathic pain, neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive dysfunction induced by surgery and anesthesia, anxiety, and depression. In addition, H(2)plays protective roles mainly through anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, the regulation of autophagy, and preservation of mitochondrial function and the blood-brain barrier. Further, H(2)is easy to use and has neuroprotective effects with no major side-effects, indicating that H(2)administration is a potential therapeutic strategy in clinical settings. Here we summarize the H(2)donors and their pharmacokinetics. Meanwhile, we review the effectiveness and safety of H(2)in the treatment of various nervous system diseases based on preclinical and clinical studies, leading to the conclusion that H(2)can be a simple and effective clinical therapy for CNS diseases such as ischemia-reperfusion brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and diseases characterized by cognitive dysfunction. The potential mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effect of H(2)are also analyzed.

AB  - Objective:
   The need for digital tools in mental health is clear, with insufficient access to mental health services. Conversational agents, also known as chatbots or voice assistants, are digital tools capable of holding natural language conversations. Since our last review in 2018, many new conversational agents and research have emerged, and we aimed to reassess the conversational agent landscape in this updated systematic review.
   Methods:
   A systematic literature search was conducted in January 2020 using the PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, and Cochrane databases. Studies included were those that involved a conversational agent assessing serious mental illness: major depressive disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, or anxiety disorder.
   Results:
   Of the 247 references identified from selected databases, 7 studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, there were generally positive experiences with conversational agents in regard to diagnostic quality, therapeutic efficacy, or acceptability. There continues to be, however, a lack of standard measures that allow ease of comparison of studies in this space. There were several populations that lacked representation such as the pediatric population and those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. While comparing 2018 to 2020 research offers useful insight into changes and growth, the high degree of heterogeneity between all studies in this space makes direct comparison challenging.
   Conclusions:
   This review revealed few but generally positive outcomes regarding conversational agents' diagnostic quality, therapeutic efficacy, and acceptability, which may augment mental health care. Despite this increase in research activity, there continues to be a lack of standard measures for evaluating conversational agents as well as several neglected populations. We recommend that the standardization of conversational agent studies should include patient adherence and engagement, therapeutic efficacy, and clinician perspectives.

AB  - Gestational period plays critical role in neuropsychological development. One of the genes that undergoes changes by prenatal stress (PNS) exposure, is the gene coding brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Studies have reported different patterns of change following PNS in BDNF, which emphasizes the complexity of the issue. In this review, systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL databases was performed. Primary searches resulted in 2132 studies and finally 43 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Transcriptional and epigenetic changes of BDNF gene in the brain were recorded. Decreased or unchanged BDNF total mRNA and BDNF mature protein, with hypermethylation of the coding exons were the most reported changes. However, stress paradigm, gender of the fetus and the day of sacrifice were found to significantly affect the results. Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are the most vulnerable regions. They can show long lasting and persistent transcriptional and epigenetics changes of BDNF gene following PNS. Further studies evaluating the importance of these findings in humans are essential.

AB  - Over the past decade there has been a surge of interest in the development of endocannabinoid-based therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diverse neuropsychiatric conditions. Although initial preclinical and clinical development efforts focused on pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase to elevate levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide, more recent efforts have focused on inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) to enhance signaling of the most abundant and efficacious endocannabinoid ligand, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). We review the biochemistry and physiology of 2-AG signaling and preclinical evidence supporting a role for this system in the regulation of anxiety-related outcomes and stress adaptation. We review preclinical evidence supporting MAGL inhibition for the treatment of affective, trauma-related, and stress-related disorders; describe the current state of MAGL inhibitor drug development; and discuss biological factors that could affect MAGL inhibitor efficacy. Issues related to the clinical advancement of MAGL inhibitors are also discussed. We are cautiously optimistic, as the field of MAGL inhibitor development transitions from preclinical to clinical and theoretical to practical, that pharmacological 2-AG augmentation could represent a mechanistically novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of affective and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Depression is a common condition affecting up to 20% of all pregnant women, and is associated with subsequent developmental and behavioral problems in children, such as conduct disorder and ADHD. One proposed mechanism underlying these associations is modification of the fetal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS), resulting in altered responses to stress. This review examined the evidence regarding altered HPA-axis and ANS reactivity in children prenatally exposed to high maternal depressive symptoms. A systematic search was conducted in the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO, for studies published till 25 July 2017. A total of 13 studies comprising 2271 mother-infant dyads were included. None of the studies were suitable for meta-analysis. Risk of bias assessment showed low risk for four studies. Only three studies described an independent association between exposure to high maternal prenatal depressive symptoms and altered stress reactivity in children. There is limited evidence of an independent association between prenatal exposure to maternal depression and altered HPA or ANS reactivity in children.

AB  - Background The effectiveness of digital psychological interventions in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unclear. We aimed to systematically investigate the available evidence for digital psychological interventions in reducing mental health problems in LMICs.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English from database inception to March 9, 2020. We included randomised controlled trials investigating digital psychological interventions in individuals with mental health problems in LMICs. We extracted data on demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of the intervention, including the setting, digital delivery method, control group conditions, number of sessions, therapeutic orientation (eg, cognitive therapy or behaviour therapy), presence or absence of guidance, and length of follow-up, and statistical information to calculate effect sizes. If a study reported insufficient data to calculate effect sizes, the corresponding authors were contacted to provide data that could be aggregated. We did random-effects meta-analyses, and calculated the standardised mean difference in scores of digital psychological interventions versus control conditions (Hedges' g). Quality of evidence was assessed by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The primary outcome was post-intervention mental health problems, as measured by self-reporting instruments or clinical interviews. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019137755.
   Findings We identified 22 eligible studies that were included in the meta-analysis. The included studies involved a total of 4104 participants (2351 who received a digital psychological intervention and 1753 who were in the control group), and mainly focused on young adults (mean age of the study population was 20-35 years) with depression or substance misuse. The results showed that digital psychological interventions are moderately effective when compared with control interventions (Hedges' g 0.60 [95% CI 045-0.75]; Hedges' g with treatment as usual subgroup for comparison 0.54 [0.35-0.73]). Heterogeneity between studies was substantial (P =74% [95% CI 60-83]). There was no evidence of publication bias, and the quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria was generally high.
   Interpretation Digital psychological interventions, which have been mostly studied in individuals with depression and substance misuse, are superior to control conditions, including usual care, and are moderately effective in LMICs. However, the considerable heterogeneity observed in our analysis highlights the need for more studies to be done, with standardised implementation of digital psychological intervention programmes to improve their reproducibility and efficiency. Digital psychological interventions should be considered for regions where usual care for mental health problems is minimal or absent. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - First responders are routinely exposed to traumatic critical incidents, placing them at higher risk for developing stress-related psychopathology and associated health problems than the general population. Interventions which could improve resilience to stress may help to protect the health of this high risk population. We systematically reviewed such interventions for first responders to determine which ones work and why. We searched the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration Library, EMBASE, IBSS, Medline, PILOTS, PubMed, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS from January 1, 1980 to June 28, 2018 for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled studies aiming to improve well-being, resilience, or stress management for police, ambulance, fire, or search and rescue workers using non-pharmacological interventions. Data were extracted from published reports and obtained from authors. Within- and between-group effect sizes were calculated for mental and physical health outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool. The initial search identified 3,816 studies, 13 of which were eligible for analysis (n = 634 cases, n = 628 controls). Six studies demonstrated intervention-related improvements. However, risk of bias was mostly unclear or high. Within-group intervention effect sizes ranged from -0.82 (95% CI [-1.48, -0.17]) to 2.71 [1.99, 3.42] and between-group intervention effect sizes ranged from -0.73 [-1.25, -0.21] to 1.47 [0.94, 2.01], depending on the outcome. Largest effects were seen for interventions that targeted modifiable risk factors for trauma-related psychiatric disorders. Targeting modifiable predictors of trauma-related psychiatric disorders through training may protect the health of first responders who routinely face trauma in their line of work.

AB  - Depression is a mental disorder that affects millions of people around the world. However, depressive symptoms can be seen in other psychiatric and medical conditions. Here, we investigate the effect of DHEA treatment on depressive symptoms in individuals with depression and/or other clinical conditions in which depressive symptoms are present. An electronic search was performed until October 2019, with no restrictions on language or year of publication in the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials comparing DHEA versus placebo were included if the depressive symptoms were assessed. Fifteen studies with 853 female and male individuals were included in this review. To conduct the meta-analysis, data were extracted from 14 studies. In comparison with placebo, DHEA improved depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.28, 95% (CI) -0.45 to -0.11,p =.001, 12 studies, 742 individuals (375 in the experimental group and 367 in the placebo group),I-2 = 24%), very low quality of evidence, 2 of 14 studies reporting this outcome were removed in a sensitivity analysis as they were strongly influencing heterogeneity between studies. No hormonal changes that indicated any risk to the participants' health were seen. Side effects observed were uncommon, mild, and transient, but commonly related to androgyny. In conclusion, DHEA was associated with a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms compared to placebo. However, these results should be viewed with caution, since the quality of evidence for this outcome was considered very low according to the GRADE criteria.

Therefore, improving their treatment is a significant medical research target: The role of probiotics is a topic of great interest for the current research in this field. Objectives To explore the current literature about the impact of probiotics on anxious and depressive symptoms. Methods Scoping review following the PRISMA guidelines. Results The selection process yielded 23 studies. Probiotics positively affected depressive symptomatology and anxiety symptoms according to 53.83% and 43.75% of the selected studies, respectively. Among the studies assessing inflammatory biomarkers, 58.31% found they were decreased after administration of probiotics. Conclusion The results emerging from the existing literature about probiotic supplementation for depression treatment are encouraging, but further research is needed considering the shortage of clinical trials on this topic and the heterogeneity of the samples analyzed.

AB  - Depression is the most common presenting mental health disorder in primary care. It is also a major contributor to somatic complaints, worsening of chronic medical conditions, poor quality of life, and suicide. Current pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic approaches avert less than half of depression's cumulative burden on society. However, there is a growing body of research describing both how maladaptive lifestyle choices contribute to the development and worsening of depression and how lifestyle-oriented medical interventions can reduce the incidence and severity of depression. This research, largely derived from an emerging field calledepigenetics, elucidates the interactions between our lifestyle choices and those epigenetic factors which mediate our tendencies toward either health, or the onset, if not worsening of disease. The present review highlights how lifestyle choices involving diet, physical activity, sleep, social relationships, and stress influence epigenetic processes positively or negatively, and thereby play a significant role in determining whether one does or does not suffer from depression. The authors propose that medical training programs consider and adopt lifestyle medicine oriented instructional initiatives that will enable tomorrow's primary care providers to more effectively identify and therapeutically intervene in the maladaptive choices contributing to their patients' depression.

AB  - Objectives: Cannabis use is proposed as a risk factor for psychosis and is associated with depressive disorders. However, the relationship between recreational cannabis use and its longitudinal implications on anxiety conditions is less studied. The aim of this investigation is to systematically evaluate published literature and perform a meta-analysis of the data. Methods: A systematic search was performed of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO from inception to May 31, 2020, in addition to a hand search. Longitudinal studies that evaluated the relationship of cannabis use and development of anxiety were included. Where applicable, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were extracted, pooled, and evaluated using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: After screening of unique abstracts (n= 6835), the final evaluation included 24 studies, of which 10 reportedORs that were analyzed quantitatively. Cannabis use was significantly associated with increased odds of developing any anxiety conditions (OR= 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.54). Cannabis use was not significantly associated with developing generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or social anxiety disorder. Review of studies not reportingORrevealed mixed results but are suggestive of a link between cannabis use and increased rates/severity of anxiety. Conclusions: Published evidence suggests that cannabis use is likely associated with increased risk of anxiety in the long term but variability of study designs precludes declaration of a causal relationship. Awareness of this association is of relevance for both clinical practice and mental health policy implementation.

AB  - Purpose Parenting practices represent important and modifiable factors for health and wellbeing in children and adolescents; however, strength and quality of studies examining relationships between parenting practices in childhood and risk of depression and anxiety in adolescence are unclear. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the longitudinal literature that describes these associations. Methods Six electronic databases were searched for articles published through March 2018. Eligible articles were published in the English language, peer-reviewed, and had prospective cohort study designs. Articles eligible for inclusion examined positive and negative parenting practices of parents and/or guardians when study subjects were between 0 and 9 years of age, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms when subjects were between 10 and 19 years of age. Heterogeneity of included articles precluded meta-analysis: findings were reported narratively. Results 4558 references were screened for inclusion, and 19 articles met eligibility criteria and were included for review. Ten articles examined positive parenting practices, and four demonstrated statistically significant associations between positive parenting practices and lower risk of adolescent depression, anxiety, and/or internalizing symptoms. Fifteen articles examined negative parenting practices, and five demonstrated significant associations between negative parenting practices and higher risk of adolescent depression, anxiety, and/or internalizing symptoms. Conclusion This review demonstrates that the evidence base supporting longitudinal associations between parenting practices in childhood and adolescent symptoms of depression, anxiety, and internalizing problems is inconsistent. Findings from this review highlight limitations of the existing literature and identify understudied parenting dimensions that require further investigation.

AB  - Antidepressants are prescribed for the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, however there is still controversy about whether they should be used in this population. This meta-review aimed to assess the effects of antidepressants for the acute treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders (ADs), autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), enuresis, major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents. Efficacy was measured as response to treatment (either as mean overall change in symptoms or as a dichotomous outcome) and tolerability was measured as the proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. Suicidality was measured as suicidal ideation, behavior (including suicide attempts) and completed suicide. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched (until 31 October 2019) for existing systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of double-blind randomized controlled trials. The quality of the included reviews was appraised using AMSTAR-2. Our meta-review included nine systematic reviews/meta-analyses (2 on ADHD; 1 on AD; 2 on ASD; 1 on enuresis; 1 on MDD, 1 on OCD and 1 on PTSD). In terms of efficacy this review found that, compared to placebo: fluoxetine was more efficacious in the treatment of MDD, fluvoxamine and paroxetine were better in the treatment of AD; fluoxetine and sertraline were more efficacious in the treatment of OCD; bupropion and desipramine improved clinician and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms; clomipramine and tianeptine were superior on some of the core symptoms of ASD; and no antidepressant was more efficacious for PTSD and enuresis. With regard to tolerability: imipramine, venlafaxine, and duloxetine were less well tolerated in MDD; no differences were found for any of the antidepressants in the treatment of anxiety disorders (ADs), ADHD, and PTSD; tianeptine and citalopram, but not clomipramine, were less well tolerated in children and adolescents with ASD. For suicidal behavior/ideation, venlafaxine (in MDD) and paroxetine (in AD) were associated with a significantly increased risk; by contrast, sertraline (in AD) was associated with a reduced risk. The majority of included systematic reviews/meta-analyses were rated as being of high or moderate in quality by the AMSTAR-2 critical appraisal tool (one and five, respectively). One included study was of low quality and two were of critically low quality. Compared to placebo, selected antidepressants can be efficacious in the acute treatment of some common psychiatric disorders, although statistically significant differences do not always translate into clinically significant results. Little information was available about tolerability of antidepressants in RCTs of OCD and in the treatment of ADHD, ASD, MDD, and PTSD. There is a paucity of data on suicidal ideation/behavior, but paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidality in the treatment of AD and venlafaxine for MDD. Findings from this review must be considered in light of potential limitations, such as the lack of comparative information about many antidepressants, the short-term outcomes and the quality of the available evidence.

AB  - Worldwide road traffic accidents have been increasing. Human behaviors and environmental factors are often responsible for such events. This being a serious public health concern, public health interventions are needed to minimize the rate of road traffic accidents. We aimed to identify broader human behaviors, sociodemographic factors, and environmental factors associated with the risk of road traffic accidents. We searched for the relevant studies in electronic database including PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and World Health Organization global health library. In addition, a manual search was also performed. Findings from scientific literature were presented in a summative form. Young age, male gender, speed, influence of substance, use of mobile phone, driving experience, temperament, attitude, aggression, stress, anxiety, emotionality, fatigue, lack of sleep, and road conditions were found closely associated with a risk of road traffic accidents. Despite having substantial driving training and ability to handling motor vehicles, professional drivers such as bus and taxi drivers are very vulnerable to road traffic accidents. This study reports that the increasing prevalence of road traffic accidents can be addressed significantly by applying behavior change theories. The health belief model was found useful in promoting safer driving.

AB  - South Asian countries report the highest prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) globally. This systematic review and meta-analysis report the pooled prevalence of CMDs among the South Asian countries. Database searches were conducted in eight electronic databases. Titles, abstracts, full-text screening, and extraction of data on the event rate of 17 indicators of CMDs were performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 160 studies were included and data analysis was done using the Comprehensive Meta-analysis Software (v.3). A prevalence of depressive symptoms was 26.4% among 173,449 participants, alcohol abuse was 12.9% (n = 107,893); anxiety 25.8% (n = 70,058); tobacco smoking 18.6% (n = 84,965); PTSD 17.2% (n = 42,298); mixed anxiety and depression 28.4% (n = 11,102); suicidal behaviors 6.4% (n = 25,043); misuse of opiates 0.8% (n = 37,304); tobacco chewing 21.0% (n = 10,586); use of cannabis 3% (n = 10,977); GAD 2.9% (n = 70,058); bipolar disorder 0.6% (n = 7,197); IV drug abuse 2.5% (n = 15,049); panic disorder 0.01% (n = 28,087); stimulant use 0.9% (n = 1,414); OCD 1.6% (n = 8,784) and phobic disorders 1.8% (n = 27,754). This study reported a high prevalence of CMDs in South Asian countries; necessitating further research on psychiatric epidemiology in those contexts. It informs the need for effective policymaking and implementation of culturally appropriate multilevel interventions.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health threat. The South-Asian (SA) countries have witnessed both the initial brunt of the outbreak as well as the ongoing rise of cases. Their unique challenges in relation to mental health during the pandemic are worth exploring. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted for all the original studies on the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on psychological health/well-being in the SA countries of the World Psychiatric Association Zone 16. PubMed, Google Scholar, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched till June 2020. Studies conducted in the age group of 18-60 years with a minimum sample size of 10, and statistically significant results were included. Results: Thirteen studies were included in the review. They showed increase prevalence in nonpsychotic depression, anxiety, somatic concerns, alcohol-related disorders, and insomnia in the general population. Psychological symptoms correlated more with physical complaints of fatigue and pain in older adults and were directly related to social media use, misinformation, xenophobia, and social distancing. Frontline workers reported guilt, stigma, anxiety, and poor sleep quality, which were related to the lack of availability of adequate personal protective equipment, increased workload, and discrimination. One study validated the Coronavirus anxiety scale in the Indian population while another explored gaming as a double-edged sword during the lockdown in adolescents. Another study from Bangladesh explored psychosexual health during lockdown. Most studies were cross-sectional online surveys, used screening tools and had limited accessibility. Conclusion: The ongoing COVID-19 crisis and its impact serve as an important period for adequate mental healthcare, promotion, research, and holistic biopsychosocial management of psychiatric disorders, especially in vulnerable groups. Mental healthcare and research strategies during the pandemic and preparedness for postpandemic aftermath are advocated subsequently.

AB  - Background: Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is commonly and increasingly used in America and worldwide and can include both pharmacologic (e.g., vitamins and supplements) and nonpharmacologic (e.g., yoga) interventions. These therapies may be of interest to patients who desire "natural" alternatives or complements to standard treatments. CAM may be used by patients, with or without supervision from a licensed medical professional, to treat psychiatric conditions. Objective: To provide an overview of more commonly used CAM interventions that have relevance to mental health care providers, particularly consultation-liaison psychiatrists, and to describe the indications, safety, and dosing of these treatments. Methods: We searched PubMed to identify articles that described the uses, safety, mechanisms, and recommendations for CAM therapies in relation to the treatment of psychiatric conditions. Articles most relevant to this review were included, with a preferential focus on meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Results: We summarized common CAM therapies that have shown efficacy for the treatment of psychiatric conditions. These therapies include natural medications, nutritional psychiatry, light therapy, yoga, and exercise. Conclusions: Certain CAM interventions may be effective as monotherapies and/or as adjunctive treatments for psychiatric conditions. However, they may also have safety risks, contraindications, and/or interactions with medications. It is therefore important for physicians and other mental health care professionals to inquire about patient use of CAM and to understand the indications, safety, and dosing of these therapies.

AB  - In this paper the scientific literature on the association between forests, stress relief and relaxation is reviewed with the purpose to understand common patterns of research, the main techniques used for analysis, findings relevant to forest-therapy-oriented management, and knowledge gaps. The database of studies was collected with a keyword search on the Web, which returned a set of 32 studies that were included in the analysis. The main findings and patterns were identified with a text mining analysis of the abstract to search for keyword patterns across studies. The analysis indicates that most studies compared rest and relaxation performances across urban and forest environments and used a combination of self-reported measure of stress or rest collected with validate scales, e.g., the Profile of Mood of States (POMS) and the Restoration Outcome Scale (ROS), and a minority-only set of these two groups of indicators. Results of this review indicate that primary studies identified a positive association between forest exposure and mental well-being, in particular when compared to urban environments, thus suggesting that forest are effective in lowering stress levels. This study found that, to date, the characteristics of forests and characteristics of the visit are little investigated in the literature. For this reason, more research with a focus on forest variables such as tree species composition, tree density and other variables affecting forest landscape should be further investigated to inform forest management. Similarly, the characteristics of the visits (e.g., length of visit and frequency) should be further explored to provide robust forest therapy guidelines.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that traffic noise may negatively impact mental health. However, existing systematic reviews provide an incomplete overview of the effects of all traffic noise sources on mental health. We conducted a systematic literature search and summarized the evidence for road, railway, or aircraft noise-related risks of depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and dementia among adults. We included 31 studies (26 on depression and/or anxiety disorders, 5 on dementia). The meta-analysis of five aircraft noise studies found that depression risk increased significantly by 12% per 10 dB L-DEN(Effect Size = 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.23). The meta-analyses of road (11 studies) and railway traffic noise (3 studies) indicated 2-3% (not statistically significant) increases in depression risk per 10 dB L-DEN. Results for road traffic noise related anxiety were similar. We did not find enough studies to meta-analyze anxiety and railway or aircraft noise, and dementia/ cognitive impairment and any traffic noise. In conclusion, aircraft noise exposure increases the risk for depression. Otherwise, we did not detect statistically significant risk increases due to road and railway traffic noise or for anxiety. More research on the association of cognitive disorders and traffic noise is required. Public policies to reduce environmental traffic noise might not only increase wellness (by reducing noise-induced annoyance), but might contribute to the prevention of depression and anxiety disorders.

AB  - Older adults in the United States have lower rates of mental health care utilization than young adults. To understand these lower rates of mental health care, we performed a systematic review, in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, of barriers that prevent older adults from seeking and accessing treatment. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Clinical Key to identify studies of barriers to mental health treatment in the older adult population (in individuals 50 y of age and older). Thirty-two articles met inclusion criteria (English language and focused on barriers to care in older adults) and exclusion criteria (focus on non-United States populations, focus on younger adults, or no focus on barriers to care). We identified 5 categories of barriers to mental health care in older adults: (1) attitudes and knowledge among older adults; (2) comorbid medical conditions; (3) provider-related factors; (4) other extrinsic barriers (eg, cost, transportation, reliance on caregivers); and (5) unique factors that affect older adults in minority populations. Large studies have primarily identified intrinsic barriers, including negative attitudes toward mental health care and lack of perceived need for treatment, as preventing older adults from seeking mental health care. Minority populations have also been found to face cultural barriers and increased levels of stigma compared with non-Hispanic whites, although several of the identified articles concerning barriers among minority older adults involved qualitative studies with small samples. Larger quantitative studies may help clarify the relative importance of barriers affecting this population. Interventions that have been shown to increase access to mental health services for older adults include community-based care and integrated primary and psychiatric care, but these strategies can be difficult to implement in low-resource settings. More research is needed to determine which interventions and policies are most effective in targeting particular barriers.

AB  - Background and aims: Mobile phone addiction (MPA) is frequently reported to be correlated with anxiety, depression, stress, impulsivity, and sleep quality among college students. However, to date, there is no consensus on the extent to which those factors are correlated with MPA among college students. We thus performed a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the previous findings. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and Chinese Biological Medicine (CBM) databases from inception to August 1, 2020. Pooled Pearson's correlation coefficients between MPA and anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and sleep quality were calculated by R software using random effects model. Results: Forty studies involving a total of 33, 650 college students were identified. Weak-to-moderate positive correlations were found between MPA and anxiety, depression, impulsivity and sleep quality (anxiety: summary r = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.34-0.45, P < 0.001, I-2 = 84.9%; depression: summary r = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.32-0.40, P < 0.001, I-2 = 84.2%; impulsivity: summary r = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.28-0.47, P < 0.001, I-2 = 94.7%; sleep quality: summary r = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.22-0.33, P < 0.001, I-2 = 85.6%). The pooled correlations revealed some discrepancies when stratified by some moderators. The robustness of our findings was further confirmed by sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis provided solid evidence that MPA was positively correlated with anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and sleep quality. This indicated that college students with MPA were more likely to develop high levels of anxiety, depression, and impulsivity and suffer from poor sleep quality. More studies, especially large prospective studies, are warranted to verify our findings.

AB  - Context: Worldwide outbreak of coronavirus has been declared by the World Health Organization as a global emergency. Quarantine, as one of the first important health measures to control and spread epidemic diseases, is the focus of health authorities and policymakers in most societies. This study was designed to obtain the psychological impact of quarantine and strategies to reduce it.
   Evidence Acquisition: This is a "narrative review" study done through advanced search with the keywords Quarantine, Homeisolation, COVID-19, Coronavirus, Mental Health, Psychological effect in the Scopus, Pumped, Clinical Key, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science databases from 2019-2020. The articles were included in the study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Systematic searching and screening of the titles resulted in 68 initial titles that decreased to 46 after reviewing the abstracts, and 19 articles were included in the final review.
   Results: Quarantine can lead to psychosocial problems from feeling lonely to depression and anxiety disorders. Certain counseling, as well as educational and supportive interventions, can make this situation tolerable.
   Conclusions: For acceptance and adherence to quarantine conditions, clear and transparent information about the disease and its prevalence and meeting the needs of people such as psychological, informational, and financial needs in each country are essential to reduce fear and anxiety.

AB  - Background: Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity; however, high rates of psychiatric comorbidity complicate bariatric surgery care. As a result, importance has been placed on the need for ongoing psychiatric support in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Given the lack of conclusive presurgery psychosocial predictors of postoperative mental health outcomes, studies have now shifted their focus to understand the long-term psychosocial sequalae that arise after surgery. Increasing evidence has demonstrated the potential for psychiatric care to stabilize psychiatric symptoms and minimize patient distress. Objective: To review psychopharmacological and psychological interventions for patients undergoing bariatric surgery and their impact on mental health and weight outcomes after surgery. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search in Ovid MEDLINE for studies examining the impact of psychopharmacological and psychological treatments on bariatric patients' postoperative mental health and weight outcomes. Results: Overall, 37 studies were included in the review. Preliminary evidence suggests that psychiatric medications do not negatively impact weight loss or health-related quality of life in the short term; however, more rigorous research designs are needed. There are insufficient data on specific psychiatric medications and long-term impact on weight loss and psychosocial outcomes. Postoperative psychological interventions have evidence for improving eating psychopathology, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; however, effects on weight loss remain unclear. Conclusion: Evidence for psychopharmacological and psychological treatments remains preliminary. Consideration should be given to integrated, stepped-care models to provide personalized psychiatric interventions after surgery. Future research on expanding current psychiatric interventions, timing of delivery, and predictors of response is needed.

AB  - In recent years, the number of patients with neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment) and mental disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety and schizophrenia) have increased dramatically. Researchers have found that complex network analysis can reveal the topology of brain functional networks, such as small-world, scale-free, etc. In the study of brain diseases, it has been found that these topologies have undergoed abnormal changes in different degrees. Therefore, the research of brain functional networks can not only provide a new perspective for understanding the pathological mechanism of neurological and psychiatric diseases, but also provide assistance for the early diagnosis. Focusing on the study of human brain functional networks, this paper reviews the research results in recent years. First, this paper introduces the background of the study of brain functional networks under complex network theory and the important role of topological properties in the study of brain diseases. Second, the paper describes how to construct a brain functional network using neural image data. Third, the common methods of functional network analysis, including network structure analysis and disease classification, are introduced. Fourth, the role of brain functional networks in pathological study, analysis and diagnosis of brain functional diseases is studied. Finally, the paper summarizes the existing studies of brain functional networks and points out the problems and future research directions.

AB  - Purpose Refugee and asylum-seeking women are particularly vulnerable to experiencing mental health difficulties during the perinatal period, with social factors compounding these experiences. Research is limited into the mental health needs of perinatal women who are refugees or seeking asylum. The purpose of this paper is to examine the best available international evidence on this topic and to discuss the findings with relevance to the UK context. Design/methodology/approach A modified population, intervention, comparison, outcome was used to formulate the research question and search strategy. Databases searched were: cumulative index of nursing and allied health literature, Medline, PsychINFO, Web of Science and Scopus. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis framework, results were screened against an inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each study underwent a quality assessment in which they were appraised using the mixed methods appraisal tool. Findings Eight papers were retrieved, and a thematic analysis was conducted. Two major themes were identified: mental health needs and social influences. Refugees and asylum seekers are likely to have experienced trauma as reasons for migration. Post-migration stressors, including hostility and dispersal from social networks, lead to cumulative trauma. These each add to the mental health needs of perinatal refugee and asylum-seeking women that cannot be ignored by policymakers, health and social care services or professionals. Originality/value Refugee and asylum-seeking women are particularly vulnerable to mental health difficulties in the perinatal period. Stressors accumulated pre-, during and post-migration to the host country exacerbate mental distress. In the UK, the treatment of this population may be detrimental to their mental health, prompting the need for greater critical awareness of the socioecological environment that refugee or asylum-seeking women experience.

AB  - Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a commonly reported and serious complication among people living with HIV (PLWH). PTSD may significantly increase unintentional non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to pool the observational studies exploring the association between PTSD and medication adherence among PLWH. Methods Comprehensive searches were conducted in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and ProQuest to identify relevant articles and dissertations. A random effects meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting was used to summarize the odds ratio (OR) across studies. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were also carried out to assess the moderation effects for potential factors. Results By synthesizing 12 studies comprising 2489 participants, the pooled odd ratio of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy was 1.19 (95% confidential interval (CI), 1.03-1.37,p= 0.02). No significant publication bias was detected by Egger's test (Intercept = 0.842,p= 0.284). Factors moderating the association were mean age of participants, depression adjustment, and depression (allp< 0.05). Conclusions This meta-analysis supports that PTSD is related to adherence in PLWH. The hypothesized mechanisms (avoidant behavior and cognitive impairment) underlying this association need further investigation. Overall, this study highlights that clinicians should thoughtfully integrate timely mental health intervention into routine care.

AB  - Test anxiety is a widespread and mostly detrimental emotion in learning and achievement settings. Thus, it is a construct of high interest for researchers and its measurement is an important issue. So far, test anxiety has typically been assessed using self-report measures. However, physiological measures (e.g., heart rate or skin conductance level) have gained increasing attention in educational research, as they allow for an objective and often continuous assessment of students' physiological arousal (i.e., the physiological component of test anxiety) in real-life situations, such as a test. Although theoretically one would assume self-report measures of test anxiety and objective physiological measures would converge, empirical evidence is scarce and findings have been mixed. To achieve a more coherent picture of the relationship between these measures, this systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether higher self-reported test anxiety is associated with expected increases in objectively measured physiological arousal. A systematic literature search yielded an initial 231 articles, and a structured selection process identified 29 eligible articles, comprising 31 studies, which met the specified inclusion criteria and provided sufficient information about the relationship under investigation. In line with theoretical models, in 21 out of the 31 included studies, there was a significant positive relationship between self-reported test anxiety and physiological arousal. The strengths of these correlations were of medium size. Moderators influencing the relation between these two measures are discussed, along with implications for the assessment of physiological data in future classroom-based research on test anxiety.

AB  - Insomnia is a common problem, affecting individuals' health and quality of life. Among several therapies used to treat this condition, spiritual interventions are suggested to have beneficial outcomes on sleep disturbances. Nevertheless, a systematic compilation of the evidence available is still needed in the literature in order to scientifically investigate the topic. To examine the most common spiritual interventions proposed to treat sleep disorders and to assess the scientific evidence of these interventions. This is a scoping literature review conducted by independent researchers on the following databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and OpenGrey. A boolean expression was used, and all studies published in the last 5 years investigating the role of spiritual or religious interventions on insomnia were included. From a total of 3257 articles retrieved in our search, ten studies were included in the final analysis. There is a wide array of techniques used to treat insomnia or the mental disorders associated with insomnia, such as mantra, yoga, mindfulness, praying/meditation, daily spiritual experiences, psycho-religious training and intervention. The included studies showed a positive influence of spiritual/religious interventions on insomnia directly and indirectly. However, there is a scarcity of clinical trials and most studies have small sample sizes and used only subjective measures, resulting in a low evidence. The results of the present review point to a promising role of spirituality and religion on better sleep outcomes, particularly in the improvement in insomnia. However, the heterogeneity and the quality of these studies suggest caution while interpreting these findings. More clinical trials are needed in this area to provide a recommendation of these methods in clinical practice.

AB  - Introduction:Social media has become an integrated part of daily life, with an estimated 3 billion social media users worldwide. Adolescents and young adults are the most active users of social media. Research on social media has grown rapidly, with the potential association of social media use and mental health and well-being becoming a polarized and much-studied subject. The current body of knowledge on this theme is complex and difficult-to-follow. The current paper presents a scoping review of the published literature in the research field of social media use and its association with mental health and well-being among adolescents. Methods and Analysis:First, relevant databases were searched for eligible studies with a vast range of relevant search terms for social media use and mental health and well-being over the past five years. Identified studies were screened thoroughly and included or excluded based on prior established criteria. Data from the included studies were extracted and summarized according to the previously published study protocol. Results:Among the 79 studies that met our inclusion criteria, the vast majority (94%) were quantitative, with a cross-sectional design (57%) being the most common study design. Several studies focused on different aspects of mental health, with depression (29%) being the most studied aspect. Almost half of the included studies focused on use of non-specified social network sites (43%). Of specified social media, Facebook (39%) was the most studied social network site. The most used approach to measuring social media use was frequency and duration (56%). Participants of both genders were included in most studies (92%) but seldom examined as an explanatory variable. 77% of the included studies had social media use as the independent variable. Conclusion:The findings from the current scoping review revealed that about 3/4 of the included studies focused on social media and some aspect of pathology. Focus on the potential association between social media use and positive outcomes seems to be rarer in the current literature. Amongst the included studies, few separated between different forms of (inter)actions on social media, which are likely to be differentially associated with mental health and well-being outcomes.

AB  - Even though suicidal attempt among medical students is a major public health concern, there are no prior studies that reported its consolidated magnitude worldwide. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic review is the first to quantitatively analyze the prevalence of suicidal attempts among medical students. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for English language articles that assessed the prevalence of suicide attempts among medical students. A random-effect meta-analysis was used to combine data from individual studies. The heterogeneity across the studies was evaluated using Cochran's Q- and the I(2)test. We assessed publication bias using Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots. A total of 14 articles were selected for meta-analysis according to the PRISMA guideline. The pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal attempt was found to be 2.19% (95% CI; 1.17-4.07). The pooled one-year prevalence was estimated to be 1.64 (95% CI; 0.60-4.45). The estimated prevalence of suicidal attempt was considerably high among medical studies in low and middle-income countries than medical studies in high-income countries. The estimated prevalence of suicidal attempt also varies by gender of participants Given the high prevalence estimate of suicidal attempt among medical students and its potential in resulting death by suicide, early identification, and interventions should be considered among medical students.

AB  - Fatigue and anhedonia are commonly reported, co-occurring clinical symptoms associated with chronic illnesses. Fatigue is a multidimensional construct that is defined as a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, cognitive, or emotional tiredness that interferes with usual functioning. Anhedonia is a component of depressive disorders and other psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, and is defined by the reduced ability to experience pleasure. Both symptoms greatly affect the health-related quality of life of patients with chronic illnesses. Although fatigue and anhedonia are commonly associated with each other, understanding the differences between the two constructs is necessary for diagnosis and clinical treatment. A scoping review was conducted based on published guidance, starting with a comprehensive search of existing literature to understand the similarities and differences between fatigue and anhedonia. An initial search of PubMed using fatigue and anhedonia as medical subject headings yielded a total of 5254 articles. A complete full-text review of the final 21 articles was conducted to find articles that treated both constructs similarly and articles that presented fatigue and anhedonia as distinct constructs. About 60% of the reviewed articles consider both constructs as distinct, but a considerable number of the reviewed articles found these constructs indistinguishable. Nomenclature and biology were two themes from the reviewed articles supporting the idea that anhedonia and fatigue are indistinguishable constructs. The information generated from this review is clinically relevant to optimize the management of fatigue related to anhedonia from other fatigue subtypes.

AB  - Background People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face many psychosocial challenges throughout life, highlighting the need for programs and resources promoting psychosocial wellbeing. Indigenous peoples with ASD and/or other neurodevelopmental disorders must overcome cultural and social barriers to access such supports. This study aimed to identify psychosocial programs and resources developed world-wide for this population by systematically reviewing research evaluating programs aiming to promote the psychosocial wellbeing of this population and/or their caregivers; and collating and reviewing resources developed to promote their psychosocial wellbeing. Methods Searches were last conducted in December 2019. The systematic review searched 28 electronic databases, and 25 electronic databases were searched for resources promoting psychosocial wellbeing. Additional published and unpublished studies were identified from relevant reviews, authors of eligible articles, and experts working in Indigenous Health. Articles and resources were screened for inclusion using pre-defined criteria. Articles included in the systematic review were assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. The diversity and paucity of outcomes reported precluded pooling of study findings for meta-analysis. Results Seven articles situated in the USA (2), Canada (3) and Australia (2); and eleven resources developed in Australia (9), Canada (1) and New Zealand (1) met inclusion criteria. All articles showed some promising findings for improving psychosocial wellbeing for Indigenous children with ASD and/or another neurodevelopmental disorder, and 5 of 7 evaluated the cultural adaptation of an existing evidence-based program for an Indigenous population. However, methodological quality was moderate or low (57% and 43% of articles respectively) and no studies had adult participants. The psychosocial wellbeing supports provided by the 11 resources included psychoeducation, community support, and services/workshops. Conclusions Despite the paucity of research and resources found, important exemplars demonstrate that existing programs can be adapted to support Indigenous people with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. While future policy should endeavour to facilitate Indigenous people's access to support services, and encourage researchers to develop and evaluate programs promoting psychosocial wellbeing for this population, given complexities of designing and evaluating new programs, careful and appropriate cultural adaptations of existing evidence-based programs would increase feasibility of ongoing research without compromising outcomes.

AB  - Background:Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a biological and mood disorder with a seasonal pattern. Dietary intervention and nutritional status have been reported to affect SAD severity. The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence of associations between SAD and diet, eating behavior, and nutrition intervention. Methods:We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from inception up to July 1, 2019. Studies that examined diet and eating behaviors in SAD patients and tests of nutrition interventions for SAD were included. Two independent investigators extracted data based on study designs, participants, outcomes, exposures, and association measures. Results:Eleven studies were included: six studies examined distinctive dietary patterns and eating behaviors in SAD patients and five studies explored the efficacy of nutrition interventions for SAD. Vegetarianism and alcoholism were associated with higher SAD prevalence, but normal alcohol intake was not correlated with SAD severity. Compared with non-clinical subjects, SAD patients tended to consume significantly larger dinners and more evening snacks during weekdays and weekends and exhibit a higher frequency of binge eating, external eating, and emotional eating. Additionally, compared to healthy controls, SAD patients presented more cravings for starch-rich food and food with high fiber. However, neither the ingestion of carbohydrate-loaded meals nor Vitamin D/B12 supplementation showed benefit for SAD. Conclusion:Studies suggest that SAD patients may exhibit distinctive diet preferences and eating behaviors, but no current nutrition intervention has demonstrated efficacy for ameliorating SAD symptoms. Further evidence is needed from randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer durations.

AB  - Key PointsQuestionDo psychosocial stressors at work increase the risk of sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder? FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, psychosocial stressors at work were associated with an elevated risk of sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder. The risk was up to 76% higher among workers exposed to these work stressors compared with nonexposed workers. MeaningGiven that psychosocial stressors at work are frequent and modifiable, physicians should be aware of their importance when evaluating their patients' mental health and work capacity.
   ImportanceMental health problems are associated with considerable occupational, medical, social, and economic burdens. Psychosocial stressors at work have been associated with a higher risk of mental disorders, but the risk of sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder, indicating a more severe condition, has never been investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis. ObjectiveTo synthesize the evidence of the association of psychosocial stressors at work with sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder among adult workers. Data SourcesSeven electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, and International Bibliography of the Social Sciences), 3 gray literature databases (Grey Literature Report, WHO-IRIS and Open Grey), and the reference lists of all eligible studies and reviews were searched in January 2017 and updated in February 2019. Study SelectionOnly original prospective studies evaluating the association of at least 1 psychosocial stressor at work from the 3 most recognized theoretical models were eligible: the job demand-control-support model, including exposure to job strain (high psychological demands with low job control); effort-reward imbalance model; and organizational justice model. Study selection was performed in duplicate by blinded independent reviewers. Among the 28467 citations screened, 23 studies were eligible for systematic review. Data Extraction and SynthesisThis meta-analysis followed the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Data extraction and risk of bias evaluation, using the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies-Interventions tool, were performed in duplicate by blinded independent reviewers. Data were pooled using random-effect models. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSickness absence due to a mental disorder with a diagnosis obtained objectively. ResultsA total of 13 studies representing 130056 participants were included in the 6 meta-analyses. Workers exposed to low reward were associated with a higher risk of sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder compared with nonexposed workers (pooled risk ratio [RR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.49-2.08]), as were those exposed to effort-reward imbalance (pooled RR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.37-2.00]), job strain (pooled RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.24-1.74]), low job control (pooled RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.02-1.53]), and high psychological demands (pooled RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.04-1.45]). Conclusions and RelevanceThis meta-analysis found that workers exposed to psychosocial stressors at work were associated with a higher risk of sickness absence due to a mental disorder. A better understanding of the importance of these stressors could help physicians when evaluating their patients' mental health and work capacity.
   This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the association of psychosocial stressors at work with sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder among adult workers.

AB  - Introduction: Facial palsy is often associated with impaired facial function and altered appearance. However, the literature with regards to the psychological adjustment of children and adolescents with facial palsy has not been systematically reviewed to date. This paper aimed to review all published research with regards to psychosocial adjustment for children and adolescents with facial palsy. Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsychInfo and AMED databases were searched and data was extracted with regards to participant characteristics, study methodology, outcome measures used, psychosocial adjustment and study quality. Results: Five studies were eligible for inclusion, all of which investigated psychosocial adjustment in participants with Moebius syndrome, a form of congenital facial palsy. Many parents reported their children to have greater social difficulties than general population norms, with difficulties potentially increasing with age. Other areas of psychosocial adjustment, including behaviour, anxiety and depression, were found to be more comparable to the general population. Discussion: Children and adolescents with Moebius syndrome may experience social difficulties. However, they also demonstrate areas of resilience. Further research including individuals with facial palsy of other aetiologies is required in order to determine the psychosocial adjustment of children and adolescents with facial palsy.

AB  - This review was conducted to explore the bi-directional association of maternal depression with diet. This link is hypothesized because the mental health of pregnant women may adversely affect their nutritional intake; or inversely, that poor nutritional intake during pregnancy may cause mental health issues. Seven electronic databases were searched to retrieve relevant peer-reviewed articles published during 2000-2018. Primary research studies published in English that evaluated the relationship between maternal antenatal and postnatal depression with dietary intake were selected. We screened 1585 articles, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria. These included five cohort studies (including two birth cohorts) and eight cross-sectional studies representing a total of 12,742 participants altogether. Studies were divided into five groups depending on whether they analyzed all nutrients, micronutrients, dietary patterns, dietary behavior or intake of fish and vegetables.
   The studies exploring the association of depression with dietary patterns found a protective association of "Health Conscious", "Healthy" and "Brazilian" diet patterns with maternal depression. The group of studies which analyzed all nutrients, found an inverse relationship of the "Healthy Eating Index" with maternal depression. Deficiency of calcium, iron, and folate were also associated with maternal depression. Prenatal and early postpartum eating attitudes and BMI were found as predictors of depressive symptoms in the late postpartum period in a diet behavior study. It is important to identify modifiable lifestyle risk factors which may contribute to maternal depression. A limitations of our review is the absence of meta-analysis which was not possible due to heterogeneity of the studies.

AB  - The aim was to systematically review the relationship between muscular strength (MS) and depression symptoms (DS) among adults, and conduct a meta-analysis to determine the pooled odds ratio (OR) for the relationship between MS and DS. The strategies employed in this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies published up to December 2019 were systematically identified by searching in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases. Inclusion criteria were: (1) cross-sectional, longitudinal and intervention studies; (2) outcomes included depression or DS; (3) participants were adults and older adults; and (4) the articles were published in English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish. A total of 21 studies were included in the review, totalling 87,508 adults aged >= 18 years, from 26 countries. The systematic review findings suggest that MS has a positive effect on reducing DS. Meta-analysis findings indicate that MS is inversely and significantly related to DS 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.89). Interventions aiming to improve MS have the potential to promote mental health and prevent depression. Thus, public health professionals could use MS assessment and improvement as a strategy to promote mental health and prevent depression.

AB  - Bipolar disorders have an onset in late adolescence or early adulthood and patients may experience alternating episodes of mania and depression, with euthymic periods interspersed between these extremes of mood. Clinical research studies have shown that bipolar disorder patients exhibit disruptions in circadian and seasonal rhythms, even when they are symptom free. In addition, some bipolar patients display pronounced seasonal patterns in occurrence of manic and depressive episodes, time of year for disease onset, and age of onset. Several groups have emphasized the impact of seasonal changes in sunlight intensity on bipolar disorder, especially in locations farther from the equator. In this paper, we examine rate of change of solar insolation during the spring and fall in locations that vary in their distance from the equator and propose that seasonal changes in sunlight intensity may be tracked by the suprachiasmatic nucleus and affect disease onset and progression in seasonally susceptible bipolar patients.

AB  - The two most prevalent substance use disorders involve alcohol and nicotine, which are often co-abused. Robust preclinical and translational evidence indicates that individuals initiate drug use for the acute rewarding effects of the substance. The development of negative emotional states is key for the transition from recreational use to substance use disorders as subjects seek the substance to obtain relief from the negative emotional states of acute withdrawal and protracted abstinence. The neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a major regulator of the brain stress system and key in the development of negative affective states. The present review examines the role of CRF in preclinical models of alcohol and nicotine abuse and explores links between CRF and anxiety-like, dysphoria-like, and other negative affective states. Finally, the present review discusses preclinical models of nicotine and alcohol use with regard to the CRF system, advances in molecular and genetic manipulations of CRF, and the importance of examining both males and females in this field of research.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are prevalent and highly disabling mental disorders. In recent years, intensive efforts focused on the search for potential neuroimaging, genetic, and peripheral biomarkers in order to better understand the pathophysiology of these disorders, support their diagnosis, and characterize the treatment response. Of note, peripheral blood biomarkers, as surrogates for the central nervous system, represent a promising instrument to characterize psychiatric disorders, although their role has not been extensively applied to clinical practice. In this report, the state of the art on peripheral biomarkers of DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) Anxiety Disorders is presented, in order to examine their role in the pathogenesis of these conditions and their potential application for diagnosis and treatment. Available data on the cerebrospinal fluid and blood-based biomarkers related to neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, neurotrophic factors, and the inflammation and immune system are reviewed. Despite the wide scientific literature and the promising results in the field, only a few of the proposed peripheral biomarkers have been defined as a specific diagnostic instrument or have been identified as a guide in the treatment response to DSM-5 Anxiety Disorders. Therefore, further investigations are needed to provide new biological insights into the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders, to help in their diagnosis, and to tailor a treatment.

AB  - This study was a quantitative meta-analysis of empirical research on the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and academic performance (AP) that included the three main theoretical models of EI. We conducted a computerized literature search in the main electronic databases. Forty-four of an initial 3,210 articles met the inclusion criteria. With 49 effect sizes and a cumulative sample size of 19,861 participants, we found significant heterogeneity indices indicating a variety of results. In general, the results of this study indicated a significant effect of EI on AP (Z over bar = 0.26). Average association between EI and AP was higher in studies measured EI as ability (Z over bar = 0.31), than studies measured EI as self-report (Z over bar = 0.24), and self-report mixed EI (Z over bar = 0.26). In the educational field, this meta-analysis provides information on the specific role of EI as a function of used measures. Some practical implications are discussed.

AB  - The stressful experiences that many asylum seekers and refugees (AS&R) are exposed to during forced migration, and during resettlement in host countries, can have a profound impact on their mental health. Comparatively less research attention has been allocated to exploring other indices of quality of life (QoL) in AS&R populations. This review aimed to (i) synthesize the predictors and correlates of QoL of AS&R populations in high-income countries, and (ii) to identify the methodological strengths and weaknesses of this body of research. Fourteen databases were systematically searched (Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Health Technology Assessment, National Health Service Economic Evaluation, Educational Resource Index and s, BiblioMap, Scopus, Social Sciences Citation Index, Evidence Aid, DARE, Web of Science and PubMed). Eligibility criteria included: adults seeking asylum or refuge in a high-income country, primary quantitative data, the use of a measure based on the WHO's definition of QoL, published in a peer-reviewed journal. A narrative synthesis approach was used, and the quality was assessed using the AXIS tool for cross-sectional studies and the CASP tool for longitudinal studies. Of the 13.656 papers identified, 23 met the eligibility criteria. A wide range of factors were found to have significant associations with QoL. Both positive and negative correlates of QoL were largely dominated by social (e.g. social networks) and mental health factors (e.g. depression). Although all of the cross-sectional studies met over half of the quality criteria, only 12 met 75% or more of these criteria. For the longitudinal studies, for all but one study lacked statistical precision and the results cannot be applied to the local population. Key findings across the various forms of QoL (overall, physical, psychological, social and environmental) were that having established social networks and social integration were associated with higher QoL, whereas having mental disorders (i.e. PTSD or depression) was strongly associated with reduced QoL. More research is needed into physical and environmental predictors and correlates of QoL. The findings of the review can be used to inform policies and interventions aimed at supporting AS&R and promoting the integration and wellbeing of these populations.

AB  - While African American and Hispanic adolescents and young adults living in the USA are exposed to myriad stressors that may increase their risk for mental health difficulties, few studies have examined nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among these youth. The purpose of this systematic review was to critically examine and synthesize current literature on NSSI among these understudied youth. Using multiple search terms related to NSSI, race/ethnicity, and developmental stage, electronic literature searches of PubMed, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar databases retrieved 3036 relevant articles published in the English language between 2000 and 2018; manual reference checks yielded an additional 17 articles. Ultimately, a total of 52 full-text studies were assessed for eligibility, and 15 articles were included in the present review. Although the majority of studies reported higher prevalence of NSSI among non-Hispanic White youth, evidence suggests that African American males are also at high risk of engaging in self-harm. Emotional dysregulation emerged as a common risk factor, while social support and feelings of connection were protective for some African American and Hispanic youth. Although racism and discrimination were not linked to NSSI in the reviewed studies, this remains an important area of future research for prevention and intervention efforts.

AB  - BackgroundDepression is highly prevalent among Haemodialysis (HD) patients and is known to results in a series of adverse outcomes and poor quality of life (QoL). Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to improve depressive symptoms and QoL in other chronic illness, there is uncertainty in terms of the effectiveness of CBT in HD patients with depression or depressive symptoms.MethodsAll randomised controlled trials relevant to the topic were retrieved from the following databases: CINHAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and CENTRAL. The grey literature, specific journals, reference lists of included studies and trials registers website were also searched. Data was extracted or calculated from included studies that had measured depression and quality of life using valid and reliable tools -this included mean differences or standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to identify the methodological quality of the included studies.ResultsSix RCTs were included with varying methodological quality. Meta-analysis was undertaken for 3 studies that employed the CBT versus usual care. All studies showed that the depressive symptoms significantly improved after the CBT. Furthermore, CBT was more effective than usual care (MD=-5.28, 95%CI -7.9 to -2.65, P=0.37) and counselling (MD=-2.39, 95%CI -3.49 to -1.29), while less effective than sertraline (MD=2.2, 95%CI 0.43 to 3.97) in alleviating depressive symptoms. Additionally, the CBT seems to have a beneficial effect in improving QoL when compared with usual care, while no significant difference was found in QoL score when compared CBT with sertraline.ConclusionsCBT may improve depressive symptoms and QoL in HD patients with comorbid depressive symptoms. However, more rigorous studies are needed in this field due to the small quantity and varied methodological quality in the identified studies.

KW  - SARS
AB  - Background: Covid-19 has started to spread within China since the end of December 2019. Despite government's immediate actions and strict control, more and more people were infected every day. As such a contagious virus can spread easily and rapidly between people, the whole country was put into lockdown and people were forced into isolation. In order to understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health well-being, Chinese researchers have conducted several studies. However, no consistent results were obtained. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted. Methods:We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to find literature from December 2019 to April 2020 related to Covid-19 and mental health, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews and case reports were excluded. The incidence of anxiety and depression in the population was synthesized and discussed. Results:A total of 27,475 subjects were included in 12 studies. Random effect model is used to account for the data. The results showed that the incidence of anxiety was 25% (95% CI: 0.19-0.32), and the incidence of depression was 28% (95% CI: 0.17-0.38). Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these incidence estimates. Subgroup analysis included the study population and assessment tools, and sensitivity analysis was done to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Conclusions:Owing to the significant heterogeneity detected in studies regarding this pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression, we must interpret the results with caution. As the epidemic is ongoing, it is vital to set up a comprehensive crisis prevention system, which integrating epidemiological monitoring, screening and psychological crisis prevention and interventions.

AB  - Purpose There have been strides in workplace incivility (WI), but in what direction, angles and theoretical streams are they taking place? In light of it, the purpose of this review is to analyze the overall WI research output yielded in the initial decades of this century. Design/methodology/approach This investigation searched exclusively for empirical articles written in English that matched the terms incivility and WI in the websites of prominent peer-review publications covering the period of 19 years (i.e. 2000-2019). As a result, 93 peer-reviewed empirical studies were properly gathered and classified. Findings WI is one of the most relevant topics in OB studies under scrutiny in this moment. Corroborating such a perception is the huge amount of outlets that have been publishing about WI. In this sense, it is a topic that has gained strong interdisciplinary status, given the manifested interest of very distinct areas. Cross-sectional studies have prevailed in terms of method preferences, yet other approaches have been used. Of noteworthy is the shortage of qualitative and meta-analytic studies. Data provided evidence that a very limited number of nations (only 18 countries) have been investigated and it is not exactly surprising that the United States be the target of the majority of studies in this field. The antecedents and consequences of WI are the major focus of the investigations. But I found some evidence that that WI has been tested as performing the role of measure, mediator and moderator. Research limitations/implications It focused exclusively on peer-review journals and articles written in English. Originality/value This endeavor contributes to the theory of WI by encompassing crucial aspects such as time horizon, major outlets, study types, country-level output, samples features, constructs perused, theoretical function of WI and research outcomes. In addition, it points out new potential research streams.

AB  - Background Treatment in bipolar disorder (BD) is commonly applied as a multimodal therapy based on decision algorithms that lack an integrative understanding of molecular mechanisms or a biomarker associated clinical outcome measure. Pharmacogenetics/genomics study the individual genetic variation associated with drug response. This selective review of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenomic testing (PGT) in BD will focus on candidate genes and genome wide association studies of pharmacokinetic drug metabolism and pharmacodynamic drug response/adverse event, and the potential role of decision support tools that incorporate multiple genotype/phenotype drug recommendations. Main body We searched PubMed from January 2013 to May 2019, to identify studies reporting on BD and pharmacogenetics, pharmacogenomics and PGT. Studies were selected considering their contribution to the field. We summarize our findings in: targeted candidate genes of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways, genome-wide association studies and, PGT platforms, related to BD treatment. This field has grown from studies of metabolizing enzymes (i.e., pharmacokinetics) and drug transporters (i.e., pharmacodynamics), to untargeted investigations across the entire genome with the potential to merge genomic data with additional biological information. Conclusions The complexity of BD genetics and, the heterogeneity in BD drug-related phenotypes, are important considerations for the design and interpretation of BD PGT. The clinical applicability of PGT in psychiatry is in its infancy and is far from reaching the robust impact it has in other medical disciplines. Nonetheless, promising findings are discovered with increasing frequency with remarkable relevance in neuroscience, pharmacology and biology.

AB  - Behavioral therapy (BT) and exercise are efficacious treatments for depression and anxiety when employed separately. The combination of BT and exercise (BT+Ex) may augment improvements but the combined effect of these therapies is not fully elucidated. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine if BT+Ex yielded a significant reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms compared to BT alone (BT). Randomized controlled studies published prior to September 2019 were searched among several databases (PUBMED, MEDLINE, PsychArticle, and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials). Studies that measured depression and anxiety symptoms following BT+Ex vs. BT were extracted and analyzed. The effect of these therapies on depression and anxiety were analyzed. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of exercise intensity (moderate and high), exercise type (aerobic and combined exercise), and baseline levels of depression. The moderating effects of gender, age, and treatment duration were performed. Data were extracted from 18 studies (1686 participants, mean age = 47 years, 65% female). There was a significant effect of BT+Ex on symptoms of depression. The effect of BT+Ex was significant for moderate intensity exercise and elevated baseline levels of depression. Age moderated the effect for depression. There was a significant effect of BT+Ex on depressive symptoms in humans. Exercise intensity and elevated depressive symptoms may play a role in the effect of exercise.

   Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched from June 2018 to September 2018. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted.
   Results: Twenty-one studies were included in qualitative synthesis, and 10 studies were included in meta-analysis. MBIs are effective with an overall moderate effect size (Hedges' g = 0.70) in improving well-being in people with MS, with lasting effects at the follow-up (g = 0.55). In particular, MBIs demonstrated to highly reduce stress (g = 1.07) and to improve depression and anxiety symptoms with a moderate to large effect at postintervention (g = 0.77 and g = 0.63, respectively).
   Conclusions: MBIs represent a valid and effective mind-body intervention to improve the well-being of patients with MS. Further studies should investigate which components of MBIs could be more beneficial for patients with progressive MS.

AB  - Objective: Population neuroscience is an emerging field that combines epidemiology and neuroscience to study how genes and the environment shape typical and atypical brain functioning. The objective of this study was to review key studies on population neuroscience from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and to identify potential gaps vis-a-vis studies conducted in high-income countries.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review to search for longitudinal cohort studies investigating the development of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents in LMICs. We performed an electronic search in the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases from inception to July 5th, 2019.
   Results: We found six cohorts from four countries that met our search criteria: three cohorts from Brazil, one from China, one from South Africa, and one from Mauritius. Relevant examples of findings from these studies are reported.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the impact of the valuable science output these cohort designs promote, allowing LMICs to have a share in frontline global psychiatry research. National and international funding agencies should invest in LMIC population neuroscience in order to promote replication and generalization of research from high-income countries.

AB  - Importance Detection, prognosis, and indicated interventions in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) are key components of preventive psychiatry. Objective To provide a comprehensive, evidence-based systematic appraisal of the advancements and limitations of detection, prognosis, and interventions for CHR-P individuals and to formulate updated recommendations. Evidence Review Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, and Ovid/PsychINFO were searched for articles published from January 1, 2013, to June 30, 2019, to identify meta-analyses conducted in CHR-P individuals. MEDLINE was used to search the reference lists of retrieved articles. Data obtained from each article included first author, year of publication, topic investigated, type of publication, study design and number, sample size of CHR-P population and comparison group, type of comparison group, age and sex of CHR-P individuals, type of prognostic assessment, interventions, quality assessment (using AMSTAR [Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews]), and key findings with their effect sizes. Findings In total, 42 meta-analyses published in the past 6 years and encompassing 81 outcomes were included. For the detection component, CHR-P individuals were young (mean [SD] age, 20.6 [3.2] years), were more frequently male (58%), and predominantly presented with attenuated psychotic symptoms lasting for more than 1 year before their presentation at specialized services. CHR-P individuals accumulated several sociodemographic risk factors compared with control participants. Substance use (33% tobacco use and 27% cannabis use), comorbid mental disorders (41% with depressive disorders and 15% with anxiety disorders), suicidal ideation (66%), and self-harm (49%) were also frequently seen in CHR-P individuals. CHR-P individuals showed impairments in work (Cohen d = 0.57) or educational functioning (Cohen d = 0.21), social functioning (Cohen d = 1.25), and quality of life (Cohen d = 1.75). Several neurobiological and neurocognitive alterations were confirmed in this study. For the prognosis component, the prognostic accuracy of CHR-P instruments was good, provided they were used in clinical samples. Overall, risk of psychosis was 22% at 3 years, and the risk was the highest in the brief and limited intermittent psychotic symptoms subgroup (38%). Baseline severity of attenuated psychotic (Cohen d = 0.35) and negative symptoms (Cohen d = 0.39) as well as low functioning (Cohen d = 0.29) were associated with an increased risk of psychosis. Controlling risk enrichment and implementing sequential risk assessments can optimize prognostic accuracy. For the intervention component, no robust evidence yet exists to favor any indicated intervention over another (including needs-based interventions and control conditions) for preventing psychosis or ameliorating any other outcome in CHR-P individuals. However, because the uncertainty of this evidence is high, needs-based and psychological interventions should still be offered. Conclusions and Relevance This review confirmed recent substantial advancements in the detection and prognosis of CHR-P individuals while suggesting that effective indicated interventions need to be identified. This evidence suggests a need for specialized services to detect CHR-P individuals in primary and secondary care settings, to formulate a prognosis with validated psychometric instruments, and to offer needs-based and psychological interventions.
   Question What is the status of current clinical knowledge in the detection, prognosis, and interventions for individuals at risk of psychosis? Findings In this review of 42 meta-analyses encompassing 81 outcomes, detecting individuals at risk for psychosis required knowledge of their specific sociodemographic, clinical, functional, cognitive, and neurobiological characteristics, and predicting outcomes was achieved with good accuracy provided that assessment tools were used in clinical samples. Evidence for specific effective interventions for this patient population is currently insufficient. Meaning Findings of this review suggest that, although clinical research knowledge for psychosis prevention is substantial and detecting and formulating a prognosis in individuals at risk for psychosis are possible, further research is needed to identify specific effective interventions in individuals with sufficient risk enrichment.
   This review synthesizes research findings from 42 meta-analyses that assessed detection, prognosis, and interventions for the prevention of psychosis and offers updated practice recommendations.

AB  - Background Interest in delivering psychological interventions within schools to facilitate early intervention is increasing. However, most reviews have focused on universal or preventative programmes rather than interventions designed to decrease existing symptoms of depression or anxiety. This paper aims to provide a meta-analytic review of randomised controlled trials of indicated psychological interventions for young people aged 10-19 with elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Methods Eight electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to April 2019 for eligible trials. Study quality was assessed using two scales designed to evaluate psychotherapy intervention trials. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted separately for trials that recruited participants based on symptoms of depression and based on symptoms of anxiety. Results Data from 45 trials were analysed. Most interventions studied used cognitive and behavioural strategies. Few studies met methodological quality criteria, but effect size was not associated with study quality. Indicated school-based interventions had a small effect on reducing depression symptoms (SMD = .34, 95% CI -0.48, -0.21) and a medium effect on reducing anxiety symptoms (SMD = -.49, 95% CI -0.79, -0.19) immediately postintervention. Subgroup analyses indicated that interventions delivered by internal school staff did not have significant effects on symptoms. Reductions in depression were maintained at short-term (<= 6 months) but not medium (>6 months <= 12) or long-term (>12-month) follow-up. Reductions in anxiety symptoms were not maintained at any follow-up. Conclusions Indicated school-based interventions are effective at reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents immediately postintervention but there is little evidence that these reductions are maintained. Interventions delivered by school staff are not supported by the current evidence base. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials incorporating assessment of longer-term outcomes are needed to justify increased investment in school-based interventions for adolescent depression and anxiety.

AB  - Purpose There is no review on the effect of work-related stressors on mental health of young workers. We systematically reviewed epidemiological evidence on this relationship. Methods The review searched eight databases: Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Informit, PsycINFO, and Scopus from their respective start dates until May 2017. Studies that have examined a mental health outcome in relation to a work-related stressor as exposure in young workers were included. The review was reported based on the PRISMA statement. Results Three cross-sectional studies and six longitudinal cohort studies were included. Cross-sectional evidence showed that adverse work conditions including working overtime, job boredom, low skill variety, low autonomy, high job insecurity, and lack of reward were associated with poor mental health of young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that high job demands, low job control, effort-reward imbalance, and low work support (men only) were associated with poor mental health. There was evidence on the contemporaneous relationship between two or more adverse work conditions and poor mental health. Conclusions Although more research (particularly high-quality longitudinal studies) is warranted in this area, our review indicates that work-related stressors have a negative impact on the mental health of young workers. The current review suggests that workplace interventions and policy are required to improve the quality of work for young workers.

AB  - Background
   Epilepsy and mental illness share similar problems in terms of stigma, as a result of centuries of superstition, ignorance and misbeliefs. Stigma leads not only to discrimination and civil and human rights violations but also to poor access to healthcare and non-adherence or decreased adherence to treatment, ultimately increasing morbidity and mortality. Despite continuous efforts in fighting stigma in these conditions, there is very limited knowledge on the phenomenon of double stigma, meaning the impact of having two stigmatised conditions at the same time.
   Aims
   To discuss double stigma in mental health with special reference to epilepsy.
   Method
   Articles were identified through searches in PubMed up to 31 October 2019 using the search terms 'epilepsy', 'psychiatric disorders', 'stigma' and additional material was identified from the authors' own files and from chosen bibliographies.
   Results
   Double stigma is gaining attention for other stigmatised medical conditions, such as HIV, however, the literature on epilepsy is almost non-existent and this is quite astonishing given that one in three people with epilepsy have a lifetime diagnosis of a psychiatric condition. Felt (perceived) stigma and psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, create a vicious circle in epilepsy maintaining both, as depression correlates with stigma and vice versa as well as epilepsy and depression serving as bidirectional risk factors. This phenomenon has no geographical and economic boundaries as similar data have been reported for low-income and high-income countries.
   Conclusions
   Governments and policymakers as well as health services, patients' organisations, families and the general public need to be aware of the phenomenon of double stigma in order to develop campaigns and interventions tailored for these patients.

AB  - In the Western world, 2-5 % of pregnant women use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. There is no consensus on the potential long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of early SSRI exposure. Our aim was to determine whether there is an overall effect of perinatal SSRI exposure in animals on a spectrum of behavioral domains. After a comprehensive database search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, we included 99 publications. We performed nine meta-analyses and two qualitative syntheses corresponding to different behavioral categories, aggregating data from thousands of animals. We found evidence for reduced activity and exploration behavior (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.28 [-0.38, -0.18]), more passive stress coping (SMD -0.37 -0.52, -0.23]), and less efficient sensory processing (SMD -0.37 -0.69, -0.06]) in SSRI- versus vehicle-exposed animals. No differences were found for anxiety (p = 0.06), social behavior, learning and memory, ingestive- and reward behavior, motoric behavior, or reflex and pain sensitivity. Exposure in the period equivalent to the human third trimester was associated with the strongest effects.

AB  - Background and objectives: Conversion disorder/functional neurological disorder (CD/FND) can be a chronic disorder and has an unknown pathology. This review explored the current level of research and understanding the origin of CD/FND pathology.
   Methods: This narrative review collated relevant papers and articles identified by a search in both Scopus and PubMed. Systematic reviews and observational articles focusing on inflammation and childhood trauma were included. Articles that were not in English, case reports, or that included participants from military background, were excluded.
   Results: Overall 54 papers were included from an initial search number of 5264. 34 of these articles were identifying and discussing new trends and theories related to the pathophysiology while the remaining 20 were defining the current knowledge of CD/FND.
   There is no definitively known pathophysiology of FND, with several noted categories of involved being immune system, inflammation and neural changes. Each system and mechanism could either be seen as a direct mechanism of action or an indirect effect from a further unknown mechanism of action. Additionally, there seems to be a lack of coherency between these different proposed theories, with little information bringing them together. Further research may explore whether or not inflammation plays a direct role in the pathophysiology of the disorder, and if a difference in the symptoms is dictated by different inflammatory markers.
   Conclusion: Overall this narrative review identified and postulated different mechanisms for the pathology of CD/FND while also discovering where new research should focus.

AB  - A number of reviews and meta-analyses have consistently documented the positive effect of individual psychological intervention with clinical older adults suffering from late-life depression, anxiety disorders, or other mental illnesses. However, many older adults without clinical disorders might seek and benefit from individual psychological interventions too. Given the aging populations across the globe, knowing the potential efficacy of individual psychological interventions with non-clinical older adults therefore is important. However, the research on this topic has not been reviewed systematically. This was the primary aim of the present review. Secondarily, we wanted to find out how many of these studies were conducted in a European context. A systematic literature search identified nine eligible studies yielding an aggregated sample size of 983. Two of these were European. Eight of the nine studies (including one European) reported significant positive effects of individual psychological interventions, that is, increases in psychological well-being and decreases in depression symptoms and distress. Effect sizes were extracted or calculated when possible to estimate the magnitude of the intervention effects. These effect sizes varied across studies and ranged from trivial in size to large and even very large, the median being a medium effect size. The results from the present review suggest that non-clinical older adults benefit from individual psychological interventions. However, the limited number of studies available for review precludes conclusions regarding the comparative efficacy of different types of psychological interventions in this population. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Schools are increasingly at the forefront of mental healthcare for young people internationally. This review aims to describe recent developments in school-based mental health activities to respond to mental health needs in adolescents, with a focus on empirical studies aimed at preventing, ameliorating or treating mental disorders.
   Recent findings
   The field is characterized by substantial heterogeneity in program design and research methods. Evidence for effectiveness of single-faceted school-based mental health programs is equivocal. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported mixed findings across a variety of single-faceted universal and targeted programs at post-intervention, short-term and long-term follow-up. The largest and most recent review and network meta-analyses conclude there is limited evidence in support of these forms of school-based anxiety and depression prevention programs. Feasibility studies, which include consideration of appropriate service providers, suggest a need to consider schools as complex systems when designing interventions. Recent models adopting whole-school approaches appear feasible, effective and potentially sustainable with modest levels of resourcing.
   Summary
   Greater evidence is needed regarding long-term impact and sustainability of interventions. Recent trials of multifaceted and multilevel interventions show particular promise. Future research should further explore strategies embedded within school systems and processes.

Aims The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the efficacy of interventions in improving psychological adjustment and well-being for parents who have an infant diagnosed with or at risk of neurodevelopmental disability. Methods The Cochrane Review Group search strategy was followed with search of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase between July and December 2017. Methodological quality of included articles was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) Scale by two independent reviewers. Results Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. A small number of high-quality trials demonstrated moderate to large effectiveness of reducing adverse parent psychological symptoms of trauma and stress. Significant improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms emerged at longer-term (6 months to 8 years) follow-up postinterventions. Conclusions There is promising support for the effectiveness of some interventions to reduce maladaptive psychological symptoms in parents with infants diagnosed at risk of neurodevelopmental disability. Further quality RCTs of psychological interventions addressing broader neurodevelopmental risk conditions for infants are required.

AB  - Background Web-based interventions have been introduced as novel and effective treatments for mental disorders and, in recent years, specifically for the bereaved. However, a systematic summary of the effectiveness of online interventions for people experiencing bereavement is still missing. Objective A systematic literature search was conducted by four reviewers who reviewed and meta-analytically summarized the evidence for web-based interventions for bereaved people. Methods Systematic searches (PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, Medline, and CINAHL) resulted in seven randomized controlled trials (N= 1,257) that addressed adults having experienced bereavement using internet-based interventions. We used random effects models to summarize treatment effects for between-group comparisons (treatmentvs.control at post) and stability over time (postvs.follow-up). Results All web-based interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In comparison with control groups, the interventions showed moderate (g= .54) to large effects (g= .86) for symptoms of grief and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. The effect for depression was small (g= .44). All effects were stable over time. A higher number of treatment sessions achieved higher effects for grief symptoms and more individual feedback increased effects for depression. Other moderators (i.e.dropout rate, time since loss, exposure) did not significantly reduce moderate degrees of heterogeneity between the studies. Limitations The number of includable studies was low in this review resulting to lower power for moderator analyses in particular. Conclusions Overall, the results of web-based bereavement interventions are promising, and its low-threshold approach might reduce barriers to bereavement care. Nonetheless, future research should further examine potential moderators and specific treatment components (e.g.exposure, feedback) and compare interventions with active controls.

AB  - Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are a family of serine proteases that when dysregulated may contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In the present review article, we describe what is known about their physiological and pathological roles with an emphasis on KLK6 and KLK8, two KLKs that are highly expressed in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Altered expression and activity of KLK6 have been linked to brain physiology and the development of multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, altered levels of KLK6 in the brain and serum of people affected by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease have been documented, pointing out to its function in amyloid metabolism and development of synucleinopathies. People who have structural genetic variants of KLK8 can suffer mental illnesses such as intellectual and learning disabilities, seizures, and autism. Increased expression of KLK8 has also been implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Also, we discuss the possible link that exists between KLKs activity and certain viral infections that can affect the nervous system. Although little is known about the exact mechanisms that mediate KLKs function and their participation in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders will open a new field to develop novel therapies to modulate their levels and/or activity and their harmful effects on the CNS.

AB  - The aim in this literature review was (1) to explore the physiologically and psychologically therapeutic benefits of forest bathing on adults suffering from pre-hypertension or hypertension, and (2) to identify the type, duration, and frequency of an effective forest bathing intervention in the management of pre-hypertension and hypertension, so as to provide directions for future interventions or research. The electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsyINFO, and the China Academic Journals (CAJ) offered through the Full-text Database (CNKI) were searched for relevant studies published from the inception of the databases to April 2019. Of the 364 articles that were identified, 14 met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The synthesis of the findings in the included studies revealed that forest bathing interventions were effective at reducing blood pressure, lowering pulse rate, increasing the power of heart rate variability (HRV), improving cardiac-pulmonary parameters, and metabolic function, inducing a positive mood, reducing anxiety levels, and improving the quality of life of pre-hypertensive or hypertensive participants. Forest walking and forest therapy programs were the two most effective forest bathing interventions. Studies reported that practicing a single forest walking or forest therapy program can produce short-term physiological and psychological benefits. It is concluded that forest bathing, particularly forest walking and therapy, has physiologically and psychologically relaxing effects on middle-aged and elderly people with pre-hypertension and hypertension.

AB  - Purpose of Review Despite a call for better understanding of the role of environmental pollutant influences on mental health and the tremendous public health burden of mental health, this issue receives far less attention than many other effects of pollutants. Here we summarize the body of literature on non-occupational environmental pollutant exposures and adult depression, anxiety, and suicide-in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsychINFO through the end of year 2018. Recent Findings One hundred twelve articles met our criteria for further review. Of these, we found 88 articles on depression, 33 on anxiety, and 22 on suicide (31 articles covered multiple outcomes). The earliest article was published in 1976, and the most frequent exposure of interest was air pollution (n = 33), followed by secondhand smoke (n = 20), metals (n = 18), noise (n = 17), and pesticides (n = 10). Other exposures studied less frequently included radiation, magnetic fields, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), volatile organic compounds, solvents, and reactive sulfur compounds. The current literature, although limited, clearly suggests many kinds of environmental exposures may be risk factors for depression, anxiety, and suicide. For several pollutants, important limitations exist with many of the studies. Gaps in the body of research include a need for more longitudinal, life-course studies, studies that can measure cumulative exposures as well as shorter-term exposures, studies that reduce the possibility of reverse causation, and mechanistic studies focused on neurotoxic exposures.

AB  - Over 90% women with perinatal depression in low and middle-income countries do not receive treatment. Scale-up of evidence-based psychosocial interventions is a key challenge. We developed the Thinking Healthy Programme (THP), a psychosocial intervention that can be delivered by non-specialist providers such as community health workers in primary and secondary care settings. Our research showed that three out of 4 women with perinatal depression who received the programme recovered, and there were beneficial effects on infant outcomes. In over a decade since the original research, policy and practice uptake of the programme globally has been promising. We describe factors contributing to this: the programme is relatively inexpensive and culturally transferable; the intervention can be integrated with existing maternal and child health programmes; the programme is amenable to 'task-sharing' via peers, nurses, community health-workers and other frontline workers; cascaded models of training and supervision, and the use of technology for training and delivery provide exciting future avenues for scaled-up implementation. These innovations are relevant to the neglected field of public mental health, especially in the post COVID19 era when rates of anxiety and depression are likely to rise globally.

AB  - Empathy, broadly defined as the ability to understand the other and to share others' emotions, motivates prosocial behavior and underlies successful interpersonal relations. Dysfunctions in this ability may cause fundamental difficulties in social communication. Empathy has been measured in various ways, from self-report questionnaires to laboratory objective performance tests. Empathic accuracy (EA), i.e., the ability to accurately empathize, is measured using more complex and ecological paradigms, such as asking participants to infer filmed interactions, or having people narrate personal emotional stories then assessing the correspondence between the perceiver and the target of empathy as the criteria for empathic ability. This measure is particularly useful in the study of clinical populations, where deconstructing the multifaceted concept of empathy may contribute to a more complete understanding of specific clinical profiles. This paper presents a scoping review of the literature on EA in clinical populations, and on EA and clinical traits and states in nonclinical or high-risk populations. Following an exhaustive literature search, 34 studies were found eligible to be included in this review. The largest category was studies focused on EA in people with schizophrenia (31%; 11 papers), followed by studies focused on EA in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and autistic traits in a nonclinical population (22%; 8 papers). Studies were also found on EA and depression tendencies, psychopathy, social anxiety, behavior disorders, and personality disorders, and a few other clinical conditions. The included studies varied on research aims, designs, sample sizes, and male:female ratios. The overall synthesized results suggest that EA is reduced in schizophrenia and ASD. In other clinical populations, the number of studies was very limited. We urge researchers to further examine EA in these less-studied populations. The review reveals a general underrepresentation of female participants in studies on EA in clinical populations. We suggest that future research address understudied clinical populations, such as those diagnosed with psychopathy. Subject, target, and situational variables should also be considered, with special attention to gender differences (and similarities), the association between EA abilities and adaptive functioning, and the study of individuals with clinical conditions as targets, not just observers, in EA tasks.

AB  - Workplace stress management is a growing problem that can have significant mental health and financial impact for workers and their employers. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of Virtual Reality (VR) treatments for stress and anxiety, however no reviews of VR to date have looked specifically into the use of VR for this purpose in the workplace. This scoping review aimed to identify available evidence in this environment (i.e., workplace) and investigate whether using VR might reduce workplace stress levels. The academic databases, CINAHL, Medline, Proquest, PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched using terms focused on VR, stress or relaxation, and workplaces. Results from the articles reviewed demonstrate a wide variety of study designs and techniques, with a general indication that the interventions reduce stress. Commonalities, differences, and levels of workplace focus are examined. Areas for future studies are highlighted, and the importance of the unique contribution VR can make to stress management in the workplace is identified as a gap in the research to be filled.

AB  - The main purpose of our review study was to estimate depression prevalence among Saudi Arabian medical students according to the published articles and try to reveal the main associated factors. A systematic search was performed through PubMed/Medline and Google Scholar databases. A review of 18 studies published between January 2010 and March 2019 was composed of the following selection of necessary articles approved by PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcomes) criteria. The prevalence of depression among medical students of Saudi Arabia ranged from 30.9% to 77.6% with a mean prevalence of 51.5%. Depression severity was evaluated by various questionnaires, so we summarized the extracted data and revealed that medical students tend to have moderate to severe depression to a greater extent than mild depressive symptoms (33.27% vs 29.9%). The findings of this review suggest a high incidence of depression among medical students and the influence of associate sociodemographic factors. Females are considered to be at a higher risk of depression. First-year medical students are the most susceptible to develop depressive symptoms. Smoking is strongly associated with depression severity. Marital status, eating habits, usage of stimulants, and sleep disturbances are within significant findings of our review study.

AB  - Objectives. - Speed of thought is a central phenomenon in mood disorders. We aimed to provide an update on the topic ten years after a first narrative review published on racing and crowded thoughts in mood disorders. This update is based on recent publications, including recent works of our group.
   Methods. - Narrative review based on publications from the last ten years including publications of our group and a systematic research of references on PubMed.
   Results. - The traditional dichotomist view of racing versus crowded thoughts is not refuted but appears to be more complex, as revealed by validation studies of the Racing and Crowded Thoughts Questionnaire. Moreover, this dualistic view can no longer be conceptualized in a simple bijective concordance with the distinction of hypomania versus mixed depression. We also show that racing/crowded thoughts are strongly associated with mixed depression and not with non-mixed depression, that they tend to be more associated in hypomania to irritability than to the typical symptoms of energy and activity increase and that they are clearly distinguishable from ruminations. Yet, although tightly linked to mood disorders, racing/crowded thoughts appear to be associated to anxiety as well as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and insomnia.
   Conclusions. - Racing and crowded thoughts should be studied in a dimensional perspective as an important facet of mind activity within and beyond the field of mood disorders. (C) 2020 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects people worldwide. MDD treatments include antidepressants, which involve a delayed onset of action, long-term treatment, side effects and, frequently, only partial efficacy. The lack of access to the living brain, and the complex and still poorly elucidated pathophysiology of MDD, hinders treatment development. There is not only a need for new treatment strategies, but also for new approaches to investigating the pathophysiology of MDD. Light therapy is a well-established treatment acting through the retina. Since the retina is part of the central nervous system, it has been suggested as a useful area for investigating mental illness. In this article, we will first set out the evidence that MDD affects the retina's structure and function. We will then review studies evaluating the efficacy of light therapy in unipolar non-seasonal MDD. Finally, we discuss the disruption of melatoninergic pathways in MDD, its assessment through the retina and the treatment of this disruption with light therapy.

AB  - Background Cognitive bias modification (CBM) therapies, including attention bias modification, interpretation bias modification, or approach and avoidance training, are prototypical examples of mechanistically derived treatments, but their effectiveness is contentious. We aimed to assess the relative effectiveness of various CBM interventions for anxious and depressive symptomatology.
   Methods For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register from database inception up until Feb 7, 2020. We included randomised controlled trials of CBM versus control conditions or other forms of CBM for adults aged 18 years and older with clinical or subclinical anxiety or depression measured with a diagnostic interview or a validated clinical scale. We excluded studies comparing CBM with a non-CBM active intervention. Two researchers independently selected studies and evaluated risk of bias with the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Primary outcomes encompassed anxiety and depressive symptoms measured with validated clinical scales. We computed standardised mean differences (SMDs) with a restricted maximum likelihood random effects model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018086113.
   Findings From 2125 records we selected 85 trials, 65 (n=3897) on anxiety and 20 (n=1116) on depression. In a well connected network of anxiety trials, interpretation bias modification outperformed waitlist (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.19) and sham training (SMD -0.30, -0.50 to -0.10) for the primary outcome. Attention bias modification showed benefits only in post-hoc sensitivity analyses excluding post-traumatic stress disorder trials. Prediction intervals for all findings were large, including an SMD of 0. Networks of depression trials displayed evidence of inconsistency. Only four randomised controlled trials had low risk of bias on all six domains assessed.
   Interpretation CBM interventions showed consistent but small benefits; however heterogeneity and risk of bias undermine the reliability of these findings. Larger, definitive trials for interpretation bias modification for anxiety might be warranted, but insufficient evidence precludes conclusions for depression.

AB  - The mechanisms by which childhood maltreatment increases anxiety is unclear, but a propensity for increased defensive behavior in rodent models of early life stress (ELS) suggests that work in rodents may clarify important mechanistic details about this association. A key challenge in studying the effects of ELS on defensive behavior in rodents is the plethora of inconsistent results. This is particularly prominent with the maternal separation (MS) literature, one of the most commonly used ELS models in rodents. To address this issue we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, examining the effects of MS on exploratory-defensive behavior in mice and rats using the open field test (OFT) and the elevated plus maze (EPM). This search yielded a total of 49 studies, 24 assessing the effect of MS on behavior in the EPM, 11 tested behavior in the OFT, and 14 studies provided data on both tasks. MS was associated with increased defensive behavior in rats (EPM: Hedge's g = -0.48, p = 0.02; OFT: Hedge's g = -0.33, p = 0.05), effect sizes that are consistent with the anxiogenic effect of early adversity reported in humans. In contrast, MS did not alter exploratory behavior in mice (EPM: Hedge's g = -0.04, p = 0.75; OFT: Hedge's g = -0.03, p = 0.8). There was a considerable amount of heterogeneity between studies likely related to the lack of standardization of the MS protocol. Together, these findings suggest important differences in the ability of MS to alter circuits that regulate defensive behaviors in mice and rats.

AB  - Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric diagnosis of an impairing condition in which the patient is preoccupied with a slight or perceived defect in their appearance. BDD patients have a higher rate of psychiatric comorbidities than the background population which include obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, anxiety and suicide. It causes distress and affects the patient's quality of life. It is previously found that the prevalence of patients that suffers from BDD is higher among dermatology patients than in the background population. To create an overview of the original literature that exist on topic: BDD in dermatology. A systematic review was conducted by two reviewers. PubMed was searched using a predefined search string created in collaboration between the authors and a bibliographic fellow on 18th of August 2018 and again in January 2020. 45 articles were obtained and after exclusion 5 relevant articles remained. Dermatology patients have a higher incidence of BDD than the background population. BDD patients are significantly younger and it has been suggested that BDD develops during adolescence but is diagnosed with a delay of several years because patients seek out health care professionals among non-mental health specialists. BDD does not appear associated with the setting, i.e. cosmetic vs general dermatology, but BDD patients have a lower quality of life and are more commonly unemployed or on sick leave. It is often difficult to treat, and a combination of the dermatologic treatment and the psychiatric treatment may be necessary in the context of visible skin pathology.

AB  - A key objective in the field of translational psychiatry over the past few decades has been to identify the brain correlates of major depressive disorder (MDD). Identifying measurable indicators of brain processes associated with MDD could facilitate the detection of individuals at risk, and the development of novel treatments, the monitoring of treatment effects, and predicting who might benefit most from treatments that target specific brain mechanisms. However, despite intensive neuroimaging research towards this effort, underpowered studies and a lack of reproducible findings have hindered progress. Here, we discuss the work of the ENIGMA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Consortium, which was established to address issues of poor replication, unreliable results, and overestimation of effect sizes in previous studies. The ENIGMA MDD Consortium currently includes data from 45 MDD study cohorts from 14 countries across six continents. The primary aim of ENIGMA MDD is to identify structural and functional brain alterations associated with MDD that can be reliably detected and replicated across cohorts worldwide. A secondary goal is to investigate how demographic, genetic, clinical, psychological, and environmental factors affect these associations. In this review, we summarize findings of the ENIGMA MDD disease working group to date and discuss future directions. We also highlight the challenges and benefits of large-scale data sharing for mental health research.

AB  - BackgroundWhilst any type of bereavement can be traumatic, bereavement through violent or sudden causes is associated with more severe negative health and wellbeing outcomes compared to other types of loss. Social support has been found to have a positive impact on wellbeing after traumatic events in general. However, this association appears to be less consistently demonstrated in studies that focus on bereavement, and the literature in this area has not yet been systematically reviewed. This study aimed to review the international literature to examine systematically whether there is an association between informal social support from family and friends after bereavement through sudden and/or violent causes and post-bereavement wellbeing.MethodsWe conducted a systematic search for quantitative studies that tested for an association between social support and any outcome related to wellbeing after a sudden and/or violent loss. Included studies were assessed for quality, and findings were reported using the approach of narrative synthesis. The review was pre-registered on Prospero (registration number CRD42018093704).ResultsWe identified 16 papers that met inclusion criteria, 11 of which we assessed as being of good or fair quality and 5 as poor quality. Fifteen different wellbeing outcomes were measured across all studies. We found consistent evidence for an inverse association between social support and symptoms/presence of depression, predominantly consistent evidence for an inverse association between social support and symptoms/presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and conflicting evidence for an inverse association between social support and symptoms/presence of complicated grief.ConclusionsOur systematic review identified evidence to suggest that social support after sudden or violent bereavement is associated with a reduced severity of depressive and PTSD symptoms. Further longitudinal research is needed to explore potential causality in this relationship, widening the focus from common mental disorders to include other mental illnesses, wellbeing outcomes, and suicide-related outcomes after bereavement. There is also a need for consensus on the conceptualisation and measurement of social support. Our findings imply that interventions to improve access to and quality of social support may reduce the burden of mental illness after bereavement, and may therefore be worth investing in.

AB  - Objective:
   Many people with psychotic experiences do not develop psychotic disorders, yet those who seek help demonstrate high clinical complexity and poor outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychological interventions for people with psychotic experiences.
   Method:
   We searched 13 databases for studies of psychological interventions for adults with psychotic experiences, but not psychotic disorders. Our outcomes were the proportion of participants remitting from psychotic experiences (primary); changes in positive and negative psychotic symptoms, depression, anxiety, functioning, distress, and quality of life; and economic outcomes (secondary). We analysed results using multilevel random-effects meta-analysis and narrative synthesis.
   Results:
   A total of 27 reports met inclusion criteria. In general, there was no strong evidence for the superiority of any one intervention. Five studies reported on our primary outcome, though only two reports provided randomised controlled trial evidence that psychological intervention (specifically, cognitive behavioural therapy) promoted remission from psychotic experiences. For secondary outcomes, we could only meta-analyse trials of cognitive behavioural therapy. We found that cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than treatment as usual for reducing distress (pooled standardised mean difference: -0.24; 95% confidence interval = [-0.37, -0.10]), but no more effective than the control treatment for improving any other outcome. Individual reports indicated that cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, sleep cognitive behavioural therapy, systemic therapy, cognitive remediation therapy, and supportive treatments improved at least one clinical or functional outcome. Four reports included economic evaluations, which suggested cognitive behavioural therapy may be cost-effective compared with treatment as usual.
   Conclusion:
   Our meta-analytic findings were primarily null, with the exception that cognitive behavioural therapy may reduce the distress associated with psychotic experiences. Our analyses were limited by scarcity of studies, small samples and variable study quality. Several intervention frameworks showed preliminary evidence of positive outcomes; however, the paucity of consistent evidence for clinical and functional improvement highlights a need for further research into psychological treatments for psychotic experiences.

AB  - Soldier's Heart (SH) is a former medical diagnosis, rarely mentioned nowadays, presented under several other names. Considering the controversy regarding the removal of Soldier's Heart diagnosis from DSM-5, this study aimed to conduct a systematic review to evaluate its usage in the clinical practice. Information on diagnosis, military stress, heart rate variability, treatment, and prognosis were collected from 19 studies included after a systematic literature search. Considering the lack of adequate use of Soldier's Heart diagnosis and the diagnostic overlapping with other conditions, the present systematic review supports the inclusion of Soldier's Heart under the umbrella of posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSDs). This proposal is also in line with the conception that physical symptoms are relevant features often associated with generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD. Also, it will be described the higher prevalence of cardiological comorbidities in SH and possible cardiological consequences. Pharmacotherapy based on benzodiazepines and beta-blockers, as well as biofeedback and mindfulness techniques are considered to be useful treatment options. Further studies are needed to better define psychopathological domains of this syndrome and possible novel treatment targets.

   Previous research has suggested high levels of unaddressed mental health needs among male-dominated work settings. The mining industry has been a recent focus internationally. This paper aims to critically examine research regarding organizational mental health interventions for people working in mining industries.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The narrative review used a systematic standardized search strategy in six databases and grey literature from 1990 to 2019.
   Findings
   Of the 418 studies identified, seven studies (five quantitative and two qualitative studies) met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of these studies revealed the organisational interventions available to address mental health needs of miners. Interventions were categorised into organisational and individual-focused approaches. Evidence shows there is great potential in conducting workplace mental health programs, yet further research is required to create a strong evidence base for substantiated policy and practice implications.
   Practical implications
   Mental health interventions and programs should be available in mining industry to enhance mental health. Organisations can also improve mental health by implementing significant changes in the work environment and identifying workplace factors that induce strain and contribute to psychological distress in employees. Attempt can be made at restructuring safety policies and practices to include mental health, addressing organisational structures such as work schedules and providing training for managers and supervisors.
   Originality/value
   This review focuses on the unique characteristics pertaining to male-dominated mining industries and workplace mental health interventions which are aimed at supporting employee mental health.

AB  - Background Children younger than 7 years can develop mental disorders that might manifest differently than in older children or adolescents. However, little is known about the prevalence of mental disorders at this early age.
   Methods We systematically searched the literature in the databases Web of Science, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, MEDLINE, and Embase to identify epidemiological studies of community samples published between 2006 and 2020. A series of meta-analyses was conducted to estimate the pooled worldwide prevalence of mental disorders in general, specific mental disorders, and comorbidity in young children.
   Results A total of ten epidemiological studies reporting data on N = 18,282 children (12-83 months old) from eight countries met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of mental disorders in general was 20.1%, 95% CI [15.7, 25.4]. Most common disorders were oppositional defiant disorder (4.9%, 95% CI [2.5, 9.5]) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (4.3%, 95% CI [2.5, 7.2]). The prevalence of any anxiety disorders was 8.5%, 95% CI [5.2, 13.5], and of any depressive disorders was 1.1%, 95% CI [0.8, 1.6]. Comorbidity was estimated at 6.4%, 95% CI [1.3, 54.0].
   Conclusions The literature search reveals that the epidemiology of mental disorders in children younger than 7 years is still a neglected area of research. The findings also indicate that there are a significant number of young children suffering from mental disorders who need appropriate age-adapted treatment.

AB  - Background: With the development of urbanization, there is a decreasing tendency for people contact with natural greenness. Whether maternal exposure to greenness has an impact on pregnancy complications and pregnancy outcomes remains to be confirmed.
   Objectives: To estimate the association and dose-response relationship between residential greenness and pregnancy outcomes.
   Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to 1st December 2019 were searched.
   Synthesis methods: The summary regression coefficient (beta) and odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated. The linear dose-response relationship between greenness and adverse pregnancy outcomes was also investigated.
   Results: Overall, 36 studies with a total of 11,983,089 participants were included. Birth weight was significantly higher in highest level of greenness exposure group compared to lowest level group (e.g. beta:20.22, 95% CI:13.50-26.93 at 100 in buffer). The odds of low birth weight (LBW) decreased in the highest level of group compared to lowest level group (e.g. OR:0.86, 95%CI:0.75-0.99 at 100 m buffer). The odds of small for gestational age (SGA) also decreased in the highest group (OR:0.93, 95%CI:0.88-1.00 at 100 m buffer). In addition, maternal exposure to greenness was associated with increased head circumference and decreased mental disorders. The dose-response models showed a 2% decrease risk of LBW per 0.1 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increase within 300 m buffer (OR:0.98, 95%CI:0.97-0.99, P < 0.001) and a 1% decrease risk of SGA per 0.1 NDVI increase within 300 m buffer (OR:0.99, 95%CI:0.98-1.00, P = 0.037). No significant associations were found on preterm birth, gestational age, gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.
   Conclusions: This review confirms an inverse association between residential greenness and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Findings of our study provide evidences for pregnant women to increase greenness exposure. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by a fear of negative evaluation, negative self-belief and extreme avoidance of social situations. These recurrent symptoms are thought to maintain the severity and substantial impairment in social and cognitive thoughts. SAD is associated with a disruption in neuronal networks implicated in emotional regulation, perceptual stimulus functions, and emotion processing, suggesting a network system to delineate the electrocortical endophenotypes of SAD. This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of the most frequently studied electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral coupling, event-related potential (ERP), visual-event potential (VEP), and other connectivity estimators in social anxiety during rest, anticipation, stimulus processing, and recovery states. A search on Web of Science provided 97 studies that document electrocortical biomarkers and relevant constructs pertaining to individuals with SAD. This study aims to identify SAD neuronal biomarkers and provide insight into the differences in these biomarkers based on EEG, ERPs, VEP, and brain connectivity networks in SAD patients and healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we proposed recommendations to improve methods of delineating the electrocortical endophenotypes of SAD, e.g., a fusion of EEG with other modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalograms (MEG), to realize better effectiveness than EEG alone, in order to ultimately evolve the treatment selection process, and to review the possibility of using electrocortical measures in the early diagnosis and endophenotype examination of SAD.

AB  - People seeking asylum are at an increased risk of mental disorder compared to refugees and other migrants. This paper aims to understand the impact of postmigration social-environmental factors to help inform efforts to reduce rates of mental disorder. We conducted a systematic review searching 11 databases, as well as 6 government and nongovernment websites. We asked 5 experts for recommendations, and carried out forwards and backwards citation tracking. From 7004 papers 21 were eligible and had the appropriate data. Narrative synthesis was conducted. 24 Social-environmental factors were identified and categorised into 7 themes: working conditions, social networks, economic class, living conditions, healthcare, community and identity, and the immigration system. Evidence suggests that discrimination and post-migration stress are associated with increased rates of mental disorder. The post-migration environment influences the mental health of people seeking asylum. Discrimination and post-migration stress are key factors, warranting further research and public attention.

AB  - Psoriasis is a chronic dermatological condition that is frequently associated with problematic patterns of emotional reactivity (the way in which patients react to stimuli), alexithymia (their ability to recognize and label the emotional reaction), and emotion regulation (the ability to enhance or reduce their own emotional reaction). A research in the peer-reviewed scientific literature was conducted in order to identify articles describing the association of psoriasis and affective problems. In particular, we first evaluate studies that have investigated abnormal emotional reactivity (in terms of duration, frequency, or type of the experienced emotions) and its impact on patients' quality of life; next, we review the role of alexithymia and emotion regulation in modulating the relationship between emotional reactivity and quality of life in this population. From a critical analysis of the reviewed studies, we highlight that altered emotional processing might be particularly important in the characterization of this condition. In particular, we show that this condition is related to an emotional reactivity characterized by negative emotions that have a stronger impact on patients' quality of life when emotion regulation abilities are weak, especially if patients have alexithymia. Finally, we present suggestions for future directions in both clinical and research fields.

AB  - Internet gaming is among the most popular entertainment options, worldwide; however, a considerable proportion of gamers show symptoms of pathological gaming. Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has been proposed to describe a behavioral addiction, which shares many similarities, both physical and psychological, with substance use disorder. Environmental factors, such as interpersonal and relationship dynamics during childhood and adolescence, have been suggested to modulate the onset and trajectories of IGD. However, studies exploring the contributions of dysfunctional family environments to the development of IGD remain limited. This minireview aims to offer an overview of the current knowledge regarding the impacts of early-life interpersonal and relationship dynamics on the development of IGD and to provide a snapshot of the current state of the literature in this field. Specifically, it underlines the modulatory role of early-life relational factors such as a) family function, b) parent-child relationships, c) childhood maltreatment, and d) bullying and cyberbullying on the development of IGD. Consistent with this evidence, therapeutic interventions that aim to "restructure" the emotional ties and familiar dynamics that are known to be associated with dysfunctional behaviors and feelings, and likely promote pathological gaming, are recognized as the most successful clinical therapeutic approaches for IGD.

AB  - Stress in general, and early life stress in particular, has been associated with the development of anxiety and mood disorders. The molecular, biological and psychological links between stress exposure and the pathogenesis of anxiety and mood disorders have been extensively studied, resulting in the search of novel psychopharmacological strategies aimed at targets of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis has been observed in certain subgroups of patients with anxiety and mood disorders. In addition, the effects of different anti-anxiety agents on various components of the HPA axis has been investigated, including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). For example, benzodiazepines, including clonazepam and alprazolam, have been demonstrated to reduce the activity of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the hypothalamus. TCAs and SSRIs are also effective anti-anxiety agents and these may act, in part, by modulating the HPA axis. In this regard, the SSRI escitalopram inhibits CRF release in the central nucleus of the amygdala, while increasing glucocorticoid receptor (GRs) density in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. The molecular effects of these anti-anxiety agents in the regulation of the HPA axis, taken together with their clinical efficacy, may provide further understanding about the role of the HPA axis in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - BackgroundSelf-harm, whether attributed to suicidal or non-suicidal motives, is associated with several poor outcomes in young people, including eventual suicide. Much of our understanding of self-harm in young people is based on literature from Europe (particularly, the UK), North America, and Australia. We aimed to synthesise the available evidence on prevalence, the commonly reported self-harm methods, correlates, risk and protective factors, and reasons for self-harm, in adolescents (aged 10-25years) in sub-Saharan Africa.MethodWe searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, African Journals OnLine, and African Index Medicus for records from 1950 through August 2019, without language restrictions. We supplemented the database searches by searching relevant portals for postgraduate theses, reference harvesting, contacting authors for unpublished studies, and hand searching relevant print sources. We applied narrative synthesis to the evidence.ResultsSeventy-four studies from 18 sub-Saharan African countries met the inclusion criteria. The median lifetime prevalence estimate was 10.3% (interquartile range [IQR] 4.6% - 16.1%); median 12-month prevalence estimate was 16.9% (IQR: 11.5% - 25.5%); median 6-month prevalence estimate was 18.2% (IQR: 12.7% - 21.8%); and the median 1-month prevalence estimate was 3.2% (IQR: 2.5-14.8%). Studies from Western sub-Saharan Africa reported the highest 12-month prevalence estimates (median=24.3%; IQR=16.9% - 27.9%). Clinical samples commonly reported overdose, whereas self-cutting was most commonly reported in non-clinical samples. Academic failure, sexual, emotional, and physical abuse, romantic relationship problems, family conflict, depression, and previous self-harm were identified as key correlates of self-harm. No study reported protective factors against self-harm.ConclusionVariation in estimates was explained by small sample sizes and variation in definitions and measures used. Exploration of associations, risks and protective factors was based upon concepts and measures derived from high income countries. More detailed and culturally sensitive research is needed to understand the context-specific risks and protective factors for self-harm in adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are one of the most prevalent mental disorders in children and adolescents which may effectively be treated by several forms of exposure therapy. An emerging approach to exposure is virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), but a literature search synthesis focusing specifically on the use of VRET in children and adolescents is still lacking. This systematic review sets out to provide an overview concerning VRET for the treatment of anxiety disorders in this age group. Four published trials covering an overall sample of 100 participants between the ages of 8 and 16 years were found during a systematic literature search and were included in the current review. Results reveal that participants show clinical improvements regarding anxiety symptoms after VRET. Nevertheless, the high potential of virtual reality as a tool for treating children and adolescents with anxiety disorders is contrasted by a considerable lack of controlled trials. Despite the evidence of VRET in adult samples, there is a need for more research with younger cohorts in order to be able to support this promising field of application.

AB  - A significant number of breast cancer survivors are living with their minor children. In this review we investigated the impact of maternal breast cancer on children. A literature search conducted through PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and CINAHL yielded 26 relevant studies, which documented a variety of effects. Evidence has been presented that dealing with maternal breast cancer can cause uncertainty, anxiety and depression in children, but may also lead to enhanced social and academic performance. The risk of problems in these children is reported to be associated with both low parental affective responsiveness and excessive parental involvement. Internalising child problems were shown to be linked with maternal depression and family dysfunction, and externalising problems with family dysfunction and communication problems. Some of these problems may be modified by interventions for supporting these families, which should be designed to include both parents and children, and also the healthcare personnel.

AB  - Effective occupational health psychology (OHP) interventions are evidence-based strategies that address the increasing costs of occupational stress and poor well-being. However, the evidence that OHP interventions successfully reduces these costs remains ambiguous. This systematic review of OHP interventions assessed the theoretical basis informing recently published interventions, the outcomes targeted, and the evaluation methods they used. Using a comprehensive search strategy of 25 years of international OHP intervention research, 60 journal articles representing 59 unique interventions met criteria for inclusion. Articles were coded and data analyzed using content analysis. Results identified that 53% of these interventions were not explicitly theory based and their outcomes were poorly defined. We identified considerable construct proliferation and a pathogenic bias in distal intervention outcomes. Most of the experimental evaluation methods used were focused on demonstrating an effect existed-on average within a group-to the exclusion of assessing the costs and benefits of an intervention. In combination, these results suggest this field too often reports interventions adopting a trial-and-error approach, which demonstrates inadequate integration with theory, and reports outcomes that are not easily comparable between studies. We discuss these findings and present 3 sets of recommendations for addressing these concerns and to advance both knowledge and practical outcomes for OHP interventions.

AB  - Objective: Primary care practitioners determine access to care for many preschool children with mental health (MH) problems. This study examined rates of mental health (MH) problem identification in preschoolers within primary healthcare settings, related service use, and MH status at follow-up. The findings may inform evidence-based policy and practice development for preschool MH. Method: For this systematic review, MEDLINE (R), EMBASE (R), PsycInfo (R), and ERIC (R) were searched from inception to March 7, 2018 for reports in which a screening measure was used to identify MH problems in children aged 24-72 months, seen in primary and community health care settings. Meta-analyses, using random effects models to provide pooled estimates, were used when three or more studies examined identification rates. Findings on service use and persistence of disorders are summarized. Results: Thirty-five publications representing 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. MH problems were identified in 17.6% of preschoolers (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 11.1-24.1), Q = 4.9, p > 0.1 by primary/community healthcare practitioners. Psychiatric diagnoses were identified in 18.4% of preschoolers (95% CI: 12.3 - 24.4), Q= 1.6, p > 0.1. Based on three studies, parents of 67-72% of identified children received advice and 26-42% received specialist referrals. In the subset of studies examining persistence of MH disorders, 25-67% of identified children had MH disorders after one to three years. Conclusion: While the identification rate by primary/community practitioners is similar to the diagnostic rate, these may not consistently be the same children. Substantial variability in management and outcomes indicate need for more rigorous evaluation of primary care services for this population.

AB  - Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a form of arthritis characterized by joint pain, stiffness, swelling and deformity. There has been plethora of researches in the area of rheumatoid arthritis which focused on immune system, genetic predisposition and newer treatment modalities. Researchers have also examined the cognitive decline, physical deficits and their interrelationship in patients with RA. Among several psychological aspects depression, anxiety and stress emerge as significant psychological co morbidity. RA is a multifactorial, chronic, inflammatory disease primarily affects physical functioning as well as psychological aspects. Pain, fatigue, duration of disease, disease activity and functional disability are very common in rheumatoid arthritis which is leading cause of psychological distress and functional disability. Various types of neuropsychological battery were used to assess the decline in specific areas like attention, executive functioning, visuo-spatial learning, verbal learning/memory etc. These functions were compared with other type of arthritis disease. Also, various other factors like depression, cardiovascular diseases, other systemic and chronic disease and concomitant drugs intake etc. also affected cognitive functioning in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients. The objective of this review was to identify and explore the rates and types of cognitive impairment in RA.This present review paper systematically examines and summarizes the cognition related decrement in arthritis patients. Multiple research articles between 1990 to 2018 were searched. These reviews were evaluated and synthesized using a narrative and descriptive approach.

AB  - Unspecific somatic health complaints and symptoms are common in children and adolescents, varying on a continuum of severity. When persistent and impairing, they are often referred to as functional somatic syndromes (FSS). The overarching objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the pediatric literature in relation to conceptual, assessment, and treatment issues for youth presenting with FSS. Clinical recommendations are outlined including addressing potential feasibility and barrier issues for families presenting to medical and mental health services. Assessment and treatment issues are further discussed in context of two recent psychotherapy trials conducted with children and older age adolescents (aged from 7 to 19 years). Finally, we address ongoing research gaps in this field with view to strengthen the evidence base in the assessment and treatment of youth presenting with FSS.

AB  - BackgroundWith an increased political interest in school-based mental health education, the dominant understanding and measurement of mental health literacy (MHL) in adolescent research should be critically appraised. This systematic literature review aimed to investigate the conceptualisation and measurement of MHL in adolescent research and the extent of methodological homogeneity in the field for meta-analyses.MethodsDatabases (PsycINFO, EMBASE, MEDLINE, ASSIA and ERIC) and grey literature were searched (1997-2017). Included articles used the term 'mental health literacy' and presented self-report data for at least one MHL domain with an adolescent sample (10-19years). Definitions, methodological and contextual data were extracted and synthesised.ResultsNinety-one articles were identified. There was evidence of conceptual confusion, methodological inconsistency and a lack of measures developed and psychometrically tested with adolescents. The most commonly assessed domains were mental illness stigma and help-seeking beliefs; however, frequency of assessment varied by definition usage and study design. Recognition and knowledge of mental illnesses were assessed more frequently than help-seeking knowledge. A mental-ill health approach continues to dominate the field, with few articles assessing knowledge of mental health promotion.ConclusionsMHL research with adolescent samples is increasing. Results suggest that a better understanding of what MHL means for this population is needed in order to develop reliable, valid and feasible adolescent measures, and explore mechanisms for change in improving adolescent mental health. We recommend a move away from 'mental disorder literacy' and towards critical 'mental health literacy'. Future MHL research should apply integrated, culturally sensitive models of health literacy that account for life stage and acknowledge the interaction between individuals' ability and social and contextual demands.

AB  - Background: Chinese Taoist cognitive therapy (CTCT), a culture-oriented psychological therapy for Chinese mental well-being, has been proposed for decades. However, the evidence for its effects is unclear. This study aimed to systematically assess the effect of this therapy on symptoms of depression and anxiety in Chinese adults.
   Methods: Relevant studies were searched from major electronic databases through November 2018 without language limits. Several search terms used include "anxiety" OR "depression" AND "Taoism" OR "Daoism" OR "Chinese Taoist Cognitive Therapy." A total of 11 clinical trials focusing on CTCT were included in this meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analytical models were conducted. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also explored.
   Results: Eight clinical trials for 580 subjects were included. The majority of these studies explored samples with depressive symptoms. Overall, CTCT significantly reduced depressive symptoms with a small positive effect (SMD = 0.16, 95% CI: -0.36-0.68). Medium-to-large effect sizes were observed across individuals with clinical or non-clinical depression and chronic physical diseases (SMD = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.27-1.13 and SMD = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.09-1.35, respectively). However, the effectiveness for anxiety symptoms remains debatable.
   Conclusions: Our findings hold promise that CTCT can help reduce depressive symptoms in Chinese adults, including patients with chronic physical diseases and clinical or non-clinical depression. Our findings may be generalized to Chinese communities in other countries.

AB  - Introduction Common mental disorders (CMD) are leading causes of decreased workability in Sweden and worldwide. Effective interventions to prevent or treat such disorders are important for public health. Objective To synthesize the research literature regarding occupational health service (OHS) interventions targeting prevention or reduction of CMD among employees. The effect on workability (sickness absence, return-to-work and self-reported workability) and on CMD symptoms was evaluated in a narrative analysis. Data sources The literature search was performed in four electronic databases in two searches, in 2014 and in 2017. Eligibility criteria (using PICO) Population: studies investigating employees at risk or diagnosed with CMD, as well as preventive workplace intervention targeting mental health. Intervention: studies where the recruitment or the intervention was delivered by the OHS or OHS personnel were included. Control: individuals or groups who did not receive the target intervention. Outcome: all types of outcomes concerning sickness absence and psychological health were included. Study quality was assessed using a Swedish AMSTAR-based checklist, and results from studies with low or medium risk of bias were narratively synthesized based on effect or absence thereof. Results Thirty-three studies were included and assessed for risk of bias. Twenty-one studies had low or medium risk of bias. In 18 studies, rehabilitation interventions were evaluated, 11 studies concerned interventions targeting employees at risk for developing CMD and four studies investigated preventive interventions. Work-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving skill interventions decreased time to first return-to-work among employees on sick leave for CMD in comparison with treatment-as-usual. However, effect on return to full-time work was not consistent, and these interventions did not consistently improve CMD symptoms. Selective interventions targeting employees at risk of CMD and preventive interventions for employees were heterogeneous, so replication of these studies is necessary to evaluate effect. Limitations Other workplace interventions outside the OHS may have been missed by our search. There was considerable heterogeneity in the included studies, and most studies were investigating measures targeting the individual worker. Interventions at the workplace/organizational level were less common.

AB  - Research on the perception of silence has led to insights regarding its positive effects on individuals. We conducted a series of studies during which individuals were exposed to several minutes of silence in different contexts. Participants were introduced to different social and environmental settings, either in a seminar room at a university or in a city garden, alone or in a group. Instructions across studies varied, as participants were exposed to real waiting situations, were asked to just think and to explicitly experience the time interval without further instructions or following a session of Depth Relaxation Music Therapy (DRMT)/Hypnomusictherapy (HMT). Silence was judged to significantly increase relaxation, improve mood states, and alter the perception of time and the orientation toward the present moment. We controlled for influences of trait variables, such as impulsivity, mindfulness, daydreaming, and time perspective. Findings empirically demonstrate that exposure to silence can be effective in therapeutic and educational contexts to promote relaxation and well-being.

AB  - Objectives: The Ebola virus disease (EVD) is associated with major mental health consequences (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD). Studies have shown a need for relevant and effective programs to address mental health consequences associated to EVD. This systematic review aimed to describe programs implemented following EVD outbreaks and to evaluate their effectiveness and relevance in order to provide evidence-based data to improve mental health services.
   Methods: We first searched EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, PILOTS, Cochrane Library and MEDLINE for a systematic review on EVD and on MHPSS programs. Then, we searched the grey literature. The search generated 2827 publications. Eleven studies were retained according to the PRISMA statement.
   Results: This systematic review revealed that most programs were implemented by international organizations in collaboration with local partners. Many of them were implemented following WHO mhGAP and Psychological First Aid guidelines. Programs were implemented in hospitals, Ebola treatment centres, communities among different categories of individuals exposed to EVD (survivors, health workers and volunteers, other frontline workers, children, adults, etc.). Only two of the identified programs which integrated cultural factors were empirically evaluated. Results from the evaluations showed mental health improvement for both children and adults.
   Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic review on MHPSS programs among communities affected by EVD. This study shows the need to increase efforts to systematically document and evaluate the implemented programs. Results also provide preliminary evidence about the value of culturally sensitive MHPSS programs and of the implication of local mental health professionals.

AB  - Aim Oxidative stress is strongly implicated in many psychiatric disorders, which has resulted in the development of new interventions to attempt to perturb this pathology. A great deal of attention has been paid to glutathione, which is the brain's dominant antioxidant and plays a fundamental role in removing free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. Measurement of glutathione concentration in the brain in vivo can provide information on redox status and potential for oxidative stress to develop. Glutathione might also represent a marker to assess treatment response.
   Methods This paper systematically reviews studies that assess glutathione concentration (measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in various mental health conditions.
   Results There is limited evidence showing altered brain glutathione concentration in mental disorders; the best evidence suggests glutathione is decreased in depression, but is not altered in bipolar disorder. The review then outlines the various methodological options for acquiring glutathione data using spectroscopy.
   Conclusions Analysis of the minimum effect size measurable in existing studies indicates that increased number of participants is required to measure subtle but possibly important differences and move the field forward.

AB  - During disasters, people share their thoughts and emotions on social media and also provide information about the event. Mining the social media messages and updates can be helpful in understanding the emotional state of people during such unforeseen events as they are real-time data. The objective of this review is to explore the feasibility of using social media data for mental health surveillance as well as the techniques used for determining mental health using social media data during disasters. PubMed, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES databases were searched from 2009 to November 2018 for primary research studies. After screening and analyzing the records, 18 studies were included in this review. Twitter was the widely researched social media platform for understanding the mental health of people during a disaster. Psychological surveillance was done by identifying the sentiments expressed by people or the emotions they displayed in their social media posts. Classification of sentiments and emotions were done using lexicon-based or machine learning methods. It is not possible to conclude that a particular technique is the best performing one, because the performance of any method depends upon factors such as the disaster size, the volume of data, disaster setting, and the disaster web environment.

AB  - Childhood behavioral outcomes have been linked to low quality intrauterine environments caused by prenatal exposures to both chemical and non-chemical stressors. The effect(s) from the many stressors a child can be prenatally exposed to may be influenced by complex interactive relationships that are just beginning to be understood. Chemical stressors influence behavioral outcomes by affecting the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) enzyme, which is involved in serotonin metabolism and the neuroendocrine response to stress. Non-chemical stressors, particularly those associated with violence, have been shown to influence and exacerbate the externalizing behavioral outcomes associated with low MAOA activity and slowed serotonin metabolism. The adverse developmental effects associated with high stress and maternal drug use during pregnancy are well documented. However, research examining the combined effects of other non-chemical and chemical stressors on development and childhood outcomes as a result of gestational exposures is scarce but is an expanding field. In this systematic review, we examined the extant literature to explore the interrelationships between exposures to chemical and non-chemical stressors (specifically stressful/traumatic experiences), MAOA characteristics, and childhood externalizing behaviors. We observed that exposures to chemical stressors (recreational drugs and environmental chemicals) are significantly related to externalizing behavioral outcomes in children. We also observed that existing literature examining the interactions between MAOA characteristics, exposures to chemical stressors, and traumatic experiences and their effects on behavioral outcomes is sparse. We propose that maternal stress and cortisol fluctuations during pregnancy may be an avenue to link these concepts. We recommend that future studies investigating childhood behaviors include chemical and non-chemical stressors as well as children's inherent genetic characteristics to gain a holistic understanding of the relationship between prenatal exposures and childhood behavioral outcomes.

AB  - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) leads to functional capacity decline, generating great impact in quality of life. Quality of life is directly related to physical integrity and functional independence. This systematic review aimed to analyze treatment protocols and their outcomes from clinical trials with focus on ALS rehabilitation that evaluated the effects on quality of life and functional independence from their intervention process. A literature search was conducted through MEDLINE-PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science and Scopus databases. A total of 3630 articles were identified. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. They focused on different aspects of quality of life or functional independence, which are: respiratory care, mental health, communication skills and exercises. Use of bipap and inspiratory muscle training, anxiety and depression, communication devices implementation and exercises safety and tolerability were considered as key points. However, the drastic evolution of the disease is a limiting factor to the perception of quality of life improvement by patients. Further studies should be done to validate the benefits on patients' quality of life.

AB  - Background: Personalisation of treatment is a development in general medicine that may be of relevance for psychosomatic psychiatry as well.
   Objectives: Discuss how diagnostic profiling can contribute to clinical translational research in psychosomatic psychiatry.
   Methods: Critical review of current shortcomings and required strategies in clinical translational research.
   Results: Current shortcomings in clinical mental health research concern 1) the validity and applicability of biological tests as biomarkers; 2) the diagnostic classifications and 3) the conceptualisation of mental disorder. Clinical psychosomatic research should broaden the current search for etiological mechanisms from the biological domain to include physical symptoms, cognitive function, psychological symptoms, their subjective appraisal by the patient, social factors such as experienced trauma, and resilience factors. The methodology of a profiling study is introduced, that would be particularly useful to describe profiles of patients associated with favourable or less favourable treatment outcome and to develop personalised treatments based upon that. These can then be evaluated in Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs).
   Conclusions: Development of new treatment strategies for mental disorders requires diagnostic procedures to provide clinicians and patients with tools, validated in humans, for tailoring treatment as much as possible to the particular problem, preference and profile of the patient, as a way of developing personalized treatment in psychiatry. Patients with Somatic Symptom Disorders (SSD) might be a group of particular interest to perform profling studies, as they present the highest phenomenological variety alongside the different domains. In this manner, innovative clinical translational research can pave the way with a contribution from psychosomatic psychiatry.

AB  - Introduction: In addition to their role in regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its related peptides, the urocortins, are important mediators of physiological and pathophysiological processes of the central nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, endocrine, reproductive, and skin systems. Altered regulation of CRF-mediated adaptive responses to various stressful stimuli disrupts healthy function and might confer vulnerability to several disorders, including depression and anxiety.
   Methodology: This narrative review was conducted through search and analysis of studies retrieved from online databases using a snowball method.
   Results: This review covers aspects beginning with the discovery of CRF, CRF binding protein and their actions via interaction with CRF receptors type 1 and type 2. These are surface plasma membrane receptors, activation of which is associated with conformational changes and interaction with a variety of G-proteins and signaling pathways. We also reviewed the pharmacology and mechanisms of the receptor signaling modulatory activity of these receptors.
   Conclusion: This review compiles and presents knowledge regarding the CRFergic system, including CRF related peptides, CRF binding protein, and CRF receptors, as well as some evidence that is potentially indicative of the biological roles of these entities in several physiological and pathophysiological processes.

AB  - Depression is one of mental health consequences that present in women with obstetric fistula. It is estimated that over 264 million people of all ages suffer from depression globally. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the epidemiologic evidence from previous studies on the prevalence of depression among women with obstetric fistula in low-income African countries. We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct this meta-analysis. The common databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, Psych INFO, Google Scholar, African Index Medicus, and African Journals Online (AJOL)) were searched for the relevant literature. We used a random-effect meta-analysis model to estimate the overall prevalence of depression and the Q -and I-2 -statistics were used to assess the heterogeneity between the studies included in the meta-analysis. Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots were used to check for the presence of publication bias. The pooled estimated prevalence of depression among women with obstetric fistula in low-income African countries was 56.2% (95% CI 43.1-68.4). The prevalence of depression among women with obstetric fistula was 74.4% in Ethiopia, 72.9% in Kenya, 46.0% in Malawi, 41.0% in Sudan, 34.8% in Nigeria, and 27.7% in Tanzania. Furthermore, the prevalence of depression was higher (97.0%) when it was measured by using Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) when compared with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) (62.7%), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) (36.7%), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (41.0%), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (27.7%). Moreover, the pooled estimated prevalence of depression among women with obstetric fistula was ranged from 48.1 to 57.7% in a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. The prevalence of depression among women with obstetric fistula in low-income African countries was high. Screening and appropriate management of depression among women with obstetric fistula are warranted.

   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:
   Interventional studies published between 2000 and 2018 focused on evaluating the effectiveness of exercise interventions in adults with AUD.
   Data Extraction:
   This protocol was prepared using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocols standard and the Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies guidelines.
   Data Synthesis:
   Physical activity levels/fitness [VO2 max (Oxygen Uptake) and HRmax (Maximum Heart Rate)], levels of depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, quality of life, and alcohol consumption (number of standard drinks consumed per day and per week).
   Results:
   The findings indicated that exercise significantly improved physical fitness as assessed by VO2 max (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.487, P < .05) and HRmax (SMD: 0.717, P < .05). Similarly, exercise significantly improved mental health as assessed by quality of life (SMD: 0.425, P < .05), but levels of depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, and alcohol consumption did not change significantly. Aerobic exercise alleviated depression and anxiety symptoms more than that of yoga and mixed types. Duration of exercise also had a similar effect on anxiety and depression.
   Conclusions:
   Exercise can be an effective and persistent adjunctive treatment for individuals with AUDs.

AB  - Background The increasing number of people who experience mental disorders is a global problem. People with mental disorders have high rates of co-morbidity and significantly poorer oral health outcomes than the general public. However, their oral health remains largely a hidden and neglected issue. A complex range of factors impact the oral health of this group. These include anxiety and dental phobia, dietary habits, including the heavy consumption of sugary drinks, substance misuse of tobacco, alcohol, and/or psychostimulants, the adverse orofacial side effects of anti-psychotic and anti-depression medications, and financial, geographic, and social barriers to accessing oral health care. Methods The aim of this realist systematic review is to (a) identify and synthesise evidence that explores oral health interventions for people living with mental disorders; (b) explore the context and mechanisms that have contributed to the success of interventions or the barriers and challenges; (c) produce program theories on causal, contextual and mechanistic factors to facilitate outcomes and (d) produce recommendations and guidelines to guide future oral health interventions for people with mental disorders at both the policy and practice level. Using a five-step process, that incorporates primary data collection from key stakeholders, a beginning theoretical framework will be developed to describe contextual and mechanistic factors and how they might impact on the success or failure of oral health interventions for people with mental disorders. Key database searches will be conducted, with data extraction focused on the factors that might have impacted on intervention implementation and outcomes. Quality appraisal of studies will occur, and the theoretical framework will be populated with extracted data. Stakeholder input will support the development and refinement of a theory on oral health interventions for people with mental disorders. Discussion This will be the first review to take a realist approach to explore the broad scope of causal factors that impact on the success or failure of oral health interventions for people with mental disorders. The approach includes extensive stakeholder engagement and will advance realist systematic review methodology. Review outcomes will be important in guiding policy and practice to ensure oral health interventions better meet the needs of people with mental disorders. Systematic review registration This review protocol is registered with PROSPERO (Number) 155969.

AB  - Aversive or rewarding experiences are remembered better than those of lesser survival significance. These emotional memories, whether negative or positive, leave traces in the brain which can later be retrieved and strongly influence how we perceive, how we form associations with environmental stimuli and, ultimately, guide our decision-making. In this review aticle, we outline what constitutes an emotional memory by focusing on threat- and reward-related memories and describe how they are formed in the brain during learning and reformed during retrieval. Finally, we discuss how the field is moving from understanding emotional memory brain circuits separately, towards studying how these two opposing brain systems interact to guide choices during conflict. Here, we outline two novel tasks in rodents that model opposing binary choices (approach or avoid) guided by competing emotional memories. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a major integration hub of emotional information which is also known to be critical for decision-making. Consequently, brain circuits that involve this brain region may be key for understanding how the retrieval of emotional memories flexibly orchestrates adaptive choice behavior. Because several mental disorders (e.g., drug addiction and depression) are characterized by deficits in decision-making in the face of conflicting emotional memories (maladaptively giving more weight to one memory over the other), the development of choice-based animal models for emotional regulation could give rise to new approaches for the treatment of these disorders in humans.

AB  - Objectives
   In the last two centuries, researchers tried to investigate the complex effects of early life stress on developing brain as well as the mechanisms underlying dissociation that may be frequently linked to traumatic experiences. Clinically, dissociation may be found in many psychiatric disorders and may be defined as the disruption of important human functions such as memory, identity, consciousness, thinking, emotions, body representation, motor control as well as behavior. The aim of the present review was to selectively review data about the link between traumatic experiences, dissociation and psychopathological patways.
   Methods
   A detailed search regarding the association between traumatic experiences, dissociation, and psychopathological patways has been carried out.
   Results
   Based on the most relevant included studies (n = 16), a chronic hypothalamic pityuitary adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation (that may include both hyperactivity and hypoactivity) has been found in subjects with childhood traumatic experiences. The dysregulated stress system in subjects who have suffered from early traumatic conditions is able to promote important neuroendocrine and immune impairments together with inducing inflammatory-related conditions. Exposure to early-life traumatic experiences may be also linked to relevant psychopathological and neurocognitive consequences with multiple psychopathological conditions that may be developed in individuals with a positive history of traumatic experiences. Importantly, early adversities are closely related to enhanced chronicity, suicidal behavior, and poorer treatment response.
   Conclusions
   Although dissociation may be diagnosed both in acute and chronic conditions, many clinicians are, unfortunately, not able to correctly detect these conditions. The main implications related to the link between trauma, dissociation, and most relevant psychopathological conditions are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are of increasing importance in clinical medicine. However, their evaluation by classic psychometric methods carries considerable limitations. The clinimetric approach provides a viable framework for their assessment. Objective: The aim of this paper was to provide a systematic review of clinimetric properties of the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ), a simple, self-rated instrument for the assessment of psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, hostility, and somatization) and well-being (contentment, relaxation, friendliness, and physical well-being). Methods: The PRISMA guidelines were used. Electronic databases were searched from inception up to March 2019. Only original research articles, published in English, reporting data about the clinimetric properties of the SQ, were included. Results: A total of 284 studies was selected. The SQ has been used in populations of adults, adolescents, and older individuals. The scale significantly discriminated between subgroups of subjects in both clinical and nonclinical settings, and differentiated medical and psychiatric patients from healthy controls. In longitudinal studies and in controlled pharmacological and psychotherapy trials, it was highly sensitive to symptoms and well-being changes and discriminated between the effects of psychotropic drugs and placebo. Conclusions: The SQ is a highly sensitive clinimetric index. It may yield clinical information that similar scales would fail to provide and has a unique position among the PROs that are available. Its use in clinical trials is strongly recommended.

AB  - Background: Depression and anxiety are more likely to co-occur than to occur in isolation. Research supports the use of exercise in the treatment of depression or anxiety, but comorbidity may complicate how people are impacted by treatment.
   Methods: A systematic review (PROSPERO # 42018111114) was conducted to investigate whether and how the evidence of effects of exercise on depression accounts for (1) the prevalence of comorbidity of depression and anxiety within trial samples, and (2) the effects of comorbidity in analyses of intervention effects. This review will utilize and extend the findings of Cooney et al. (2013) applying the same search terms and inclusion criteria (i.e. depression diagnosis). For the review update, five databases were searched including Cochrane Register of Control Trials, Embase, PubMed, Medline and PsycINFO.
   Results: The search resulted in 63 eligible studies with a total of 4,816 participants. Sixteen (25%) studies reported prevalence of anxiety, two (3%) considered comorbidity descriptively, but none accounted for comorbidity in their trial analyses.
   Conclusions: Depression and anxiety are known to co-exist but trials testing the effects of exercise on depression are generally neither reporting the prevalence of comorbidity of anxiety within their samples nor testing whether the presence of comorbidity impacts trial effectiveness and efficacy. Comorbidity of depression and anxiety should be considered in exercise trials to ensure that the effects will apply to the manifestation of these disorders in the real world.

AB  - This advances in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment review examines current evidence on the clinical validity of DSM-5 attenuated psychosis syndrome.
   Question What is the clinical validity of DSM-5 attenuated psychosis syndrome (DSM-5-APS)? Findings In this systematic review including 56 articles and meta-analysis including 23 cohort studies, the clinical validity of DSM-5-APS was tested against evidence-based antecedent, concurrent, and prognostic validators. DSM-5-APS has received substantial concurrent and prognostic validation, mostly from psychometric research in the field of the clinical high-risk state for psychosis, while precipitating and predisposing epidemiological factors, neurobiological research, and treatments have been underinvestigated to date. Meaning Although current evidence supports the potential clinical validity of DSM-5-APS, more research should address the epidemiological profile of this diagnostic category as well as predisposing and precipitating risk factors, neurobiological correlates, and effectiveness of treatments.
   Importance Since the release of the DSM-5 diagnosis of attenuated psychosis syndrome (DSM-5-APS) in 2013, several research studies have investigated its clinical validity. Although critical and narrative reviews have reviewed these progresses, no systematic review has comprehensively summarized the available evidence regarding the clinical validity of DSM-5-APS. Objective To provide current evidence on the clinical validity of DSM-5-APS, focusing on recent advances in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Evidence Review A multistep literature search using the Web of Science database, Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, Ovid/PsychINFO, conference proceedings, and trial registries from database inception to June 16, 2019, was conducted following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines and PROSPERO protocol. Studies with original data investigating individuals diagnosed using DSM-5-APS or meeting comparable criteria were included. The results of the systematic review were summarized in tables and narratively synthesized against established evidence-based antecedent, concurrent, and prognostic validators. A quantitative meta-analysis was conducted to explore the cumulative risk of psychosis onset at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months in individuals diagnosed using DSM-5-APS criteria. Findings The systematic review included 56 articles, which reported on 124 validators, including 15 antecedent, 55 concurrent, and 54 prognostic validators. The epidemiological prevalence of the general non-help-seeking young population meeting DSM-5-APS criteria was 0.3%; the prevalence of individuals meeting DSM-5-APS criteria was variable in clinical samples. The interrater reliability for DSM-5-APS criteria was comparable with that of other DSM-5 mental disorders and can be optimized by the use of specific psychometric instruments. DSM-5-APS criteria were associated with frequent depressive comorbid disorders, distress, suicidality, and functional impairment. The meta-analysis included 23 prospective cohort studies, including 2376 individuals. The meta-analytical risk of psychosis onset was 11% at 6 months, 15% at 12 months, 20% at 24 months, and 23% at 36 months. Research into predisposing and precipitating epidemiological factors, neurobiological correlates, and effective treatments for DSM-5-APS criteria has been limited. Conclusions and Relevance Over recent years, DSM-5-APS criteria have received substantial concurrent and prognostic validation, mostly driven by research into the clinical high-risk state for psychosis. Precipitating and predisposing factors, neurobiological correlates, and effective treatments are undetermined to date.

AB  - Background: With increasing workload and dismal working conditions, healthcare professionals (HCPs) in India often suffer from burnout. Understanding the extent of these problems and the contributing factors is necessary to build a healthy workforce capable of serving the society. The purpose of this study was to systematically review and analyze: 1) the prevalence of burnout among HCPs in India and 2) the factors associated with burnout in this population. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE, from the inception of these databases to October 2019, was conducted using keywords. The search results were screened to identify studies evaluating burnout among HCPs in India using a standard burnout tool. Using a random effect model, the pooled prevalence of burnout was estimated using Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) in three domains: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA). Risk factors for burnout were assessed qualitatively. Results: A total of 15 studies assessing burnout in 3845 Indian HCPs were identified. The pooled prevalence of burnout was 24% in the EE domain, 27% in the DP domain, and 23% in the PA domain. Younger age, female gender, unmarried status, and difficult working conditions were associated with increased risk of burnout. Conclusion: Burnout is highly prevalent among Indian HCPs, with close to one-fourth of them suffering from burnout. A number of personal and professional factors are associated with burnout, and these should be considered while developing solutions to tackle burnout.

AB  - Objective Amongst psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most prevalent, by affecting approximately 15-17% of the population and showing a high suicide risk rate equivalent to around 15%. The present comprehensive overview aims at evaluating main research studies in the field of MDD at suicide risk, by proposing as well as a schematic suicide risk stratification and useful flow-chart for planning suicide preventive and therapeutic interventions for clinicians.
   Methods A broad and comprehensive overview has been here conducted by using PubMed/Medline, combining the search strategy of free text terms and exploded MESH headings for the topics of 'Major Depressive Disorder' and 'Suicide' as following: ((suicide [Title/Abstract]) AND (major depressive disorder [Title/Abstract])). All articles published in English through May 31,2019 were summarized in a comprehensive way.
   Results Despite possible pathophysiological factors which may explain the complexity of suicide in MDD, scientific evidence supposed the synergic role of genetics, exogenous and endogenous stressors (i.e., interpersonal, professional, financial, as well as psychia tric disorders), epigenetic, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress-response system, the involvement of the monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems, particularly the serotonergic ones, the lipid profile, neuro-immunological biomarkers, the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other neuromodulators.
   Conclusion The present overview reported that suicide is a highly complex and multifaceted phenomenon in which a large plethora of mechanisms could be variable implicated, particularly amongst MDD subjects. Beyond these consideration, modern psychiatry needs a better interpretation of suicide risk with a more caretiil assessment of suicide risk stratification and planning of clinical and treatment interventions.

This literature review examines the role of self-care in the promotion of well-being among mental health practitioners. Specifically, empirical research is presented in relation to specific domains of self-care practice, including awareness, balance, flexibility, physical health, social support, and spirituality. Findings from this review underscore the importance of taking a proactive approach to self-care and, in particular, integrating self-care directly into clinical training programs and into the quality assurance processes of professional organizations within the field of mental health.

AB  - Pain-related memory biases have been frequently explored in individuals with chronic pain, and along with attentional and interpretation biases are hypothesised to contribute to the onset and/or maintenance of chronic pain. The aim of this review is to provide a systematic review and synthesis of studies exploring memory recall biases for pain-related information in individuals with chronic pain relative to healthy controls and the recall of neutral information. Studies were identified through a search of Medline, PsychINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Open Grey databases. Search terms were memory, recall, recognition, and bias*, intersected with pain. Eighteen studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included. Subset meta-analyses are also reported from 12 studies with relevant between-groups data (comparing recall in chronic pain vs healthy control groups) and 12 studies with relevant within-groups data (eg, comparing recall of pain-related/emotional vs neutral words). Between-groups analysis revealed significantly weaker recall bias for affective-pain words in individuals with chronic pain relative to healthy controls, but only when nondepressed chronic pain individuals were included. No significant differences were found between groups in the recall of sensory-pain, illness-related, or depression-related words. Within-groups analysis revealed individuals with chronic pain show a significant recall bias favouring sensory-pain words relative to neutral and affective-pain words, and a bias for illness-related words relative to depression-related words. A recall bias favouring neutral words was found in healthy individuals. Evidence for the presence of pain-related memory biases in patients with chronic pain is inconclusive. Further methodologically rigorous research is required.

AB  - Objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide an estimate of the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders in youth with epilepsy (YWE). It also aimed to calculate the overall magnitude of observed differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms reported by YWE compared with healthy controls and investigate whether any factors moderated anxiety and depression outcomes in YWE.
   Methods Following prospective registration, electronic databases were searched up until October 2018. Studies were included if they reported on the rate of anxiety or depression in samples of YWE, and/or if they used valid measures of anxious or depressive symptomatology in YWE compared with a healthy control sample.
   Results Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. The overall pooled prevalence of anxiety disorders in YWE was 18.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.0%-28.5%), and for depression the pooled prevalence was 13.5% (95% CI 8.8%-20.2%). In samples of YWE compared with healthy controls, significantly higher anxiety (d=0.57, 95% CI 0.32-0.83, p<.000) and depressive (d=0.42, 95% CI 0.16-0.68, p<.000) symptomatology was reported.
   Conclusions YWE report anxiety and depressive disorders and symptoms to a significantly higher degree than youth without epilepsy. There is also evidence that certain anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder) are particularly elevated, perhaps reflecting the unique impact of epilepsy on youth psychopathology. Research is needed to understand the risk factors associated with anxiety and depressive disorders in epilepsy, and better understand how these symptoms change across development.

AB  - Background Carers are key providers of care and support to mental health patients and mental health policies consistently mandate carer involvement. Understanding carers' experiences of and views about assessment for involuntary admission and subsequent detention is crucial to efforts to improve policy and practice. Aims We aimed to synthesise qualitative evidence of carers' experiences of the assessment and detention of their family and friends under mental health legislation. Method We searched five bibliographic databases, reference lists and citations. Studies were included if they collected data using qualitative methods and the patients were aged 18 or older; reported on carer experiences of assessment or detention under mental health legislation anywhere in the world; and were published in peer-reviewed journals. We used meta-synthesis. Results The review included 23 papers. Themes were consistent across time and setting and related to the emotional impact of detention; the availability of support for carers; the extent to which carers felt involved in decision-making; relationships with patients and staff during detention; and the quality of care provided to patients. Carers often described conflicting feelings of relief coupled with distress and anxiety about how the patient might cope and respond. Carers also spoke about the need for timely and accessible information, supportive and trusting relationships with mental health professionals, and of involvement as partners in care. Conclusions Research is needed to explore whether and how health service and other interventions can improve the involvement and support of carers prior to, during and after the detention of family members and friends.

AB  - Question What is the long-term outcome of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder? Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 69 randomized clinical trials including 4118 patients, cognitive behavioral therapy was associated with better outcomes compared with control conditions among patients with anxiety symptoms within 12 months after treatment completion. At longer follow-up, significant associations were found only for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder; relapse rates (predominantly for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia) after 3 to 12 months were 0% to 14%. Meaning The findings suggest that compared with control conditions, cognitive behavioral therapy was generally associated with lower anxiety symptoms within 12 months after treatment completion, but few studies have examined longer-term outcomes.
   Importance Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended for anxiety-related disorders, but evidence for its long-term outcome is limited. Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the long-term outcomes after cognitive behavioral therapy (compared with care as usual, relaxation, psychoeducation, pill placebo, supportive therapy, or waiting list) for anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Data Sources English-language publications were identified from PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, OpenGrey (1980 to January 2019), and recent reviews. The search strategy included a combination of terms associated with anxiety disorders (eg, panic or phobi*) and study design (eg, clinical trial or randomized controlled trial). Study Selection Randomized clinical trials on posttreatment and at least 1-month follow-up effects of cognitive behavioral therapy compared with control conditions among adults with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, PTSD, or OCD. Data Extraction and Synthesis Researchers independently screened records, extracted statistics, and assessed study quality. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures Hedges g was calculated for anxiety symptoms immediately after treatment and at 1 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, and more than 12 months after treatment completion. Results Of 69 randomized clinical trials (4118 outpatients) that were mainly of low quality, cognitive behavioral therapy compared with control conditions was associated with improved outcomes after treatment completion and at 1 to 6 months and at 6 to 12 months of follow-up for a generalized anxiety disorder (Hedges g, 0.07-0.40), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (Hedges g, 0.22-0.35), social anxiety disorder (Hedges g, 0.34-0.60), specific phobia (Hedges g, 0.49-0.72), PTSD (Hedges g, 0.59-0.72), and OCD (Hedges g, 0.70-0.85). After 12-month follow-up, these associations were still significant for generalized anxiety disorder (Hedges g, 0.22; number of studies [k] = 10), social anxiety disorder (Hedges g, 0.42; k = 3), and PTSD (Hedges g, 0.84; k = 5), but not for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (k = 5) and could not be calculated for specific phobia (k = 1) and OCD (k = 0). Relapse rates after 3 to 12 months were 0% to 14% but were reported in only 6 randomized clinical trials (predominantly for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety-related disorders is associated with improved outcomes compared with control conditions until 12 months after treatment completion. After 12 months, effects were small to medium for generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, large for PTSD, and not significant or not available for other disorders. High-quality randomized clinical trials with more than 12 months of follow-up and reported relapse rates are needed.
   This systematic review and meta-analysis of 69 randomized clinical trials assesses long-term outcomes after cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

AB  - Question Is the receipt of a preferred treatment associated with dropout and clinical outcomes in adult psychosocial mental health interventions? Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 randomized clinical trials involving 5294 participants with a mental health diagnosis found that receiving preferred psychosocial mental health treatment was associated with lower dropout rates and had a medium positive association with therapeutic alliance. There was no evidence of a significant association with clinical outcomes. Meaning Offering patients with a mental health diagnosis their preferred treatment is associated with important aspects of engagement in psychosocial interventions; these findings strengthen existing policy and guidance on ensuring informed treatment choice in mental health care.
   This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the association of patient treatment preference with dropout and clinical outcomes in adult psychosocial mental health interventions.
   Importance Receiving a preferred treatment has previously been associated with lower dropout rates and better clinical outcomes, but this scenario has not been investigated specifically for psychosocial interventions for patients with a mental health diagnosis. Objective To assess the association of patient treatment preference with dropout and clinical outcomes in adult psychosocial mental health interventions via a systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources The Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, PsychINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Nice HDAS (Healthcare Databases Advanced Search), Google Scholar, BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine), Semantic Scholar, and OpenGrey were searched from inception to July 20, 2018, and updated on June 10, 2019. Study Selection Studies were eligible if they (1) were a randomized clinical trial; (2) involved participants older than 18 years; (3) involved participants with mental health diagnoses; (4) reported data from a group of participants who received their preferred treatment and a group who received their nonpreferred treatment or who were not given a choice; and (5) offered at least 1 psychosocial intervention. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two researchers extracted study data for attendance, dropout, and clinical outcomes independently. Both assessed the risk of bias according to the Cochrane tool. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Main Outcomes and Measures The following 7 outcomes were examined: attendance, dropout, therapeutic alliance, depression and anxiety outcomes, global outcomes, treatment satisfaction, and remission. Results A total of 7341 articles were identified, with 34 eligible for inclusion. Twenty-nine articles were included in the meta-analyses comprising 5294 participants. Receiving a preferred psychosocial mental health treatment had a medium positive association with dropout rates (relative risk, 0.62; 0.48-0.80; P < .001; I-2 = 44.6%) and therapeutic alliance (Cohen d = 0.48; 0.15-0.82; P = .01; I-2 = 20.4%). There was no evidence of a significant association with other outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance This is the first review, to our knowledge, examining the association of receiving a preferred psychosocial mental health treatment with both engagement and outcomes for patients with a mental health diagnosis. Patients with mental health diagnoses who received their preferred treatment demonstrated a lower dropout rate from treatment and higher therapeutic alliance scores. These findings underline the need to accommodate patient preference in mental health services to maximize treatment uptake and reduce financial costs of premature dropout and disengagement.

AB  - Purpose of review Challenging behaviour shown by individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) has a major negative impact. There is robust evidence for the efficacy of treatments based on applied behaviour analysis. However, such approaches are limited in important ways - providing only part of the whole solution. We reviewed the literature to provide an overview of recent progress in psychological treatments for challenging behaviour and how these advance the field beyond a purely behavioural approach. Recent finding We identified 1029 articles via a systematic search and screened for those implementing a psychological intervention with individuals with NDD (or caregivers) and measuring the potential impact on challenging behaviour. Of the 69 included studies published since 2018, more than 50% implemented a purely behavioural intervention. Other studies could generally be categorized as implementing parent training, meditation, skill training or technology-assisted interventions. Greater consideration of the interplay between behavioural and nonbehavioural intervention components; systematic approaches to personalization when going beyond the behavioural model; mental health and broad social communication needs; and models that include cognitive and emotional pathways to challenging behaviour; is needed to advance the field. Furthermore, technology should not be overlooked as an important potential facilitator of intervention efforts.

AB  - Conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) against women and girls has been the subject of increasing research and scholarship. Less is known about the health of men, boys and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) and other gender non-binary persons who survive CRSV. This paper is the first systematic realist review on medical, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) interventions that focusses on male and LGBT survivors of CRSV. The review explores the gender differences in context, mechanisms and outcomes that underpin interventions addressing the health and psychosocial wellbeing of male and LGBT survivors. The aim is to contribute to the design and delivery of gender-sensitive and, when needed, gender-specific approaches for interventions that respond to specific needs of different groups of all survivors. We conducted a systematic search of academic and grey literature to identify medical and MHPSS interventions that included men, boys and LGBT survivors. We identified interventions specifically targeting women and girls that we used as comparators. We then purposively sampled studies from the fields of gender and health, and sexual abuse against men and LGBT people for theory building and testing. We identified 26 evaluations of interventions for survivors of CRSV. Nine studies included male survivors, twelve studies focussed exclusively on female survivors and one study targeted children and adolescents. No intervention evaluation focussed on LGBT survivors of CRSV. The interventions that included male survivors did not describe specific components for this population. Results of intervention evaluations that included male survivors were not disaggregated by gender, and some studies did not report the gender composition. Although some mental health and psychosocial consequences of sexual violence against men and boys may be similar among male and female survivors, the way each process trauma, display symptoms, seek help, adhere to treatment and improve their mental health differ by gender. Initiatives targeting male and LGBT survivors of CRSV need to be designed to actively address specific gender differences in access, adherence and response to MHPSS interventions. Models of care that are gender-sensitive and integrated to local resources are promising avenues to promote the health of male and LGBT survivors of CRSV.

AB  - Background: Although biofeedback using electrophysiology has been explored extensively, the approach of using neurofeedback corresponding to hemodynamic response is a relatively young field. Real time functional magnetic resonance imaging-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) uses sensory feedback to operantly reinforce patterns of neural response. It can be used, for example, to alter visual perception, increase brain connectivity, and reduce depression symptoms. Within recent years, interest in rt-fMRI-NF in both research and clinical contexts has expanded considerably. As such, building a consensus regarding best practices is of great value.
   Objective: This systematic review is designed to describe and evaluate the variations in methodology used in previous rt-fMRI-NF studies to provide recommendations for rt-fMRI-NF study designs that are mostly likely to elicit reproducible and consistent effects of neurofeedback.
   Methods: We conducted a database search for fMRI neurofeedback papers published prior to September 26th, 2019. Of 558 studies identified, 146 met criteria for inclusion. The following information was collected from each study: sample size and type, task used, neurofeedback calculation, regulation procedure, feedback, whether feedback was explicitly related to changing brain activity, feedback timing, control group for active neurofeedback, how many runs and sessions of neurofeedback, if a follow-up was conducted, and the results of neurofeedback training.
   Results: rt-fMRI-NF is typically upregulation practice based on hemodynamic response from a specific region of the brain presented using a continually updating thermometer display. Most rt-fMRI-NF studies are conducted in healthy samples and half evaluate its effect on immediate changes in behavior or affect. The most popular control group method is to provide sham signal from another region; however, many studies do not compare use a comparison group.
   Conclusions: We make several suggestions for designs of future rt-fMRI-NF studies. Researchers should use feedback calculation methods that consider neural response across regions (i.e., SVM or connectivity), which should be conveyed as intermittent, auditory feedback. Participants should be given explicit instructions and should be assessed on individual differences. Future rt-fMRI-NF studies should use clinical samples; effectiveness of rt-fMRI-NF should be evaluated on clinical/behavioral outcomes at follow-up time points in comparison to both a sham and no feedback control group.

AB  - Purpose of Review Studies on the relations between shame and anxiety and obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) are reviewed, with a focus on recent work. Recent Findings Medium-sized positive correlations have been consistently found across anxiety disorders and OCRDs, suggesting that this relation is transdiagnostic. Most studies focused on shame-proneness and found similar relations across multiple types (e.g. internal, external) and domains (e.g. bodily, characterological, behavioural) of shame, with little variation between clinical and non-clinical populations and different age categories. However, most studies are cross-sectional and correlational and by separately studying clinical and non-clinical populations, they do not give a unitary dimensional view of the relation between shame and symptoms. Emerging findings suggest that shame may be a marker of the response to treatment in these disorders, and its relation with symptoms may be bidirectional. The consistent but medium-sized associations between shame and symptoms of anxiety and OCRDs warrant the future search for mediators and moderators.

AB  - Mood disorders such as depression and anxiety are frequently observed in patients suffering from chronic pain. Over time, different tests and models have been developed in rodents to study the anxiodepressive-like consequences of chronic pain. This review describes these preclinical tools (models and tests) used for studying behavioural aspects of the comorbid relationship between chronic pain and anxiety and/or major depressive disorder. Three major types of chronic pain strongly associated with anxiodepressive-like comorbidity as well as their animal models are presented: neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain and fibromyalgia. After a description of chronic pain animal models and of the tests that allow determining nociceptive responses, this review presents and discusses the various behavioural tests that have been used to assess anxiety and depressive-like behaviours in these models of chronic pain. Finally, this review highlights the progress that remains to be made to homogenize the results in the field of pain-induced mood disorders and summarizes the recent advances achieved through these tests and models.

AB  - Aim Young people experiencing mental ill health are more likely than their healthy aged peers to drop out of high school. This can result in social exclusion and vocational derailment. Identifying young people at risk and taking action before an illness is established or school dropout occurs is an important goal. This study aimed to examine evidence for the risk markers and at risk mental states of the clinical staging model (stage 0-1b) and whether these risk states and early symptoms impact school participation and academic attainment.
   Method This narrative review assembles research from both the psychiatry and education literature. It examines stage 0 to stage 1b of the clinical staging model and links the risk states and early symptoms to evidence about the academic success of young people in high school.
   Results In accordance with the clinical staging model and evidence from education literature, childhood trauma and parental mental illness can impact school engagement and academic progress. Sleep disturbance can result in academic failure. Undifferentiated depression and anxiety can increase the risk for school dropout. Subthreshold psychosis and hypomanic states are associated with functional impairment and high rates of Not in Employment, Education, or Training (NEET) but are not recognized in the education literature.
   Conclusion Risk markers for emerging mental ill health can be identified in education research and demonstrate an impact on a student's success in high school. Clear referral protocols need to be embedded into school life to reduce risk of progression to later stages of illness and support school participation and success.

AB  - Background Mental health conditions are leading causes of disability worldwide. Psychosocial interventions for these conditions might have a key role in their treatment, although applicability of findings to poor-resource settings might be a challenge. We aimed to evaluate the strength and credibility of evidence generated in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for various mental health outcomes.
   Methods We did an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised studies done in LMICs. Literature searches were done in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos from Jan 1, 2010, until May 31, 2019. Systematic reviews of randomised studies investigating the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for mental health conditions in LMICs were included. Systematic reviews of promotion, prevention, and protection interventions were excluded, because the focus was on treatment interventions only. Information on first author, year of publication, outcomes, number of included studies, and reported summary meta-analytic estimates was extracted from included meta-analyses. Summary effects were recalculated using a common metric and random-effects models. We assessed between-study heterogeneity, predictive intervals, publication bias, small-study effects, and whether the results of the observed positive studies were more than expected by chance. On the basis of these calculations, strength of associations was assessed using quantitative umbrella review criteria, and credibility of evidence using the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019135711.
   Findings 123 primary studies from ten systematic reviews were included. The evidence on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in adults with depression in humanitarian settings (standardised mean difference 0.87, 95% CI 0.67-1.07; highly suggestive association, GRADE: moderate) and in adults with common mental disorders (0.49, 0.36-0.62; highly suggestive association, GRADE: moderate) was supported by the most robust evidence. Highly suggestive strength of association was found for psychosocial interventions in adults with schizophrenia for functional outcomes, in adults with depression, and in adults with post-traumatic stress disorder in humanitarian settings. In children in humanitarian settings, and in children with disruptive behaviour, psychosocial interventions were supported by suggestive evidence of efficacy.
   Interpretation A relatively large amount of evidence suggests the benefit of psychosocial interventions on various mental health outcomes in LMICs. However, strength of associations and credibility of evidence were quite variable, depending on the target mental health condition, type of population and setting, and outcome of interest. This varied evidence should be considered in the development of clinical, policy, and implementation programmes in LMICs and should prompt further studies to improve the strength and credibility of the evidence base.

AB  - A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the literature concerning the effects of paternal perinatal depression (PPND) on socioemotional and behavioral development in children. We assessed the literature using searches in PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Embase from inception to November 2019 and supplemented it by manual searches. Two authors independently selected the eligible studies and extracted data, and three authors assessed the quality of the studies. To explore the effects of PPND on a child's socioemotional and behavioral development, a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, followed by the construction of a funnel plot. Nine studies were included for review. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of behavioral problems in children with PPND as compared to non-PPND was 1.209 (95% Cl: 1.137-1.285), the pooled OR of emotional problems in children with PPND was 1.265 (95% CI: 1.180-1.356), and the pooled OR of social functions in children with PPND was OR = 1.299 (95% CI: 0.972-1.736). PPND may play a significant role in adversely impacting the emotional and behavioral development in children during early childhood. Thus, interventions for PPND should be initiated to make up the negative effect of PPND on a child's emotional and behavioral development.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered a promising intervention for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (trOCD). We conducted a systematic search to investigate the efficacy and safety of DBS for OCD. Primary outcomes included the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), adverse events (AE), and quality of life. We assessed affective state, global functioning, cognition, and tolerability as secondary outcomes. Eight studies comprising 80 patients with trOCD were analysed both individually and collectively. We found a pooled mean reduction in Y-BOCS of 38.68 %, indicating DBS could be considered an effective therapy for trOCD. Most AE were mild and transient, however there were five severe surgery-related AE: intracerebral haemorrhage in three patients and infection in two. Mood-related serious AE were one completed suicide, three suicide attempts in two patients, and suicidal thoughts and depression in four. Despite this, affective state improved following stimulation. Despite being limited by significant heterogeneity across studies, our review has shown DBS to be an effective treatment in otherwise trOCD. There is a need to standardise study methodology in future research.

AB  - Glutamatergic modulators may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depressive disorder (DD), riluzole, as a modulating drug of the glutamatergic system, its antidepressant efficacy and safety of riluzole for DD are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to determine the efficacy and safety of riluzole used for DD.
   A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, VIP and other databases from 1980 to 2019. The primary outcome was change in depression severity and meta analysis was performed using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. There was some difference in depression severity change in riluzole-citalopram therapy. No significant differences were observed in response rate, remission rate, relapse rate and adverse events, while, the relapse time in riluzole group was longer than placebo group.
   In this meta-analysis riluzole showed no antidepressant efficacy compared to placebo in monotherapy or riluzole-ketamine combined therapy, while it might relieve depression severity to some extent in riluzole-citalopram therapy. Furthermore, riluzole showed favorable safety for DD. The longer relapse time of riluzole group might have clinical significance to some extent, although this had no statistical difference. More studies are needed to clarify the potential association between riluzole and DD.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are prevalent in both civilian and military service members. As the number of smartphone-based applications (apps) grows rapidly in health care, apps are also increasingly used to help individuals with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Yet, if the apps are self-managed, the feasibility and efficacy of such interventions are still rather unclear in these two populations with PTSD symptoms. Hence, the present meta-analysis set out to evaluate the effect of self-management smartphone-based apps on PTSD and depressive symptoms in populations with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Studies were included if they conducted randomized controlled trials or pre-post comparisons. Six studies (n = 2 randomized controlled trials) were identified for meta-analysis. In pre-post comparisons, N = 209 participants were included in the analyses. In randomized controlled trials, N = 87 participants received smartphone-based self-management interventions and N = 82 participants were in waitlist control conditions. Meta-analysis for pre-post comparisons concluded an effect of g = 0.55 (p < 0.001) regarding the overall reduction in PTSD symptoms (n = 6) and g = 0.45 (p < 0.001) for reduction in depressive symptoms (n = 5). Yet, in randomized controlled trials, no significant difference was found between app-based treatment and waitlist control groups (g = 0.09, p = 0.574). The duration of the interventions did not significantly influence the results. Overall, despite positive pre-post effects, current results indicate that smartphone-apps for PTSD patients are not significantly more effective than waitlist control conditions. Nevertheless, a combined smartphone and standard therapy approach may be a fruitful field for future research.

AB  - Epidemiological evidence on the association between sedentary behaviors and the risk of depression is inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies to identify the impact of sedentary behaviors on the risk of depression. We systematically searched in the PubMed and Embase databases to June 2019 for prospective cohort studies investigating sedentary behaviors in relation to the risk of depression. The pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with random-effect meta-analysis. In addition, meta-regression analyses, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. Twelve prospective studies involving 128,553 participants were identified. A significantly positive association between sedentary behavior and the risk of depression was observed (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.19, I-2 = 60.6%, P < 0.01). Subgroup analyses revealed that watching television was positively associated with the risk of depression (RR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.30), whereas using a computer was not (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.79-1.23). Mentally passive sedentary behaviors could increase the risk of depression (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.27), whereas the effect of mentally active sedentary behaviors were non-significant (RR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.83-1.15). Sedentary behaviors were positively related to depression defined by clinical diagnosis (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.03, 1.14), whereas the associations were statistically non-significant when depression was evaluated by the CES-D and the Prime-MD screening. The present study suggests that mentally passive sedentary behaviors, such as watching television, could increase the risk of depression. Interventions that reduce mentally passive sedentary behaviors may prevent depression.

AB  - Background More than two million early care and education (ECE) providers care for young children in the USA each day. These providers tend to earn low wages and many are enrolled in public assistance programs. Nearly all ECE providers are female and they are disproportionately women of color. Despite the fact that these attributes place the ECE workforce at greater risk of chronic disease, the health status of the workforce is not established and the availability and effectiveness of interventions to improve their health status is also not known. Methods We conducted a scoping review of both the published literature and current practice to identify all articles and interventions targeting the health status of the ECE workforce. Our search strategy identified scientific articles published in English within the past 10 years as well as any interventions targeting the ECE workforce that have been implemented within the past 3 years. Data from both scientific articles and practice were extracted using systematic methods and summarized. Results Thirteen studies described some component of physical health including diet quality (11 studies), physical activity (8 studies), and height/weight/body mass index (7 studies), and 21 studies assessed component(s) of mental health including depression (15 studies), stress (8 studies), and mindfulness (3 studies). ECE providers reported a high prevalence of overweight, obesity, and chronic disease diagnoses and spend significant time being sedentary, and some report low diet quality. Mental health concerns in this population include depression and high stress. Eleven interventions targeting ECE workforce wellness were also identified; most focused on nutrition, physical activity and/or stress. Conclusion The limited evidence available for review describes a workforce in need of health promotion interventions to address high levels of mental and physical health challenges, some above and beyond peers with comparable demographic characteristics. Several promising interventions were identified from both the published and unpublished literature; these interventions should be further implemented and evaluated to assess their impact on the workforce.

AB  - Context: Patients with eating disorders (EDs) may have a lower mentalization ability. To the best of our knowledge, no meta-analysis has so far addressed the multidimensional mentalization profile within these patients. Objective: To summarize the existing evidence of the mentalization profile and its association with EDs. Data sources: We searched for articles in PsychINFO, Embase and PubMed using the search terms mentalization, reflective function, adult attachment interview, alexithymia, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, eye test, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, Theory of Mind, mind-mindedness, mind-blindness, facial expression recognition, metacognition, ED, anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). Studies included: Quantitative studies including diagnosed patients with an ED, healthy controls (HCs) and relevant test methods. Data synthesis: Forty-four studies were included. Nine studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. Significantly lower mentalization ability about oneself was found in patients with an ED when compared to HCs. Groups were more comparable when dealing with mentalization ability of others. Non-significant but clinically relevant results include a tendency for a lower mentalization ability in patients with AN compared to patients with BN. Conclusion: The mentalization profile is complex and varies across dimensions of mentalization in patients with an ED. Different degrees of mentalization between various EDs were found, implying the necessity for further research on mentalization profiles in different ED diagnoses. The sparse existing literature was a limitation for this meta-analysis, emphasizing that further research on the mentalization profile in patients with EDs is needed.

AB  - While becoming inextricable to our daily lives, online social media are blamed for increasing mental health problems in younger people. This systematic review synthesized evidence on the influence of social media use on depression, anxiety and psychological distress in adolescents. A search of PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, CINAHL and SSCI databases reaped 13 eligible studies, of which 12 were cross-sectional. Findings were classified into four domains of social media: time spent, activity, investment and addiction. All domains correlated with depression, anxiety and psychological distress. However, there are considerable caveats due to methodological limitations of cross-sectional design, sampling and measures. Mechanisms of the putative effects of social media on mental health should be explored further through qualitative enquiry and longitudinal cohort studies.

AB  - Introduction: Many studies have been done on the effects of heat stress on cognitive functions, but the results are inconsistent. This article aimed to review the effect of heat stress on cognitive functions.
   Material and method: In this study, all English articles conducted on effect of heat stress on cognitive, perceptual, and psychomotor functions from 1970 to 2018 were reviewed. For this, articles with keywords such as heat strain, heat stress, cognitive function, memory, comprehension, psychomotor, reaction time, mental performance, mood, mental response, error, task performance, fatigue, alertness, hyperthermia, and heat exhaustion were searched in the Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Pub Med, Springer, Wiley Online Library and ProQuest databases. Out of 157 retrieved articles, 39 articles were finally reviewed according to the inclusion criteria.
   Results: Out of 157 retrieved articles related to the topic, according to the inclusion criteria, 39 articles were finally considered for review. Among this articles, 9 (%23) articles were published \ before 2000 and 30 (%77) after 2000. Two articles were in athletes, four articles (%10.2) in workers, four articles (%10.2) in students, four articles (%10.2) in military soldiers and twenty-five articles (%64.2) were conducted in ordinary people. Based on the results, heat stress was identified as a detrimental factor for decreased cognitive functions such as reading comprehension, memory, focus, mathematical processing, tracking test, reaction time, perception and decoding text and numeric messages, visual alertness, mental computing, text reading, hidden figures test and verbal fluency.
   Conclusion: Based on the results of these studies, heat stress has been introduced as a detrimental factor for disrupting cognitive functions, but conclusion based on the results of studies is a systematic method is difficult because many confounding variables such as type of work, exposure time, skill and adaptation plays a big role.

AB  - Objective: Psychological well-being has been associated with desirable individual and organisational outcomes. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of digital interventions for the improvement of psychological well-being and/or the prevention/management of poor mental well-being in the workplace. Methods: This review protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019142428). Scientific databases including MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and EMBASE will be searched for relevant studies published between January 1990 and July 2019. Studies will be included if they report specific primary and secondary outcomes of digital interventions delivered to adults in the workplace for the improvement of their psychological wellbeing and/or the prevention/management of poor mental well-being and were published in English. Following screening of titles and abstracts, full texts of potentially eligible papers will be screened in duplicate to identify studies that assess the effectiveness of those digital interventions. Discrepancies will be resolved through consensus or by consulting a third reviewer. An integrated narrative synthesis will assess included studies' findings, and a meta-analysis will be performed if included studies appear to be homogeneous. The "Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias" tool and the JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies will be used to appraise included studies. Conclusion: The results of this work will provide recommendations on the use of digital interventions for the promotion of psychological well-being at work. It will also guide the development of future workplace digital interventions and subsequent primary research in this field.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides a valuable field of research into impairment of self-consciousness (SC), because AD patients have a reduced capacity to understand their mental world, to experience and relive previous personal events, as well as to interpret thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about themselves. Several studies observed that AD patients had an altered SC, but not a complete abolition of it. Emotions are an integral part of the construction of personal identity, therefore of Self. In general, most studies on emotion in AD patients have observed that emotion is not completely abolished and it lets them better remember autobiographical events with greater emotional charge. The positive effect of autobiographical memories rich in emotional content, evoked directly/automatically by sensorial stimuli such as familiar odors or music, could be used to reestablish/reinforce the permanence and coherence of the Self in AD. We studied the research of empirical evidence supporting the power of the sensorial cues associated with emotion, which could be capable of enhancing the SC in AD. We presented the studies about "Emotional stimulations" using odor, music, or taste cues in AD. All studies have shown to have a positive impact on SC in AD patients such as odor-evoked autobiographical memories, taste/odor-evoked autobiographical memories, emotional sensorial stimulation using musical cues, and multi-sensorial stimulations using healing gardens. We found research supporting the notion that emotional sensorial stimulations can even temporarily exalt memory, affective state, and personal identity, that is, the SC in AD. The emotional sensory stimulations could be used as a tool to activate the SC in AD and hence improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers.

AB  - Introduction Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease. Snakebite causes at least 120 000 death each year and it is estimated that there are three times as many amputations. Snakebite survivors are known to suffer from long-term physical and psychological sequelae, but not much is known on the mental health manifestations postsnakebite. Methods We conducted a scoping review and searched five major electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE(R), Global Health, APA PsycINFO, EMBASE classic+EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), contacted experts and conducted reference screening to identify primary studies on mental health manifestations after snakebite envenomation. Two reviewers independently conducted titles and abstract screening as well as full-text evaluation for final inclusion decision. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We extracted data as per a standardised form and conducted narrative synthesis. Results We retrieved 334 studies and finally included 11 studies that met our eligibility criteria. Of the 11 studies reported, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the most commonly studied mental health condition after snakebite, with five studies reporting it. Estimate of the burden of PTSD after snakebite was available from a modelling study. The other mental health conditions reported were focused around depression, psychosocial impairment of survivors after a snakebite envenomation, hysteria, delusional disorders and acute stress disorders. Conclusion There is a need for more research on understanding the neglected aspect of psychological morbidity of snakebite envenomation, particularly in countries with high burden. From the limited evidence available, depression and PTSD are major mental health manifestations in snakebite survivors.

AB  - Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD, PD) have a pediatric and young adult onset in Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC). The SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic RNA virus is triggering neurological complications and deep concern regarding acceleration of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes already in progress. This review, based on our MMC experience, will discuss two major issues: 1) why residents chronically exposed to air pollution are likely to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 systemic and brain effects and 2) why young people with AD and PD already in progress will accelerate neurodegenerative processes. Secondary mental consequences of social distancing and isolation, fear, financial insecurity, violence, poor health support, and lack of understanding of the complex crisis are expected in MMC residents infected or free of SARS-CoV-2. MMC residents with pre-SARS-CoV-2 accumulation of misfolded proteins diagnostic of AD and PD and metal-rich, magnetic nanoparticles damaging key neural organelles are an ideal host for neurotropic SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus invading the body through the same portals damaged by nanoparticles: nasal olfactory epithelium, the gastrointestinal tract, and the alveolar-capillary portal. We urgently need MMC multicenter retrospective-prospective neurological and psychiatric population follow-up and intervention strategies in place in case of acceleration of neurodegenerative processes, increased risk of suicide, and mental disease worsening. Identification of vulnerable populations and continuous effort to lower air pollution ought to be critical steps.

AB  - Despite the progress made in HIV treatment and prevention, HIV remains a major cause of adolescent morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. As perinatally infected children increasingly survive into adulthood, the quality of life and mental health of this population has increased in importance. This review provides a synthesis of the prevalence of mental health problems in this population and explores associated factors. A systematic database search (Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus) with an additional hand search was conducted. Peer-reviewed studies on adolescents (aged 10-19), published between 2008 and 2019, assessing mental health symptoms or psychiatric disorders, either by standardized questionnaires or by diagnostic interviews, were included. The search identified 1461 articles, of which 301 were eligible for full-text analysis. Fourteen of these, concerning HIV-positive adolescents, met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised. Mental health problems were highly prevalent among this group, with around 25% scoring positive for any psychiatric disorder and 30-50% showing emotional or behavioral difficulties or significant psychological distress. Associated factors found by regression analysis were older age, not being in school, impaired family functioning, HIV-related stigma and bullying, and poverty. Social support and parental competence were protective factors. Mental health problems among HIV-positive adolescents are highly prevalent and should be addressed as part of regular HIV care.

AB  - This meta-review integrates the current meta-analysis literature on the efficacy of internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) for mental disorders and somatic diseases in children and adolescents. Further, it summarizes the moderators of treatment effects in this age group. Using a systematic literature search of PsycINFO and MEDLINE/PubMed, we identified eight meta-analyses (N = 8,417) that met all inclusion criteria. Current meta-analytical evidence of IMIs exists for depression (range of standardized mean differences, SMDs = .16 to .76; 95 % CI: -.12 to 1.12; k = 3 meta-analyses), anxiety (SMDs = .30 to 1.4; 95 % CI: -.53 to 2.44; k = 5) and chronic pain (SMD = .41; 95 % CI:.07 to .74; k = 1) with predominantly nonactive control conditions (waiting-list; placebo). The effect size for IMIs across mental disorders reported in one meta-analysis is SMD = 1.27 (95% CI:.96 to 1.59; k = 1), the effect size of IMIs for different somatic conditions is SMD =.49 (95 % CI:.33 to.64; k = 1). Moderators of treatment effects are age (k = 3), symptom severity (k = 1), and source of outcome assessment (k = 1). Quality ratings with the AMSTAR-2-checklist indicate acceptable methodological rigor of meta-analyses included. Taken together, this meta-review suggests that IMIs are efficacious in some health conditions in youths, with evidence existing primarily for depression and anxiety so far. The findings point to the potential of IMIs to augment evidence based mental healthcare for children and adolescents.

AB  - Background: Several existing studies have reported that occupational factors might play an important part in cognitive function with aging.
   Objective: We aim to explore the associations between modifiable occupational factors and risk of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Methods: Adopting random-effect models, this study conducted primary analyses for all occupational factors and subgroup analyses for the effect of occupation type based on prospective cohort and case-control studies searched from PubMed and EMBASE databases up to March 2020.
   Results: Among the 38,111 identified literatures, 9 studies on occupation type, 4 studies on work complexity, and 30 studies on occupational exposure were included. In terms of occupation type, mental work conferred a 44% reduced risk (95% CI = 0.34-0.94, I-2 = 85.00%, p < 0.01) for MCI. In terms of work complexity, higher work complexity conferred a 5% reduced risk (95% CI = 0.91-1.00, I-2 = 57.00%, p < 0.01) for dementia. In terms of occupational exposure, high strain and passive job in the longest-held job conferred a 1.21- and 1.15-fold excess risk (95% CI = 1.05-1.39 I-2 = 62.00%, p < 0.05; 95% CI = 1.05-1.26 I-2 = 31.00%, p = 0.23; respectively) of cognitive decline. Besides, magnetic field exposure conferred a 1.26-fold excess risk (95% CI = 1.01-1.57, I-2 = 69.00%, p < 0.01) for dementia.
   Conclusion: Novel prevention strategies based on occupational factors may hold promise against dementia and MCI.

AB  - With the advancement in modern information technology, virtual reality (VR) is being increasingly used for the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of mental disorders. Recently, a VR-based cognitive behavioral therapy for social phobia has been recognized as a new medical technology in South Korea. This might lead to an increase in the use of VR in the field of psychiatry. The present review provides an overview of the status of VR therapies in various psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis, addiction, and eating disorder. Besides, it summarizes the role of VR therapy in the management of disorders associated with child and adolescence psychiatry as well as various other clinical applications. Additionally, we discuss the merits and limitations of VR therapy, which might serve as a useful reference for researchers. In the current environment wherein novel medical models consisting of a combination of digital devices and medicine are being developed; understanding new technologies such as VR could open new doors to mental health treatments.

AB  - Aims. Major depressive disorders are highly prevalent in the world population, contribute substantially to the global disease burden and cause high health care expenditures. Information on the economic impact of depression, as provided by cost-of-illness (COI) studies, can support policymakers in the decision-making regarding resource allocation. Although the literature on COI studies of depression has already been reviewed, there is no quantitative estimation of depression excess costs across studies yet. Our aims were to systematically review COI studies of depression with comparison group worldwide and to assess the excess costs of depression in adolescents, adults, elderly, and depression as a comorbidity of a primary somatic disease quantitatively in a meta-analysis.
   Methods. We followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines. PubMed, PsycINFO, NHS EED, and EconLit were searched without limitations until 27/04/2018. English or German fulltext peer-reviewed articles that compared mean costs of depressed and non-depressed study participants from a bottom-up approach were included. We only included studies reporting costs for major depressive disorders. Data were pooled using a random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed with I-2 statistic. The primary outcome was ratio of means (RoM) of costs of depressed v. non-depressed study participants, interpretable as the percentage change in mean costs between the groups.
   Results. We screened 12 760 articles by title/abstract, assessed 393 articles in full-text and included 48 articles. The included studies encompassed in total 55 898 depressed and 674 414 non-depressed study participants. Meta-analysis showed that depression was associated with higher direct costs in adolescents (RoM = 2.79 [1.69-4.59], p < 0.0001, I-2 = 87%), in adults (RoM = 2.58 [2.01-3.31], p < 0.0001, I-2 = 99%), in elderly (RoM = 1.73 [1.47-2.03], p < 0.0001, I-2 = 73%) and in participants with comorbid depression (RoM = 1.39 [1.24-1.55], p < 0.0001, I-2 = 42%). In addition, we conducted meta-analyses for inpatient, outpatient, medication and emergency costs and a cost category including all other direct cost categories. Meta-analysis of indirect costs showed that depression was associated with higher costs in adults (RoM = 2.28 [1.75-2.98], p < 0.0001, I-2 = 74%).
   Conclusions. This work is the first to provide a meta-analysis in a global systematic review of COI studies for depression. Depression was associated with higher costs in all age groups and as comorbidity. Pooled RoM was highest in adolescence and decreased with age. In the subgroup with depression as a comorbidity of a primary somatic disease, pooled RoM was lower as compared to the age subgroups. More evidence in COI studies for depression in adolescence and for indirect costs would be desirable.

AB  - Objectives: Mind-body exercise has been generally recognized as a beneficial strategy to improve mental health in those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). However, to date, no attempt has been made to collate this literature. The aim of the present study was to systematically analyze the effects of mind-body exercise for COPD patients with anxiety and depression and provide scientific evidence-based exercise prescription. Methods: both Chinese and English databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Baidu Scholar) were used as sources of data to search randomized controlled trials (RCT) relating to mind-body exercise in COPD patients with anxiety and depression that were published between January 1982 to June 2019. 13 eligible RCT studies were finally used for meta-analysis. Results: Mind-body exercise (tai chi, health qigong, yoga) had significant benefits on COPD patients with anxiety (SMD = -0.76, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.60, p = 0.04, I-2 = 47.4%) and depression (SMD = -0.86, 95% CI -1.14 to -0.58, p = 0.000, I-2 = 71.4%). Sub-group analysis indicated that, for anxiety, 30-60 min exercise session for 24 weeks of health qigong or yoga had a significant effect on patients with COPD who are more than 70 years and have more than a 10-year disease course. For depression, 2-3 times a week, 30-60 min each time of health qigong had a significant effect on patients with COPD patients who are more than 70 years old and have less than a 10-year disease course. Conclusions: Mind-body exercise could reduce levels of anxiety and depression in those with COPD. More robust RCT are required on this topic.

AB  - Overinvolved/protective parenting has emerged in child development literature as part of the etiology of internalizing problems (anxiety/depression). This review aimed to explore overinvolved/protective parenting questionnaires that exist in the internalizing literature for different childhood periods and their psychometric properties (reliability, validity, norms). A systematic review was conducted through seven databases and Google Scholar. Extraction and evaluation of psychometric properties were double coded. Four hundred and sixty publications were screened for eligibility, with 20 of these further assessed. Ten overinvolved/protective parenting questionnaires were described in the literature (between 1993 and 2019) six starting as young as preschool age, two at primary school age and two in adolescence. Some questionnaires at each age stood out in terms of psychometric development: at preschool age, the Overinvolved/protective Parenting Scale, and at primary and high school age the Modified My Memories of Upbringing for Children. The Parental Bonding Instrument is also recommended in late adolescence. Clinicians and researchers can select from the questionnaires reviewed, to assist in clinical practice with children and families, along with etiology, treatment and prevention research.

AB  - Background: Family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease are the most important support in concrete personal and economic terms. Family dynamics play a fundamental role in the provision of informal caregiving benefits.
   Objective: This review aims to identify factors related to the family caregiving of relatives with Alzheimer's disease, taking specifically into account the construct of coping and expressed emotion.
   Methods: This is a systematic review including articles selected using search terms including "caregivers," "Alzheimer's," "family," and "relationship" in research databases. Findings were synthesized and categorized into themes.
   Results: A total of 454 abstracts were identified. Following screening, lateral searches, and quality appraisal, 36 studies were included for synthesis. A total of 5 themes were identified: burden; demographics; coping strategies; caregiver mental health; and family dynamics and expressed emotions.
   Conclusion: The quality and level of evidence supporting each theme varied. We need further research into family dynamics ameliorating the caregiving and how to measure it.

A computerized literature search provided 41 relevant and potentially eligible studies. Results showed that the study of emotions in skin disease is limited to Sadness/depression and Fear/anxiety. The emotions of Anger and Disgust have been poorly explored in empirical studies, despite they could be theoretically considered a vulnerability factor for the development of skin disorders and the dermatological extreme consequences, as negative emotionality toward self and the pathological skin condition. The bibliometric qualitative analysis with VOSViewer software revealed that the majority of the studies have been focused on the relationships between vitiligo and Sadness/depression, dermatitis and Fear/anxiety, psoriasis, and Anger, suggesting the need of future research exploring Disgust and, in general, a wider emotional spectrum.

AB  - Background: Teaching is considered as one of the most stressful professions that can lead to repercussions on physical and mental health, as well as on professional performance. Among the most common psychiatric conditions in teachers, there is Burnout Syndrome (BS) that is considered a disease of physical and mental exhaustion. One of the measures to mitigate this condition is to change eating habits, seeking an improvement in the quality of life and mental health. Therefore, the objective of this integrative review was to evaluate the relationship between the promotion of healthy eating habits and BS in teachers.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to include articles published using Medline / Pubmed, Lilacs / Bireme and Google Scholar, and the descriptors: burnout syndrome, nutrition and food education, depression and quality of life, teacher, and mental health, with an emphasis in the last ten years.
   Results: Thirty-seven studies were included. These studies suggest that approaches on health nutrition habits may improve BS and mental health. Furthermore, deficient intake of magnesium, zinc, vitamins D, C, E and of the B complex, tryptophan, calcium, iron, omega 3, probiotics, and polyphenols may contribute to arousal or worsening of BS symptoms. However, no experimental studies that evaluated the association between eating patterns and BS in teachers were found.
   Conclusion: Although there were no experimental studies on teachers, other studies suggested a positive association between healthy nutrition habits and improvement of mental health and BS prevention and/or treatment. The behavioral approach to change eating habits can contribute to more effective outcomes.

AB  - Aims. Lay opinions and published papers alike suggest mood varies with the seasons, commonly framed as higher rates of depression mood in winter. Memory and confirmation bias may have influenced previous studies. We therefore systematically searched for and reviewed studies on the topic, but excluded study designs where explicit referrals to seasonality were included in questions, interviews or data collection.
   Methods. Systematic literature search in Cochrane database, DARE, Medline, Embase, PsychINFO and CINAHL, reporting according to the PRISMA framework, and study quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Two authors independently assessed each study for inclusion and quality assessment. Due to large heterogeneity, we used a descriptive review of the studies.
   Results. Among the 41 included studies, there was great heterogeneity in regards to included symptoms and disorder definitions, operationalisation and measurement. We also observed important heterogeneity in how definitions of `seasons' as well as study design, reporting and quality. This heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis and publication bias analysis. Thirteen of the studies suggested more depression in winter. The remaining studies suggested no seasonal pattern, seasonality outside winter, or inconclusive results.
   Conclusions. The results of this review suggest that the research field of seasonal variations in mood disorders is fragmented, and important questions remain unanswered. There is some support for seasonal variation in clinical depression, but our results contest a general population shift towards lower mood and more sub-threshold symptoms at regular intervals throughout the year. We suggest future research on this issue should be aware of potential bias by design and take into account other biological and behavioural seasonal changes that may nullify or exacerbate any impact on mood.

AB  - Background: A critical strategy in the management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is optimizing the effects of currently available pharmacologic therapies such as citicoline (CC).
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of CC as adjunct therapy to cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) in the treatment of AD.
   Methods: We identified relevant studies by electronic search until April 2020. We considered studies with a comparator group that enrolled elderly patients with a diagnosis of AD and employed CC as an adjunct therapy to AChEIs compared to AChEI monotherapy or comparisons of different AChEIs combined with CC. Methodological quality assessment was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
   Results: Out of 149 articles identified, two retrospective cohort studies involving 563 elderly patients affected with AD were included. After 3 months and 9 months, better Mini-Mental Status Examination scores were observed in the "AChEIs + CC" group versus "AChEIs alone" group. CC combined with donepezil may be better in improving cognition than when combined with rivastigmine. No significant difference was noted in terms of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental-ADL. Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Geriatric Depression Scale-short form scores appeared to be lower in the combination treatment versus monotherapy. The adverse events of combined treatment were self-limiting and included occasional excitability, gastric intolerance, and headache.
   Conclusion: Limited evidence from pooled data of two observational studies suggests that CC used in adjunct with AChEIs in the treatment of AD was well-tolerated and showed improvement in cognition, mood, and behavioral symptoms compared to treating with AChEIs alone.

AB  - There is mounting evidence that the trillions of microbes that inhabit our gut are a substantial contributing factor to mental health and, equally, to the progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. The extraordinary complexity of the gut ecosystem, and how it interacts with the intestinal epithelium to manifest physiological changes in the brain to influence mood and behaviour, has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny over the last 2 decades. To further complicate matters, we each harbour a unique microbiota community that is subject to change by a number of factors including diet, exercise, stress, health status, genetics, medication, and age, amongst others. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a dynamic matrix of tissues and organs including the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota, immune cells, gut tissue, glands, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and the brain that communicate in a complex multidirectional manner through a number of anatomically and physiologically distinct systems. Long-term perturbations to this homeostatic environment may contribute to the progression of a number of disorders by altering physiological processes including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, neurotransmitter systems, immune function, and the inflammatory response. While an appropriate, co-ordinated physiological response, such as an immune or stress response, is necessary for survival, a dysfunctional response can be detrimental to the host, contributing to the development of a number of central nervous system disorders.

AB  - Background Individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD) report psychological distress and poor physical functioning and may benefit from mindfulness training.
   Purpose To examine the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on psychological and physiological measures in adults with CVD using meta-analysis.
   Methods Comprehensive searches identified studies that (a) evaluated MBIs in adults with CVD or who had experienced a cardiac event, (b) included a comparison condition, and (c) assessed psychological (e.g., anxiety and depression) or physiological (e.g., systolic or diastolic blood pressure [BP]) outcomes. Independent raters coded methodological (e.g., design and quality) and intervention features (e.g., intervention content) as potential moderators. Weighted mean effect sizes (d(1)), using full information maximum likelihood estimation, were calculated.
   Results Of the 1,507 records reviewed, 16 studies met inclusion criteria (N = 1,476; M age = 56 years; 40% women). Compared to controls, participants who received an MBI reported greater improvements in psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depression, distress, and perceived stress: d(+)s = 0.49 to 0.64). MBI recipients also reduced their systolic (d(+) = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.26, 1.51; k = 7) but not diastolic (d(+) = 0.07, 95% CI = -0.47, 0.60; k = 6) BP relative to controls.
   Conclusions MBIs demonstrated favorable effects on psychological and physiological outcomes among adults with CVD. Future research should investigate if such benefits lead to improvements in disease outcomes in studies with longer follow-ups.

AB  - Background: Psychiatric and psychosomatic consultation-liaison services (CL) are important providers of diagnosis and treatment for hospital patients with mental comorbidities and psychological burdens. Objective: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the effects of CL on depression and anxiety. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted until 2017. Included were published randomized controlled trials using CL interventions with adults in general hospitals, treatment as usual as control groups, and depression and/or anxiety as outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Level of integration was assessed using the Standard Framework for Levels of Integrated Healthcare. Meta-analyses were performed using random effects models and meta-regression for moderator effects. Results: We included 38 studies (9,994 patients). Risk of bias was high in 17, unclear in 15, and low in 6 studies. Studies were grouped by type of intervention: brief interventions tailored to the patients (8), interventions based on specific treatment manuals (19), and integrated, collaborative care (11). Studies showed small to medium effects on depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses for depression yielded a small effect (d = -0.19, 95% CI: -0.30 to -0.09) in manual studies and a small effect (d = -0.33, 95% CI: -0.53 to -0.13) in integrated, collaborative care studies, the latter using mostly active control groups with the possibility of traditional consultation. Conclusions: CL can provide a helpful first treatment for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Given that especially depressive symptoms in medically ill patients are long-lasting, the results underline the benefit of integrative approaches that respect the complexity of the illness.

AB  - Aims Observational studies have shown a relationship between maternal mental health (MMH) and child development, but few studies have evaluated whether MMH interventions improve child-related outcomes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this review is to synthesise findings on the effectiveness of MMH interventions to improve child-related outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods We searched for randomised controlled trials conducted in LMICs evaluating interventions with a MMH component and reporting children's outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed on outcomes included in at least two trials. Results We identified 21 trials with 28 284 mother-child dyads. Most trials were conducted in middle-income countries, evaluating home visiting interventions delivered by general health workers, starting in the third trimester of pregnancy. Only ten trials described acceptable methods for blinding outcome assessors. Four trials showed high risk of bias in at least two of the seven domains assessed in this review. Narrative synthesis showed promising but inconclusive findings for child-related outcomes. Meta-analysis identified a sizeable impact of interventions on exclusive breastfeeding (risk ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.71, ten trials,N= 4749 mother-child dyads,I-2= 61%) and a small effect on child height-for-age at 6-months (std. mean difference = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02-0.24, three trials,N= 1388,I-2= 0%). Meta-analyses did not identify intervention benefits for child cognitive and other growth outcomes; however, few trials measured these outcomes. Conclusions These findings support the importance of MMH to improve child-related outcomes in LMICs, particularly exclusive breastfeeding. Given, the small number of trials and methodological limitations, more rigorous trials should be conducted.

AB  - Cost-utility analyses are slowly becoming part of randomized control trials evaluating physical and mental health treatments and (preventive) interventions in child and adolescent development. The British National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, for example, insists on the use of gains in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to compute the "value for money" of interventions. But what counts as a gain in quality of life? For one of the most widely used instruments, the EuroQol 5 Dimensions scale (EQ-5D), QALYs are estimated by healthy individuals who provide utility scores for specific health states, assuming that the best life is a life without self-experienced problems in five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The worst imaginable outcome is defined as "a lot of problems" in each of these five domains. The impact of the individual's problems on the social network is not weighted, and important social-developmental domains (externalizing problems, social competence) are missing. Current cost-utility computations based on EQ-5D favor physical health over mental health, and they rely on adult weights for child and adolescent quality of life. Thus, a level playing field is absent, and developmental expertise is sorely missing.

AB  - Background: A growing body of evidence has linked mental health outcomes to the gut microbiome. This has led to the investigation of the GI tract as a target for novel treatments and interventions for depression, including probiotic supplementation. Our recent pilot study provided the first evidence of probiotics improving symptoms of depression in treatment-naive depressed patients. To further support and expand upon this evidence, data from the pilot study were used to plan a 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of probiotics on depression. Here, we report the protocol for this trial. Methods: Participants diagnosed with depression will orally consume a probiotic supplement containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum or placebo once daily. Participants will undergo assessments measuring clinical outcomes using a battery of validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Sleep architecture and quality will be measured using polysomnography. Neuroimaging data will be collected using magnetic resonance imaging to examine functional and structural neurophysiological changes. Molecular data will be collected from blood, stool, and urine samples to examine cytokine levels and explore potential genes and proteins that may predict outcomes in depression. Results: We expect results to replicate and expand on our pilot data demonstrating that probiotics may be effective in alleviating symptoms of depression, and to find biomarkers that will predict these outcomes. Conclusions: The findings from this study will add to the growing body of research in this emerging field, which eventually may provide evidence for probiotics having a role in alleviating symptoms of depression.

AB  - Aims Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for depression, anxiety and suicide. The estimated prevalence of these problems is essential to guide public health policy, but published results vary. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and suicide among Chinese MSM. Methods Systematic searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, CNKI and Wanfang databases with languages restricted to Chinese and English for studies published before 10 September 2019 on the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempts among Chinese MSM. Studies that were published in the peer-reviewed journals and used validated instruments to assess depression and anxiety were included. The characteristics of studies and the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempts were independently extracted by authors. Random-effects modelling was used to estimate the pooled rates. Subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression were conducted to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. This study followed the PRISMA and MOOSE. Results Sixty-seven studies were included. Fifty-two studies reported the prevalence of depressive symptoms, with a combined sample of 37 376 people, of whom 12 887 [43.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 38.9-47.5] reported depressive symptoms. Twenty-seven studies reported the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, with a combined sample of 10 531 people, of whom 3187 (32.2%; 95% CI, 28.3-36.6) reported anxiety symptoms. Twenty-three studies reported the prevalence of suicidal ideation, with a combined sample of 15 034 people, of whom 3416 (21.2%; 95% CI, 18.3-24.5) had suicidal ideation. Nine studies reported the prevalence of suicide plans, with a combined sample of 5271 people, of whom 401 (6.2%; 95% CI, 3.9-8.6) had suicide plans. Finally, 19 studies reported the prevalence of suicide attempts, with a combined sample of 27 936 people, of whom 1829 (7.3%; 95% CI, 5.6-9.0) had attempted suicide. Conclusions The mental health of Chinese MSM is poor compared with the general population. Efforts are warranted to develop interventions to prevent and alleviate mental health problems among this vulnerable population.

AB  - Aims Perinatal depression threatens the health of maternal women and their offspring. Although screening programs for perinatal depression exist, non-uptake of referral to further mental health care after screening reduces the utility of these programs. Uptake rates among women with positive screening varied widely across studies and little is known about how to improve the uptake rate. This study aimed to systematically review the available evidence on uptake rates, estimate the pooled rate, identify interventions to improve uptake of referral and explore the effectiveness of those interventions. Methods This systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42019138095). We searched Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database and VIP Databases from database inception to January 13, 2019 and scanned reference lists of relevant researches for studies published in English or Chinese. Studies providing information on uptake rate and/or effectiveness of interventions on uptake of referral were eligible for inclusion. Studies were excluded if they did not report the details of the referral process or did not provide exact uptake rate. Data provided by observational studies and quasi-experimental studies were used to estimate the pooled uptake rate through meta-analysis. We also performed meta-regression and subgroup analyses to explore the potential source of heterogeneity. To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, we conducted descriptive analyses instead of meta-analyses since there was only one randomised controlled trial (RCT). Results Of 2302 records identified, 41 studies were eligible for inclusion, including 39 observational studies (n= 9337), one quasi-experimental study (n= 43) and one RCT (n= 555). All but two studies were conducted in high-income countries. The uptake rates reported by included studies varied widely and the pooled uptake rate of referral was 43% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 35-50%) by a random-effect model. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses both showed that referral to on-site assessment or treatment (60%, 95% CI 51-69%) had a significantly higher uptake rate than referral to mental health service (32%, 95% CI 23-41%) (odds ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.13-1.52). The included RCT showed that the referral intervention significantly improved the uptake rate (p 0.01). Conclusions Almost three-fifths of women with positive screening results do not take up the referral offers after perinatal depression screening. Referral to on-site assessment and treatment may improve uptake of referral, but the quality of evidence on interventions to increase uptake was weak. More robust studies are needed, especially in low-and middle-income countries.

AB  - Background: Although Huntington's disease (HD) can cause a wide range of psychological difficulties, no review has ever been carried out on the range of psychological interventions adopted with this population.
   Objective: To scope the literature on psychological interventions for psychological difficulties in people affected by HD.
   Methods: A systematic scoping review was performed across MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Academic Search Ultimate, and Cochrane Library up to 1 March 2020.
   Results: From an initial return of 1579 citations, a total of nine papers were considered eligible for review. These included a qualitative investigation, three case studies, two case series, two uncontrolled pretest-posttest designs, and only one randomised control trial (RCT). Despite the wide range of psychological difficulties which can be experienced by people affected by the HD gene expansion, the adopted interventions only accounted for five main psychological outcomes (anxiety, apathy, depression, irritability, and coping). Further discussion and suggestions for future research are provided for each outcome.
   Conclusion: The current literature on psychological interventions in people affected by HD is extremely limited both in terms of methods and addressed clinical outcomes. Consequently, no conclusions can be offered yet as to which psychological therapy may help this population. As further more comprehensive research is urgently needed for this group, the ultimate aim of the present review is to act as a call to arms for HD researchers worldwide to help shed light on the most effective way to translate psychological theory into practice for the benefit of people affected by HD.

   Material and methods: A systematic literature search has been conducted on the PubMed database for meta-analyses and clinical trials. A total of 196 full-text articles were screened. The inclusion criteria, such as hypnosis had to be used in medical procedures as the main method of therapy, the study was either a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or clinical trial, there were measures of the effect of hypnosis and the intervention was compared to either other psychological intervention, standard treatment or placebo, were covered by 13 articles. The Google Scholar search engine was used to extract additional materials for explanatory reasons.
   Results: The use of hypnosis has been found in several fields of medicine, mainly in pediatrics and gastroenterology. It was mostly used to elevate patients' life quality by lowering or eliminating pain, distress, depression, and anxiety. It has been found that hypnosis was used also in more complex procedures such as anesthesia or accelerating wound healing.
   Conclusions: It is crucial for current medical practice not to underestimate the possibilities of a beneficial outcome for hypnosis use in different medical conditions. Overall strong evidence was provided that hypnosis is not a form of charlatanry, but an evidence-based medical procedure.

AB  - In depression, symptoms range from loss of motivation and energy to suicidal thoughts. Moreover, in depression alterations might be also observed in the sleep-wake cycle and in the daily rhythms of hormonal (e.g., cortisol, melatonin) secretion. Both, the sleep-wake cycle and hormonal rhythms, are regulated by the internal biological clock within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Therefore, a dysregulation of the internal mechanism of the SCN might lead in the disturbance of temporal physiology and depression. Hence, circadian symptoms in mood disorders can be used as important biomarkers for the prevention and treatment of depression. Disruptions of daily rhythms in physiology and behavior are also observed in animal models of depression, giving thus an important tool of research for the understanding of the circadian mechanisms implicated in mood disorders. This review discusses the alterations of daily rhythms in depression, and how circadian perturbations might lead in mood changes and depressive-like behavior in humans and rodents respectively. The use of animal models with circadian disturbances and depressive-like behaviors will help to understand the central timing mechanisms underlying depression, and how treating the biological clock(s) it may be possible to improve mood.

AB  - The habenula (Hb) is a phylogenetically old epithalamic structure differentiated into two nuclear complexes, the medial (MHb) and lateral habenula (LHb). After decades of search for a great unifying function, interest in the Hb resurged when it was demonstrated that LHb plays a major role in the encoding of aversive stimuli ranging from noxious stimuli to the loss of predicted rewards. Consistent with a role as an anti-reward center, aberrant LHb activity has now been identified as a key factor in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder. Moreover, both MHb and LHb emerged as new players in the reward circuitry by primarily mediating the aversive properties of distinct drugs of abuse. Anatomically, the Hb serves as a bridge that links basal forebrain structures with monoaminergic nuclei in the mid- and hindbrain. So far, research on Hb has focused on the role of the LHb in regulating midbrain dopamine release. However, LHb/MHb are also interconnected with the dorsal (DR) and median (MnR) raphe nucleus. Hence, it is conceivable that some of the habenular functions are at least partly mediated by the complex network that links MHb/LHb with pontomesencephalic monoaminergic nuclei. Here, we summarize research about the topography and transmitter phenotype of the reciprocal connections between the LHb and ventral tegmental area-nigra complex, as well as those between the LHb and DR/MnR. Indirect MHb outputs via interpeduncular nucleus to state-setting neuromodulatory networks will also be commented. Finally, we discuss the role of specific LHb-VTA and LHb/MHb-raphe circuits in anxiety and depression.

AB  - Objectives: This review examined the currently available evidence of the association between liver encephalopathy and mood/anxiety disorders. Method: English-language studies using the keywords "hepatic encephalopathy," "depression," and "anxiety" were searched through PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO databases. A total of 135 articles were considered for this review, of which 9 were qualitative and quantitative research papers regarding depression and anxiety in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Results: There is a significant discrepancy between the research method of the studies and their outcomes. The number of studies suggesting a relationship between HE and mood/anxiety disorders is slightly higher than that of studies with opposite results; however, based on the current evidence, it is difficult to conclude a significant association between these two conditions. Conclusion: More longitudinal studies that include face-to-face psychiatric assessments are required to highlight any possible association between depressive/anxiety disorders and HE.

AB  - Objective: To summarise the literature on prenatal attachment in pregnancies following Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). Background: Prenatal attachment can predict the quality of the postpartum parent-infant relationship and is linked to perinatal mental health of the parents and their adjustment to the parental role. It might be expected prenatal attachment will be influenced by fertility treatment such as ART, but there are contradictory results. Methods: In this review, studies with a cross-sectional and longitudinal design, published in 1990-2019 were included. A search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science and Scopus, and using the Google Scholar search engine. A total of 17 articles were found which met the inclusion criteria and after these articles were reviewed using the STROBE-checklist, 15 articles were included in the study. Results: In most couples who conceived following ART, the level of prenatal attachment was either similar to or higher than in couples who conceive without ART. Conclusions: The findings challenge the idea that infertility problems affect attachment in pregnancies following ART. However, ART- couples may be more susceptible to anxiety due to pregnancy loss and support may be better focused on the pregnancy-related anxiety in these couples rather than any attachment intervention.

AB  - Suicidal behaviour is a multifaceted phenomenon that concerns all human populations. It has been suggested that a complex interaction between the individual genetic profile and environmental factors throughout life underlies the pathophysiology of suicidal behaviour. Although epidemiological and genetic studies suggest the existence of a genetic component, exposure to biological and psychosocial adversities, especially during critical developmental periods, also contributes to altering the biological responses to threat and pleasure. This results in amplified maladaptive cognitive and behavioural traits and states associated with suicidal behaviours. Alterations in the cognitive inhibition and decision-making capacity have been implicated in suicidal behaviours. Structural and functional changes in key brain regions and networks, such as prefrontal cortex, insula and default mode network, may underlie this relationship. Furthermore, the shift from health to suicidal behaviour incorporates complex and dynamic changes in the immune and stress responses, monoaminergic system, gonadal system and neuroplasticity. In this review, we describe the major findings of epidemiological, genetic, neuroanatomical, neuropsychological, immunological and neuroendocrinological studies on suicide behaviours to provide a solid background for future research in this field. This broad overview of the biological bases of suicide should promote neuroscience research on suicidal behaviours. This might lead to improved biological models and to the identification of evidence-based biomarkers, treatment options and preventive strategies.

AB  - Objective: To review the current evidence for efficacy of cannabidiol in the treatment of mood disorders. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Scielo, , and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published up to July 31, 2019. The inclusion criteria were clinical trials, observational studies, or case reports evaluating the effect of pure cannabidiol or cannabidiol mixed with other cannabinoids on mood symptoms related to either mood disorders or other health conditions. The review was reported in accordance with guidelines from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. Results: Of the 924 records initially yielded by the search, 16 were included in the final sample. Among them, six were clinical studies that used cannabidiol to treat other health conditions but assessed mood symptoms as an additional outcome. Similarly, four tested cannabidiol blended with Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the treatment of general health conditions and assessed affective symptoms as secondary outcomes. Two were case reports testing cannabidiol. Four studies were observational studies that evaluated the cannabidiol use and its clinical correlates. However, there were no clinical trials investigating the efficacy of cannabidiol, specifically in mood disorders or assessing affective symptoms as the primary outcome. Although some articles point in the direction of benefits of cannabidiol to treat depressive symptoms, the methodology varied in several aspects and the level of evidence is not enough to support its indication as a treatment for mood disorders. Conclusions: There is a lack of evidence to recommend cannabidiol as a treatment for mood disorders. However, considering the preclinical and clinical evidence related to other diseases, cannabidiol might have a role as a treatment for mood disorders. Therefore, there is an urgent need for well-designed clinical trials investigating the efficacy of cannabidiol in mood disorders.

AB  - Anxiety is a severe problem for at least one-third of people living with Parkinson's disease (PD). Anxiety appears to have a greater adverse impact on quality of life than motor impairment. Despite its high prevalence and impact on daily life, anxiety is often undiagnosed and untreated. To better address anxiety in PD, future research must improve knowledge about the mechanism of anxiety in PD and address the lack of empirical evidence from clinical trials. In response to these challenges, the Parkinson's Foundation sponsored an expert meeting on anxiety on June 13th and 14th 2018. This paper summarizes the findings from that meeting informed by a review of the existing literature and discussions among patients, caregivers, and an international, clinician-scientist, expert panel working group. The goal is to provide recommendations to improve our understanding and treatment of anxiety in PD.

AB  - Psychological interventions can alleviate posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, further development of treatment approaches calls for understanding the mechanisms of change through which diverse interventions affect PTSS. We systematically searched the literature for controlled studies of mechanisms of change in psychological interventions for PTSS. We aimed to detect all empirically studied mechanisms and evaluate the level of evidence for their role in the alleviation of PTSS. We identified 34 studies, of which nine were among children. We found evidence for improvements in maladaptive posttraumatic cognitions as a general mechanism of change involved in diverse interventions, among both adults and children. We also found some preliminary evidence for increases in mindfulness as a mechanism of change in mindfulness- and spiritually-oriented interventions among adults. We found scant, mixed empirical evidence for other mechanisms of change. Notably, studies on changes in traumatic memories as a mechanism of change were lacking, despite clinical emphasis on their importance. A major limitation across reviewed studies was that most could not establish temporal order of changes in mechanisms and PTSS. Including thorough analyses of mechanisms of change beyond cognitions in all future trials and improving the reporting of findings would aid the development and implementation of even more effective interventions.

AB  - Serious diseases that threaten life affect both the patient and the life partner's ability to adapt, thus, in recent years, professionals have started to focus on the patient-partner dyad. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the results of couple interventions aimed at reducing depression, anxiety, distress and increasing the quality of life and improving the relationship. For this purpose, we carried out a systematic search in the PsycINFO and Medline databases, and selected peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2018 containing interventions dedicated to oncology patients and their partners. We identified 21 studies that included 2081 couples. The meta-analysis performed evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions in relation to these variables as well as the persistence over time of the effects. Interventions had a statistically significant lower effect in reducing patient anxiety in follow-ups up to six months (g = -0.43, z = -2.02,p = 0.04), and a small statistically significant effect in improving the couple relationship from the perspective of the partners at post-test time (g = 0.29, z = 2.01,p = 0.04). We investigated the moderating effect of the cumulative duration of intervention sessions, the type of intervention or the method of intervention by applying random effects meta-regressions, but none of these variables proved to have a moderating effect. The obtained result indicates the partial effectiveness of interventions in reducing psychological difficulties and improving the quality of life and the couple relationship of oncological patients and their partners.

AB  - Mothers' sensitive responses to their infants have evolutionary importance and are likely hardwired into the maternal brain. Mood disorders are associated with aberrant neural processing of emotion in regions overlapping with 'maternal sensitivity networks' which could compromise maternal processing of infant signals. This systematic review aimed to integrate findings from studies of neural responses to infant stimuli in healthy mothers and in mothers with mood disorders. We included original studies using functional brain imaging and electrophysiological techniques. The databases psycINFO and PubMed were searched for eligible articles until January 2019. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria, none of which investigated mothers with bipolar disorder or remitted unipolar disorder. Studies were characterized by large methodological heterogeneity. The most consistent findings were that healthy mothers exhibit stronger and faster neural responses to infant stimuli than non-mothers in key emotional processing regions including the amygdala, insula and orbitofrontal cortex, which is accentuated for own infants. Motherswith acute depression display blunted neural responses within these regions which correlates with greater depression severity.

TI  - School-based interventions to prevent anxiety and depression in children and young people: a systematic review and network meta-analysis
KW  - HEALTH-CARE
KW  - ADOLESCENTS
KW  - DISORDERS
KW  - EFFICACY
AB  - Background Rates of anxiety and depression are increasing among children and young people. Recent policies have focused on primary prevention of mental disorders in children and young people, with schools at the forefront of implementation. There is limited information for the comparative effectiveness of the multiple interventions available.
   Methods We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials for published and unpublished, passive and active-controlled randomised and quasi-randomised trials. We included educational setting-based, universal, or targeted interventions in which the primary aim was the prevention of anxiety and depression in children and young people aged 4-18 years. Primary outcomes were post-intervention self-report anxiety and depression, wellbeing, suicidal ideation, or self-harm. We assessed risk of bias following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We estimated standardised mean differences (SMD) using random effects network meta-analysis in a Bayesian framework. The study is registered with PROPSERO, number CRD42016048184.
   Findings 1512 full-text articles were independently screened for inclusion by two reviewers, from which 137 studies of 56 620 participants were included. 20 studies were assessed as being at low risk of bias for both random sequence generation and allocation concealment. There was weak evidence to suggest that cognitive behavioural interventions might reduce anxiety in primary and secondary settings. In universal secondary settings, mindfulness and relaxation-based interventions showed a reduction in anxiety symptoms relative to usual curriculum (SMD -0.65, 95% credible interval -1.14 to -0.19). There was a lack of evidence to support any one type of intervention being effective to prevent depression in universal or targeted primary or secondary settings. Comparison-adjusted funnel plots suggest the presence of small-study effects for the universal secondary anxiety analysis. Network meta-analysis was not feasible for wellbeing or suicidal ideation or self-harm outcomes, and results are reported narratively.
   Interpretation Considering unclear risk of bias and probable small study effects for anxiety, we conclude there is little evidence that educational setting-based interventions focused solely on the prevention of depression or anxiety are effective. Future research could consider multilevel, systems-based interventions as an alternative to the downstream interventions considered here. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oxytocin's stress-reducing and social functions suggest an involvement in trauma processing and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   We searched PubMed, PubPsych, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Web of Science, ProQuest and ClinicalTrials.gov for studies assessing endogenous oxytocin, oxytocin receptor genotype or methylation in traumatized humans. Eligible studies (k = 66) were systematically described. We meta-analytically compared oxytocin parameters between traumatized and non-traumatized individuals (k = 17) and individuals with and without PTSD (k = 8), and correlated oxytocin with trauma exposure (k = 16) and PTSD symptoms (k = 8).
   Endogenous oxytocin concentrations did not differ between PTSD patients and healthy individuals. The remaining effects on endogenous oxytocin were heterogeneous. Subgroup analyses identified sampling-related, trauma-related and demographic moderators, resulting in inconsistent or non-significant effects. Methylation data were insufficient for meta-analyses, and meta-analytic genotype results were inconsistent.
   Unstimulated endogenous oxytocin was not a biomarker for trauma exposure or PTSD. Given the impact of methodology, more basic research on endogenous oxytocin measurements is needed. Future studies might consider the oxytocin stress response and investigate oxytocin longitudinally.

AB  - BackgroundChildren exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) are at heightened risk of emotional and behavioural problems. However, not all children exposed to IPV experience difficulties. Many display positive wellbeing and development despite experiencing this adversity.
   ObjectiveThis is the first known article to systematically review the existing literature on the factors associated with emotional and behavioural resilience and positive functioning in children exposed to IPV.
   MethodThis review was registered at the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews, registration number CRD42016037101. Four databases were searched (Embase, Web of Science, Psychinfo, and Medline) for peer-reviewed articles assessing factors associated with positive outcomes for children (aged between 0 and 12years) who had been exposed to IPV. Retrieved articles were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers.
   ResultsOf the 1,365 retrieved articles, 15 were eligible for inclusion. Results showed that maternal mental health was a significant predictor of resilience in children exposed to IPV. Preliminary evidence was found for emotion coaching, parenting, and child temperament. Broader socio-contextual factors were largely neglected across the articles reviewed.
   ConclusionThe findings from this review highlighted that there is still much to be learned about what helps children display resilience when exposed to IPV and what can be done to foster this resilience.

AB  - Background and aims: This systematic review analyzes and summarizes gambling-related findings from the nationally representative US National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) data. Methods: Systematic literature searches in accordance with PRISMA guidelines found 51 eligible studies that met inclusion criteria. Eight studies utilized both Waves 1 and 2 NESARC data, and selection of sample sizes varied from 185 to 43,093 individuals, consistent with specified research objectives of each study. Results: The prevalence of lifetime pathological gambling was 0.42% (0.64% among men, 0.23% among women), while past-year prevalence was 0.16%. Pathological gambling rates were generally higher in populations with substance-use disorders and other psychiatric diagnoses. Rates of adverse childhood experiences and suicidal attempts were higher among individuals with problem or pathological gambling. Early-onset gamblers were more likely to be male, be never married, have incomes below $70,000, belong to younger cohorts and have Cluster B personality disorders, but less likely to be diagnosed with mood disorders. While pathological gambling was related to obesity, increased stress, and poorer physical health among general age groups, recreational gambling was linked with improved physical and mental functioning in older adults. Conclusions: The NESARC has provided important information on the correlates of pathological gambling and subdiagnostic patterns of gambling behaviors. Additional studies should examine these relationships in the current gambling environment and longitudinally with aims of implementing policies to improve the public health.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder in China, but its reported treatment rate varies largely across different studies. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the pooled treatment rate for people with MDD in China and its associated factors. Both English (PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science) and Chinese (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang and SinoMed) databases were searched from their commencement date to November 13, 2018. Epidemiological studies that reported the treatment rate of MDD were included and synthesized using a random effects model. Fifteen studies covering 609,054 participants were included. The pooled treatment rate for MDD in China was 19.5% (95% CI: 10.7%-28.4%). Among the 15 studies, 9 reported the number of patients who received treatments in psychiatric hospitals with a pooled treatment rate of 5.2% (95% CI: 2.8%-7.5%). Meta-regression found that study quality (beta = 0.131, P = 0.028) and male gender (beta = 0.006, P = 0.039) were significantly associated with a higher treatment rate for MDD. In China, the treatment rate for MDD, particularly in psychiatric hospitals, was low. Effective public education and increasing access to mental health services will probably increase the number of people seeking and receiving treatment.

AB  - While universal school-based social and emotional learning (SEL) programs claim to target various SEL competencies, earlier reviews have not provided a clear overview of the competencies in question. We therefore wished to identify the competencies targeted in SEL programs for secondary school students. We also aimed to examine the effects of these programs on SEL competencies and psychosocial health. The specific SEL competencies directly addressed in the programs' primary learning targets were identified based on the Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL) framework for SEL. Five bibliographic databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Applied Science Premier (ASP), and Web of Science) were searched for relevant research papers published between 2014 and 2018. We included 40 studies that investigated 32 programs focusing on two or more SEL competencies. While most programs targeted four or five of the SEL competencies, many of the included studies did not measure the programs' effects on all the competencies targeted. Our results showed that the SEL programs had substantial effects on the SEL competencies they addressed and on psychosocial health. Although the programs focused predominantly on self-management skills and relationship skills, the largest summary effects were found for self-awareness and social awareness.

AB  - Recently, concern has increased globally over farmers' mental health issues. We present a systematic review of the outcomes, locations, study designs, and methods of current studies on farmers' mental health. In particular, this review aims to fill an important gap in understanding of the potential key risk factors affecting farmers' mental health around the world. 167 articles on farmer mental health were included in a final systematic review using a standardized electronic literature search strategy and PRISMA guidelines. The four most-cited influences on farmers' mental health in the reviewed literature respectively were pesticide exposure, financial difficulties, climate variabilities/drought, and poor physical health/past injuries. The majority of studies were from developed countries, most specifically from the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Comparative studies on the mental health of farmers and other occupational workers showed mixed results, with a larger portion identifying that psychological health disturbances were more common in farmers and farm-workers. Knowledge of farmer psychological disorder risk factors and its impacts are essential for reducing the burden of mental illness. Further research will be required on climate change impacts, developing country farmers' mental health, and information on how to reduce help-seeking barriers amongst farmers.

AB  - Objective The aim of this meta-analysis was to better understand the magnitude and consistency of the association between childhood adversity and borderline personality disorder (BPD) across case-control, epidemiological and prospective cohort studies. Method Following the review protocol (reference: CRD42017075179), search terms pertaining to adversity and BPD were entered into three search engines. Random-effects meta-analysis synthesised the size and consistency of the effects. Results A total of 97 studies compared BPD to non-clinical (k = 40) and clinical (k = 70) controls. Meta-analysis of case-control studies indicated that individuals with BPD are 13.91 (95% CI 11.11-17.43) times more likely to report childhood adversity than non-clinical controls. This effect was smaller when considering retrospective cohort (OR: 2.59; 95% CI 0.93-7.30) and epidemiological (OR: 2.56, 95% CI 1.24-5.30) studies. Findings were significant across adversity subtypes with emotional abuse (OR: 38.11, 95% CI: 25.99-55.88) and neglect (OR: 17.73, 95% CI = 13.01-24.17) demonstrating the largest effects. Individuals with BPD were 3.15 (95% CI 2.62-3.79) times more likely to report childhood adversity than other psychiatric groups. Conclusions This meta-analysis corroborates theoretical proposals that exposure to adverse life experiences is associated with BPD. It highlights the importance of considering childhood adversity when treating people diagnosed with BPD.

AB  - Objective: An increasing number of studies have shown the anti-depressive effect of qigong. However, its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze existing literature on the mechanism of qigong in reducing depression. Method: The review process followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Randomized controlled trials of qigong were searched from PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Academic Search Premier from inception to December 2018. Studies which involved depression and any neurophysiological or psychological mechanisms as outcomes were included. Publication bias was tested before conducting meta-analysis. Two independent raters were involved for the entire review process. Results: A total of nine studies were identified which covered both neurophysiological and psychological mechanisms. Among these selected studies, seven were involved in meta-analysis, which suggested that qigong was effective in alleviating depression (standardized mean difference, SMD = -0.27, p < 0.05, I-2 = 27%). A significant effect was also found for diastolic blood pressure (SMD = -1.64, p < 0.05, I-2 = 31%). However, no significant effect was found for cortisol level and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions: This review shows that qigong is effective in reducing depression through activating the parasympathetic nervous system. Future studies with higher quality of research methodology with less selection and attrition bias should be conducted to unravel the possible anti-depressive effect of qigong.

AB  - One of the biggest growth areas in e-mental health resources has been the development and use of mobile mental health apps for smartphones and tablet devices. Such apps are being downloaded at increasing rates, but there have been questions about their efficacy and the research methodologies used to examine this. A review of the major app marketplaces, the Apple App Store and Google Play store, was conducted to locate apps claiming to offer a therapeutic treatment for depression and/or anxiety, and have research evidence for their effectiveness, according to their app store descriptions. App store descriptions were also analyzed to determine whether the app had been developed with mental health expert input; whether they had been developed in association with a government body, academic institution, or medical facility; and, whether or not they were free to download. Overall, 3.41% of apps had research to justify their claims of effectiveness, with the majority of that research undertaken by those involved in the development of the app. Other results indicated that 30.38% of shortlisted apps claimed to have expert development input; 20.48% had an affiliation with a government body, academic institution, or medical facility; and, 74.06% were free to download. Future research must consider other methodologies that may facilitate more research being completed on a greater number of apps, and future development needs to incorporate greater levels of input by mental health experts. Ways in which app stores could play a key role in encouraging more scientific research into the effectiveness of the mental health apps they sell are discussed.

AB  - Experimental animal models are a valuable tool to study the neurobiology of emotional behavior and mechanisms underlying human affective disorders. Mounting evidence suggests that various aquatic organisms, including both vertebrate (e.g., zebrafish) and invertebrate (e.g., crayfish) species, may be relevant to study animal emotional response and its deficits. Ideally, model organisms of disease should possess considerable genetic and physiological homology to mammals, display robust behavioral and physiological responses to stress, and should be sensitive to a wide range of drugs known to modulate stress and affective behaviors. Here, we summarize recent findings in the field of zebrafish- and crayfish-based tests of stress, anxiety, aggressiveness and social preference, and discuss further perspectives of using these novel model organisms in translational biological psychiatry. Outlining the remaining questions in this field, we also emphasize the need in further development and a wider use of crayfish and zebrafish models to study the pathogenesis of affective disorders.

AB  - Objective: There is growing global evidence for stark inequalities in the physical health status and life-expectancy of people with a mental health diagnosis. In most cases, physical activity (PA) is one of the most effective methods of maintaining physical and mental health. However, people with mental health challenges are less likely to adhere to recommended levels of PA, leading to a vicious cycle of poor physical and mental health. The objective of this paper is to assess if, and how cognitive-behavioural (CB) techniques increase adherence to PA in mental health populations. Method: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. Inclusion criteria were: a behavioural change intervention which targeted PA using CB approaches; Delivered to adults with a mental health condition as defined by DSM V or ICD-10; Report adherence to the intervention AND physical activity; RCT, cluster RCT, quasi-experimental, or controlled before and after study. Electronic searches conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library (Trials), SPORTDiscus and PsycINFO. Results: Ten studies from seven countries were synthesised. Methodologically moderate to weak, all showed adherence to the intervention to be associated with increased levels of PA. All studies reported higher than average adherence to PA in the intervention groups. Discussion: CB interventions were associated with improved adherence to PA in international samples of people with mental health conditions. Studies adopting more robust designs are needed to quantify optimal interventions and impact, but this original synthesis is encouraging for researchers and clinicians alike looking to maximise the synergy between physical and mental health.

AB  - Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that temperament is strongly influenced by more than 700 genes that modulate associative conditioning by molecular processes for synaptic plasticity and long-term learning and memory. The results were replicated in three independent samples despite variable cultures and environments. The identified genes were enriched in pathways activated by behavioral conditioning in animals, including the two major molecular pathways for response to extracellular stimuli, the Ras-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascades. These pathways are activated by a wide variety of physiological and psychosocial stimuli that vary in positive and negative valence and in consequences for health and survival. Changes in these pathways are orchestrated to maintain cellular homeostasis despite changing conditions by modulating temperament and its circadian and seasonal rhythms. In this review we first consider traditional concepts of temperament in relation to the new genetic findings by examining the partial overlap of alternative measures of temperament. Then we propose a definition of temperament as the disposition of a person to learn how to behave, react emotionally, and form attachments automatically by associative conditioning. This definition provides necessary and sufficient criteria to distinguish temperament from other aspects of personality that become integrated with it across the life span. We describe the effects of specific stimuli on the molecular processes underlying temperament from functional, developmental, and evolutionary perspectives. Our new knowledge can improve communication among investigators, increase the power and efficacy of clinical trials, and improve the effectiveness of treatment of personality and its disorders.

AB  - The integration of behavioral epigenetics' principles (eg, DNA methylation) into the study of human infants' development has mainly focused on the effects of early adverse exposures, paying less attention to protective caregiving experiences. The present review focused on DNA methylation linked to variations in maternal behavior in human infants and children. Literature search occurred on three databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) and 11 records were selected. Key variables were abstracted from each article including: sample size and characteristics, time and type of maternal caregiving behavior exposure, time and locus of methylation biomarker, presence/absence, time and type of adverse exposure. Six out of eleven records documented the predictive effect of maternal caregiving on DNA methylation, whereas the remaining five reported on the role of maternal behavior as an influencing factor of the adversity-to-methylation link. Consistent with evidence from the animal model, the quality of maternal caregiving in humans (a) might be associated with variations in DNA methylation status of specific genes involved in socio-emotional development and (b) might partially buffer the association between early adversities and epigenetic variations in infants and children. Current evidence suggests that the quality of maternal caregiving can contribute to behavioral development trajectories of human infants and children at least partially through epigenetic regulation. Open questions and methodological aspects are discussed to guide future human developmental research in behavioral epigenetics.

AB  - Objectives: Since 2000, approximately 500,000 refugees have settled in the Nordic countries, about a third of them being children and young people. To identify general trends, and to detect gaps in the existing knowledge about the socioeconomic and health status of these young refugees, this review discusses the literature regarding three key areas related to welfare policy: health, education and employment. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, SocINDEX, Sociological Abstracts, Embase and Cochrane, and a search for publications from relevant institutions were undertaken. All publications had to be original quantitative studies published since 1980. The total number of studies identified was 1353, 25 publications were included. Results: Young refugees had poorer mental health than ethnic minority and native-born peers. Mental health problems were related to pre-migration experiences but also to post-migration factors, such as discrimination and poor social support. Refugees performed worse in school than native-born and few progressed to higher education. Experiencing less discrimination and having better Nordic language proficiency was associated with higher educational attainment. A higher proportion of refugees were unemployed or outside the labour force compared with other immigrants and native-born. Assessment instruments varied between studies, making comparisons difficult. Conclusions: The study suggests pre-migration factors but also post-migration conditions such as perceived discrimination, social support and Nordic language proficiency as important factors for the mental health, education and employment outcomes of young refugees in the Nordic countries. Further Nordic comparative research and studies focusing on the relationship between health, education and employment outcomes are needed.

AB  - Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland at night. This hormone has many physiological functions, the main one being to synchronise individuals' biological rhythms. Exogenous melatonin has the same chronobiotic action, even at small doses (0.125 mg). In addition, a sleep-inducing (soporific) action appears to occur in a dose-effect relationship, i.e. as the dose increases. In psychiatric disorders, these two effects could have interesting applications in clinical practice. The French institute of medical research on sleep (SFRMS) appointed a group of experts to conduct a consensus conference to study the indications of melatonin and the conditions of its prescription. An account of the conclusions on adult psychiatric disorders (presented orally at the Congress on Sleep in Marseille, 23 November 2017) is given here. Exogenous melatonin proves to be useful among patients with a stabilized psychiatric disorder or in remission, to prevent relapse in case of associated complaints of insomnia, poor quality sleep or delayed sleep phase syndrome. During acute phases, melatonin could be used as an adjuvant treatment when there are insomnia symptoms, in mood disorders (bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder), in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in peri-surgical anxiety and in schizophrenia. In somatoform disorders, melatonin is a possible treatment for painful symptoms in fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspeptic syndrome and temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

AB  - Background: Children are exposed to chemical and non-chemical stressors from their built, natural, and social environments. Research is needed to advance our scientific understanding of non-chemical stressors, evaluate how they alter the biological response to a chemical stressor, and determine how they impact children's health and well-being. To do this, we conducted a state-of-the-science review of non-chemical stressors found in a child's social environment. Methods: Studies eligible for inclusion in this review were identified through a search of the peer-reviewed literature using PubMed and PsycINFO. Combinations of words associated with non-chemical stressors and children were used to form search strings. Filters were used to limit the search to studies published in peer-reviewed journals from 2000-2016 and written in English. Publications found using the search strings and filters went through two rounds of screening. Results: A total of 146 studies met the inclusion criteria. From these studies, 245 non-chemical stressors were evaluated. The non-chemical stressors were then organized into 13 general topic areas: acculturation, adverse childhood experiences, economic, education, family dynamics, food, greenspace, neighborhood, social, stress, urbanicity, violence, and other. Additional information on health outcomes, studies evaluating both chemical and non-chemical stressors, and animal studies are provided. This review provides evidence that non-chemical stressors found in a child's social environment do influence their health and well-being in both beneficial (e.g., salutatory effects of greenspace and social support) and adverse (e.g., poor relationships between health and selected non-chemical stressors such as economics, educational attainment, exposure to violence, stress) ways. Conclusions: This literature review identified a paucity of studies addressing the combined effects of chemical and non-chemical stressors and children's health and well-being. This literature review was further complicated by inconsistencies in terminology, methodologies, and the value of non-chemical stressor research in different scientific disciplines. Despite these limitations, this review showed the importance of considering non-chemical stressors from a child's social environment when addressing children's environmental health considerations.

AB  - Early life stress (ELS) induced by psychological trauma, child maltreatment, maternal separation, and domestic violence predisposes to psycho-behavioral pathologies during adulthood, namely major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and bipolar affective disorder. While environmental data are available in illustrating this association, data remain to be established on the epigenomic underpinning of the nexus between ELS and MDD predisposition. Specifically, despite the observed aberrant epigenomic modulation of the NR3C1, a glucocorticoid receptor gene, in early social adversity and social threats in animal and human models, reliable scientific data for intervention mapping in reducing social adversity and improving human health is required. We sought to synthesize the findings of studies evaluating (a) epigenomic modulations, mainly DNA methylation resulting in MDD following ELS, (b) epigenomic modifications associated with ELS, and (c) epigenomic alterations associated with MDD. A systematic review and quantitative evidence synthesis (QES) were utilized with the random effect meta-analytic procedure. The search strategy involved both the PubMed and hand search of relevant references. Of the 1534 studies identified through electronic search, 592 studies were screened, 11 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the QES, and 5 examined ELS and MDD; 4 studies assessed epigenomic modulation and ELS, while 2 studies examined epigenomic modulations and MDD. The dense DNA methylation of the 1F exon of the NR3C1, implying the hypermethylated region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, was observed in the nexus between ELS and MDD, common effect size (CES) = 14.96, 95%CI, 10.06-19.85. With respect to epigenomic modulation associated with child ELS, hypermethylation was observed, CES = 23.2%, 95%CI, 8.00-38.48. In addition, marginal epigenomic alteration was indicated in MDD, where hypermethylation was associated with increased risk of MDD, CES = 2.12%, 95%CI, 0.63-4.86. Substantial evidence supports the implication of NR3C1 and environmental interaction, mainly DNA methylation, in the predisposition to MDD following ELS. This QES further supports aberrant epigenomic modulation identified in ELS as well as major depressive episodes involving dysfunctional glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback as a result of allostatic overload. These findings recommend prospective investigation of social adversity and its predisposition to the MDD epidemic via aberrant epigenomic modulation. Such data will facilitate early intervention mapping in reducing MDD in the United States population.

AB  - Worldwide, depression and bipolar disorder affect a large and growing number of people. However, current pharmacotherapy options remain limited. Despite adequate treatment, many patients continue to have subsyndromal symptoms, which predict relapse in bipolar illness and often result in functional impairments. Aspirin, a common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has purported beneficial effects on mood symptoms, showing protective effects against depression in early cohort studies. This systematic review thus aimed to investigate the role of aspirin in mood disorders. Using the keywords (aspirin or acetylsalicy* or asa) and (mood or depress* or bipolar or mania or suicid*), a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, Clinical Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDANTR), Clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar databases found 13,952 papers published in English between 1 January 1988 and 1 May 2019. A total of six clinical studies were reviewed. There were two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials and populations drawn from two main cohort studies (i.e., the Geelong Osteoporosis Study and the Osteoarthritis Initiative study). Using a random-effects model, the pooled hazard ratio of the three cohort studies was 0.624 (95% confidence interval: 0.0503 to 1.198, p = 0.033), supporting a reduced risk of depression with aspirin exposure. Overall, the dropout rates were low, and aspirin appears to be well-tolerated with minimal risk of affective switch. In terms of methodological quality, most studies had a generally low risk of bias. Low-dose aspirin (80 to 100 mg/day) is safe, well-tolerated and potentially efficacious for improving depressive symptoms in both unipolar and bipolar depression. Due to its ability to modulate neuroinflammation and central nervous system processes, aspirin may also have valuable neuroprotective and pro-cognitive effects that deserve further exploration. Further randomized, controlled trials involving the adjunctive use of aspirin should be encouraged to confirm its therapeutic benefits.

AB  - Background This scoping review maps population-based surveys and mental health literacy (MHL) interventions undertaken in China during 1997-2018 in order to identify research gaps. Method Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework for a scoping review, five English databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Web of Science and CINAHL) and two Chinese ones (CNKI and WanFang) were systematically searched, identifying both reports of surveys and evaluation of interventions from Jan 1997 to Oct 2018. Results MHL research has developed rapidly in China in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades. There were 350 peer-reviewed publications included in this review, covering diverse settings and participants. Of these publications, 313 (89.4%) were published in Chinese-language journals and 37 in English-language journals; 303 (86.6%) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of MHL interventions. MHL research in China has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health-related knowledge and beliefs. Much less attention has been given to developing and evaluating relevant interventions. MHL related to general mental health and suicide were most commonly studied, with less focus on specific disorders, although some studies covered depression, psychosis and anxiety disorders. The majority of MHL tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in China (n = 97, 80.2% ) and almost half of these studies (57.8%) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics. Conclusions More interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, are needed in China. These should be evaluated with high-quality study designs, such as randomised controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for measuring MHL should also be addressed in future studies.

AB  - Purpose This review aimed to systematically investigate the Chinese public's ability to recognize specific mental disorders and their knowledge and beliefs about available treatments. Methods Eight electronic databases were searched to identify quantitative studies examining recognition of depression, anxiety and/or schizophrenia, knowledge and beliefs about treatments, and/or correlates of each of the three constructs among the general population in China. Prevalence estimates were calculated for themes under each construct. Effect size r was computed for each relationship between an independent variable and one of the three constructs. Results A total of 65 studies (N = 174,253) were included in this review. Depression (25.4%), anxiety (18.2%) and schizophrenia (18.4%) had low recognition rates. More than 80% of people agreed that one should seek professional help for mental illnesses, but fewer than 40% were likely to use professional services for their own mental health issues. Regarding psychiatric medications, 57% of the respondents agreed that medications should be taken regularly, but more than 60% believed that they would be harmful. Gender, income, residential area, occupation, education and marital status were significantly associated with level of mental health knowledge. Conclusions The public's level of mental health literacy related to recognition of specific mental disorders, and knowledge and beliefs about treatments is still relatively low. The government should consider public education campaigns to improve this.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Dissociation, which is defined as the failure to associate consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior into an integrated whole, has long been assumed to be generated by trauma. If dissociation is a product of trauma exposure, then dissociation would be a major mental health outcome observed in studies of disaster survivors. Although some studies have examined dissociation in disasters, no systematic literature reviews have been conducted to date on the topic.
   AIM
   To systematically evaluate the literature on the association between disaster and dissociation to determine the prevalence and incidence of dissociation after exposure to disaster and further examine their relationship.
   METHODS
   EMBASE, Medline, and PsychINFO were searched from inception to January 1, 2019 to identify studies examining dissociative disorders or symptoms related to a disaster in adult or child disaster survivors and disaster responders. Studies of military conflicts and war, articles not in English, and those with samples of 30 or more participants were exduded. Search terms used were "disaster' and dissociation ("dissociar," "multiple personality," "fugue," "psychogenic amnesia," "derealization," and "depersonalization"). Reference lists of identified articles were scrutinized to identify studies for additional articles.
   RESULTS
   The final number of articles in the review was 53, including 36 articles with samples of adults aged 18 and above, 5 of children/adolescents under age 18, and 12 of disaster workers. Included articles studied several types of disasters that occurred between 1989 and 2017, more than one-third (38%) from the United States. Only two studies had a primary aim to investigate dissociation in relation to disaster and none reported data on dissociative disorders. All of the studies used self-report symptom scales; none used structured interviews providing full diagnostic assessment of dissociative disorders or other psychopathology. Several studies mixed exposed and unexposed samples or did not differentiate outcomes between exposure groups. Studies examining associations between dissociation and disaster exposure have been inconclusive. The majority (75%) of the studies compared dissociation with posttrauma tic stress, with inconsistent findings. Dissociation was found to be associated with a wide range of other psychiatric disorders, symptoms, and negative emotional, cognitive, and functional states.
   CONCLUSION
   The studies reviewed had serious methodological limitations including problems with measurement of psychopathology, sampling, and generation of unwarranted conclusions, precluding conclusions that dissociation is an established outcome of disaster.

AB  - There is increasing evidence of a pivotal role of the gut microbiota (GUT-M) in key physiological functions in vertebrates. Many studies discuss functional implications of the GUT-M not only on immunity, growth, metabolism, but also on brain development and behavior. However, while the influence of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) on behavior is documented in rodents and humans, data on farm animals are scarce. This review will first report the well-known influence of the MGBA on behavior in rodent and human and then describe its influence on emotion, memory, social and feeding behaviors in farm animals. This corpus of experiments suggests that a better understanding of the effects of the MGBA on behavior could have large implications in various fields of animal production. Specifically, animal welfare and health could be improved by selection, nutrition and management processes that take into account the role of the GUT-M in behavior.

AB  - BackgroundOccupational stressors in police work increase the risk for officer mental health morbidities. Officers' poor mental wellbeing is harmful to the individual, can affect professionalism, organisational effectiveness, and public safety. While the impact of operational stressors on officers' mental wellbeing is well documented, no review has systematically investigated organisational stressor impacts. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to assess the relationship between organisational stressors and police officer mental wellbeing.MethodsSystematic review conducted following PRISMA and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Literature search was undertaken from 1990 to May 2017 on four databases (EBSCOHOST Medline/SocINDEX/PsycINFO/OVID Embase) and grey literature. Included articles were critically appraised and assessed for risk of bias. Narrative and evidence syntheses were performed by specific mental health outcomes.ResultsIn total, 3571 results were returned, and 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. All included studies were published in English between 1995 and 2016, had cross-sectional study designs, spanned across four continents and covered 15,150 officers. Strong evidence of significant associations was identified for organisational stressors and the outcomes of: occupational stress, psychiatric symptoms/psychological distress, emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment. The organisational stressors most often demonstrating consistently significant associations with mental health outcomes included lack of support, demand, job pressure, administrative/organisational pressure and long working-hours.ConclusionsThis review is the first to systematically examine organisational stressors and mental health in police officers. Organisational stressors that can be targeted by interventions and policy changes to secure officer wellbeing, a healthy work environment, and benefits to the organisation and the public are identified.

AB  - Introduction The prevalence of common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, is high and the demand for psychological interventions and talking therapies is increasing. In order to meet this need, it is necessary to explore alternative methods to deliver talking therapies. Training lay health workers (LHWs) to deliver psychological interventions might be one possible solution to address current gaps in service provision. A number of studies have successfully used this approach to deliver psychological interventions in order to meet the demand for mental health care. Despite increased interest in this area, the evidence has not been synthesised or systematically reviewed.
   Methods Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBBASE, PsycINFO and CINHAL) were systematically searched to specifically capture studies on task-shifting psychological interventions for common mental disorders. Data were extracted on the experiences of the lay-workers on training and therapy delivery. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Themes and subthemes of LHWs views on receiving training, barriers and facilitators to therapy delivery, factors required to become a successful therapist and the impact of training and therapy delivery on the therapists are described.
   Results 10 studies were eligible for inclusion. Key messages were: LHWs were satisfied with training but wanted more robust supervision; not enough time was given to training on understanding mental health problems; LHWs grew in confidence and this impacted on their personal relationships with others.
   Conclusion This is the first review to explore LHWs experiences in training and therapy delivery by synthesising existing qualitative research. A number of key messages derived out of this review can help in further improving the quality of the training programmes and highlighting the benefits that are available for the LHW in delivering psychological interventions.

AB  - The cerebellum is well-established as a primary center for controlling sensorimotor functions. However, recent experiments have demonstrated additional roles for the cerebellum in higher-order cognitive functions such as language, emotion, reward, social behavior, and working memory. Based on the diversity of behaviors that it can influence, it is therefore not surprising that cerebellar dysfunction is linked to motor diseases such as ataxia, dystonia, tremor, and Parkinson's disease as well to non-motor disorders including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. Regardless of the condition, there is a growing consensus that developmental disturbances of the cerebellum may be a central culprit in triggering a number of distinct pathophysiological processes. Here, we consider how cerebellar malformations and neuronal circuit wiring impact brain function and behavior during development. We use the cerebellum as a model to discuss the expanding view that local integrated brain circuits function within the context of distributed global networks to communicate the computations that drive complex behavior. We highlight growing concerns that neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases with severe behavioral outcomes originate from developmental insults to the cerebellum.

AB  - Background Humanitarian emergencies are a major global health challenge with the potential to have a profound impact on people's mental and psychological health. Effective interventions in humanitarian settings are needed to support the mental health and psychosocial needs of affected populations. To fill this gap, this systematic review synthesises evidence on the effectiveness of a wide range of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) programmes delivered to adults affected by humanitarian emergencies in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Methods A comprehensive search of 12 electronic databases, key websites and citation checking was undertaken in 2015 and updated in May 2018. We included controlled trials published in English from 1980. We extracted data and assessed risk of bias prior to performing a meta-analysis using random effects models. When meta-analysis was not used, we narratively described individual trial effect sizes using forest plots.
   Results Thirty-five studies were included. Overall, MHPSS programmes show benefits in improved functioning and reducing post-traumatic stress disorder. There are also indications from a limited pool of evidence that cognitive-behavioural therapy and narrative exposure therapy may improve mental health conditions. Other psychotherapy modalities also showed a positive trend in favour of MHPSS programmes for improving several mental health outcomes.
   Conclusion In addition to MHPSS programme for improving mental health outcomes in adults affected by humanitarian emergencies in LMICs, there is also a need to generate robust evidence to identify potential impact on broader social dimensions. Doing so could aid the future development of MHPSS programmes and ensure their effective implementation across different humanitarian contexts in LMICs. Future research on MHPSS programmes which focus on basic services and security, community and family programmes, their cost-effectiveness and mechanisms of impact could also strengthen the MHPSS evidence base to better inform policy and practice decision-making in humanitarian settings.

AB  - Background An increasing number of studies are identifying associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and ill health throughout the life course. We aimed to calculate the proportions of major risk factors for and causes of ill health that are attributable to one or multiple types of ACE and the associated financial costs.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched for studies in which risk data in individuals with ACEs were compared with these data in those without ACEs. We searched six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Criminal Justice Databases, and the Education Resources Information Center) for quantitative studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and July 11, 2018, that reported risks of health-related behaviours and causes of ill health in adults that were associated with cumulative measures of ACEs (ie, number of ACEs). We included studies in adults in populations that did not have a high risk of ACEs, that had sample sizes of at least 1000 people, and that provided ACE prevalence data. We calculated the pooled RR for risk factors (harmful alcohol use, illicit drug use, smoking, and obesity) and causes of ill health (cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, anxiety, and depression) associated with ACEs. RRs were used to estimate the population-attributable fractions (PAFs) of risk attributable to ACEs and the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and financial costs associated with ACEs. This study was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018090356).
   Findings Of 4387 unique articles found following our initial search, after review of the titles (and abstracts, when the title was relevant), we assessed 880 (20%) full-text articles. We considered 221 (25%) full-text articles for inclusion, of which 23 (10%) articles met all selection criteria for our meta-analysis. We found a pooled prevalence of 23.5% of individuals (95% CI 18.7-28.5) with one ACE and 18.7% (14.7-23.2) with two or more ACEs in Europe (from ten studies) and of 23.4% of individuals (22.0-24.8) with one ACE and 35.0% (31- 6-38- 4) with two or more ACEs in north America (from nine studies). Illicit drug use had the highest PAFs associated with ACEs of all the risk factors assessed in both regions (34.1% in Europe; 41.1% in north America). In both regions, PAFs of causes of ill health were highest for mental illness outcomes: ACEs were attributed to about 30% of cases of anxiety and 40% of cases of depression in north America and more than a quarter of both conditions in Europe. Costs of cardiovascular disease attributable to ACEs were substantially higher than for most other causes of ill health because of higher DALYs for this condition. Total annual costs attributable to ACEs were estimated to be US$581 billion in Europe and $748 billion in north America. More than 75% of these costs arose in individuals with two or more ACEs.
   Interpretation Millions of adults across Europe and north America live with a legacy of ACEs. Our findings suggest that a 10% reduction in ACE prevalence could equate to annual savings of 3 million DALYs or $105 billion. Programmes to prevent ACEs and moderate their effects are available. Rebalancing expenditure towards ensuring safe and nurturing childhoods would be economically beneficial and relieve pressures on health-care systems. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM-III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up-to-date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence-supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best-validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two-thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence-based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.

AB  - Purpose Case-finding for common mental disorders (CMD) in routine data unobtrusively identifies patients for mental health research. There is absence of a review of studies examining CMD-case-finding accuracy in routine primary care data. CMD-case definitions include diagnostic/prescription codes, signs/symptoms, and free text within electronic health records. This systematic review assesses evidence for case-finding accuracy of CMD-case definitions compared to reference standards.
   Methods PRISMA-DTA checklist guided review. Eligibility criteria were outlined prior to study search; studies compared CMD-case definitions in routine primary care data to diagnostic interviews, screening instruments, or clinician judgement. Studies were quality assessed using QUADAS-2.
   Results Fourteen studies were included, and most were at high risk of bias. Nine studies examined depressive disorders and seven utilised diagnostic interviews as reference standards. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) planes illustrated overall variable case-finding accuracy across case definitions, quantified by Youden's index. Forest plots demonstrated most case definitions provide high specificity.
   Conclusion Case definitions effectively identify cases in a population with good accuracy and few false positives. For 100 anxiety cases, identified using diagnostic codes, between 12 and 20 will be false positives; 0-47 cases will be missed. Sensitivity is more variable and specificity is higher in depressive cases; for 100 cases identified using diagnostic codes, between 0 and 87 will be false positives; 4-18 cases will be missed. Incorporating context to case definitions may improve overall case-finding accuracy. Further research is required for meta-analysis and robust conclusions.

AB  - Sciatica impacts on the ability to work and may lead to a reduced return to work. This study reviewed and summarised prognostic factors of work participation in patients who received conservative or surgical treatment for clinically diagnosed sciatica. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO until January 2018. Cohort studies, using a measure of work participation as outcome, were included. Two independent reviewers performed study inclusion and used the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool for risk of bias assessment and GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence. Based on seven studies describing six cohorts (n=1408 patients) that assessed 21 potential prognostic factors, favourable factors for return to work (follow-up ranging from 3 months to 10 years) included younger age, better general health, less low back pain or sciatica bothersomeness, better physical function, negative straight leg raise-test, physician expecting surgery to be beneficial, better pain coping, less depression and mental stress, less fear of movement and low physical work load. Study results could not be pooled. Using GRADE, the quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading mainly for a high risk of bias and imprecision. Several prognostic factors like pain, disability and psychological factors were identified and reviewed, and these could be targeted using additional interventions to optimise return to work.

AB  - Over the last two decades, neuroscientists have used antidepressant placebo probes to examine the biological mechanisms implicated in expectancies of mood improvement. However, findings from these studies have yet to elucidate a model-based theory that would explain the mechanisms through which antidepressant expectancies evolve to induce persistent mood changes. Compared to other fields, the development of experimental models of antidepressant placebo effects faces significant challenges, such as the delayed mechanism of action of conventional antidepressants and the complex internal dynamics of mood. Still, recent neuroimaging studies of antidepressant placebo effects have shown remarkable similarities to those observed in other disciplines (e.g., placebo analgesia), such as placebo-induced increased p-opioid signaling and bloodoxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in areas involved in cognitive control, the representation of expected values and reward and emotional processing. This review will summarize these findings and the challenges and opportunities that arise from applying methodologies used in the field of placebo analgesia into the field of antidepressant placebo effects.

AB  - The present contribution offers an overview of a new area of research in the field of foreign language acquisition, which was triggered by the introduction of Positive Psychology (PP) (MacIntyre and Gregersen, 2012). For many years, a cognitive perspective had dominated research in applied linguistics. Around the turn of the millennium researchers became increasingly interested in the role of emotions in foreign language learning and teaching, beyond established concepts like foreign language anxiety and constructs like motivation and attitudes toward the foreign language. As a result, a more nuanced understanding of the role of positive and negative learner and teacher emotions emerged, underpinned by solid empirical research using a wide range of epistemological and methodological approaches. PP interventions have been carried out in schools and universities to strengthen learners and teachers' experiences of flow, hope, courage, well-being, optimism, creativity, happiness, grit, resilience, strengths, and laughter with the aim of enhancing learners' linguistic progress. This paper distinguishes the early period in the field that started with MacIntyre and Gregersen (2012), like a snowdrop after winter, and that was followed by a number of early studies in relatively peripheral journals. We argue that 2016 is the starting point of the current period, characterized by gradual recognition in applied linguistics, growing popularity of PP, and an exponential increase in publications in more mainstream journals. This second period could be compared to a luxuriant English garden in full bloom.

AB  - Objective: There exists considerable individual variability in the development and progression of pathological stress reactions after experiencing trauma, as well as in individuals' response to psychological interventions. Yet until recently, such individual differences had not been considered when evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This systematic review aims to examine the emerging literature on this subject and, specifically, to identify trajectories and predictors of psychotherapeutic response in adults with PTSD. Method: Four databases were searched using specific keywords without date or language restrictions. For each study, independent reviewers systematically evaluated whether it met eligibility criteria and assessed risk of bias. For included studies, reviewers completed data extraction using standard formats. Those examining how subgroups of adults respond to therapy for clinical PTSD using trajectory modeling were deemed eligible. Demographic, PTSD, clinical, and trauma-related factors associated to particular trajectories were also examined. Results: Of the 1,727 papers identified, 11 were included in this analysis. Of these studies, six focused on military-related traumas and five on civilian ones. Although studies found between two and five trajectories, most supported a three-trajectory model of response categorized as responders, nonresponders, and subclinical participants. Over 22 predictors of treatment trajectories were examined. Comorbid depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse were the strongest predictors of poor therapeutic response. Age, combat exposure, social support, and hyperarousal were moderate predictors. Conclusion: This review provides valuable insight into the treatment of PTSD, as it supports the heterogeneous trajectories of psychotherapeutic responses and provides avenues for the development of interventions that consider individual-level factors in treatment response.

AB  - Recent scientific and technological advances have brought us closer to being able to apply a true biopsychosocial approach to the study of resilience in humans. Decades of research have identified a range of psychosocial protective factors in the face of stress and trauma. Progress in resilience research is now advancing our understanding of the biology underlying these protective factors at multiple phenotypic levels, including stress response systems, neural circuitry function, and immune responses, in interaction with genetic factors. It is becoming clear that resilience involves active and unique biological processes that buffer the organism against the impact of stress, not simply involve a reversal of pathological mechanisms. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in the field, highlighting key psychosocial milestones and accompanying biological changes during development, and into adulthood and old age. Continued advances in our understanding of psychological, social, and biological determinants of resilience will contribute to the development of novel interventions and help optimize the type and timing of intervention for those most at risk, resulting in a possible new framework for enhancing resilience across the life span.

AB  - Background: There is a huge gap in the treatment of mental disorders in Latin America, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Given the sharp increase in Internet access and the rapid penetration of smartphones in the region, the use of Internet-based technologies might potentially contribute to overcoming this gap and to provide more widely distributed and low-cost mental health care in a variety of contexts.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the literature in order to systematically map the existing evidence on use of Internet-based interventions for prevention, treatment, and management of mental disorders across Latin American countries, as well as to identify existing gaps in knowledge. Six electronic databases were searched for published papers (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, SciELO, and CENTRAL).
   Results: After the eligibility assessment, we identified 22 Internet-based studies carried out in Latin America for prevention, treatment, education, or facilitating self-management of mental disorders. Included studies mainly targeted depression (n = 11), substance misuse (n = 6), anxiety (n = 3), and mental health literacy for education and health professionals (n = 2). Most studies were undertaken in Brazil (n = 6), Mexico (n = 5), and Chile (n = 4). Only 3 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 were pilot RCTs, and 15 were naturalistic, acceptability, or feasibility studies. The three RCTs identified showed disparate results, but overall, there are challenges to face. Better results are seen in the short-term (postintervention or after 3 months), but most studies do not explore outcomes for long enough (follow-up after 6 or 12 months). Most of the feasibility and pilot studies showed reasonably good acceptability for a wide range of strategies but difficulties to engage and retain participants for long enough or adhering to established protocols.
   Conclusion: This study shows that Internet-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders are growing rapidly in Latin America, but there are few studies on effectiveness and cost effectiveness, making it difficult to provide the evidence needed to justify scaling up these interventions.

AB  - This review aimed to examine the effectiveness of mental health training programs designed to improve the knowledge, attitudes, or helping behaviour of secondary school teachers for adolescent depression, anxiety, and related mental health problems. A systematic search strategy was conducted using electronic databases and hand search procedures. Eight studies met inclusion criteria, representing six unique training programs. All eight studies reported an improvement in mental health knowledge (d = 0.57-3.1) and attitudes (d = 0.36-1.18) at post-intervention. There was little evidence that the included training programs improved teachers' helping behaviour or students' mental health. There was no evidence to suggest that these training programs alleviated mental health problems among teachers themselves. Only two studies were conducted as randomised controlled trials. The findings suggest there may be value in providing mental health training to teachers; however, there is an urgent need for more rigorous research to determine which, if any, programs can alter teacher behaviour or improve student outcomes for mental health.

AB  - Purpose of review To review recent studies which assess comorbidity, that is, prevalence of co-occurrence, relationships and treatment implications between anxiety disorders and various medical illnesses. Recent findings The prevalence rates of anxiety disorders in patients with medical illnesses are high, with percentage up to 29% in patients with epilepsy, 48.9% in patients with multiple sclerosis, 30.1% in patients with Parkinson's disease, 30% in patients with cardiovascular disease, 47.0% in patients with diabetes mellitus, and so on. The most prevalent anxiety disorders among individuals with somatic illnesses are generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. In addition, various medical illnesses are highly prevalent in samples of patients with anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders co-occurring with medical illnesses have a number of clinical implications, including a greater severity and negative impact on treatment outcome of both medical illnesses and anxiety disorders. It is important for clinicians to look for possible anxiety disorders among patients with medical illnesses. Further studies need to ascertain how to best treat individuals suffering from both anxiety disorders and medical illnesses, and focus on the issue of causality when these conditions co-occur.

AB  - Objective: The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a highly connected cortical region that acts as a hub in major large-scale brain networks. Its dysfunction is associated with a number of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism, depression, substance use disorder (SUD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies targeting the mPFC indicate that it may be a useful therapeutic resource in psychiatry due to its selective modulation of this area and connected regions.
   Methods: This review examines six mPFC rTMS trials selected from 697 initial search results. We discuss the main results, technical and methodological details, safety, tolerability, and localization strategies.
   Results: Six different protocols were identified, including inhibitory (1 Hz) and excitatory (5, 10, and 20 Hz) frequencies applied therapeutically to patient populations diagnosed with major depressive disorder, OCD, autistic spectrum disorder, SUD, specific phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the OCD and acrophobia trials, rTMS significantly reduced symptoms compared to placebo.
   Conclusion: These protocols were considered safe and add interesting new evidence to the growing body of mPFC rTMS literature. However, the small number and low methodological quality of the studies indicate the need for further research.

The present meta-analysis analyzed whether parents of children with chronic physical diseases and/or sensory/physical disabilities show higher anxiety levels than parents of healthy/nondisabled children or test norms. Methods The databases PSYCINFO, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and PSYNDEX were searched for relevant studies. In total, 486 studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Results We found moderate elevations of anxiety symptoms in parents of young people with chronic conditions (g = .54 standard deviation units). About 16% of the parents fulfilled the criteria for an anxiety disorder. Parents of young people with neuromuscular disorders, HIV-infection/AIDS, and cancer during active treatment showed large elevations of anxiety symptoms. Elevations of anxiety symptoms were smaller in the cases of longer lasting chronic conditions, longer time since the end of active treatment, in families of older children, in samples with lower percentages of mothers, and in studies from economically developed countries compared to less developed countries. Conclusion Measures for preventing and reducing anxiety symptoms in parents of young people with neuromuscular disorders, HIV-infection/AIDS, and those undergoing cancer treatments are particularly needed.

AB  - Introduction: Partners of military Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health difficulties can themselves develop difficulties with stress, well-being, and secondary trauma. Various interventions exist which involve partners of military personnel, but very few with an explicit focus on the partners' well-being. This article aims to conduct a systematic review of these interventions and outline the range of interventions and the outcomes measured. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search, from which 25 papers were reviewed. Papers were included if they described any form of intervention in which a partner was involved, where the Veteran was described as having PTSD, and where the aim of the intervention was aimed at least partly at improving the well-being of partners. Results: We found various types of interventions, such as group-based interventions, residential retreats, couples therapies, Internet-based interventions, and family-based interventions. Of the 25 studies reviewed, 21 reported on well-being outcomes, either via randomized controlled trials (RCTs), evaluations, or case studies. In most cases, interventions reported improvements in the well-being of partners, although there were very few controlled studies. Only a small number of interventions were aimed solely at partners. The most common feature of interventions was psychoeducation on topics such as communication, problem solving, and emotion regulation. Many papers described the advantages of group processes such as social support and normalization, gained from partners sharing experiences with one another. Discussion: A wide range of formats exist of interventions for improving the well-being of military partners. The literature would benefit from more robust experimental research into their effectiveness, and exploration of interventions aimed directly at the well-being of partners.

AB  - Depression predisposes to medical illnesses and advances biological aging indicated by shorter telomere length, accelerated brain aging and advanced epigenetic aging. Medical illnesses also increase the risk of late-life depression. The reciprocal relationships of depression with aging-related and disease-related processes have generated pathogenetic hypotheses and provided treatment targets. Targeting risk factors of vascular disease in mid-life is a logical approach in prevention of vascular depression. The depression-executive dysfunction and the vascular depression syndromes have clinical presentations and neuroimaging findings consistent with frontostriatal abnormalities. Dopamine D-2/3 agonists are effective in depression of Parkinson's disease and their efficacy needs to be assessed in these two syndromes. Computerized cognitive remediation targeting functions of the cognitive control network may improve both executive functions and depressive symptoms of late-life major depression. Significant progress has been made in neurostimulation treatments in depressed younger adults. TMS targeting deep structures responsible for mood regulation is well tolerated by older adults and its efficacy in syndromes of late-life depression needs to be studied. Efficacious psychotherapies for late-life depression exist, but are underutilized in part because of their complexity. Streamlined, stepped psychotherapies targeting behaviors assumed to result from dysfunction of brain networks implicated in late-life depression can be easy to learn and have potential for dissemination. However, their effectiveness needs further investigation. Depression increases the risk of dementing disorders. Antidepressants are rather ineffective in treating depression of demented patients, but long-term use of antidepressants may reduce the risk of dementia. However, confirmation studies are needed.

AB  - Research suggests that major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are both associated with unique emotional memory (EM) biases. To better elucidate the EM phenotypes of these disorders, we systematically reviewed the literature on non-autobiographical explicit EM biases in individuals with MDD and BD compared to healthy controls. The following databases were searched: Cochrane, Embase, HAPI, LILACs, Medline, PsycInfo and Web of Science. Grey literature and hand searches were also performed. Fourteen studies met full eligibility criteria. Eleven studies included data from an MDD sample (10 during acute depression, 1 during euthymia) and 3 studies included data from a BD sample (2 during acute mood episodes, 1 during euthymia). Only 3 of the studies in acute depression revealed a negative explicit EM bias. One study in MDD during euthymia revealed an EM deficit for negative stimuli. One of the two studies in BD (type I; BD-I) during an acute mood episode revealed a positive explicit EM bias, while the other showed no bias. One study in BD during euthymia showed an EM deficit for negative stimuli. Overall, this review concludes that current empirical evidence does not readily support the existence of an explicit EM bias in MDD during acute depression. The identification and implications of potential moderating factors on explicit EM performance in MDD and BD during both illness stages are discussed.

AB  - Background. Research has found a strong link between ageism, in the form of negative stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination toward older people, and risks to their physical and mental health. Little is known, however, about the effectiveness of strategies to reduce ageism.
   Objectives. To assess the relative effects of 3 intervention types designed to reduce ageism among youths and adults-education, intergenerational contact, and combined education and intergenerational contact-by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Search Methods. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, AgeLine, EBSCO, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Global Index Medicus, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Epistemonikos, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Campbell Collaboration, PROSPERO, GreyLit, and OpenGrey. We identified additional records by hand-searching reference lists of relevant review articles as well as records included in the meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers completed the search and screening process.

Eligible studies were those that (1) evaluated an intervention designed to reduce ageism, (2) examined at least 1 ageism outcome in relation to older adults, (3) used a design with a comparison group (randomized or nonrandomized), and (4) were published after 1970, when the ageism concept was developed.
   Data Collection and Analysis. Two independent reviewers extracted study-level data from records using a common data collection spreadsheet. They also assessed study quality by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) tool to assess quality of outcome evidence. Primary outcomes were attitudes toward older people and accuracy of knowledge about aging and older people. Secondary outcomes included comfort with older adults, anxiety about one's own aging, and interest in working in the field of geriatrics or gerontology. We carried out meta-analyses with statistical mixed models.
   Main Results. We identified 63 eligible studies (1976-2018) with a total sample of 6124 participants. Ageism interventions demonstrated a strongly significant effect on attitudes (differences of standardized mean differences [d(D)] = 0.33; P<.001), knowledge (d(D) = 0.42; P<.001), and comfort (d(D) = 0.50; P<.001), but no significant effect on anxiety (d(D) = 0.13; P = .33) or working with older adults (dD = -0.09; P = .40). Combined interventions with education and intergenerational contact showed the largest effects on attitudes. We found stronger effects for females and for adolescent and young adult groups.
   Authors' Conclusions. Interventions are associated with substantial reduction in ageism and should be part of an international strategy to improve perceptions of older people and the aging process. Additional research using more rigorous designs to examine the effects of interventions is strongly recommended.
   Public Health Implications. Ageism has well-established negative effects on the physical and mental health of older people. Findings suggest that relatively low-cost, feasible strategies involving education and intergenerational contact can serve as the basis of effective interventions to reduce ageism.

TI  - Low high-density lipoprotein and psychopathology: A review
KW  - CHOLESTEROL
KW  - DEPRESSION
AB  - BACKGROUND: An association between the level of total cholesterol and psychopathology has been the focus of numerous studies. Low total cholesterol has been found to be related to depression, personality disorders, and dissociative disorder. High cholesterol has been associated with schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no reviews of the psychiatric correlates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) have been published. We reviewed the literature for studies reporting a significant association between low or high levels of HDL and psychopathology.
   METHODS: A search of major databases (PubMed and CINAHL) was conducted using the following keywords: HDL, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, OCD, and psychiatric disorders.
   RESULTS: Eight studies met our search criteria. Six of the 8 studies reported significantly higher rates of depression, anxiety, suicide attempts, and violent behaviors in participants with low HDL.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a low HDL may not only be associated with risk for cardiac disease, but also with increased risk for serious psychiatric disorders. Further controlled studies are warranted.

AB  - Background Some recent studies examined the effect of ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution on depression and suicide. However, the results have been inconclusive. Aims To determine the overall relationship between PM exposure and depression/suicide in the general population. Method We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-crossover and cohort studies to assess the association between PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m or less) or PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 and 10 mu m) exposure and depression/suicide. Results A total of 14 articles (7 for depression and 7 for suicide) with data from 684 859 participants were included in the meta-analysis. With a 10 mu g/m3 increase in PM2.5 we found a 19% (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.19 [1.07, 1.33]) increased risk of depression and a marginally increased risk of suicide (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.05 [0.99, 1.11]) in the general population. We did not observe any significant associations between increasing exposure to PM10 and depression/suicide. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were used to determine the robustness of results. The strongest estimated effect of depression associated with PM2.5 appeared in a long-term lag pattern (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.25 [1.07, 1.45], P < 0.01) and cumulative lag pattern (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.26 [1.07, 1.48], P < 0.01). Conclusions The meta-analysis suggested that an increase in ambient PM2.5 concentration was strongly associated with increased depression risk in the general population, and the association appeared stronger at long-term lag and cumulative lag patterns, suggesting a potential cumulative exposure effect over time. Declaration of interest None.

AB  - Objective To estimate the prevalence of antenatal depression in South Asia and to examine variations by country and study characteristics to inform policy, practice and future research. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of 13 databases including international databases and databases covering scientific literature from South Asian countries in addition to Google Scholar and grey sources from 1 January 2007 to 31 May 2018. Studies reporting prevalence estimates of antenatal depression using a validated diagnostic/screening tool were identified, screened, selected and appraised. Primary outcome was proportion (%) of pregnant women identified as having antenatal depression. Results Thirty-three studies involving 13 087 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Twelve studies were rated as high quality and 21 studies were of moderate quality. Overall pooled prevalence of antenatal depression was 24.3 % (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 19.03 to 30.47). Studies showed a high degree of heterogeneity (I-2=97.66%) and evidence of publication bias (p=0.668). Prevalence rates for India (17.74%, 95% CI 11.19 to 26.96) and Sri Lanka (12.95%, 95% CI 8.29 to 19.68) were lower compared with the overall prevalence, whereas prevalence rates for Pakistan (32.2%, 95% CI 23.11 to 42.87) and Nepal (50%, 95% CI 35.64 to 64.36) were higher. Conclusions While robust prevalence studies are sparse in most South Asian countries, available data suggest one in four pregnant women is likely to experience antenatal depression in the region. Findings highlight the need for recognition of the issue in health policy and practice and for resource allocation for capacity building at regional and national levels for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Digital mindfulness-based interventions (d-MBIs) present a promising path for the scalable dissemination of mindfulness instruction in the 21st century. Smartphone applications and web-based platforms can offer potential advantages over traditional face-to-face formats through enhanced accessibility, standardization, personalization, and efficacy of mindfulness training. A growing body of research has documented that a digital approach to teaching mindfulness can improve measures of attention, stress, depression, and anxiety. However, effective digital mindfulness instruction must overcome a variety of challenges, including the possibility of low engagement, shallow learning, and unaddressed obstacles or frustrations. Fortunately, best practices from multiple fields of research provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

AB  - Aim The aim of this narrative summary was to examine the efficacy of physical activity and exercise as a universal prevention for depression in young people. Methods We conducted a search of the literature in the open-access evidence database of controlled trials and systematic reviews in youth mental health, an initiative between Orygen, The National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health and headspace, National Youth Mental Health Foundation. In April 2018, we searched for all papers published between 1980 and 2017 relating to "Depressive Disorder" under the "Universal Prevention" illness stage and classified as "Physical activity/Exercise" under the treatment/intervention classification. Systematic reviews, randomized control trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials were all included. Results A total of 11 papers were returned. Three of these studies were observational and eight studies were controlled trials. The reviewed studies indicate that exercise and physical activity might be an effective universal depression prevention intervention for young people. Three of the controlled studies had a passive control group or no control group and only one study had longer-term follow-up. No trial used a longitudinal design to determine if interventions prevent the onset of new cases of depression. Conclusions The studies reviewed in the current review demonstrate a bidirectional relationship between physical activity, exercise and adolescent mental health. The results of the current review suggest that physical activity and exercise programs designed to increase the level of activity in young people should be implemented to be attractive and achievable to young people that may have poor psychological health.

AB  - The comorbidity between discrete clinical diagnosis occurs in higher levels than prevalence rates, indicating that mental disorders are systematically overcategorized. Dimensional models - as the Internalizing-Externalizing Spectrum - claim for a common latent structure of psychopathology. The current meta-analysis aims to evaluate whether the externalizing and internalizing latent factors of the psychopathological spectrum display common and distinctive neurobiological substrates, as unveiled by Error-Related Negativity (ERN) modulation. A systematic search of the literature was conducted and a total of 99 articles (160 studies, N = 8123) were included in the quantitative analysis. A dissociable effect was found: reduced ERN amplitude was observed in externalizing, while increased ERN amplitude was reported in internalizing. Larger effects were documented in all the externalizing dimensions (except for alcohol abuse) and were moderated by frontal electrode sites and tasks requiring inhibition. In internalizing, the overall effect was less robust. Disorder severity and tasks with punishment contingencies moderated the findings, and anxiety and obsessive-compulsive traits were the unique dimensions of internalizing accounting for the ERN increased amplitude. Overall, our findings highlight that ERN reduction interacts with the multiple phenotypic expressions of externalizing at a general level, while more specific factors - such as differences in sensitivity and aversion to errors - may explain increased ERN amplitude in internalizing.

AB  - Turbulent and radiative exchanges of heat between the ocean and atmosphere (hereafter heat fluxes), ocean surface wind stress, and state variables used to estimate them, are Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) and Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) influencing weather and climate. This paper describes an observational strategy for producing 3-hourly, 25-km (and an aspirational goal of hourly at 10-km) heat flux and wind stress fields over the global, ice-free ocean with breakthrough 1-day random uncertainty of 15 W m(-2) and a bias of less than 5 W m(-2). At present this accuracy target is met only for OceanSITES reference station moorings and research vessels (RVs) that follow best practices. To meet these targets globally, in the next decade, satellite-based observations must be optimized for boundary layer measurements of air temperature, humidity, sea surface temperature, and ocean wind stress. In order to tune and validate these satellite measurements, a complementary global in situ flux array, built around an expanded OceanSITES network of time series reference station moorings, is also needed. The array would include 500-1000 measurement platforms, including autonomous surface vehicles, moored and drifting buoys, RVs, the existing OceanSITES network of 22 flux sites, and new OceanSITES expanded in 19 key regions. This array would be globally distributed, with 1-3 measurement platforms in each nominal 10 degrees by 10 degrees box. These improved moisture and temperature profiles and surface data, if assimilated into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, would lead to better representation of cloud formation processes, improving state variables and surface radiative and turbulent fluxes from these models. The in situ flux array provides globally distributed measurements and metrics for satellite algorithm development, product validation, and for improving satellite-based, NWP and blended flux products. In addition, some of these flux platforms will also measure direct turbulent fluxes, which can be used to improve algorithms for computation of air-sea exchange of heat and momentum in flux products and models. With these improved air-sea fluxes, the ocean's influence on the atmosphere will be better quantified and lead to improved long-term weather forecasts, seasonal-interannual-decadal climate predictions, and regional climate projections.

AB  - Background: Determining the clinical effects of coercion is a difficult challenge, raising ethical, legal, and methodological questions. Despite limited scientific evidence on effectiveness, coercive measures are frequently used, especially in psychiatry. This systematic review aims to search for effects of seclusion and restraint on psychiatric inpatients with wider inclusion of outcomes and study designs than former reviews.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, primarily through Pubmed, Embase, and CENTRAL. Interventional and prospective observational studies on effects of seclusion and restraint on psychiatric inpatients were included. Main search keywords were restraint, seclusion, psychiatry, effect, harm, efficiency, efficacy, effectiveness, and quality of life.
   Results: Thirty-five articles were included, out of 6,854 records. Studies on the effects of seclusion and restraint in adult psychiatry comprise a wide range of outcomes and designs. The identified literature provides some evidence that seclusion and restraint have deleterious physical or psychological consequences. Estimation of post-traumatic stress disorder incidence after intervention varies from 25% to 47% and, thus, is not negligible, especially for patients with past traumatic experiences. Subjective perception has high interindividual variability, mostly associated with negative emotions. Effectiveness and adverse effects of seclusion and restraint seem to be similar. Compared to other coercive measures (notably forced medication), seclusion seems to be better accepted, while restraint seems to be less tolerated, possibly because of the perception of seclusion as "non-invasive." Therapeutic interaction appears to have a positive influence on coercion perception.
   Conclusion: Heterogeneity of the included studies limited drawing clear conclusions, but the main results identified show negative effects of seclusion and restraint. These interventions should be used with caution and as a last resort. Patients' preferences should be taken into account when deciding to apply these measures. The therapeutic relationship could be a focus for improvement of effects and subjective perception of coercion. In terms of methodology, studying coercive measures remains difficult but, in the context of current research on coercion reduction, is needed to provide workable baseline data and potential targets for interventions. Well-conducted prospective cohort studies could be more feasible than randomized controlled trials for interventional studies.

AB  - Insufficient sleep and insomnia promote chronic disease in the general population and may combine with social and economic factors to increase rates of chronic health conditions among AI/AN people. Given that insufficient sleep and insomnia can be addressed via behavioral interventions, it is critical to understand the prevalence and correlates of these disorders among AI/AN individuals in order to elucidate the mechanisms associated with health disparities and provide guidance for subsequent treatment research and practice. We reviewed the available literature on insufficient sleep and insomnia in the AI/AN population. PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and ProQuest were searched between June 12th and October 28th of 2018. Prevalence of insufficient sleep ranged from 15% to 40%; insomnia prevalence ranged from 25% to 33%. Insufficient sleep was associated with unhealthy diet, low physical activity levels, higher BMI, worse self-reported health, increased risk for diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, frequent mental distress, smoking, binge drinking, depression, and chronic pain. Insomnia was associated with depression, childhood abuse, PTSD, anxiety, alcohol use, low social support, and low trait-resilience levels. Research on evidence-based treatment and implementation practices targeting insufficient sleep and insomnia was lacking, and only one study described the development/validation of a measure of insufficient sleep among AI/AN people. There is a need for rigorous sleep research including testing and implementation of evidence-based treatment for insufficient sleep and insomnia in this population in an effort to help eliminate health disparities. We present recommendations for research and clinical practice based on the current review.

AB  - Background: The cross-cultural validity of the construct of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been a life-long debate in the field of trauma. Its validation in a setting such as India-a nation prone to considerably traumatic events such as conflict, natural disasters, and sexual violence against women-warrants exploration.
   Objective: To describe how PTSD and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are conceptualized in the Indian context by systematically examining the evidence of studies that investigate PTSD and PTSS in India.
   Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct yielded a total of 56 studies that discussed one or multiple aspects of PTSD and PTSS in India. Data relating to types of events, populations, diagnostic tools, manifestations, and interventions were extracted and analyzed.
   Results: Eleven of 29 Indian states and 2/7 union territories were represented in the 56 included studies, with most studies (n = 21) originating from Tamil Nadu. Natural Disasters (n = 28), War/Conflict (n = 10), and Medical conditions (n = 7) were the top three most commonly investigated traumatic events. The majority of studies focused on entire communities (n = 16), while children and adolescents made up the second largest group (n = 14). Less attention was paid explicitly to male (n = 3) or female (n = 4) victims. Twenty-five different methods for screening for PTSD were identified, with the most common being the impact of events scale (n = 14). The majority of studies reported the screening and clinical diagnosis of PTSD by professional health care providers (n = 24). Abuse scored the highest average prevalence of PTSD at 52.3%, while the lowest was 16.4% due to man-made accidents. Overall, there was a lack of assessment on trauma-specific interventions, though psychosocial support was the most commonly mentioned intervention.
   Conclusions: Results indicate diversity in approaches for identifying, measuring, and treating PTSD and PTSS in the Indian population and how sociocultural norms influence its manifestation in this population. Future research calls for the development of culturally sensitive approaches to identifying and addressing PTSD and PTSS in India.

AB  - Introduction The adverse physical consequences of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) have been thoroughly investigated and documented. Yet, we know little about the adverse mental health consequences of the practice. To fill this research gap, we systematically reviewed studies that assessed any adverse mental health consequences related to FGM/C.
   Methods We searched four databases from inception to 21 December 2018. We then reviewed all titles and abstracts for relevant studies. We used the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool to appraise the quality of each study and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to rate the risk of bias within studies.
   Results We included 16 studies in this review; only six studies examined the association between FGM/C and adverse mental health outcomes as the sole research question. Among the included studies, 10 were conducted at the participants' country of origin. The sample size of the populations studied ranged from 3 to 4800 participants. Only one study received a rating of good' methodological quality. Fourteen of the 16 studies reported an association between FGM/C and at least adverse mental health outcome. These included eight studies that reported a higher burden of adverse mental health outcomes among women who underwent FGM compared with women who did not undergo FGM/C. Four studies reported a correlation between the severity of FGM/C and the severity of adverse mental health outcomes.
   Conclusion This systematic review documents an association between FGM/C and adverse mental health outcomes. Importantly, our review demonstrates the need for more rigorous research on the topic.

KW  - PROGRAM
AB  - Trauma informed care (TIC) is a whole system organisational change process which emerged from the seminal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study, establishing a strong graded relationship between the number of childhood adversities experienced and a range of negative outcomes across multiple domains over the life course. To date, there has been no systematic review of organisation-wide implementation initiatives in the child welfare system. As part of a wider cross-system rapid evidence review of the trauma-informed implementation literature using systematic search, screening and review procedures, twenty-one papers reporting on trauma-informed implementation in the child welfare system at state/regional and organisational/agency levels were identified. This paper presents a narrative synthesis of the various implementation strategies and components used across child welfare initiatives, with associated evidence of effectiveness. Training was the TIC implementation component most frequently evaluated with all studies reporting positive impact on staff knowledge, skills and/or confidence. The development of trauma-informed screening processes, and evidence-based treatments/trauma focused services, where evaluated, all produced positive results. Whilst weaknesses in study design often limited generalisability, there was preliminary evidence for the efficacy of trauma-informed approaches in improving the mental and emotional well-being of children served by community-based child welfare services, as well as their potential for reducing caregiver stress and improving placement stability.

AB  - Aim. To provide a review of the clinically relevant evidence pertaining to the use of trazodone in major depressive disorder. Methods. Medline and Cochrane Library searches were searched using the keywords 'trazodone' AND 'depression', to identify the most relevant literature pertinent to the pharmacological properties of trazodone and its use in clinical practice. Articles that were selected included basic pharmacology papers, clinical trials, clinical practice guidelines, and reviews. Related references were cross checked. European and United States prescribing information was reviewed as well. An effort was made to give weight to the information that was most relevant for daily clinical practice. Results. Trazodone is an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that remains innovative and with a favorable profile for the treatment of depression. The appropriate antidepressant doses are usually 150-300 mg/day and are often higher than the doses that are used when trazodone is prescribed to augment the antidepressant effect of another medication, for instance when trazodone is prescribed to address insomnia in a patient treated with an SSRI. Trazodone is usually well tolerated and has a low risk of anticholinergic side effects, weight gain and sexual side effects. Discussion. Trazodone is an established medication that is efficacious for the treatment of a broad array of depressive symptoms, including symptoms that are less likely to respond to other antidepressants (e.g. SSRI), such as insomnia. As an antidepressant, trazodone has proven as efficacious as the tricyclic and second-generation antidepressants and is tolerated relatively well. Trazodone may be helpful for patients with major depression and comorbid insomnia, anxiety or psychomotor agitation. Conclusions. Trazodone is efficacious antidepressants with a relatively low risks of side effects such as weight gain, sexual or anticholinergic effects (such as constipation, urinary retention, dry mouth). In addition to being able to control a wide range of depressive symptoms, trazodone may improve sleep and be particularly helpful for patients whose symptoms of depression include insomnia.

Studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based therapies (MBTs) are successful in reducing psychological distress in patients with anxiety, depressive, and chronic somatic disorders. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of these therapies in MS, PD, and HD patients.
   Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating a CBT or MBT and reporting psychological outcome measures were included. Two separate meta-analyses were performed; one on studies comparing psychological therapy with a treatment as usual or waitiist condition and one on studies with active treatment control conditions.
   Results: The first meta-analysis (N = 12 studies, 8 in MS and 4 in PD populations) showed a significant effect size of g = 0.51 in reducing psychological distress. The second meta-analysis (N = 7 studies, in MS populations) showed a mean effect size of g = 0.36. No RCTs were found in HD populations. The overall quality of the included studies was low and considerable heterogeneity was found. No evidence was found for publication bias.
   Conclusion: CBT and MBTs have a small to moderate effect on reducing psychological distress in patients with PD and MS. However, more research with better methodological quality and larger study samples is warranted, especially in HD patient populations.

AB  - The Yezidis who represent a religious minority living in Northern Iraq were particularly affected by the persecution by ISIS (Islamic state of Iraq and Syria, syn.: ISIL-Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant) that gained power after 2013. This paper gives an overview of the events and the mental health consequences on the Yezidi community as well as associated influences on affected female Yezidis. Based on a systematic literature search, the aspects of Persecution by ISIS and actual situation of the Yezidi community, Gender-specific aspects of the persecution and its consequences, Mental health of the affected women, and Cultural-historical and religious context are worked out. Research indicates a high burden of health strain and mental health problems in the surviving Yezidi women, especially post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) and depression. Concerning transgenerational trauma, the recent genocide has revived past experiences in the history of the community. Like the narrow cultural and religious rules of the community, this can be both a resource and a burden. The actual extent of the attacks is neither predictable for the affected individuals nor for the community, consequences could also be passed onto descendants. Long-term care and support of the affected persons, their descendants, and the Yezidi community seems indispensable.

A systematic review was conducted according to MOOSE guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses of the prevalence of depression were conducted by intervals of time since spousal loss.ResultsThe literature search identified 12,982 studies of which 22 were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Of these, 14 were furthermore eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The summary estimates found in the meta-analysis for the prevalence of depression in the intervals of time since spousal loss were: <= 1month: 38.2% (21.9-55.8%); >1month to 3months: 25.0% (17.3-33.5%); >3months to 6months: 23.1% (18.0-28.7%); >6months to 12months: 19.4% (15.2-24.0%); >12months to 18months: 11.1% (5.3-18.7%); >18months to 24months: 15.2% (12.3-18.2%); >24months to 60months: 10.5% (4.3-18.5%).ConclusionWidowhood is associated with a high prevalence of depression and the study identifies a population group needing special attention in daily clinical practice. The prevalence is highest in the first month of widowhood, however, continues to be high at least 5years into widowhood.

AB  - Background: Workplace violence (WPV) in the health care sector remains a prominent, under-reported global occupational hazard and public health issue.
   Objective: To determine the types and prevalence of WPV among doctors.
   Methods: Primary papers on WPV in medicine were identified through a literature search in 4 health databases (Ovid Medline, EMBASE, PsychoINFO and CINAHL). The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for the mapping and identification of records. To assess the studies included in our review, we used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme cohort review checklist and the Risk of Bias Assessment.
   Results: 13 out of 2154 articles retrieved were reviewed. Factors outlining physician WPV included (1) working in remote health care areas, (2) understaffing, (3) mental/emotional stress of patients/visitors, (4) insufficient security, and (5) lacking preventative measures. The results of 6 studies were combined in a meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of WPV was 69% (95% CI 58% to 78%).
   Conclusion: The impact of WPV on health care institutions is profound and far-reaching; it is quite common among physicians. Therefore, steps must be taken to promote an organizational culture where there are measures to protect and promote the well-being of doctors.

AB  - Objectives: Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases (CCVDs) and mental disorders, including suicide, are prevalent among overworked individuals in Japan. The 2014 legislation regarding the prevention of overwork-related deaths and disorders has accelerated the research in this field and ultimately the implementation of preventive actions.
   Methods: To understand the current problematic situations, the Research Center for Overwork-Related Disorders of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Japan, conducted analyses of compensated claims for overwork-related CCVDs and mental disorders that were recognized from January 2010 to March 2015.
   Results: The majority of CCVD cases were the men in their 50s. Transport and postal activities was the highest risk industry. Cerebrovascular cases were higher than cardiovascular ones. Long working hours was the principal factor for CCVDs. The mental disorder cases comprised approximately 70% men and affected younger age groups (peak in the third decade) with various industries at risk. In men, there was an almost equal number of F3 (Mood [affective] disorders) and F4 (Neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders) diagnoses according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. A larger number of women were diagnosed to have F4. The mental disorder cases were associated not only with long working hours, but also with injuries and disasters as well as interpersonal conflict at work.
   Conclusions: Multiple, simultaneous actions need to be made by employees, employers, researchers, and the authorities to achieve the goal of reducing the number of workers suffering from the overwork-related CCVDs and mental disorders.

AB  - Objective: A systematic review of the literature on the risks of developing iatrogenic opioid use disorders in chronic pain patients with psychiatric comorbidity.
   Methods: We conducted literature searches on Pubmed with key subjects: "chronic pain", "psychiatry", "opioids" and "opioid use disorder" and for original, English written articles published from 2000 until the first of September 2017. Final selection of the articles for review was made in a consensus between three reviewers.
   Results: Longitudinal studies showed a significant association between psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression and anxiety disorders and the development of problematic opioid use, more severe opioid craving and poor opioid treatment outcome (analgesia and side effects) in chronic pain patients. Cross-sectional studies showed a similar association between psychiatric disorders and problematic opioid use, where studies in specialized pain settings showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders, compared to non-specialized settings.
   Conclusions: This systematic review showed a significant association between psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression and anxiety disorders and the development of problematic opioid use in chronic pain patients. We therefore recommend psychiatric screening in chronic pain management. Chronic pain patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders need a multidisciplinary approach and monitoring opioid use is warranted in these patients.

AB  - Background: There is little research on the application of gamification to mental health and well-being. Furthermore, usage of gamification-related terminology is inconsistent. Current applications of gamification for health and well-being have also been critiqued for adopting a behaviorist approach that relies on positive reinforcement and extrinsic motivators.
   Objective: This study aimed to analyze current applications of gamification for mental health and well-being by answering 3 research questions (RQs). RQ1: which gamification elements are most commonly applied to apps and technologies for improving mental health and well-being? RQ2: which mental health and well-being domains are most commonly targeted by these gamified apps and technologies? RQ3: what reasons do researchers give for applying gamification to these apps and technologies? A systematic review of the literature was conducted to answer these questions.
   Methods: We searched ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, IEEE Explore, JMIR, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science for qualifying papers published between the years 2013 and 2018. To answer RQ1 and RQ2, papers were coded for gamification elements and mental health and well-being domains according to existing taxonomies in the game studies and medical literature. During the coding process, it was necessary to adapt our coding frame and revise these taxonomies. Thematic analysis was conducted to answer RQ3.
   Results: The search and screening process identified 70 qualifying papers that collectively reported on 50 apps and technologies. The most commonly observed gamification elements were levels or progress feedback, points or scoring, rewards or prizes, narrative or theme, personalization, and customization; the least commonly observed elements were artificial assistance, unlockable content, social cooperation, exploratory or open-world approach, artificial challenge, and randomness. The most commonly observed mental health and well-being domains were anxiety disorders and well-being, whereas the least commonly observed domains were conduct disorder and bipolar disorders. Researchers' justification for applying gamification to improving mental health and well-being was coded in 59% (41/70) of the papers and was broadly divided into 2 themes: (1) promoting engagement and (2) enhancing an intervention's intended effects.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the current application of gamification to apps and technologies for improving mental health and well-being does not align with the trend of positive reinforcement critiqued in the greater health and well-being literature. We also observed overlap between the most commonly used gamification techniques and existing behavior change frameworks. Results also suggest that the application of gamification is not driven by health behavior change theory, and that many researchers may treat gamification as a black box without consideration for its underlying mechanisms. We call for the inclusion of more comprehensive and explicit descriptions of how gamification is applied and the standardization of applied games terminology within and across fields.

AB  - Background: Non-binary and genderqueer (NBGQ) people are those who do not identify within the gender binary system (male vs. female), not falling exclusively in man/male or woman/female normative categories. A higher proportion of NBGQ people is usually found within young persons. This population is marginalized and, as such, is at risk of stigmatization and of developing negative health outcomes. As literature on the health of NBGQ people is sparse, this study aims at systematically review the limited studies on this field.
   Methods: The research questions which guided the systematic review were: (1) What are the differences in the health levels between NBGQ and binary transgender (BT) individuals? (2) What are the differences in the health levels between NBGQ and cisgender individuals? (3) Which medical and psychological interventions are most suitable for improving NBGQ health? According to PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.
   Results: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for the current systematic review. Among them, 9 were focused on the health differences between NBGQ and BT individuals, 4 of the latter and 1 individually were focused on the health differences between NBGQ and cisgender individuals, and 1 was focused on the evaluation of health outcomes related to medical procedures. No studies assessed psychological interventions aimed at improving health in NBGQ individuals. All studies were cross-sectional, did not generally recruit a large sample of NBGQ individuals, and used non-probability sample design. Results related to the difference in health between NBGQ and BT were mixed; indeed, some found a better health status while others a worse one. Results related to the differences in health between NBGQ and cisgender highlighted higher health needs in NBGQ than in BT individuals. The only study analyzing the effects of medical interventions on health found that NBGQ female-assigned at birth individuals improved their quality of life after chest surgery.
   Conclusions: Although scholars are starting to pay attention to the NBGQ health, research needs to be expanded both in terms of methodology and research contents. Clinical, health-related social policies, and research recommendations in this field are reported.

AB  - Thought control ability is a vulnerability factor implicated in the etiology and maintenance of emotional disorders. This manuscript aims to systematically review the use and psychometric performance of the Thought Control Ability Questionnaire (TCAQ), designed to assess people's ability to control unwanted thoughts. Three electronic databases were searched for papers administering the TCAQ published in indexed peer-reviewed journals. Data (participants characteristics, country, study design, etc.) were extracted from the results for qualitative synthesis. The TCAQ's content validity, dimensionality, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent/divergent validity, floor/ceiling effects, and interpretability were summarized. Two reviewers independently screened articles and assessed quality taking COSMIN criteria into account. Finally, the review included 17 papers. The TCAQ has been administered to healthy individuals, students, and adult patients, in six languages from nine countries. We found that the TCAQ, and its shorter versions, demonstrate robust reliability and adequate content validity. Of interest is the TCAQ's capacity to predict performance in diverse experimental tasks focused on thought control. The TCAQ unidimensionality has been supported in exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Regarding construct validity, the TCAQ is significantly related to a wide range of psychopathological measures of anxiety, worry, depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, etc. However, as only a few of the included studies had a longitudinal design, we are unable to draw firm conclusions about the measure's temporal stability. Moreover, psychometric aspects such as factorial invariance across different samples have not been analyzed. Despite these limitations, based on available psychometric evidence we can recommend using the TCAQ for measuring perceived control of unwanted thoughts.

AB  - Negative affective states are prevalent symptoms in a plethora of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and drug addiction. Dysfunction of mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems has been implicated in negative affective states in neuropsychiatric disorders. The dynorphin/kappa-opioid receptor system is a powerful effector of stress-related behavior and is highly enriched within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. Dysfunction of dynorphin/KOR signaling within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is implicated in promoting symptoms in neuropsychiatric disorders. As such, the kappa-opioid receptor system provides an important therapeutic target to treat negative affective states associated with psychiatric disorders. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the dynorphin/kappa-opioid receptor system and its role in regulating the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, motivation, and emotional behavior. Furthermore, we highlight unresolved issues in the field and offer some insights for future research.

AB  - In the era of the Anthropocene, environmental change is accelerating biodiversity loss across ecosystems on Earth, among which freshwaters are likely the most threatened. Different biodiversity facets in the freshwater realm suffer from various environmental changes that jeopardize the ecosystem functions and services important for humankind. In this work we examine how environmental changes (e.g., climate change, eutrophication, or invasive species) affect trait-based, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of biological communities. We first developed a simple conceptual model of the possible relationships between environmental change and these three diversity facets in freshwaters and, secondly, systematically reviewed articles where these relationships had been investigated in different freshwater ecosystems. Finally, we highlighted research gaps from the perspectives of organisms, ecosystems, stressors, and geographical locations. Our conceptual model suggested that both natural factors and global change operating at various spatial scales influence freshwater community structure and ecosystem functioning. The relationships between biodiversity and environmental change depend on geographical region, organism group, spatial scale, and environmental change gradient length. The systematic review revealed that environmental change impacts biodiversity patterns in freshwaters, but there is no single type of biodiversity response to the observed global changes. Natural stressors had different, even contradictory, effects (i.e., multiple, negative, and positive) on biodiversity compared with anthropogenic stressors. Anthropogenic stressors more often decreased biodiversity, although eutrophication and climate change affected freshwater ecosystems in a complex, more multi-dimensional way. The research gaps we identified were related, for example, to the low number of community-based biodiversity studies, the lack of information on true phylogenies for all freshwater organism groups, the missing evaluations whether species traits are phylogenetically conserved, and the geographical biases in research (i.e., absence of studies from Africa, Southern Asia, and Russia). We hope that our review will stimulate more research on the less well-known facets and topics of biodiversity loss in highly vulnerable freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - ImportanceChildhood maltreatment is associated with mental illness. Researchers, clinicians, and public health professionals use prospective or retrospective measures interchangeably to assess childhood maltreatment, assuming that the 2 measures identify the same individuals. However, this assumption has not been comprehensively tested. ObjectiveTo meta-analyze the agreement between prospective and retrospective measures of childhood maltreatment. Data SourcesMEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and Sociological Abstracts were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language articles from inception through January 1, 2018. Search terms included child* maltreatment, child* abuse, child* neglect, child bull*, child* trauma, child* advers*, and early life stress combined with prospective* and cohort. Study SelectionStudies with prospective measures of childhood maltreatment were first selected. Among the selected studies, those with corresponding retrospective measures of maltreatment were identified. Of 450 studies with prospective measures of childhood maltreatment, 16 had paired retrospective data to compute the Cohen kappa coefficient. Data Extraction and SynthesisMultiple investigators independently extracted data according to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool the results and test predictors of heterogeneity. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was the agreement between prospective and retrospective measures of childhood maltreatment, expressed as a kappa coefficient. Moderators of agreement were selected a priori and included the measure used for prospective or retrospective assessment of childhood maltreatment, age at retrospective report, sample size, sex distribution, and study quality. ResultsSixteen unique studies including 25471 unique participants (52.4% female [SD, 10.6%]; mean [SD] age, 30.6 [11.6] years) contained data on the agreement between prospective and retrospective measures of childhood maltreatment. The agreement between prospective and retrospective measures of childhood maltreatment was poor, with kappa=0.19 (95% CI, 0.14-0.24; P<.001). Agreement was higher when retrospective measures of childhood maltreatment were based on interviews rather than questionnaires (Q=4.1521; df=1; P=.04) and in studies with smaller samples (Q=4.2251; df=1; P=.04). Agreement was not affected by the type of prospective measure used, age at retrospective report, sex distribution of the sample, or study quality. Conclusions and RelevanceProspective and retrospective measures of childhood maltreatment identify different groups of individuals. Therefore, children identified prospectively as having experienced maltreatment may have different risk pathways to mental illness than adults retrospectively reporting childhood maltreatment. Researchers, clinicians, and public health care professionals should recognize these critical measurement differences when conducting research into childhood maltreatment and developing interventions.

A secondary aim is to outline and emphasise key methodological factors in disaster research. Method: Eligible studies were identified following a comprehensive literature search. A quality assessment was undertaken for all included studies. This was followed by methodological and descriptive review. Results: Thirty-one papers measuring psychological distress or mental disorder following the Canterbury earthquakes were identified. These papers reported outcomes from 20 separate studies of which seven were rated high-quality, eight were rated medium and five were rated low-quality. Key methodological findings and outcomes are discussed for each study. Conclusion: The Canterbury earthquakes were associated with widespread but not universal adverse effects on mental health. Disaster research quality is assisted by representative samples, repeated measures, and the use of appropriate controls to allow accurate assessments of psychological consequences to be made.

AB  - We aim to examine the relationship between diabetes and depression risk in longitudinal cohort studies and by how much the incidence of depression in a population would be reduced if diabetes was reduced. Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English-language published literature from January 1990 to December 2017. Longitudinal studies with criteria for depression and self-report doctors' diagnoses or diagnostic blood test measurement of diabetes were assessed. Systematic review with meta-analysis synthesized the results. Study quality, heterogeneity, and publication bias were examined. Pooled odds ratios were calculated using random effects models. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were used to estimate potential preventive impact. Twenty high-quality articles met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The pooled odds ratio (OR) between diabetes and depression was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.18-1.51). For the various study types the ORs were as follows: prospective studies (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.57); retrospective studies (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.62); self-reported diagnosis of diabetes (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17-1.60); and diagnostic diabetes blood test (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). PAFs suggest that over 9.5 million of global depression cases are potentially attributable to diabetes. A 10-25% reduction in diabetes could potentially prevent 930,000 to 2.34 million depression cases worldwide. Our systematic review provides fairly robust evidence to support the hypothesis that diabetes is an independent risk factor for depression while also acknowledging the impact of risk factor reduction, study design and diagnostic measurement of exposure which may inform preventive interventions.

However, there are limited studies that have evaluated the efficacy of TMS for other neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and trauma-related disorders. We reviewed the literature that has evaluated TMS as a treatment for anxiety and trauma-related disorders. Methods We searched for articles published up to December 2017 in Embase, Medline, and ISI Web of Science databases, following the Preferred Items for Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Articles (n = 520) evaluating TMS in anxiety and trauma-related disorders were screened and a small subset of these that met the eligibility criteria (n = 17) were included in the systematic review, of which nine evaluated TMS in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), four in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), two in specific phobia (SP), and two in panic disorder (PD). The meta-analysis was performed with PTSD and GAD since PD and SP had an insufficient number of studies and sample sizes. Results Among anxiety and trauma-related disorders, TMS has been most widely studied as a treatment for PTSD. TMS demonstrated large overall treatment effect for both PTSD (ES = -0.88, 95% CI: -1.42, -0.34) and GAD (ES = -2.06, 95% CI: -2.64, -1.48), including applying high frequency over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Since few studies have evaluated TMS for SP and PD, few conclusions can be drawn. Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that TMS may be an effective treatment for GAD and PTSD.

AB  - The aim of this review is to examine the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on people living with HIV (PLWH) and depression. A literature search from five electronic databases was conducted, and articles published until July 2017 were collected. The inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT that were conducted among PLWH with clinically relevant depression. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 2 was used to obtain pooled results. Seven RCTs, with a total sample size of 388 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Compared with the control group, the CBT group had statistically significant, short-term improvements in depression (g = -0.486, 95% CI [-0.969 to -0.003], P = 0.048). A significant reduction in viral load was also observed at the long-term follow-up (g = -0.306, 95% CI [-0.573 to -0.040], P = 0.024), but no improvements were found in CD4. Results of this meta-analysis showed that CBT is effective in reducing depression symptoms in PLWH with comorbid depression for a short period of time. However, the findings of this review may not be generalized in the clinical field due to the small number of involved studies and the limited study sample. Thus, more robust and adequately powered studies are needed to further explore CBT interventions in PLWH with depression.

AB  - Background: Recently, anhedonia has been recognized as an important Research Domain Criterion (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health. Anhedonia is proposed to play an essential role in the pathogenies of both addictive and mood disorders, and possibly their co-occurrence with a single individual. However, up to now, comprehensive information about anhedonia concerning its underlying neurobiological circuitries, the neurocognitive correlates, and their role in addiction, mood disorder, and comorbidity remains scarce.
   Aim: In this literature review of human studies, we bring together the current state of knowledge with respect to anhedonia in its relationship with disorders in the use of substances (DUS) and the comorbidity with mood disorders.
   Method: A PubMed search was conducted using the following search terms: (Anhedonia OR Reward Deficiency) AND ((Drug Dependence OR Abuse) OR Alcohol OR Nicotine OR Addiction OR Gambling OR (Internet Gaming)). Thirty-two articles were included in the review.
   Results: Anhedonia is associated with substance use disorders, and their severity is especially prominent in DUS with comorbid depression. Anhedonia may be both a trait and a state dimension in its relation to DUS and tends to impact DUS treatment outcome negatively.

AB  - Creative art therapy (CAT) for severe mental illness (SMI) represents an extremely heterogenous body of literature that encompasses the use of a large variety of creative mediums (i.e. visual art, music, dance, drama, writing) in the treatment of mental disorders. The present review provides a narrative summary of the findings on the use of CAT for the selected SMI, being: schizophrenia, trauma-related disorders, major depression, and bipolar disorder. A database search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library was conducted related to the use of CAT in the treatment of mental disorders published between January 2008 and March 2019. A total of 9697 citations were identified to match the search criteria and 86 full-texts were reviewed. Although literature suggests CAT to be a potentially low-risk and high benefit intervention to minimize symptoms and maximize functioning in individuals living with SMI, the lack of methodological rigor, and inconsistency in study methods and outcome measures have prevented the advancement of CAT for use in SMI. Although creation of a single CAT regimen for all psychiatric disorders stands neither practical nor advisable, greater standardization of methods would improve evaluation of CAT interventions. Future research should elucidate biological mechanisms underlying CAT methods.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Mood disorders are highly prevalent and represent a leading cause of global disability. Urbanization holds great public health implications spanning various environmental, lifestyle behavioural, economic and social domains. Underlying risk factors for mood disorders are heterogeneous but the psychiatric literature has extended beyond individual-level risk, to account for population-level environment and social-related precursors to mental ill health. This review summarizes recent studies published since 2017 examining the impact of urbanization and associated environmental, social and lifestyle risks for mood disorders, specifically depression.
   Recent findings
   All identified studies examined depression or subclinical mood-related symptomatology. Recent evidence suggests individuals residing in urban areas experience increased risk of depression. Mechanistic pathways include increased exposure to noise, light and air pollution, poor quality housing, reduced diet quality, physical inactivity, economic strain and diminished social networks. The role of the gut microbiome in the development of mood disorders represents a novel research domain expected to hold potential for the psychiatric and environmental field. Further research is needed to extrapolate the relationship between increased sedentary lifestyles and technology use and depression in urban societies.
   Summary
   Recent evidence highlights the complexity and reciprocity of underlying driving factors in the relationship between urbanization and mood disorders. Future epidemiological research should continue to untangle such complexity. There was a dearth of evidence relating to urbanization and mood disorders other than depression. Future research should identify the unique experiences of vulnerable subgroups who experience disproportionate increased risk of adverse health experiences associated with urbanization.

AB  - The increase in refugees globally since 2010 and the arrival of many into Europe since 2015, around 50% of whom are under 18 years, have been the stimulus to greater investigation and publications regarding their mental health. This clinical review summarises selected themes in the field as described in the published literature since 2016. The themes include refugee statistics, premigration and postmigration experiences, psychopathology focusing on parent-child relationships, unaccompanied refugee minors and associations between resettlement, acculturation and mental health. Some important reviews and studies are discussed that address service and treatment provision. While there has been a recent increase in research in this field, more is needed into the course of psychopathology, protective factors and the promotion of integration into resettlement countries, as well as models of service delivery and treatment effectiveness.

AB  - Objectives: This study was conducted to review the current state of evidence on the association between age of initiation of cannabis use and symptoms of psychosis, depression, or anxiety among youth under 25 years of age.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles published prior to March 2018 by searching OVID MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the references of included studies. We included comparative studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional) that reported on cannabis use in persons <25 years of age (exposure) and symptoms of psychosis, depression, or anxiety (outcome). We narratively synthesized the studies according to design (cohort, etc.) and psychiatric outcome. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias.
   Results: Of the 534 citations identified through the literature search, 23 met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. With psychosis as the outcome, all except one study found that earlier cannabis use was generally associated with higher risks. With depression/anxiety as the outcome, 6 of the 11 included studies reported findings indicating that earlier use of cannabis was linked to higher symptom levels.
   Conclusion: In persons <25 years old, greater cannabis use is associated with more psychological symptoms, especially among those with a predisposition or existing vulnerability to such outcomes (Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine level 3 or 4). Policy makers need to consider the adverse effects of cannabis use in youth when planning a public health approach to cannabis legalization.

AB  - The burnout syndrome is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal achievement. Uncertainty exists about the prevalence of burnout among medical and surgical residents. Associations between burnout and gender, age, specialty, and geographical location of training are unclear. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to quantitatively summarize the global prevalence rates of burnout among residents, by specialty and its contributing factors. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science to identify studies that examined the prevalence of burnout among residents from various specialties and countries. The primary outcome assessed was the aggregate prevalence of burnout among all residents. The random effects model was used to calculate the aggregate prevalence, and heterogeneity was assessed by I-2 statistic and Cochran's Q statistic. We also performed meta-regression and subgroup analysis. The aggregate prevalence of burnout was 51.0% (95% CI: 45.0-57.0%, I-2 = 97%) in 22,778 residents. Meta-regression found that the mean age (beta = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.28-0.40, p < 0.001) and the proportion of males (beta = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.10-0.69, p = 0.009) were significant moderators. Subgroup analysis by specialty showed that radiology (77.16%, 95% CI: 5.99-99.45), neurology (71.93%, 95% CI: 65.78-77.39), and general surgery (58.39%, 95% CI: 45.72-70.04) were the top three specialties with the highest prevalence of burnout. In contrast, psychiatry (42.05%, 95% CI: 33.09-51.58), oncology (38.36%, 95% CI: 32.69-44.37), and family medicine (35.97%, 95% CI: 13.89-66.18) had the lowest prevalence of burnout. Subgroup analysis also found that the prevalence of burnout in several Asian countries was 57.18% (95% CI: 45.8-67.85); in several European countries it was 27.72% (95% CI: 17.4-41.11) and in North America it was 51.64% (46.96-56.28). Our findings suggest a high prevalence of burnout among medical and surgical residents. Older and male residents suffered more than their respective counterparts.

AB  - Background: Patients with cancer frequently experience neuropsychiatric symptoms due to their medical illness or its treatment. In recent decades, psychiatrists have become increasingly involved in the care of patients with cancer. However, psychiatrists may be less familiar with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a distinct cancer treatment modality associated with multiple neuropsychiatric sequelae. Objective: To provide an overview of HSCT, and describe the prevalence, impact, risk factors, and suggested management of psychiatric consequences of HSCT. Methods: We performed literature searches in PubMed and PsychInfo to identify articles describing neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, anxiety, distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, delirium and cognitive impairment, resulting from HSCT in adults. Those articles most relevant to this manuscript were included. Results: Psychiatrists may be involved in the treatment of patients before, during, or after inpatient hospitalization for HSCT. Each phase of treatment introduces unique stressors that may lead to or exacerbate psychiatric disorders. Appropriate management requires evaluation of HSCT-related medications, an understanding of the impact of complications from HSCT, and consideration of how the patient's underlying medical condition should influence psychiatric recommendations. Conclusion: To optimize patient outcomes, consulting psychiatrists should be familiar with the basic principles of HSCT, and the neuropsychiatric sequelae that may result from treatment. Further research is needed to identify strategies to manage psychiatric complications in this unique population.

AB  - BackgroundAlthough the number of studies examining the relationships between sedentary behaviors (SB) and anxiety is growing, an overarching evidence, taking into account children, adolescents, and adults as well as different types of SB and different categories of anxiety outcomes, is still missing. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at obtaining a comprehensive overview of existing evidence.MethodsA search in the following databases: PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Academic Search Complete, ERIC, HealthSource: Nursing/Academic Edition and MEDLINE, resulted in k=31 original studies included in the systematic review (total N=99,192) and k=17 (total N=27,443) included in the meta-analysis. Main inclusion criteria referred to testing the SB--anxiety relationship, the quality score (above the threshold of 65%), and the language of publications (English). The study was following the PRISMA statement and was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42017068517).ResultsBoth the systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that overall average effects were small: higher levels of symptoms of anxiety were associated with higher levels of SB (weighted r=.093, 95% CI [.055, .130], p<.001). Moderator analyses indicatedthat trends for stronger effects were observed among adults, compared to children/adolescents (p=.085).ConclusionsFurther longitudinal studies are necessary to elucidate the predictive direction of the anxietySB relationship and to clarify whether the effects depend on the type of anxiety indicators.

AB  - People with higher levels of emotional intelligence (EI: adaptive emotional traits, skills, and abilities) typically achieve more positive life outcomes, such as psychological wellbeing, educational attainment, and job-related success. Although the underpinning mechanisms linking EI with those outcomes are largely unknown, it has been suggested that EI may work as a "stress buffer." Theoretically, when faced with a stressful situation, emotionally intelligent individuals should show a more adaptive response than those with low EI, such as reduced reactivity (less mood deterioration, less physiological arousal), and faster recovery once the threat has passed. A growing number of studies have begun to investigate that hypothesis in respect to EI measured as both an ability (AEI) and trait (TEI), but results are unclear. To test the "stress-buffering" function of EI, we systematically reviewed experimental studies that explored the relationship between both types of EI and acute stress reactivity or recovery. By searching four databases, we identified 45 eligible studies. Results indicated that EI was only adaptive in certain contexts, and that findings differed according to stressor type, and how EI was measured. In terms of stress reactivity, TEI related to less mood deterioration during sports-based stressors (e.g., competitions), physical discomfort (e.g., dental procedure), and cognitive stressors (e.g., memory tasks), but did not appear as helpful in other contexts (e.g., public speaking). Furthermore, effects of TEI on physiological stress responses, such as heart rate, were inconsistent. Effects of AEI on subjective and objective stress reactivity were often non-significant, with high levels detrimental in some cases. However, data suggest that both higher AEI and TEI relate to faster recovery from acute stress. In conclusion, results provide mixed support for the stress-buffering effect of EI. Limitations and quality of studies are also discussed. Findings could have implications for EI training programmes.

AB  - Modern scientific theories of emotional behavior, almost without exception, trace their origin to Charles Darwin, and his publications On the Origin of Species (1859) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). The most famous dilemma Darwin acknowledged as a challenge to his theory of evolution through natural selection was the incomplete Sub-Cambrian fossil record. However, Darwin struggled with two other rarely referenced theoretical and scientific dilemmas that confounded his theories about emotional behavior. These included (1) the origin of social instincts (e.g., altruism, empathy, reciprocity and cooperation) and the reasons for their conservation in evolution and (2) the peripheral control of heart rate vis-a-vis emotional behavior outside of consciousness. Darwin acknowledged that social instincts are critical to the survival of some species, but had difficulty aligning them with his theory of natural selection in humans. Darwin eventually proposed that heart rate and emotions are controlled via one's intellect and cortical mechanisms, and that instinctive behavior is genetically programmed and inherited. Despite ongoing efforts, these two theoretical dilemmas are debated to this day. Simple testable hypotheses have yet to emerge for the biological mechanisms underlying instinctive behavior or the way heart rate is controlled in infants. In this paper, we review attempts to resolve these issues over the past 160 years. We posit that research and theories that supported Darwin's individualistic brain-centric and genetic model have become an "orthodox" Western view of emotional behavior, one that produced the prevailing behavioral construct of attachment as developed by John Bowlby. We trace research and theories that challenged this orthodoxy at various times, and show how these challenges were repeatedly overlooked, rejected, or misinterpreted. We review two new testable theories, emotional connection theory and calming cycle theory, which we argue resolve the two dilemmas We show emerging scientific evidence from physiology and a wide variety of other fields, as well from clinical trials among prematurely born infants, that supports the two theories. Clinical implications of the new theories and possible new ways to assess risk and intervene in emotional, behavioral and developmental disorders are discussed.

AB  - To identify the impact of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) domains compared with the results of healthy controls by systematically reviewing the literature. A systematic literature search was performed on MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE until April, 2018 to obtain eligible studies reporting mean and standard deviation scores for each domain of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) in SLE patients and healthy controls. Random effect model was performed to summarize the scores of each domain. The forest plot was used to compare the scores of SLE patients with healthy controls. Review Manager (version 5.3) was adopted in the meta-analysis. In all, 13 studies were included in the work, including 1279 SLE patients and 1466 healthy controls. Compared with controls, patients with SLE had lower scores in all SF-36 dimensions (physical function, physical role function, body pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role function, mental health), especially in the physical role function. SLE does impair HRQoL to varying degrees. It is indispensable to measure and assess HRQoL of SLE patients regularly, which contributes to formulate targeted interventions appropriately and provide effective ways of management of the disease positively.

AB  - Perinatal depression is common and can have deleterious effects on mothers, infants, children, partners, and families. Despite this, few women who screen positive for depression receive psychiatric treatment. A comprehensive perinatal depression care pathway includes: (1) screening, (2) assessment, (3) triage and referral, (4) treatment access, (5) treatment initiation, (6) symptom monitoring, and (7) adaptation of treatment based on measurement until symptoms remit. This depression care pathway provides a scaffold on which to frame the challenges encountered when, and the opportunities that exist for, addressing depression in obstetric settings. Comprehensive interventions that address each step on the care pathway are needed to support obstetric practices in providing high-quality, evidence-based, effective treatment including pro-active follow-up for depression management. Despite recent attention being brought to, and significant progress in the field of maternal mental health, gaps in care persist. Ultimately, depression care needs to be fully integrated into obstetric care. Additionally, more targeted maternal mental health support and structure are needed for integration to occur and ultimately be optimized. Specific areas requiring more attention include consistency of screening, evaluation of patients with a positive depression screen for bipolar disorder, anxiety or substance use disorders, and monitoring of symptom improvement.

This review serves to take stock of what is known now about the genetics of depression, how it has increased our knowledge and understanding of its mechanisms, and how the information and knowledge can be leveraged to improve the care of people affected. We identify four priorities for how the field of MD genetics research may move forward in future years, namely by increasing the sample sizes available for genome-wide association studies (GWASs), greater inclusion of diverse ancestries and low-income countries, the closer integration of psychiatric genetics with electronicmedical records, and the development of the neuroscience toolkit for polygenic disorders.

AB  - Background and objectives: Unspecific and broad associations between adverse life events exposure and PNES and PTSD have been reported in the literature. This review aimed to explore the differences in the effect of psychogenic trauma or the cumulative effects of multi psychogenic traumas in PTSD and PNES on the memory neuronal subsystems (using evidence from functional neuroimaging studies and animal models), which could have consequences on the constellation of PNES and PTSD symptomatology.
   Method: The author performed a non-systematic review of the literature. Midline was searched using relevant terms and list of references for certain articles were reviewed as well. Key articles and conclusion from systemic reviews and meta-analysis papers were included.
   Results: Evidence from neuroimaging studies show that PNES patients exhibited increased resting-state functional activity and alterations in functional connectivity in tier 4-5 memory subsystems that are involved in appraising distant and complex contextual and social threats, such as the frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, cingulate gyrus, insula, and the default-mode network, while neuroimaging studies and animal models in PTSD revealed hypoactive tier 4-5 memory subsystems (volumetric reduction in the hippocampi and the anterior cingulate cortex, with hypoactive prefrontal areas) and hyperactive tier 1-3 memory subsystems (ventral tegmentum, dorsal and ventral striatum, and amygdala), which deals with close and imminent physical threats.
   Conclusion: Inferences can be made that the effect of a psychogenic trauma will differ according to the way the brain analyses the trauma which might determine the cluster of PNES and PTSD symptomology.

AB  - Stigma and self-stigma are major issues for people with Serious Mental Illness (SMI). This review's aims were to determine the cognitive and neural processes underlying the effects of stigma and social rejection in people with SMI.
   A stepwise systematic literature review (PRISMA) was conducted by searching PubMed, Medline and Web of Science using the following keywords: "cyberball" OR "stereotype threat" OR "implicit association test" AND "mental illness". The articles included met the following criteria: (a) reporting on social rejection, stigma or self-stigma (b) diagnosis of SMI (c) available data on the underlying mechanisms.
   Our search on July 31th 2018 found in 955 articles on PubMed and 3,362 on Web of Science. Hypersensitivity to acute social rejection was found and associated with more self-related negative emotions and more dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies. People with SMI under-performed in cognitive tasks when confronted with stigma. Stigma resistance was described with its neural correlates. Psychiatric symptoms, duration of illness and baseline non-specific distress influenced the response to acute social rejection or stigma. The samples, methods, and reported outcomes were heterogeneous and difficult to compare. Future studies should investigate the associations between self-stigma and responses to acute and chronic social rejection.

AB  - Meningioma is a slow-growing benign tumor arising from meninges and is usually asymptomatic. Though neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in patients with brain tumors, they often can be the only manifestation in cases of meningioma. Meningiomas might present with mood symptoms, psychosis, memory disturbances, personality changes, anxiety, or anorexia nervosa. The diagnosis of meningioma could be delayed where only psychiatric symptoms are seen. A comprehensive review of the literature and individual patient data analysis was conducted, which included all case reports, and case series on meningioma and psychiatric symptoms fill September 2018 with the search terms "meningioma" and "psychiatric symptoms/ depression/ bipolar disorder/ mania/ psychosis/ obsessive-compulsive disorder". Search engines used included PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane database and Google Scholar. Studies reported varied psychiatric symptoms in cases with meningioma of differing tumor site, size and lateralization. Factors which led to a neuroimaging work-up included the occurrence of sudden new or atypical psychiatric symptoms, a lack of response to typical line of treatment and the presence of neurological signs or symptoms such as headache, seizures, diplopia, urinary incontinence etc. This review emphasizes on the need of neurological examination and neuroimaging in the patients presenting to psychiatry especially with atypical symptoms.

AB  - Background: Hoarding is a disorder characterized by excessive acquisition and persistent difficulty in discarding possessions. The behaviour has adverse emotional, physical, social, financial, and legal outcomes for the person with the disorder and family members, and might pose a significant public health problem. Hoarding has been included as a distinct disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth edition (DSM-5). The prevalence of hoarding disorder is approximately 2-6% globally. The current state of the evidence does not offer clear understanding of the causes of hoarding behaviours. A systematic review of the extant literature was carried out to determine the possible causal factors of hoarding behaviours.
   Methods: This review is conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. The following electronic databases: Medline through Ovid, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched for relevant articles published between January 2000 and November 2018. Only articles published in English language were included. Two reviewers independently scrutinized the studies and included them in this review.
   Results: Our search strategy returned a total of 396 references. Preliminary findings suggest that individuals with hoarding behaviours may have a genetic susceptibility; abnormal neural activity in the fronto-temporal, para-hippocampal gyrus and insular parts of the brain has also been identified. Traumatic life experiences have also been posited to predispose individuals to hoard.
   Conclusion: Although the understanding of hoarding disorder hasgrown in recent years, greater efforts are still needed to clarify the etiology and mechanisms of hoarding disorder as these may help in planning of more holistic interventions to treat the problem.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing a joint methodology for estimating the national and global work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO joint methodology), with contributions from a large network of experts. In this paper, we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from depression attributable to exposure to long working hours, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint methodology.
   Objectives: We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to long working hours (Systematic Review 1) and systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of long working hours on depression (Systematic Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing framework, conducting both systematic reviews in tandem and in a harmonized way.
   Data sources: Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsycINFO. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional experts.
   Study eligibility and criteria: We will include working-age (>= 15 years) participants in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but exclude child workers (< 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative prevalence studies of relevant levels of occupational exposure to long working hours (i.e. 35-40, 41-48, 49-54 and >= 55 h/week) stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, in the years 2005-2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of relevant level(s) of long working hours on the incidence of or mortality due to depression, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. 35-40 h/week).
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2.

AB  - Depression is the most common mental disorder in pregnancy. An important risk factor in the development of prenatal depression is lifetime history of abuse. The current review quantitatively synthesized research on the association between history of abuse and prenatal depressive symptoms using a meta-analytic technique. A total of 3322 articles were identified through electronic searches of the following databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE Cochrane Collaboration databases between the years of 1980 and 2016. All were independently screened against the following inclusion criteria: articles reporting on original data that included measures of prenatal depression and abuse. Data were extracted by the first and second authors. Descriptive analyses were conducted using Excel version 15.32, and all analyses involving effect sizes were conducted using comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) version 3.0. Seventy articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analyses. Meta-bias detected no publication bias. Abuse had a significant positive relation with prenatal depressive symptoms, with effect sizes in the moderate range for any abuse =0.340; Cohen 1969. Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences. Academic Press, New York). The meta-analyses found a robust relation between abuse and prenatal depressive symptoms holding across a variety of demographic and study design characteristics. These results reinforce the established association between trauma victimization and subsequent psychopathology, extending current knowledge to specifically address the under-studied area of prenatal depression. These findings highlight the need for women who have survived child or adulthood abuse to receive appropriate referral and psychological treatment to mitigate their risk for prenatal depression.

AB  - Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles of endocytic origin, which are released by cells and are accessible in biofluids, such as saliva, urine, and plasma. These vesicles are enriched with small RNA, and they play a role in many physiological processes. In the brain, they are involved in processes including synaptic plasticity, neuronal stress response, cell-to-cell communication and neurogenesis. While exosomes have been implicated previously in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, research regarding their role in mental disorders remains scarce. Given their functional significance in the brain, investigation in this field is warranted. Additionally, because exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier, they may serve as accessible biomarkers of neural dysfunction. Studying exosomes may provide information towards diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, and specifically those derived from the brain may provide a mechanistic view of the disease phenotype. This review will discuss the roles of exosomes in the brain, and relate novel findings to current insights into mental disorders.

AB  - Background: An estimated 30% of women worldwide experience intimate partner violence (IPV) during their lifetime. Exposure to IPV is associated with poor health outcomes and the prevalence of violence may be higher amongst women seeking healthcare. Existing evidence from the Arab region is limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence and health outcomes of domestic violence (IPV or violence from a family member) in clinical populations in Arab countries.
   Methods: Using terms related to domestic violence, Arab countries, and date limit >= year 2000, we searched seven databases: Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science: core collection, IBSS, Westlaw, IMEMR. We included observational studies reporting estimates of prevalence or health outcomes of domestic violence amongst women aged >= 15 years, recruited while accessing healthcare in Arab countries. Studies that collected data on/after 1st January 2000 and were published in English, Arabic or French were included. Title/abstract screening, full text screening, quality assessment and data extraction were carried out. Extracted data were summarised and meta-analysis was performed where appropriate.
   Results: 6341 papers were screened and 41 papers (29 studies) met inclusion criteria. Total 19,101 participants from 10 countries were represented in the data. Meta-analysis produced pooled prevalence estimates of lifetime exposure to any type of IPV of 73.3% (95% CI 64.1-81.6), physical IPV 35.6% (95% CI 24.4-47.5), sexual IPV 22% (95% CI 13.3-32) and emotional/psychological IPV 49.8% (95% CI 37.3-62.3). Domestic violence (IPV or family violence) exposure was associated with increased odds of adverse health outcomes: depression OR 3.3 (95% CI 1.7-6.4), sleep problems OR 3.2 (95% CI 1.5-6.8), abortion OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.2-10.2), pain OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.6-4.1) and hypertension OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.0).
   Conclusions: Domestic violence is common amongst women seeking healthcare in Arab countries. Exposure to domestic violence is associated with several poor health outcomes. Further research into domestic violence in the Arab world is required.

AB  - Until recently, therapeutic development in psychiatry was targeted solely toward symptom reduction. While this is a worthwhile goal, it has yielded little progress in improved therapeutics in the last several decades in the field of mood disorders. Recent advancements in our understanding of pathophysiology suggests that an impairment of neuro-plasticity may be a critical part of the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Interventions that enhance or modulate neuroplasticity often reduce depressive symptoms when applied as stand-alone treatments. Unfortunately, when treatments are discontinued, the disease state often returns as patients relapse. However, treatments that enhance or modulate plasticity not only reduce symptom burden, but also may provide an opportune window wherein cognitive or behavioral interventions could be introduced to harness a state of enhanced neuroplasticity and lead to improved longer-term clinical outcomes. Here, we review the potential of synergistically combining plasticity-enhancing and behavioral therapies to develop novel translational treatment approaches for depression. After reviewing relevant neuroplasticity deficits in depression, we survey biological treatments that appear to reverse such deficits in humans, including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulators (ketamine, D-cycloserine), electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial brain stimulation. We then review evidence that either directly or indirectly supports the hypothesis that a robust enhancement of neuroplasticity through these methods might promote the uptake of cognitive and behavioral interventions to enhance longer-term treatment outcomes through a synergistic effect. We identify key missing pieces of evidence and discuss future directions to enhance this emerging line of research.

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance consumption commonly co-occur in victims of sexual assault. Substance consumption can occur pre-andi/or post-assault. Pre-assault substance consumption may have an impact on the subsequent development of PTSD. This review aims to provide an overview of current understanding of the effects of acute substance intoxication and chronic pre-assault problematic substance use on symptoms of PTSD amongst individuals who were victims of sexual assault.
   Methods: PsycINFO, EMBASE, and MEDLINE were searched using terms related to PTSD, sexual assault, and substance consumption. These yielded 2,121 articles, 268 of which were retrieved for more detailed evaluation and 13 of these met inclusion criteria and were appraised in full.
   Results: Overall, the reviewed papers supported our hypothesis that acute substance intoxication and chronic pre-assault problematic substance use are associated with fewer initial PTSD symptoms but less improvement over time, resulting in slower overall PTSD recovery. They also highlighted post-assault characterological self-blame and negative social reactions as mediators of recovery in the context of pre-assault substance consumption.
   Conclusions: Acute substance intoxication and chronic pre-assault problematic substance use appear to have an impact on the development of PTSD symptoms amongst victims of sexual assault. The importance of developing early interventions and routine screening and assessment for PTSD and pre-assault substance consumption is emphasized. The limited research on male victims and on substances other than alcohol is highlighted.

AB  - Introduction: The co-occurrence of bipolar disorder (BD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) seemed to be a poor prognostic factor associated with greater disability, lower social and occupational functioning, poorer treatment response, and higher suicidal ideas and attempts compared to BD patients. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted on the risk of suicide in BD-OCD patients compared to BD patients. Relevant papers published through August 2018 were identified searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. Results: In all cases, diagnoses were according to the standard Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criteria and were established using validated assessment scales. More than 80% of the selected studies presented higher rates of history of suicide attempts and lifetime depressive episodes in BD-OCD patients compared to non-comorbid patients. Conclusions: Osler's view that medicine should be a treatment of diseases, not of symptoms, is consistent with the approach of mood stabilization as the first objective in apparent BD-OCD patients, as opposed to immediate treatment with antidepressants. In line with that, especially in comorbid patients, lithium may be preferred because of its proven anti-suicidal effect.

AB  - Objective: The burden of HIV infection is higher in Africa where 70% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) resides. Since depression can negatively impact the course of HIV infection, it is therefore important to accurately estimate its burden among PLHIV in the continent.
   Methods: We searched multiple databases to identify articles published between January 2000 and February 2018, reporting the prevalence of (major) depressive disorders in PLHIV residing in Africa. We used a randomeffects meta-analysis model to pool studies.
   Results: Overall, 118 studies (60,476 participants, 19 countries) were included. There was no publication bias. The overall prevalence estimates of depressive disorders and probable major depressive disorders were 36.5% (95% CI 32.3-41.0; 101 studies) and 14.9% (12.1-17.9; 55 studies) respectively. The heterogeneity of the overall prevalence of depressive disorders was significantly explained by screening tool used, period (higher prevalence in recent studies) and distribution in sub-regions. The study setting, site, CD4 cell counts, age, sex, proportion of people with undetectable viral load were not sources of heterogeneity.
   Conclusions: This study shows that more than one third of PLHIV face depressive disorders and half of them having major form, with heterogeneous distribution in the continent. As such, depressive disorders deserve more attention from HIV healthcare providers for improved detection and overall proper management.

AB  - Clinical research across the developmental spectrum increasingly reveals the nuanced ways in which emotion and cognition can work to either support or derail rational (i.e., healthy or goal-consistent) decision making. However, psychological theories offer discrepant views on how these processes interact, and on whether emotion is helpful or harmful to rational decision making. In order to translate theoretical predictions from basic psychology to clinical research, an understanding of theoretical perspectives on emotion and cognition, as informed by experimental psychology, is needed. Here, I review the ways in which dual-process theories have incorporated emotion into the process of decision making, discussing how they account for both positive and negative influences. I first describe seven theoretical perspectives that make explicit assumptions and predictions about the interaction between emotion and cognition: affect as information, the affect heuristic, risk as feelings, hot versus cool cognition, the somatic parker hypothesis, prospect theory, and fuzzy-trace theory. I then discuss the conditions under which each theoretical perspective conceptualizes emotion as beneficial or harmful to decision making, providing examples from research on psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background An increased prevalence of common mental disorders and suicide has been reported among physicians worldwide. We aimed to assess which, if any, interventions are effective at reducing or preventing symptoms of common mental health disorders or suicidality in physicians.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL (database inception to March 26, 2018), reference lists of included studies, and additional sources were systematically searched and screened by two independent reviewers. We included randomised controlled studies or controlled before after studies of interventions to reduce depression, anxiety, or suicidality in physicians, as assessed by a validated outcome measure. Both organisation-level and physician-directed interventions were considered. Our primary outcome was differences in symptoms of common mental health disorders following intervention. We used random-effects modelling for the main meta-analyses and planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091646.
   Findings We identified 2992 articles for screening, of which eight were included in the systematic review (n=1023 physicians) and seven in the meta-analysis. Results indicated a moderate effect in favour of the physician directed interventions for reduction in symptoms of common mental health disorders (standardised mean difference 0.62; 95% CI 0.40-0.83; p<0.0001). Separate analyses showed physician-directed interventions resulted in reductions of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidality. No evidence of significant heterogeneity was found (Q=3.78; p=0.44).
   Interpretation Physician-directed interventions are associated with small reductions in symptoms of common mental health disorders among physicians. Research regarding organisational interventions aimed at improving physicians' mental health via modification of the work environment is urgently needed. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and the efficacy of the available anxiolytic drugs is less than desired. Adverse effects also compromise patient quality of life and adherence to treatment. Accumulating evidence shows that the pathophysiology of anxiety and related disorders is multifactorial, involving oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and glutamatergic dysfunction. The aim of this review was to evaluate data from animal studies and clinical trials showing the anxiolytic effects of agents whose mechanisms of action target these multiple domains.
   Methods: The PubMed database was searched for multitarget agents that had been evaluated in animal models of anxiety, as well as randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials of anxiety and/or anxiety related disorders.
   Results: The main multitarget agents that have shown consistent anxiolytic effects in various animal models of anxiety, as well in clinical trials, are agomelatine, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and omega-3 fatty acids. Data from clinical trials are preliminary at best, but reveal good safety profiles and tolerance to adverse effects.
   Conclusion: Agomelatine, NAC and omega-3 fatty acids show beneficial effects in clinical conditions where mainstream treatments are ineffective. These three multitarget agents are considered promising candidates for innovative, effective, and better-tolerated anxiolytics.

AB  - Survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) often develop chronic neurological, neurocognitive, psychological, and psychosocial deficits that can have a profound impact on an individual's wellbeing and quality of life. TBI is also a common cause of acquired epilepsy, which is itself associated with significant behavioral morbidity. This review considers the clinical and preclinical evidence that post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) acts as a 'second-hit' insult to worsen chronic behavioral outcomes for brain-injured patients, across the domains of emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. Surprisingly, few well-designed studies have specifically examined the relationship between seizures and behavioral outcomes after TBI. The complex mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remain incompletely understood, although many of the biological processes that precipitate seizure occurrence and epileptogenesis may also contribute to the development of chronic behavioral deficits. Further, the relationship between PTE and behavioral dysfunction is increasingly recognized to be a bidirectional one, whereby premorbid conditions are a risk factor for PTE. Clinical studies in this arena are often challenged by the confounding effects of anti-seizure medications, while preclinical studies have rarely examined an adequately extended time course to fully capture the time course of epilepsy development after a TBI. To drive the field forward towards improved treatment strategies, it is imperative that both seizures and neurobehavioral outcomes are assessed in parallel after TBI, both in patient populations and preclinical models.

AB  - Background Depression and anxiety are prevalent disorders and are often treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Infertility is also common among couples, and rates of depression and anxiety are elevated in this population, but the impact of SSRIs on fertility has received modest attention. This review explores the literature available on SSRIs, fertility, and infertility-treatment outcomes to assist clinicians in better counseling their patients. Methods A literature search was performed using the search terms infertility, fertility, antidepressants, and SSRIs to identify studies that investigated the relationship between SSRI use and fertility or infertility-treatment outcomes. Results Twenty relevant articles were identified, 16 of which were original research studies. The studies varied in design, quality, and outcome measures, limiting meta-analysis. The prevalence of antidepressant use ranged from 3.5%-10% in reproductive-age women, with infertile populations reporting less use. The two studies examining the impact of SSRIs in fertile women had conflicting results. Six of the seven studies in infertility patients found no significant association between SSRIs and treatment outcomes; three observed a trend, however, toward reduced fecundability or negatively influenced fertility biomarkers. One study found treatment increased pregnancy rates. In males, most studies were of relatively poor quality, though six of the seven studies found SSRIs to have an adverse effect on semen parameters. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence at present to propose that SSRIs reduce fertility or influence infertility-treatment outcomes. SSRIs may have an adverse impact on sperm quality, but further research is warranted.

AB  - Purpose of review
   About one in 650-1000 children is born with an extra X or Y chromosome, referred to as sex chromosome trisomies (SCTs). Studying SCTs may uncover unique insights in neurodevelopmental pathways underlying the risk for neurobehavioral problems and psychopathology. There is also a clinical need for more knowledge about the phenotype of SCT with the recent introduction of noninvasive prenatal screening.
   Recent findings
   The reviewed studies illustrate an increased vulnerability for psychopathology such as (symptoms of) autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression and, to a lesser degree, psychotic disorders. Although traditionally the primary focus has been on language and learning problems, recent research suggests that impairments in executive functioning, social cognition and emotion regulation may also be key factors underlying the risk for neurobehavioral problems.
   Summary
   The research field of SCT is in need of a more longitudinal perspective to identify early markers of ` at risk' development, and to assess the effectiveness of early interventions. Neurocognitive markers that signal compromised neurodevelopment may prove to be helpful in this. Variability in the SCT phenotype provides a unique opportunity to identify not only genetic but also environmental factors that shape neurodevelopmental outcome, calling for studies focused on understanding individual differences.

AB  - The terrestrial lizard Podarcis siculus is the most abundant reptile in Italy, where is considered a ubiquitous species. This lizard is widely distributed from the islands to the Apennines, from cultivated fields to anthropized areas such as gardens and city parks. For this reason, these animals are exposed to extensive physical and chemical stresses, as well as to the possibility of coming into contact with industrial pollutants and substances used in agricultural practices. Here, we review the health status of lizard specimens inhabiting natural non-anthropized areas and fields devoted to organic farming, considering the condition of (1) liver, representing the main detoxifying organ, directly influenced by feeding, and (2) gonads, essential for reproduction and, therefore, for the survival of the species. The morphological and biomolecular condition of these organs was then compared with those obtained from lizard specimens experimentally treated with nonylphenol, a co-formulant of many insecticides and plant protection products widely used in conventional farming, known to have harmful estrogenic effects. Taken together, data demonstrate that lizards inhabiting manured soil are in good health status and show a regular morphology of liver, testis, and ovary. Animals are found to be less exposed to the toxic heavy metals cadmium and lead if compared with specimens collected in areas not devoted to agriculture, but probably more exposed to vehicular traffic. However, manure, as well as nonylphenol, exerts a xeno-estrogenic effect, particularly evident in male specimens, more sensitive to estrogenic contamination. (C) 2019 Academie des sciences.

AB  - Background: Mobile Therapeutic Attention for Patients with Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (m-RESIST) is an EU Horizon 2020-funded project aimed at designing and validating an innovative therapeutic program for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The program exploits information from mobile phones and wearable sensors for behavioral tracking to support intervention administration.
   Objective: To systematically review original studies on sensor-based mHealth apps aimed at uncovering associations between sensor data and symptoms of psychiatric disorders in order to support the m-RESIST approach to assess effectiveness of behavioral monitoring in therapy.
   Methods: A systematic review of the English-language literature, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, was performed through Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. Studies published between September 1, 2009, and September 30, 2018, were selected. Boolean search operators with an iterative combination of search terms were applied.
   Results: Studies reporting quantitative information on data collected from mobile use and/or wearable sensors, and where that information was associated with clinical outcomes, were included. A total of 35 studies were identified; most of them investigated bipolar disorders, depression, depression symptoms, stress, and symptoms of stress, while only a few studies addressed persons with schizophrenia. The data from sensors were associated with symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and depression.
   Conclusions: Although the data from sensors demonstrated an association with the symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and depression, their usability in clinical settings to support therapeutic intervention is not yet fully assessed and needs to be scrutinized more thoroughly.

AB  - Considerably less attention has been paid to psychological and social sequelae of concussion in youth athletes compared with neurocognitive outcomes. This narrative review consolidates the literature on postconcussive emotional and psychosocial functioning in school-aged children and adolescents, highlighting athlete-specific findings. MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were queried for pediatric concussion studies examining psychological and/or social outcomes, and 604 studies met search criteria (11 of those specific to sport). Results were organized into domains: emotional and social dysfunction, behavioral problems, academic difficulties, sleep disturbance, headache, and quality of life. The small body of literature regarding psychological and social issues following pediatric concussion suggests behavioral disturbances at least temporarily disrupt daily life. Extrapolation from samples of athletes and nonathletes indicates postconcussive anxiety and depressive symptoms appear, although levels may be subclinical. Social and academic findings were less clear. Future well-controlled and adequately powered research will be essential to anticipate concussed athletes' psychosocial needs.

AB  - Background: Suicidal behavior is a major public health concern worldwide, and the interest in the development of novel and more efficient treatment strategies and therapies to reduce suicidal risk is increasing. Some recent studies have summarized the results of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of psychotherapeutic tools designed to treat patients at suicidal risk. However, observational studies, which reflect real-world effectiveness and may use original approaches, have not been reviewed.
   Method: The aim of this study is to systematically review the available scientific evidence issued from observational studies on the clinical effectiveness of psychotherapeutic tools designed to treat patients at suicide risk. We have thus performed a systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science databases.
   Results: Out of 1578 papers, 40 original observational studies fulfilled our selection criteria. The most used psychotherapeutic treatments were dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT, 27.5%) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, 15.0%) in patients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (32.5%) and depression (15.0%). Despite the between-study heterogeneity, interventions lead to a reduction in suicidal outcomes, i.e., suicidal ideation (55.0%) and suicide attempts (37.5%). The content and reporting quality varied considerably between the studies.
   Conclusion: DBT and CBT are the most widely used psychotherapeutic interventions and show promising results in existing observational studies. Some of the included studies provide innovative approaches. Group therapies and internet-based therapies, which are cost-effective methods, are promising treatments and would need further study.

AB  - Despite the abundance of research investigating the associations between maternal depressive symptoms (MDS) and children's cognitive development, little is known about the putative mechanisms through which depressive symptoms are associated with children's cognitive development. The aim of this review was to summarize the literature on family mediators (i.e., maternal parenting behaviors, mother-child interactions, and family stress) involved in this association in early childhood. The review includes seven studies, five longitudinal and two cross-sectional, which tested putative mediators of the association between MDS and children's cognitive development. Studies were selected from online databases (PubMed, PsycNet) and manual searches. Only studies which quantitatively assessed associations between MDS in the postnatal period and child cognitive development in early childhood (i.e., 0-5years) and included mediator variables were included in the review. Six out of seven studies identified mediating variables. The mediators included maternal responsiveness, parenting style, family dysfunction, the quality of the home environment, and maternal caregiving practices. Different mediators were identified across the reviewed studies. Maternal depressive symptoms are partly associated with child cognitive development via family processes and parenting practices. Various mediating processes are at play. Further research is needed on the role of maternal and paternal mental health and gene-environment correlations in this association. A better understanding of the mediating pathways is needed for the design of preventative intervention targeting specific family processes.

AB  - Postpartum depression can have detrimental effects on both a mother's physical and mental health and on her child's growth and emotional development. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of exercise/physical activity-based interventions in preventing and treating postpartum depressive symptoms in primiparous and multiparous women to the end of the postnatal period at 52weeks postpartum. Electronic databases were searched for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials of exercise/physical activity-based interventions in preventing and treating depressive symptoms and increasing health-related quality of life in women from 4 to 52weeks postpartum. The results of the studies were meta-analysed and effect sizes with confidence intervals were calculated. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment and Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to determine the confidence in the effect estimates. Eighteen trials conducted across a range of countries met the inclusion criteria. Most of the exercise interventions were aerobic and coaching compared to usual care, non-intervention and active controls. Small effect sizes of exercise-based interventions in reducing depressive symptoms were observed collectively and the quality of evidence was low across the individual studies. Although exercise-based interventions could create an alternative therapeutic approach for preventing major depression in postpartum women who experience subthreshold elevated depressive symptoms, the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of exercise-based and physical activity interventions need to be better established. There is a need for further more rigorous testing of such interventions in high-quality randomised controlled trials against active control conditions before large-scale roll-out of these interventions in clinical practice is proposed.

AB  - Introduction. As the global number of wind turbines has increased steadily in recent years, as has the number of studies about putative health effects in residential settings, it is the review purpose to give an overview of the characteristics and methodologies of the scientific literature around the topic in order to identify research gaps and to derive implications for research and practice. Additionally, study findings from higher-quality observational studies as well as results that seem to be of interest for the scientific and political debate are presented.
   Methods: The scoping review was conducted following systematic review methods. Comprehensive literature searches were carried out in several databases, and with extensive hand searches. All review steps were carried out in parallel by two reviewers or by one reviewer and in duplicate checked by another reviewer. The following important methodological criteria were investigated: Reporting, ethical aspects, generalization, selection bias, information bias, confounder bias. Findings from observational studies without a selection bias, information bias, and confounder bias are presented.
   Results: 84 articles, that varied significantly in methods and outcomes assessed, met the inclusion criteria. Multiple cross-sectional studies reported that wind turbine noise is associated with noise annoyance, which is moderated by several variables such as noise sensitivity, attitude towards wind turbines, or economic benefit. Wind turbine noise is not associated with stress effects and biophysiological variables of sleep. Results on the impact of wind turbine noise on sleep disburbance, quality of life, and mental health problems differed among cross-sectional studies. There were few studies that addressed the potential impact of turbine noise on clinically apparent health outcomes. There were also few studies on visual risk factors or infrasound exposure. No literature was identified regarding low-frequency noise, electromagnetic radiation, and ice throw.
   Conclusions: There is an extensive and diverse body of evidence around health impacts of wind turbines in residential settings, that increased sharply since 2010, showing particularly noise consequences concerning increased noise annoyance with its complex pathways; no relationship between wind turbine noise and stress effects and biophysiological variables of sleep; and heterogeneous findings concerning sleep disturbance, quality of life, as well as mental health problems. Research gaps concern the complex pathways of annoyance, the examination of clinically apparent health outcomes in comparison with non-exposed residents, an objective investigation of visual wind turbine features, the interaction between all wind turbine exposures, and epidemiological observational studies on field low-frequency and infrasound from wind turbines. Future research needs thorough high-quality and prospective study designs.

AB  - People living with mental illness often experience poor sleep quality compared to the general population. Poor sleep quality exacerbates symptoms of mental illness and contributes to increased physical comorbidities. Exercise has been shown to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment for managing poor sleep in the general population. Little is known regarding the efficacy of targeted exercise interventions for improving sleep quality amongst individuals with a mental illness. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the impact of exercise on sleep quality in people with mental illness. Major electronic databases were searched from inception until June 2018 for exercise-based ACTs that included either subjective and/or objective measures of sleep quality in people with severe mental illness (SMI). Eight RCT's were included in the meta-analysis, involving use of a range of exercise modalities in people with SMI diagnoses. Overall, exercise had a large statistically significant effect on sleep quality (hedges g = 0.73, 95% CI; (0.18, 1.28), p-value = 0.01; N = 8, n = 1,329, 12 = 91.15%). The beneficial effect of exercise on sleep quality outlined in this study highlights the important role exercise has in improving health outcomes for people living with mental illness. Further research is required to determine the efficacy of exercise on sleep in people experiencing a psychiatric illness and to explore the effects of exercise intervention elements such as modality, frequency, intensity and delivery settings.

Methods: Studies were identified through searching six electronic databases using combinations of three groups of keywords and manual search. Two independent reviewers screened the searched studies, extracted data of the included studies, and assessed the study quality. The extracted data were synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: Ten studies consisting of two controlled trials, six surveys, and two interview studies met the inclusion criteria. The two controlled trials had weak methodological quality, and the remaining studies were of moderate to high research quality. Results of controlled trials and interview research generally showed that MBIs had positive effects in burnout prevention. Meta-analytic results indicated a negative association between mindfulness and burnout. Conclusions: There is some evidence showing that mindfulness was negatively associated with athlete burnout. However, given the small number of interventions and qualitative studies, there is limited evidence on whether MBIs are useful in preventing athlete burnout. More studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

AB  - Postpartum depression affects approximately 11% of women. However, screening for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD) is rare and inconsistent among healthcare professionals. When healthcare professionals screen, they often rely on clinical judgment, rather than validated screening tools. The objective of the current study is to review the types and effectiveness of interventions for healthcare professionals that have been used to increase the number of women screened and referred for PMAD. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was utilized to guide search and reporting strategies. PubMed/Medline, PsychInfo/PsychArticles, Cumulative Index to Nursing, Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition databases were used to find studies that implemented an intervention for healthcare professionals to increase screening and referral for PMAD. Twenty-five studies were included in the review. Based on prior quality assessment tools, the quality of each article was assessed using an assessment tool created by the authors. The four main outcome variables were the following: percentage of women screened, percentage of women referred for services, percentage of women screened positive for PMAD, and provider knowledge, attitudes, and/or skills concerning PMAD. The most common intervention type was educational, with others including changes in electronic medical records and standardized patients for training. Study quality and target audience varied among the studies. Interventions demonstrated moderate positive impacts on screening completion rates, referral rates for PMAD, and patient-provider communication. Studies suggested positive receptivity to screening protocols by mothers and providers. Given the prevalence and negative impacts of PMAD on mothers and children, further interventions to improve screening and referral are needed.

AB  - Radicalization is a process, by which individuals adopt extreme political, social and religious ideation that leads to mass violence acts. It has been hypothesized that mental health characteristics might be associated with a risk of radicalization. However, a qualitative synthesis of studies investigating the relationship between mental health and radicalization has not been performed so far. Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review of studies examining the association between mental health characteristics and the risk of radicalization. Two reviewers performed an independent search of online databases from their inception until 8th April 2018 and 12 publications met eligibility criteria. There were several methodological limitations across the majority of eligible publications, including doubtful sample representativeness, use of diagnostic procedures without personal assessment of mental health status or lack of standardized tools for assessment of mental health. Representative cross-sectional studies revealed that depressive symptoms might be associated with radicalization proneness. However, it remains unknown whether depressive symptoms are associated with resilience or vulnerability to radicalization. Another finding from our systematic review is that several personality traits might predispose to develop extreme ideation. Finally, there is some evidence that lone-actors might represent a specific subgroup of subjects with extreme beliefs which can be characterized by high prevalence of psychotic and/or mood disorders. In conclusion, this systematic review indicates that caution should be taken on how the association between 'mental health' and 'radicalization' is being claimed, because of limited evidence so far, and a number of methodological limitations of studies addressing this issue.

AB  - Depressive symptoms are present in the depressive mood state of bipolar disorder (BPD) and major depression disorder (MDD). Often, in clinical practice, BPD patients are misdiagnosed with MDD. Therefore, genetic bio-markers could contribute to the improvement of differential diagnosis between BPD and MDD. This systematic and critical review aimed to find in literature reliable genetic biomarkers that may show differences between BPD and MDD. This systematic review followed the PRISMA-P method. The terms used to search PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were depress*, bipolar, diagnos*, genetic*, biomark*. After applying the selection criteria, N = 27 studies were selected, being n = 9 about biomarkers for BPD; n = 15, about MDD; and n = 3 for distinguishing MDD from BPD. A total of N = 3086 subjects were assessed in the selected studies (n = 486 in BPD group; n = 1212 in MDD group; and n = 1388, healthy control group). The articles were dated up to June 2017. Of the N = 27 studies, n = 16 assessed gene, n = 1 miRNA, n = 2 IcnRNA and n = 3 protein expressions, n = 4 methylation, and n = 4 polymorphisms. Some studies applied more than one of these genetic analyses. To find reliable genetic biomarkers we have taken into account the methodological care during the studies development and their validity. The genetic biomarkers selected are related to genes that play a fundamental role in synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, mood control, brain ageing, immune-inflammatory processes and mitochondrial respiratory chain. BDNF gene expression was one of the genetic biomarkers that highlighted because of its capacity of distinguishing BPD and MDD groups, and being adequately reproduced by more than one selected study.

AB  - Military personnel with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can experience high levels of mental and physical health comorbidity, potentially indicating a high level of functional impairment that can impact on both military readiness and later ill-health. There is strong evidence to implicate PTSD as a contributory factor to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) among serving personnel and veterans. This systematic review focusses on the association between PTSD and cardiovascular disease/risk factors in male, military serving and ex-serving personnel who served in the Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts. PUBMED, MEDLINE, PILOTS, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, and PSYCARTICLES were searched using PRISMA guidelines. Three hundred and forty-three records were identified, of which 20 articles were selected. PTSD was positively associated with the development of CVD, specifically circulatory diseases, including hypertension. PTSD was also positively associated with the following risk factors: elevated heart rate, tobacco use, dyslipidaemia, and obesity. Conflicting data is presented regarding heart rate variability and inflammatory markers. Future studies would benefit from a standardized methodological approach to investigating PTSD and physical health manifestations. It is suggested that clinicians offer health advice for CVD at an earlier age for ex-/serving personnel with PTSD.

AB  - Due to diverse cognitive, emotional and interpersonal changes that can follow brain injury, psychological therapies often need to be adapted to suit the complex needs of this population. The aims of the study were to synthesise published recommendations for therapy modifications following brain injury from non-progressive traumatic, vascular, or metabolic causes and to determine how often such modifications have been applied to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for post-injury emotional adjustment problems. A systematic review and narrative synthesis of therapy modifications recommended in review articles and reported in intervention studies was undertaken. Database and manual searches identified 688 unique papers of which eight review articles and 16 intervention studies met inclusion criteria. The review articles were thematically analysed and a checklist of commonly recommended modifications composed. The checklist items clustered under themes of: therapeutic education and formulation; attention; communication; memory; and executive functioning. When this checklist was applied to the intervention studies, memory aids and an emphasis on socialising patients to the CBT model were most frequently reported as adaptations. It was concluded that the inconsistent reporting of psychological therapy adaptations for people with brain injury is a barrier to developing effective and replicable therapies. We present a comprehensive account of potential modifications that should be used to guide future research and practice.

AB  - A number of studies have examined the association between diet and mood state, but the findings have been inconclusive. Herein, we conducted a systematic review to assess the association between different diet and mood state. PubMed, Cochrane's library, Science direct, Scopus, Google scholar and ISI web of science databases were searched for all available literature until December 2017 for studies assessing the association between diet and mood state. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Jadad scale for reporting randomized clinical trials were used to assess study quality. A total of 18 studies out of 2857 met our inclusion criteria and included in our systematic review. Although there are not consistent findings between studies, it seems that DASH, vegetable-based, glycemic load-based, ketogenic and Paleo diets could improve mood more than the others. Further studies are needed to assess such relationship in a longer period to draw a firm link between diet and mood.

AB  - Accumulating research in education shows that contemplative practices contribute to and foster well-being of individuals in sustainable ways. This bears special importance for teachers, as it affects not only them but also their students. Based on accumulating behavioral and neuroscientific findings, it has been suggested that a key process by which mindfulness meditation enhances self-regulation is the altering of self-awareness. Indeed, accumulated work shows that the underlying networks supporting various types of self-awareness are malleable following meditative practice. However, the field of education has developed independently from the study of the self and its relation to contemplative neuroscience thus far, and to date there is no systematic account linking this accumulating body of knowledge to the field of education or discussing how it might be relevant to teachers.
   Here we show how incorporating insights from contemplative neuroscience-which are built on the conceptualization and neuroscience of the self-into contemplative pedagogy can inform the field and might even serve as a core underlying mechanism tying together different empirical evidence. This review points to potential neural mechanisms by which mindfulness meditation helps teachers manage stress and promote supportive learning environments, resulting in improved educational outcomes, and thus it has significant implications for educational policy regarding teachers.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review explores changes in perinatal empathy and influence on maternal behaviours and child development. Background: The well-being and development of infants are commonly linked to their mothers' capacity for empathy. However, characteristic changes during pregnancy and childbirth including sleep deprivation, mood and cognitive difficulties may disrupt empathic processing. Methods: Original research papers (n = 7413) published in English language peer-reviewed academic journals were obtained by searching four electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting empathy of women in the period from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Empathy was operationalised as a general tendency of empathic emotional responding and cognitive perspective taking. Thirteen studies were systematically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. Results: Impaired empathy in mothers, due most notably to high personal distress, was associated with risk of neglect or maltreatment of children and was partially explained by mothers' aversive response to infant crying. Conclusion: Few studies present empathy as a central theme. There is a paucity of definitional parameters and theoretical linkages and over-reliance on brief self-report indices of empathy. Future studies need to be theory based, incorporate experimental approaches, and provide greater sampling diversity toadvance our understanding of empathy in perinatal women.

AB  - Objective Classifying mental disorders on the basis of objective makers might clarify their aetiology, help in making the diagnosis, identify "at risk" individuals, determine the severity of mental illness, and predict the course of the disorder. This study aims to review biological and clinical markers of panic disorder (PD).
   Methods A computerized search was carried out in PubMed and Science Direct using the key words: "marker/biomarker/clinical marker/neurobiology/staging" combined using Boolean AND operator with "panic." In addition, the reference lists from existing reviews and from the articles retrieved were inspected. Only English language papers published in peer-reviewed journals were included.
   Results Structural changes in the amygdala, hippocampus, cerebral blood level in the left occipital cortex, serotonin 5-TH and noradrenergic systems activation, aberrant respiratory regulation, hearth rate variability, blood cells and peripheral blood stem cells, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation were identified as potential candidate biomarkers of PD. Staging was identified as clinical marker of PD. According to the staging model, PD is described as follows: prodromal phase (stage 1); acute phase (stage 2); panic attacks (stage 3); chronic phase (stage 4).
   Conclusion The clinical utility, sensitivity, specificity, and the predictive value of biomarkers for PD is still questionable. The staging model of PD might be a valid susceptibility, diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive marker of PD. A possible longitudinal model of biological and clinical markers of PD is proposed.

AB  - Background: Mindfulness interventions are increasingly used as a part of integrated treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but there are limited data and a lack of consensus regarding effectiveness.
   Objectives: We explored the efficacy of mindfulness interventions compared to treatment as usual (TAU), or other psychotherapeutic interventions, in treating physical and psychosocial symptoms associated with IBD.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We included a broad range of mindfulness interventions including mindfulness-based interventions and yoga, with no restrictions on date of publication, participants' age, language or publication type. We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and WHO ICTRP database. We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines in conducting the review.
   Results: We included eight studies in the meta-analysis. Mindfulness interventions showed a statistically significant effect on stress in both the short(SMD = -0.48; 95%CI:-0.97, 0.00; P =.05), and long term (SMD = -0.55; 95%CI:-0.78,-0.32; P <.00001), significant long term effects on depression (SMD =-0.36; 95%CI:-0.66, -0.07; P =.02) and quality of life (SMD = 0.38; 95%CI:0.08, 0.68; P =.01),and small but not statistically significant improvements in anxiety (SMD = -0.27; 95%CI:-0.65, 0.11; P =.16).Effects on physical outcomes were equivocal and not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Mindfulness interventions are effective in reducing stress and depression and improving quality of life and anxiety, but do not lead to significant improvements in the physical symptoms of IBD. Further research involving IBD-tailored interventions and more rigorously designed trials is warranted.

   Methods: Major scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, EBSCO, ProQuest and PsycINFO were searched for original research articles published 1987-2016. A random effect model was used to combine Correlation coefficient. All analyses were performed using Stata MP.
   Results: After screening of 7235 documents, 13 articles including 5620 participants met inclusion criteria in this meta-analysis. Correlation coefficient was -0.08 (95% CI= -0.19, -0.03) which indicated with increasing religious orientation, anxiety and depression reduced (P<0.001). Characteristics such as sex, geographic region, and type of religions were potential sources of heterogeneity. Based on fill-and-trim method the adjusted pooled r was obtained, -0.06 (95% CI= -0.16, -0.04).
   Conclusion: There was a weakness relationship between religious orientation and mental anxiety and depression. Therefore, it needs to improve knowledge of student about advantages of religious orientation.

AB  - Background The Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project at the Harvard South Shore Program presents evidence-based recommendations considering efficacy, tolerability, safety, and cost. Two previous algorithms for unipolar nonpsychotic depression were published in 1993 and 1998. New studies over the last 20 years suggest that another update is needed. Methods The references reviewed for the previous algorithms were reevaluated, and a new literature search was conducted to identify studies that would either support or alter the previous recommendations. Other guidelines and algorithms were consulted. We considered exceptions to the main algorithm, as for pregnant women and patients with anxious distress, mixed features, or common medical and psychiatric comorbidities. For inpatients with severe melancholic depression and acute safety concerns, electroconvulsive therapy (or ketamine if ECT refused or ineffective) may be the first-line treatment. In the absence of an urgent indication, we recommend trialing venlafaxine, mirtazapine, or a tricyclic antidepressant. These may be augmented if necessary with lithium or T3 (triiodothyronine). For inpatients with non-melancholic depression and most depressed outpatients, sertraline, escitalopram, and bupropion are reasonable first choices. If no response, the prescriber (in collaboration with the patient) has many choices for the second trial in this algorithm because there is no clear preference based on evidence, and there are many individual patient considerations to take into account. If no response to the second medication trial, the patient is considered to have a medication treatment-resistant depression. If the patient meets criteria for the atypical features specifier, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor could be considered. If not, reconsider (for the third trial) some of the same options suggested for the second trial. Some other choices can also considered at this stage. If the patient has comorbidities such as chronic pain, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder, the depression could be secondary; evidence-based treatments for those disorders would then be recommended.

AB  - The Arctic air mass is the cold, dry body of air slowly moving eastwards around the North Pole in the northern hemisphere. Its southern boundary consists of four planetary waves known as the Rossby waves that mark the interface with subtropical air bringing heat polewards. The Arctic air mass is constantly being modified by the addition of heat and moisture over the oceans, as well as by winter cooling over the land masses due to limited incoming solar radiation and constant reradiation of heat into the atmosphere. The coldest air in winter is located over northeastern Siberia and moves east, cooling Canada. Warm ocean currents add large quantities of heat to the air mass moving over them, but without this addition of heat, the Arctic air mass becomes significantly colder. Research in Tibet and Northeast Asia on depression of sea level shows that during the Late Wisconsin cold event (65-10 ka B.P.), vast quantities of sea water were sequestered on land primarily as ice sheets, exposing the sea bed in the Bering Strait from 50-10 ka B.P. together with the bottom of the South China Sea between 30-20 ka B.P.. The East China Monsoon failed to reach Tibet and much of Northeast China, resulting in severe cooling of northeast Siberia and northern Tibet. This, in turn, caused severe cooling in eastern Canada together with the development of a vast, predominantly cold-based ice sheet. As the sea levels started to rise (about 19 ka B.P.), the East China Monsoon slowly redeveloped and a gradual warming took place on both continents. However, along the west side of the North American Cordillera, the Late Wisconsin glaciation only began in 29 ka B.P. but continued along the west coast until about 10 ka B.P. This paper explores the relationship of the Late Wisconsin history on the two continents, together with the mechanisms causing the landforms and climatic differences. Finally, the probable effects of these climatic changes on the early peopling of North America are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Disordered eating behaviors are more prevalent and generally are subtle as compared to eating disorders. The objective was to review the empirical studies that have determined the prevalence of disordered eating behaviors in patients with psychiatric illness. Method: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched Medline (OVID), EMBASE, PsycINFO (OVID) and the Web of Science databases from inception to April 2017. Three reviewers independently screened the citations and included them if they reported the prevalence of disordered eating behaviors in patients with primary diagnosis of mental illnesses (i.e. mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, and schizophrenia spectrum disorder). Data-extraction was performed using a pre-piloted data extraction form and a narrative synthesis of the data of the prevalence of eating disorders was carried out. Results: Thirteen studies were included in this review. The evidence suggests that the individuals seeking treatment for various mental illnesses endorsed having disordered eating behaviors such as binge eating, fasting, purging (use of diuretics, diet pills, and laxatives; vomiting and excessive exercise), loss of control over eating, bulimic tendency and anorexia. The prevalence range of binge eating (19.0%-44.0%), bulimic tendency (4.4%-13.2%), anorexia (19.8%), fasting (4.0%-40.0%), laxative use (1.0%-11.1%), diuretics use (1.0%-1.6%), vomiting (1.6%-8.6%), diet pills (36.0%), loss of control over eating (17.0%) and excessive exercise (1.0%-32.0%) were reported in the included studies. Conclusion: This review provides evidence on the prevalence of disordered eating behaviors in a wide spectrum of psychiatric illnesses. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution due to limitations. There is a clear need for studies with a larger sample size to confirm the findings and further the understanding of the prevalence of the specific type of disordered eating behaviors in psychiatric populations.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex mental disorder whose neurobiology, including epi/genetics, is still elusive. The South East European (SEE)-PTSD study has conducted an impressive amount of research on molecular mechanisms of PTSD. The results of the study make obvious the need of coordinated pluralism and transdisciplinary integrative approach in research on molecular mechanisms of PTSD and other stress-related disorders. The development of PTSD is influenced by a tangled and complicated interaction of inborn or acquired predisposition or vulnerability and environmental adversity which alters gene regulation producing effects on neurons and brain systems and inducing changes in cognition, emotion and behavior. There are still no identified objective biomarkers or tests which could confirm the trauma exposure or identify the real presence of PTSD. The puzzle how brain function enables the resilience to adversity and how brain dysfunctions lead to vulnerability to stress and development of PTSD and other stress-related disorders is still awaiting reliable explanation. Discovery of PTSD associated epi/genetic factors might provide reliable markers for pathogenesis, what could result in getting novel therapeutics and/or objective stratifying patients for research.

AB  - Background: Individuals experiencing apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD) have a lack of emotion and motivation. Apathy often overlaps with comorbidities such as depression, and is sometimes difficult to detect.
   Objective: To examine diagnostic accuracy of apathy-screening tools compared with a gold standard (clinician diagnosis) among adult outpatients with PD.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted. Six research databases were searched to May 23, 2018. Diagnostic accuracy measures, including sensitivity and specificity were gathered.
   Results: 1,007 full-text articles were reviewed with seven full-text articles included. The gold standard was considered a clinician diagnosis as apathy is not defined in the DSM/ICD. Diagnostic accuracy measures were reported for the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) both informant- and observer-rated, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Apathy Scale (AS), Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMS-Q), and Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS). The AES had the best reported sensitivity and specificity values, both 90%. The AS had the highest reported specificity at 100%, with 66% sensitivity. Pooled prevalence of apathy was 29.1% (95% CI 21.5%-36.6%).
   Conclusions: While 18 screening tools exist to screen for apathy in PD, only six have been validated against clinician diagnosis. The AES had the highest reported sensitivity and specificity and is a brief, easy to use tool. The AS was designed specifically for use in PD populations and has the highest reported specificity. Future research should focus on the development of an accepted gold standard, to further understand accuracy measures of all available apathy screening tools.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to synthesize and update findings from systematic review on health Literacy and health outcomes among patients with long-term conditions, and extend the review to the digital domain. Health outcomes include clinical outcomes, processes of care, and health service use. Data sources are the following: (1) studies which appeared in two previous systematic reviews in 2004 and 2011 whose participants were people with long-term conditions or elderly (n = 54): (2) articles on health literacy and health outcomes identified in an updated 2011-2016 search (n = 26): (3) articles on eHealth literacy and its association with health outcomes (n = 8). Strength of evidence was determined by a qualitative assessment of risk of bias, consistency, and directness. There was a lack of consistent evidence on the relationship between health literacy and clinical outcomes despite the consistent evidence on the association with mortality. There was tow to insufficient evidence on the association between health literacy and self-rated health/function and emotional states of anxiety and depression, alongside high evidence on tack of association with quality of life. There was insufficient to low evidence on the association between health literacy and behavioral outcomes (medication adherence, other health behaviors) and finally also Low to moderate evidence on the association between health literacy and use of health services such as hospitalization and emergency department. In the eHealth literacy domain, there were few studies reporting association with health behaviors and self-rated health with inconsistent results. In conclusion, it is advocated to examine performed heath literacy and eHealth literacy in large longitudinal studies.

AB  - Background: Derangements of the gut microbiome have been linked to increased systemic inflammation and central nervous system disorders, including schizophrenia. This systematic review thus aimed to investigate the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation improves schizophrenia symptoms. Methods: By using the keywords (probiotic OR gut OR microbiota OR microbiome OR yogurt OR yoghurt OR lactobacillus OR bifidobacterium) AND (schizophrenia OR psychosis), a preliminary search of the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials. gov, Clinical Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDANTR), and Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine databases yielded 329 papers published in English between January 1, 1960 and May 1, 2018. Attempts were made to search grey literature as well. Results: Three clinical studies were reviewed, comparing the use of probiotics to placebo controls. Applying per-protocol analysis and a fixed-effects model, there was no significant difference in schizophrenia symptoms between the group that received probiotic supplementation and the placebo group post-intervention as the standardized mean difference was -0.0884 (95% CI -0.380 to 0.204, p = 0.551). Separate analyses were performed to investigate the effect of probiotic supplementation on positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia alone. In both instances, no significant difference was observed as well. Conclusion: Based on current evidence, limited inferences can be made regarding the efficacy of probiotics in schizophrenia. Although probiotics may have other benefits, for example to regulate bowel movement and ameliorate the metabolic effects of antipsychotic medications, the clinical utility of probiotics in the treatment of schizophrenia patients remains to be validated by future clinical studies.

Whether caregiving is a sudden or anticipated role, caregivers are often unsure of where to turn for information or aide, and face many challenges including stress, depression, anxiety, and financial burdens. Credible, easy, and useful online resources are abundant, and the Family Caregiver Alliance and the AARP Caregiving Resources Center are no exception. Each provide excellent starting points for caregivers new to the role, or seasoned caregivers seeking additional information. Other sources compliment these pivotal sites, but each can stand alone as a primary source for family caregiving information.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Music is an economical, advantageous and reliable means of reducing stress or stress-related problems.
   OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to evaluate the effects of playing music during surgery on the performance of the surgical team through a systematic review of published studies.
   METHODS: The relevant databases of Medline/PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct were searched up to July 2018 to find related articles. The comprehensive literature search was reduced to 19 articles that met inclusion criteria.
   RESULTS: The articles comprised 13 studies and reported on the positive effects of music on the performance of the surgical team. The effects included a more relaxing and pleasant environment, more accurate and precise performance of tasks, a decrease in the mental workload and task completion time, increased situation awareness, a reduction in stress and anxiety and improved memory consolidation. Five studies reported on the negative effects of music during surgery as being a negative impact on task completion, poor auditory performance and increased likelihood of having to repeat requests. The remaining article reported no significant differences between groups compared.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most studies reported positive effects of music on the surgical team during surgery. These results indicate that it may be possible to improve the performance of the surgical team during surgery while playing controlled music.

AB  - Objectives Precarious employment (PE) is a term used to describe non-standard employment forms characterized by low security that may have negative effects on mental health. The objective of this review was to systematically review the evidence for effects of PE on mental health and identify important areas for further research.
   Methods A protocol was developed following PRISMA-P guidelines. Web of Science, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched up to 4 September 2017. All unique records were assessed for eligibility and quality by at least two reviewers. Data from included studies were summarized in forest plots and meta-analyses using a random-effects model. Evidence quality was rated using the GRADE method.
   Results We obtained 3328 unique records, of which 16 studies of sufficient quality met the inclusion criteria. Moderate quality evidence (GRADE score 3 of 4) was found for an adverse effect of job insecurity on mental health; summary odds ratio (OR) 1.52 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-1.70]. There was very low quality (GRADE 1 of 4) evidence for effects of temporary employment or unpredictable work hours on mental health. Five studies on multidimensional exposures all showed adverse effects, weighted average OR 2.01 (95% CI 1.60-2.53).
   Conclusions Research on PE and mental health is growing, but high-quality prospective studies are still scarce. Job insecurity likely has an adverse effect on mental health. A clear multi-dimensional definition of PE is lacking, and harmonization efforts are needed. Further single-variable observational studies on job insecurity or temporary employment should not be prioritized.

AB  - Pediatric organ transplantation (POT) has shown enormous development in the past few decades, and the number of POT has increased exponentially. While the various medical issues in pediatric transplantation have been discussed, there is a dearth of literature on the psychological issues surrounding POT. The present review aims at providing an overview on various psychological issues that surround POT. Literature search using search engines was carried out, and review papers and original research articles were analyzed. The overall role of the psychiatrist in the POT setup is discussed and issues such as depression and anxiety that may occur in children and their parents is elaborated. The neurocognitive changes that may occur in POT are also discussed and the need for regular monitoring is stressed. Special population such as developmental disabilities and human immunodeficiency virus infection in the organ transplant setting and specific issues related to them are discussed. The role of a child and adolescent psychiatrist as an invaluable asset to any POT team is discussed and deliberated. Multiple psychological facets that may be encountered while dealing with children and adolescents undergoing organ transplantation are discussed.

AB  - Objectives Workplace exercise interventions are known to reduce musculoskeletal complaints and are widely offered to promote employee's health. The psychosocial effects of such interventions are not clear. This review evaluates the effects of workplace exercise interventions on the psychosocial work environment and mental health.
   Methods A systematic review was performed by screening four scientific databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Database, PsycINFO and Web of Science) for published randomized controlled trials in English from 1998-2018. The review followed the PRISMA statement guidelines using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias and the GRADE approach for assessment of quality. Two researchers independently performed database search, study screening, and evaluation.
   Results Twenty two randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Substantial heterogenicity in the studies included was found in study populations, types of intervention, and outcome measures performed. Quality assessment revealed a generally low level of quality in the studies included. This was partly the result of the limited possibilities for blinding and the self-reported outcome measures.
   Conclusion Workplace exercise interventions seem to have limited effects on mental health and the psychosocial work environment. Future studies should incorporate blinding and independent outcome measures.

AB  - Background: Most of original studies indicated maternal violence experiences is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes, to date, but it is not clear that the association of maternal violence experiences and the risk of postpartum depression (PPD). We aimed to assess the association between maternal violence experiences and risk of developing PPD by performing a meta-analysis of cohort studies.
   Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Libraries and Chinese databases were searched through December 2017 to identify studies that assessed the association between violence and PPD. Meta-analysis was conducted by the RevMan software and Stata software. Potential heterogeneity source was explored by subgroup analysis and potential publication bias was assessed by Begg's funnel plots and Egger's linear regression test.
   Results: Overall, women experiencing any violence events compared with the reference group were at a higher risk of developing PPD (odds ratio [OR] = 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-2.41). Additionally, different types of violence events such as sexual (OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.35-1.81), emotional (OR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.61-1.89), and physical violence (OR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.36-2.67), as well as domestic (OR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.50-2.80) or childhood violence (OR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.34-1.88) also increased the risk of developing PPD. Relevant heterogeneity moderators have been identified by subgroup analysis. Sensitivity analysis yielded consistent results.
   Conclusions: Maternal violence experiences are significantly associated with risk of developing PPD. These finding highlight the necessary to protect women from any types of violence and formulate preventive strategies to promote the maternal mental health. (c) 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background and Aims: Research has shown a potential association between problematic social networking site (SNS) use and psychiatric disorders. The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate studies examining the association between problematic SNS use and comorbid psychiatric disorders.
   Sampling and Methods: A literature search was conducted using the following databases: PsychInfo, PsycArticles, Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Problematic SNS use (PSNSU) and its synonyms were included in the search. Information was extracted based on problematic SNS use and psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, anxiety, and stress. The inclusion criteria for papers to be reviewed were (i) being published since 2014 onwards, (ii) being published in English, (iii) having population-based studies with sample sizes >500 participants, (iv) having specific criteria for problematic SNS use (typically validated psychometric scales), and (v) containing empirical primary data reporting on the correlation between PSNSU and psychiatric variables. A total of nine studies met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Results: The findings of the systematic review demonstrated that most research has been conducted in Europe and all comprised cross-sectional survey designs. In eight (of the nine) studies, problematic SNS use was correlated with psychiatric disorder symptoms. Of the nine studies (some of which examined more than one psychiatric symptom), there was a positive association between PSNSU and depression (seven studies), anxiety (six studies), stress (two studies), ADHD (one study), and OCD (one study).
   Conclusions: Overall, the studies reviewed showed associations between PSNSU and psychiatric disorder symptoms, particularly in adolescents. Most associations were found between PSNSU, depression, and anxiety.

AB  - Context: As the mostcommonpsychiatric disorder associated with menopause, depression is associated with significant morbidity and mortality consequences. Given the importance of identifying risk factors of depression in the menopausal period, this study aims to determine bio psychosocial risk factors of depression during the menopausal transition.
   Evidence Acquisition: For this narrative review, electronic databases including Google Scholar, Magiran, Scientific Information Database (SID), PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid, Science Direct, and ProQuest were searched. Articles published between 1978 and 2017 were retrieved, and an abstract and full-text appraisal was conducted. A total of 71 articles were selected for this review. The inclusion criteria included articles focusing on depression in menopausal-aged women that were published in scientific journals and English and Farsi language articles conducted in menopausal aged women.
   Results: The bio psychosocial risk factors of depression were divided into three major categories: biological, psychological, and social risk factors.
   Conclusions: Given the important role of psychological health in menopausal-aged women, it is recommended that mental health andrisk factors of psychiatric disorders inmenopauseare evaluated atmenopauseclinicsandthat every high-riskwomanis referred to a psychiatrist for pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention.

AB  - Dysregulations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS), two of the most prominent stress-responsive systems, have been associated with the development and maintenance of various mental disorders. It has been suggested that these alterations might normalize in the course of psychotherapeutic interventions. We conducted a comprehensive review of psychotherapeutic intervention effects on HPA axis and ANS regulation in adult samples with mental disorders.
   We searched four databases for psychotherapeutic intervention studies with mentally ill patient samples, assessing cortisol and/or alpha-amylase before and after treatment. Study quality and confounder consideration within biomarker assessment were examined.
   Twenty-five studies were included. Psychotherapeutic interventions and biomarker assessment methodology varied substantially between studies. Accordingly, meta-analytical computations were deemed unfeasible. Study characteristics especially regarding cortisol and alpha-amylase assessment and analysis procedures were comprehensively reviewed. Study quality and biomarker confounder consideration ratings were mostly moderate to strong.
   Based on the results, we provide recommendations regarding intervention design and biomarker assessment methodology to increase comparability of psychotherapeutic treatment effects in future studies.

AB  - Objective To review available literature and identify the experimental evidence for effective treatment of depression in Indigenous populations worldwide. Method Results MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Informit, Psychology, and Behavioural Sciences databases were systematically searched for intervention studies from each database's inception to November 2016. Randomised controlled trials were included if they examined the effects of therapy for depression as primary or secondary outcome with Indigenous participants of any age group. This review found a total of four experimental trials (152 participants) worldwide studying the effect of behavioural and pharmacological interventions for depression in Indigenous populations. The quality of evidence was low to moderate. Results from three diverse interventions suggest that culturally specific cognitive and behavioural therapy may have the potential to reduce depressive symptoms in Indigenous young people. However, the evidence base is currently insufficient to offer sound conclusions. One trial studied the effect of dosage differences (75 vs 125 mg) of a tricyclic antidepressant, clomipramine, finding that Indigenous African patients may respond to treatment regimens at a lower dosage than recommended standard in western textbooks. Conclusions Findings from this review indicate potential for the use of culturally adapted behavioural interventions to target depression in Indigenous populations; however, current evidence is insufficient to confirm their effectiveness. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to propose recommendations for effective pharmacological treatment for Indigenous people. A tentative finding, that lower doses of antidepressants might be effective for the Indigenous, compared to the general population, requires further investigation as it holds important implications for clinical practice. More rigorous experimental research with adequate sample sizes needs to be conducted to provide conclusive recommendations for adoption into standard care.

AB  - Objective Method Several studies have observed that dissociative experiences are frequently reported by individuals with severe mental illness (SMI), especially amongst patients that report a history of adverse/traumatic life experiences. This review examined the magnitude and consistency of the relationship between childhood adversity (sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, bullying, natural disasters and mass violence) and dissociation across three SMI diagnostic groups: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and personality disorders. A database search (EMBASE, PubMed and PsycINFO) identified 30 eligible empirical studies, comprising of 2199 clinical participants. Effect sizes representing the relationship between exposure to childhood adversity and dissociation were examined and integrated using a random-effects meta-analysis. Results Conclusion The results indicated that exposure to childhood trauma was associated with heightened dissociation across SMIs. Positive significant associations were also found between specific childhood adversities and dissociation, with aggregated effect sizes in the small-to-moderate range. These findings support calls for the routine assessment of traumatic experiences in clients with SMIs presenting with dissociative symptoms and the provision of adequate therapeutic support (e.g. trauma-focused therapies) to manage and resolve these difficulties.

This is a critical period to implement interventions to enhance mental health literacy (MHL) and to prevent the occurrence of mental health problems. This systematic review examined the effectiveness of information and communication technologies interventions on MHL (recognition of conditions, stigma and help-seeking).
   Methods: The authors searched for both published and unpublished studies.
   Results: Nineteen studies were included with 9 randomized controlled trials and 10 quasi-experimental studies. Informational interventions were useful to enhance MHL of less-known disorders such as anxiety disorder and anorexia, but not depression. Interventions that were effective in enhancing depression MHL comprised active component such as videos or quizzes. Interventions that successfully elevated MHL also reduced stigma. Elevated MHL levels did not improve help-seeking, and reduction in stigma levels did not enhance help-seeking behaviours.
   Conclusions: Future good quality, large-scale, multi-sites randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate MHL interventions.

Systematic literature searches in PubMed and PsycINFO for articles published until 2017 were done. Exclusion criteria included: papers that considered radiofrequency fields, attention, safety, relational consequences, sexual behavior, cyberbullying, and reviews, qualitative, and case or experimental studies. A total of 4738 papers were screened by title and abstract, 404 were retrieved in full text, and 290 were included. Only 5% had any longitudinal design. Self-reporting was the dominating method of measurement. One third of the studies included children or youth. A majority of adult populations consisted of university students and/or self-selected participants. The main research results included associations between frequent mobile phone use and mental health outcomes, such as depressive symptoms and sleep problems. Mobile phone use at bedtime was associated with, e.g., shorter sleep duration and lower sleep quality. Problematic use (dependency) was associated with several negative outcomes. In conclusion, associations between mobile phone use and adverse mental health outcomes are found in studies that take a psychological or behavioral perspective on the exposure. However, more studies of high quality are needed in order to draw valid conclusions about the mechanisms and causal directions of associations.

This article reviews terminology in this evolving field, traditional models of gender identity development and their limitations, epidemiology and natural history of cross-gender identification among children and adolescents, co-occurring conditions and behaviors, research into the biological and psychosocial determinants of cross-gender identification, and research into the options regarding and benefits of clinical approaches to gender incongruent youth. Methods Based on a critical review of the extant literature, both theoretical and empirical, that addresses the issue of pediatric gender identity, the authors synthesized what is presently known and what is in need of further research in order to elucidate the developmental trajectory and clinical needs of gender diverse youth. Results The field of pediatric gender identity has evolved substantially over the past several years. New research suggests that cross-gender identification is prevalent (approximately 1% of youth). These youth suffer disproportionately high rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality. Although research into the etiology of cross-gender identification is limited, emerging data have shown that affirmative treatment protocols may improve the high rates of mental health difficulties seen among these patients. Conclusions The field of pediatric gender identity has evolved dramatically. Emerging data suggest that these patients' high rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality appear to be improved with affirmative protocols, although future longitudinal data are needed.

AB  - Mounting evidence has shown that the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is substantially overlapping in the diagnostic subgroups of psychiatric disorders. While it is widely acknowledged that patients receiving antipsychotic medications are at higher risk of MetS than antipsychotic-naive ones, the association between antidepressants and MetS is still debated. The goal of our mini review was to analyse the relationship among depressive symptoms, antidepressant use and the occurrence of MetS. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we searched MEDLINE, reference lists and journals, using the following search string: ((("Mental Disorders"[Mesh]) AND "Metabolic Syndrome"[Mesh]) AND "Antidepressive Agents"[Mesh]), and retrieved 36 records. Two reviewers independently assessed records and the mini review eventually included the data extracted from 8 studies. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. Overall, the results of the mini review seem to support the association among depressive symptoms, antidepressants therapy and MetS. Except for H1-R high-affinity ones, the relationship between antidepressants and MetS still needs to be clarified. Considering the widespread prescription of antidepressants, both on behalf of psychiatrists and primary care physicians, further research on this topic is recommended.

AB  - Objective: Epigenetic mechanisms have been described in several mental disorders, such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. However, less is known about the influence of epigenetic mechanisms with regard to personality disorders (PD). Therefore, we conducted a literature review on existing original data with regards to epigenetic peculiarities in connection with personality disorders.
   Methods: Systematic literature review using PRISMA guidelines. Search was performed via NCBI PubMed by keywords and their combinations. Used search terms included "epigenetic," "methylation," "acetylation" plus designations of specified personality traits and disorders according to DSM-IV.
   Results: Search yielded in total 345 publications, 257 thereof with psychiatric topic, 72 on personality disorder or traits, 43 of which were in humans and epigenetic, 23 thereof were original studies. Lastly, 23 original publications fulfilled the intended search criteria and were included. Those are 13 studies on gene methylation pattern with aggressive, antisocial and impulsive traits, 9 with borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 2 with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). The results of these studies showed significant associations of PD with methylation aberrances in system-wide genes and suggest evidence for epigenetic processes in the development of personality traits and personality disorders. Environmental factors, of which childhood trauma showed a high impact, interfered with many neurofunctional genes. Methylation alterations in ASPD and BPD repeatedly affected HTR2A, HTR3A, NR3C1, and MAOA genes.
   Summary: Epigenetic studies in PD seem to be a useful approach to elucidate the interaction of co-working risk factors in the pathogenesis of personality traits and disorders. However, the complexity of pathogenesis leads to divergent results and impedes an explicit interpretation. Differing methylation patterns within the selected PD could indicate subgroups which would benefit from patient-oriented therapeutic adjustments. They might play a major role in the future design and observation of early therapeutic intervention and thus could help to prevent severe dysfunctional conduct or full-blown personality disorder in risk subjects.

AB  - Despite the increasing presence of Chinese communities in the West, their experiences of depression and the variations in symptoms or presentation are not well understood. Using Arksey and O'Malley's methodical framework, we conducted a scoping review of the published literature, using electronic databases MEDLINE and PsycINFO, and searched for articles published since 1999. Out of 1177 articles identified, 21 met the inclusion criteria. Thematic synthesis revealed valuable scholarly work on (1) depression rates, migration, and contextual determinants, (2) causation beliefs and help seeking, (3) acculturation and symptoms, (4) presenting symptoms and somatization, and (5) culturally sensitive assessment and care. Overall, this review has identified the importance of contextual determinants in the development of depression, low rates of seeking of professional help, subtle variations in somatization, and knowledge gaps in culturally sensitive care. The findings suggest that, rather than treating migration as a cause of mental distress, the accompanying conditions and events need to be further examined and addressed as potential risk or protective factors. Subtle variations in somatization are also evident, and future scholarly work should examine the notion of cultural scripts-namely, that people attend and react to particular experiences in culturally based ways. For this reason (among others), practice models need to develop strategies for culturally sensitive care, such as co-construction of illness narratives and finding common ground. Given the stigma of mental illness and the low level of seeking professional help, the role of primary care should be expanded. Further studies investigating mental health issues beyond depression are also warranted in the studied community.

AB  - Background
   The aetiology of dementia is not yet fully understood. Stress can have a damaging effect on brain health. The prognostic effect of anxiety is still unclear regarding Alzheimer's disease as well as vascular dementia.
   Aims
   To explore the association between anxiety and future dementia.
   Method
   Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and ALOIS were searched for publications up to 12 January 2018. Longitudinal studies with a follow-up of at least 2 years were included, if the trait or state anxiety had been assessed at baseline. Studies with cognitive impairment at baseline were not included. We used a random effects model to calculate the pooled time to Alzheimer's disease and incidence of vascular dementia.
   Results
   Anxiety predicts risk of Alzheimer's disease (n = 26 193 out of seven studies, hazard ratio1.53, 95% CI 1.16-2.01, P < 0.01) and vascular dementia (n = 4916 out of two studies, odds ratio1.88, 95% CI 1.05-3.36, P < 0.01). The pooled hazard ratio regarding risk of Alzheimer's disease was still significant when excluding studies with critical risk of bias (n = 14 110 out of six studies, hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.70, P < 0.01).
   Conclusions
   Anxiety is a risk factor for both types of dementia. The temporal and functional relation between anxiety and dementia needs investigation in future studies. The protective value of treating anxiety should be explored further.

AB  - Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are stressful and/or traumatic experiences that occur during childhood. Research has demonstrated a link between ACEs and risk of physical and mental health disorders, where early life adversity may become "biologically embedded" and have wide-ranging effects on various physiological systems. The aim of this study was to identify the extent and breadth of recent research activity relating to biological measures of ACEs in adulthood. We undertook a scoping review including published research articles. Medline and PsycINFO were searched for articles from 2007 to July 2017. Articles were eligible if they included adult participants, were written in English, and reported on a biomarker of childhood adversity in adulthood. Forty articles met our inclusion criteria. Studies investigated a range of ACEs that were often measured retrospectively. The studies identified biomarkers related to inflammation (e.g., CRP), cardio/metabolic systems (e.g., BMI), genetics (e.g., telomere length), and endocrine systems (e.g., cortisol), as well as composites of multiple physiological systems. However, not every study identified found significant associations. Health behaviours, emotional distress, social relationships, and socioeconomic factors may help explain some of these associations. Further research is needed to better understand biomarkers of ACEs in adulthood and their relationship to health conditions.

AB  - Background:Although second opinions are rather restricted to the surgical disciplines, they have become more and more important to the health system in the last 20 years. The demand has been triggered by rising health costs and the economization of the field. The Internet has also made a considerable contribution to the demand for patient-initiated second opinions. Given these developments, it is surprising that second opinions have not become more important in the field of psychiatry. This article highlights the special situation of second opinions in psychiatry, discusses possible barriers to the adoption of second opinions in psychiatry, and the potential for greater use of second opinions in this field.Objective:In psychiatry, second opinions have been neglected by the typical drivers of innovations in health care, including insurers and other commercial drivers as well as psychiatrists and patients themselves. This review identifies current barriers to widespread adoption of second opinions in psychiatric practice, discusses the benefits of second opinions that have been demonstrated in other disciplines, and outlines the potential gains to be realized through use of second opinions in psychiatry.Methods:Literature in the area was reviewed through a search of the main medical databases. This literature review was supported by in-depth interviews with health care personnel and insurers.Conclusions:Second opinions are rarely obtained in psychiatry and there is little literature on this subject. The stigmatization of psychiatric disorders and patients and the uniqueness of the patient-doctor relationship in psychiatry, especially in psychotherapeutic care, may pose considerable obstacles to the use of second opinions in this field. In addition, more stakeholders, such as social workers, government agencies and regulators, health care and disability insurers, and social security agencies, are involved in the mental health compared with the somatic health sector, which may make it more difficult to achieve a coordinated approach in psychiatric care. However, we have found no convincingly good reason why second opinions have not been at least discussed in psychiatry. Psychiatry could benefit from ongoing discussions concerning the outcomes of second opinions in other medical disciplines.

AB  - Objectives: Psychiatric and substance-use disorders have been associated with premature biological ageing. Telomere length (TL), considered an ageing marker, has been analysed in psychiatric disorders, and to a lesser extent in substance-use disorders, with recent findings suggesting TL may be related to disease pathology. Methods: We conducted a critical and non-systematic literature search of TL studies published up to June 2016 in psychiatric and substance-use disorders, focussing on studies describing mechanisms, including studies linking telomere biology with genetic factors, stress and mitochondrial alterations (104 studies selected). Results: Patients with major depressive disorder and anxiety appear to have shorter leukocyte telomeres compared to controls. Inconclusive results are found for other psychiatric disorders and for substance-use disorders. This may be due in part to differences in medication treatment and response, as studies suggest that some psychotropic medications may modulate TL. Importantly, some studies establish a relationship between telomere machinery, stress and mitochondria function in psychiatric and substance-use disorders. Conclusions: While further longitudinal studies considering telomere genetics are needed to clarify the cause-effect link between telomeres and mitochondria function in psychiatric and substance-use disorders, the recent findings linking these biological processes suggest that telomeres may be more than ageing markers.

AB  - BackgroundTinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of any external acoustic stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown promising though heterogeneous therapeutic outcomes for tinnitus. The present study aims to review the recent advances in applications of tDCS for tinnitus treatment. In addition, the clinical efficacy and main mechanisms of action of tDCS on suppressing tinnitus are discussed.MethodsThe study was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The databases of the PubMed (1980-2018), Embase (1980-2018), PsycINFO (1850-2018), CINAHL, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews (1990-2018), Cambridge Scientific Abstracts (1990-2018), and google scholar (1980-2018) using the set search terms. The date of the most recent search was 20 May, 2018. The randomized controlled trials that have assessed at least one therapeutic outcome measured before and after tDCS intervention were included in the final analysis.ResultsDifferent tDCS protocols were used for tinnitus ranging single to repeated sessions (up to 10) consisting of daily single session of 15 to 20-min and current intensities ranging 1-2mA. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and auditory cortex are the main targets of stimulation. Both single and repeated sessions showed moderate to significant treatment effects on tinnitus symptoms. In addition to improvements in tinnitus symptoms, the tDCS interventions particularly bifrontal DLPFC showed beneficial outcomes on depression and anxiety comorbid with tinnitus. Heterogeneities in the type of tinnitus, tDCS devices, protocols, and site of stimulation made the systematic reviews of the literature difficult. However, the current evidence shows that tDCS can be developed as an adjunct or complementary treatment for intractable tinnitus. TDCS may be a safe and cost-effective treatment for tinnitus in the short-term application.ConclusionsThe current literature shows moderate to significant therapeutic efficacy of tDCS on tinnitus symptoms. Further randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trials with large sample sizes are needed to reach a definitive conclusion on the efficacy of tDCS for tinnitus. Future studies should further focus on developing efficient disease- and patient-specific protocols.

AB  - Background: With around 800,000 people taking their own lives every year, suicide is a growing health concern. Understanding the factors that underlie suicidality and identifying specific variables associated with increased risk is paramount for increasing our understanding of suicide etiology. Neuroimaging methods that enable the investigation of structural and functional brain markers in vivo are a promising tool in suicide research. Although a number of studies in clinical samples have been published to date, evidence about neuroimaging correlates for suicidality remains controversial.
   Objective: Patients with mental disorders have an increased risk for both suicidal behavior and non-suicidal self-injury. This manuscript aims to present an up-to-date overview of the literature on potential neuroimaging markers associated with SB and NSSI in clinical samples. We sought to identify consistently reported structural changes associated with suicidal symptoms within and across psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: A systematic literature search across four databases was performed to identify all English-language neuroimaging articles involving patients with at least one psychiatric diagnosis and at least one variable assessing SB or NSSI. We evaluated and screened evidence in these articles against a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria and categorized them by disease, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines.
   Results: Thirty-three original scientific articles investigating neuroimaging correlates of SB in psychiatric samples were found, but no single article focusing on NSSI alone. Associations between suicidality and regions in frontal and temporal cortex were reported by 15 and 9 studies across four disorders, respectively. Furthermore, differences in hippocampus were reported by four studies across three disorders. However, we found a significant lack of replicability (consistency in size and direction) of results across studies.
   Conclusions: Our systematic review revealed a lack of neuroimaging studies focusing on NSSI in clinical samples. We highlight several potential sources of bias in published studies, and conclude that future studies should implement more rigorous study designs to minimize bias risk. Despite several studies reporting associations between SB and anatomical differences in the frontal cortex, there was a lack of consistency across them. We conclude that better-powered samples, standardized neuroimaging and analytical protocols are needed to continue advancing knowledge in this field.

AB  - Background: Most research efforts toward prenatal maternal anxiety has been situated in high-income countries. In contrast, research from low-and middle-income countries has focused on maternal depression and prenatal maternal anxiety in low-and middle-income countries remains poorly understood.
   Objectives: To examine whether dimensions and attributes of current maternal anxiety assessment tools appropriately capture South Asia women's experiences of perinatal distress during pregnancy.
   Design: We conducted a rapid review with best fit framework synthesis, as we wished to map study findings to an a priori framework of dimensions measured by prenatal maternal anxiety tools.
   Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL and gray literature in November 2016. Studies were included if published in English, used any study design, and focused on women's experiences of prenatal/antenatal anxiety in South Asia.
   Review Methods: Study quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist. Study findings were extracted to an a priori framework derived from pregnancy-related anxiety tools.
   Results: From 4,177 citations, 9 studies with 19,251 women were included. Study findings mapped to the a priori framework apart from body image. A new theme, gender inequality, emerged from the studies and was overtly examined through gender disparity, gender preference of fetus, or domestic violence.
   Conclusions: Gender inequality and societal acceptability of domestic violence in South Asian women contextualizes the experience of prenatal maternal anxiety. Pregnancy-related anxiety tools should include domains related to gender inequality to better understand their influence on pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Studies have reported that exposure to pet therapy (PT) can reduce physiological and subjective stress and anxiety levels. The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the efficacy of PT as a method for reducing physiological stress levels (blood pressure and heart rate) and subjective stress and anxiety scores (self-reported stress/anxiety). Further, we examined the effects of sample characteristics and modifications to the PT (different age groups and health status of participants across samples, whether a stressor was present, and individual versus group PT) as potential moderators of the relationship between PT and stress reactivity. Our searches incorporated articles published from May 2017 and earlier in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed. This meta-analysis included 28 articles with 34 independent samples and contained a total of 1,310 participants. Using a random effects model, we determined that significant differences occurred in heart rate, self-reported anxiety, and self-reported stress after PT exposure compared with before PT. However, we did not detect significant differences in blood pressure after PT. Sample characteristics and modifications to the PT significantly moderated the effect of PT on stress responses. Our results suggest that PT can be an effective program for reducing stress reactivity.

AB  - Recent research suggests that mentors can enhance their mentees' mental health. Yet little is known about the effect of mentoring on the anxieties of the mentors themselves. We hypothesise that mentoring programmes can have a positive impact on both mentees' and mentors' mental health. In a multi-method longitudinal study, we explore empirically the effect of a formal mentoring programme in the English police force on senior police officers' levels of anxiety. In the first step of our study, we conducted a field experiment. This experiment yielded preliminary results that suggest mentors may experience marginally lower levels of anxiety and feel as if their job is more meaningful when they participate in the mentoring programme. As a second step, we qualitatively investigated the subjective experience of the participants to explain and substantiate our findings. We found that mentoring relationships provide a unique context for mentors to discuss and normalise their concerns, to share ideas for managing anxieties, and to find more meaning in their work. We discuss our findings in terms of mentoring theory and consider their practical implications for improving mental health in the workplace.

AB  - Maternal anxiety is common during the perinatal period, and despite the negative outcomes of anxiety on the mother and infant, its treatment has received limited attention. This paper describes the first review of psychological interventions for clinical anxiety during the perinatal period. A systematic search was carried out of six electronic databases. Five studies which evaluated psychological interventions for clinical anxiety in perinatal women were identified. Of the five studies included, four were open trials and one was a randomised controlled trial. Three studies evaluated group-based interventions; one study evaluated an online-delivered intervention; and one study a combined pharmacologic-psychological intervention. All participants demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety symptom severity from pre- to post-treatment. However, this review was limited to published literature evaluating treatments for clinical anxiety in perinatal women, which may have excluded important intervention studies and prevention programs, and unpublished literature. This review identifies an area of research that needs urgent attention, as very few studies have evaluated psychological treatments for perinatal anxiety. The studies included in this review demonstrate that symptoms of anxiety during the perinatal period appear to improve during treatment. Future research is needed to establish the efficacy of perinatal anxiety interventions in randomised controlled trials, whether reductions persist long term and whether benefits extend to other outcomes for the mother, infant and family.

AB  - Introduction: While several previous meta-analyses have documented the short-term efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), its long-term efficacy remains unknown. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious, debilitating, often chronic and disabling disease.
   Objective: To estimate the long-term efficacy of CBT in the treatment of PTSD by assessing the maintenance of the effect after one year of follow-up.
   Method: We performed a systematic review through electronic database searches including ISI Web of Science, PubMed, PsycInfo and Pilots. We included randomized studies in which CBT was compared with a control group (waiting list or usual care) in adults with PTSD that reported at least one year of CBT follow-up.
   Results: Our search identified 2,324 studies and 8 were selected. CBT was shown to be effective in the treatment of PTSD in the post-treatment period. Improvement in PTSD symptoms was statistically significant in relation to the control group. The improvement observed in the treatment group or single group (formed by both treatment group and control group, which was submitted to the intervention after a few weeks on the waiting list) was maintained in the follow-up.
   Conclusion: Due to the lack of control groups in the follow-up period in six of the eight studies included in this review, there is still no proper methodological basis to assert that CBT has lasting effects in the treatment of PTSD. Our study found serious methodological shortcomings and the need to fill this gap in the literature through the development of studies with robust and sophisticated designs.

AB  - Introduction: Major depressive disorder (MDD), an incapacitating mental disorder, is characterized by episodes of at least 2 weeks of apparent changes in mood, cognition, and neurovegetative functions. Many neuroimaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have examined morphometric changes in patients with MDD, but the results are not conclusive. This study aims to review the literature and perform a meta-analysis on hippocampal volume (HcV) in patients with MDD.
   Methods: Studies on HcV in patients with MDD diagnosis were identified from major databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, PsycINFO, and SciELO) using the search terms depression, major depressive disorder, MDD, unipolar, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, and hippocampus.
   Results: A meta-analysis of 29 studies fulfilling specific criteria was performed. The sample included 1327 patients and 1004 healthy participants. The studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to age, sex, age of onset, and average illness duration. However, the pooled effect size of depression was significant in both hippocampi. MDD was associated with right (-0.43; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] -0.66 to -0.21) and left (-0.40; 95%CI -0.66 to -0.15) hippocampal atrophy.
   Conclusions: MDD seems to be associated with global HcV atrophy. Larger longitudinal follow-up studies designed to analyze the influence of sociodemographic variables on this relationship are required to yield better evidence about this topic.

AB  - Objective Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and influence their mental well-being and CVD prognosis. The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety in patients with CVD. Secondary objectives were to assess the impact of CBT on cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, patient satisfaction, and quality of life.
   Methods MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and alternative sources were searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies with a control. Studies were required to assess CBT in coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, or postmyocardial infarction patients, with anxiety and/or depression. Studies were independently screened by two reviewers and critically appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The random-effects model was used to pool standardized mean differences (SMD).
   Results Twelve randomized controlled trials were included. At follow-up, depression (SMD = -0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.52 to -0.17, p < .001, I-2 = 59%) and anxiety (SMD = -0.34, 95% CI = -0.65 to -0.03, p = .03, I-2 = 71%) scores were significantly lower in CBT patients compared with controls. Change in mental health quality of life (SF-12) was also significantly greater for CBT patients, compared with controls (mean difference = 3.62, 95% CI = 0.22 to 7.02, p = .04, I-2 = 0%). No differences in patient satisfaction or cardiovascular events were evident between CBT and control groups. Among the study reports included in this meta-analysis, data specific to cardiovascular mortality were not reported.
   Conclusions Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be an effective treatment for reducing depression and anxiety in patients with CVD and should be considered in standard clinical care.

AB  - Background: Becoming a parent is often a tumultuous experience and a great challenge. The transition when a child is born is described affecting the parents and their relationship psychically, physically, mentally and emotionally. Information within care should be relevant and supportive. Furthermore information within the context of care should be relevant, supportive and helpful to parents in handling their new situation and increasing their self-reliance.
   Aim: To provide a contextualised understanding of how parents experience postnatal care in relation to information and sense of security".
   Method: A systematic search was undertaken at PubMed and CINAHL database for literature published between January 2002 and August 2017. Inclusion criteria focused on postnatal care. Eight of the studies used qualitative methods and two of the studies used quantitative methods, as a result the findings could not be combined using meta-analysis or meta-synthesis, instead narrative synthesis of the findings were used.
   Results: Ten studies were included. The analysis revealed three categories related to parent's experience of information and sense of security during the postnatal period. These categories were; Expectations on the care; Own resources; and Confirmation. Support from staff and family is described as significant for the parents sense of security. During the first postnatal week, the emotions were characterized by anxiety and/or fear. Parents prefer a "non-judgmental" attitude from the staff and to be met as an individual.
   Conclusion: Family-centred care such as continuity, participation, individually adaptation, consistent, information and preparation for parenting appear to be important components for parents' sense of security in postnatal care.

   Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of web-based mindfulness interventions in clinical mental health populations. Secondary aims were to explore the impact of study variables on the effectiveness of web-based mindfulness interventions.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating the effects of web-based mindfulness interventions on clinical populations.
   Results: The search strategy yielded 12 eligible studies. Web-based mindfulness interventions were effective in reducing depression in the total clinical sample (n=656 g=-0.609, P=.004) and in the anxiety disorder subgroup (n=313, g=-0.651, P<.001), but not in the depression disorder subgroup (n=251, P=.18). Similarly, web-based mindfulness interventions significantly reduced anxiety in the total clinical sample (n=756, g=-0.433, P=.004) and the anxiety disorder subgroup (n=413, g=-0.719, P<.001), but not in the depression disorder group (n=251, g=-0.213, P=.28). Finally, web-based mindfulness interventions improved quality of life and functioning in the total sample (n=591, g=0.362, P=.02) in the anxiety disorder subgroup (n=370, g=0.550, P=.02) and mindfulness skills in the total clinical sample (n=251, g=0.724, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Results support the effectiveness of web-based mindfulness interventions in reducing depression and anxiety and in enhancing quality of life and mindfulness skills, particularly in those with clinical anxiety. Results should be interpreted with caution given the high heterogeneity of web-based mindfulness interventions and the low number of studies included.

AB  - The current insight into the neurobiological pathogenesis underlying social anxiety disorder (SAD) is still rather limited. We implemented a meta-analysis to explore the neuroanatomical basis of SAD. We undertook a systematic search of studies comparing gray matter volume (GMV) differences between SAD patients and healthy controls (HC) using a whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach. The anisotropic effect size version of seed-based d mapping (AES-SDM) meta-analysis was conducted to explore the GMV differences of SAD patients compared with HC. We included eleven studies with 470 SAD patients and 522 HC in the current meta-analysis. In the main meta-analysis, relative to HC, SAD patients showed larger GMVs in the left precuneus, right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and supplementary motor area (SMA), as well as smaller GMV in the left putamen. In the subgroup analyses, compared with controls, adult patients (age >= 18 years) with SAD exhibited larger GMVs in the left precuneus, right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), MOG and SMA, as well as a smaller GMV in the left thalamus; SAD patients without comorbid depressive disorder exhibited larger GMVs in the left superior parietal gyrus and precuneus, right inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, MTG and superior temporal gyrus (STG), as well as a smaller GMV in the bilateral thalami; and currently drug-free patients with SAD exhibited a smaller GMV in the left thalamus compared with HC while no larger GMVs were found. For SAD patients with different clinical features, our study revealed directionally consistent larger cortical GMVs and smaller subcortical GMVs, including locationally consistent larger precuneus and thalamic deficits in the left brain. Age, comorbid depressive disorder and concomitant medication use of the patients might be potential confounders of SAD at the neuroanatomical level.

   To investigate which foods are the most nutrient dense sources of nutrients demonstrated by the scientific literature to play a role in the prevention and promotion of recovery from depressive disorders.
   METHODS
   A systematic literature review was conducted to derive a list of Antidepressant Nutrients from the 34 nutrients known to be essential for humans using level of evidence criteria. Nutritional data was extracted for a subset of foods with a high content of at least 1 Antidepressant Nutrient using a USDA database. These foods were analyzed for Antidepressant Nutrient density resulting in an Antidepressant Food Score (AFS). Plant and animal foods were analyzed separately.
   RESULTS
   Twelve Antidepressant Nutrients relate to the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders: Folate, iron, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), magnesium, potassium, selenium, thiamine, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and zinc. The highest scoring foods were bivalves such as oysters and mussels, various seafoods, and organ meats for animal foods. The highest scoring plant foods were leafy greens, lettuces, peppers, and cruciferous vegetables.
   CONCLUSION
   The AFS is based on a nutrient profiling system devised to identify foods with the highest nutrient density of nutrients with clinical evidence to support their role in depressive disorders. This list of foods and food categories with the highest density of the 12 Antidepressant Nutrients, the Antidepressant Foods, should be considered by researchers in the design of future intervention studies and clinicians as dietary options to support prevention and recovery from depression disorders.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes intellectual disability. It is a leading known genetic cause of autism. In addition to cognitive, social, and communication deficits, humans with FXS demonstrate abnormal sensory processing including sensory hypersensitivity. Sensory hypersensitivity commonly manifests as auditory, tactile, or visual defensiveness or avoidance. Clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological studies consistently show auditory hypersensitivity, impaired habituation to repeated sounds, and reduced auditory attention in humans with FXS. Children with FXS also exhibit significant visuospatial impairments. Studies in infants and toddlers with FXS have documented impairments in processing texture-defined motion stimuli, temporal flicker, perceiving ordinal numerical sequence, and the ability to maintain the identity of dynamic object information during occlusion. Consistent with the observations in humans with FXS, fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene knockout (KO) rodent models of FXS also show seizures, abnormal visual-evoked responses, auditory hypersensitivity, and abnormal processing at multiple levels of the auditory system, including altered acoustic startle responses. Among other sensory symptoms, individuals with FXS exhibit tactile defensiveness. Fmr1 KO mice also show impaired encoding of tactile stimulation frequency and larger size of receptive fields in the somatosensory cortex. Since sensory deficits are relatively more tractable from circuit mechanisms and developmental perspectives than more complex social behaviors, the focus of this review is on clinical, functional, and structural studies that outline the auditory, visual, and somatosensory processing deficits in FXS. The similarities in sensory phenotypes between humans with FXS and animal models suggest a likely conservation of basic sensory processing circuits across species and may provide a translational platform to not just develop biomarkers but also to understand underlying mechanisms. We argue that preclinical studies in animal models of FXS can facilitate the ongoing search for new therapeutic approaches in FXS by understanding mechanisms of basic sensory processing circuits and behaviors that are conserved across species.

AB  - Background: Arab Americans are a historically understudied minority group in the United States and their health needs and risks have been poorly documented. We aim to provide an updated comprehensive review of the literature on Arab American physical and mental health and provide suggestions for future work in this field.
   Methods: A comprehensive review of the English language medical and public health literature published prior to 2017 identified through multiple database searches was conducted with search terms describing Arab Americans and health outcomes and behaviors. The literature was qualitatively summarized by health behavior (vaccination, tobacco use, drug and alcohol use, and physical activity), health outcome (diabetes, mental health, cardiovascular disease, cancer, women's, and child health), and populations at increased risk of poor health outcomes (adolescents and the elderly).
   Results: The majority of studies identified exploring Arab American health have been published since 2009 with an increase in the number of longitudinal and intervention studies done with this population. The majority of research is being undertaken among individuals living in ethnic enclaves due to the lack of an ethnic or racial identifier that may help identify Arab Americans from population-based studies. Studies highlight the conflicting evidence in the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease based on study sample, an increased understanding of cancer incidence and barriers to identification, and an increased level of knowledge regarding mental health and sexual health needs in the population. Information on health behaviors has also increased, with a better understanding of physical activity, alcohol and drug use, and vaccination.
   Conclusion: More research on Arab American health is needed to identify risks and needs of this marginalized population given the current social and political climate in the United States, especially with regard to acculturation status and immigrant generation status. We provide recommendations on approaches that may help improve our understanding of Arab American health.

AB  - Context: High levels of worries and stress in pregnancy result in negative pregnancy outcomes and postnatal depression. Despite recommendations for routine psychological evaluation of pregnant women, there is a lack of scales specifically designed to measure stress during pregnancy.
   Evidence Acquisition: PubMed, Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases were searched for English articles published during 1983 - 2016. The consensus-based standards for the selection of health status measurement instruments (COSMIN) checklist was used for assessing the methodological quality of the studies.
   Results: A total of 27 studies were included, and 27 different instruments were identified. Validity and reliability assessments were performed in all the papers. According to the COSMIN checklist, the overall quality of the papers was fair to excellent. Among all the instruments, the pregnancy worries and stress questionnaire (PWSQ) and pregnancy-related anxiety questionnaire (PRAQ) showed moderate to strong evidence in most of the evaluated measurement properties.
   Conclusions: A few scales with acceptable theoretical and psychometric properties are available for the measurement of pregnancy worries. General tools previously adopted to assess worries and stress in pregnancy need further psychometric testing to confirm their reliability and suitability for the prenatal period. The results of this study indicated that while none of the evaluated tools was completely suitable for the assessment of worries and stress in pregnancy, the PWSQ and PRAQ showed moderate to strong evidence in most of the examined measurement properties.

AB  - The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the association between maternal chronic medical conditions (CMCs) and peripartum mental illness. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched to September 2017. Data were extracted and quality was assessed using standardized instruments. We generated unadjusted and adjusted pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. The review included 16 papers representing 12 studies and 1,626,260 women. CMCs overall were associated with peripartum mental illness overall (adjusted pooled odds ratios (aPOR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 1.63). CMCs overall were associated with antepartum (aPOR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.81) and postpartum mental illness separately (aPOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.85) and with peripartum depression (aPOR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.67) and anxiety separately (aPOR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.35, 1.95). No studies examined bipolar or psychotic disorders. Diabetes (aPOR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.69), hypertension/heart disease (aPOR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.45), migraine (aPOR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.54), and other neurological disorders (aPOR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.77), but not asthma, were each associated with peripartum mental illness. Findings suggest that mental health resources should be integrated in medical settings where pregnant and postpartum women with CMCs are treated.

AB  - Objectives Mental disorders are associated with significant functional impairment, sickness absence and disability. The consequences of sickness absence warrant investigation into interventions aimed at enhancing return to work (RTW) for workers with mental disorders. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim to synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at enhancing RTW in sick-listed workers with mental disorders.
   Methods EconLit, Embase, PsychInfo, PubMed, Svemed+ andWeb of Science were searched for peer-reviewed, randomised or controlled studies assessing employment-related outcomes of interventions. A meta-analysis was conducted and meta-regressions were performed to explore prespecified potential sources of heterogeneity between studies.
   Results The literature search yielded 3777 publications of which 42 (n=38938) were included in the systematic review and 32 (n=9459) had appropriate data for the meta-analysis. The pooled effect size (95% CI) was 0.14 (0.07 to 0.22). Meta-regressions revealed that the heterogeneity could not be attributed to study quality, timing of the intervention or length of the intervention. However, it could be partly explained by number of components included in the intervention, if the intervention included contact to the work place and by the disorder targeted by the intervention.
   Conclusions The results reveal strong evidence for interventions including contact to the work place and multicomponent interventions and moderate evidence for interventions including graded RTW. In addition, the results provide strong evidence for interventions targeting stress compared with interventions targeting other mental disorders. The findings point to important implications for policy and design of future interventions.

AB  - Copper (Cu) has been associated with mental disorders such as autism and epilepsy. So far, publications evaluating copper levels in patients with depressive disorder showed conflicted results. To derive a comprehensive estimation of the relationship between body burden of copper and depressive disorder and explore the possible role of copper in mental health, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Relevant published data were obtained by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) before October 10, 2017. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (95%Cl) was calculated using STATA 12.0. A total of 21 studies with 1487 patients and 943 controls were collected in this meta-analysis. Pooled analysis found that patients with depression had higher blood levels of copper than the controls without depression, while there was no difference of copper content in hair between the two groups. Subgroup analysis suggested that age had influence on the relationship between copper and depression. No evidence of publication bias was observed. This meta-analysis suggests that increased levels of blood copper might be associated with depressive disorder and therefore the possible role of copper as a biomarker of depression.

AB  - This study aimed to estimate the level of burnout in mental health professionals and to identify specific determinants of burnout in this population. A systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, PsychINFO/Ovid, Embase, CINAHL/EBSCO and Web of Science was conducted for original research published between 1997 and 2017. Sixty-two studies were identified as meeting the study criteria for the systematic review. Data on the means, standard deviations, and prevalence of the dimensions of burnout were extracted from 33 studies and included in the meta-analysis (n = 9409). The overall estimated pooled prevalence for emotional exhaustion was 40% (CI 31%-48%) for depersonalisation was 22% (CI 15%-29%) and for low levels of personal accomplishment was 19% (CI 13%-25%). The random effects estimate of the mean scores on the Maslach Burnout Inventory indicate that the average mental health professional has high levels of emotional exhaustion [mean 21.11 (95% CI 19.98, 22.24)], moderate levels of depersonalisation [mean 6.76 (95% CI 6.11, 7.42)] but retains reasonable levels of personal accomplishment [mean 34.60 (95% CI 32.99, 36.21)]. Increasing age was found to be associated with an increased risk of depersonalisation but also a heightened sense of personal accomplishment. Work-related factors such as workload and relationships at work, are key determinants for burnout, while role clarity, a sense of professional autonomy, a sense of being fairly treated, and access to regular clinical supervision appear to be protective. Staff working in community mental health teams may be more vulnerable to burnout than those working in some specialist community teams, e.g., assertive outreach, crisis teams.

AB  - Objective: To present a systematic review of the literature on the associations between early social environment, early life adversity, and social cognition in major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.
   Method: Relevant studies were identified via electronic and manual searches of the literature and included articles written in English and published in peer-reviewed journals up to May 2018. Quality assessment was performed using the quality evaluation scale employed in previous systematic reviews.
   Results: A total of 25 studies were included in the systematic review with the quality assessment scores ranging from 3 to 6 (out of 6). The vast majority of the studies reviewed showed a significant association between early childhood social experience, including both insecure attachment and adversity relating to neglect or abuse, and poorer social cognitive performance.
   Conclusion: We discuss these findings in the context of an attachment model, suggesting that childhood social adversity may result in poor internal working models, selective attention toward emotional stimuli and greater difficulties with emotional self-regulation. We outline some of the steps required to translate this understanding of social cognitive dysfunction in major psychiatric disorders into a target for interventions that mitigate the adverse effects of childhood maltreatment and poor parental attachment on social cognition.

Among circulating blood-derived markers there has been a significant amount of research into inflammatory markers, neurotrophins and oxidative stress markers.AimsTo synthesise and interpret existing evidence of inflammatory markers, neurotrophins and oxidative stress markers in bipolar disorder focusing on the mood phase of illness.MethodFollowing PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted for studies investigating peripheral biomarkers in bipolar disorder compared with healthy controls. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, SciELO and Web of Science, and separated studies by bipolar mood phase (mania, depression and euthymia). Extracted data on each biomarker in separate mood phases were synthesised using random-effects model meta-analyses.ResultsIn total, 53 studies were included, comprising 2467 cases and 2360 controls. Fourteen biomarkers were identified from meta-analyses of three or more studies. No biomarker differentiated mood phase in bipolar disorder individually. Biomarker meta-analyses suggest a combination of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein/interleukin-6, brain derived neurotrophic factor/tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- and soluble TNF- receptor 1 can differentiate specific mood phase in bipolar disorder. Several other biomarkers of interest were identified.ConclusionsCombining biomarker results could differentiate individuals with bipolar disorder from healthy controls and indicate a specific mood-phase signature. Future research should seek to test these combinations of biomarkers in longitudinal studies.Declaration of interestNone.

AB  - In the year 2000, an important art therapy literature review addressed an essential question-does art therapy work? It discussed 17 articles dealing with the issue of the effectiveness of art therapy. Two decades later, this research field has extended its scope and is flourishing. Several current reviews of research work have described the broad range of methods implemented today, which includes qualitative and quantitative studies; other reviews have focused on art therapy with specific populations, or by age group. The aim of this systematic literature review is to contribute to the ongoing discussion in the field by exploring the latest studies dealing with the effectiveness of art therapy with a broad scope of adult clients. We conducted a comprehensive search in four databases and review of every quantitative article that has addressed outcome measures in the art therapy field from 2000 to 2017. This paper presents the latest 27 studies in the field that examine the effectiveness of art therapy with adult clients and divides them into seven clinical categories: cancer patients, clients coping with a variety of medical conditions, mental health clients, clients coping with trauma, prison inmates, the elderly, and clients who have not been diagnosed with specific issues but face ongoing daily challenges. It underscores the potential effects of art therapy on these seven clinical populations, and recommends the necessary expansions for future research in the field, to enable art therapy research to take further strides forward.

AB  - Background: There is a large treatment gap for common mental disorders (CMD), with wide variation by world region. This review identifies factors associated with formal health service utilisation for CMD in the general adult population, and compares evidence from high-income countries (HIC) with that from low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC).
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Scopus in May 2016. Eligibility criteria were: published in English, in peer-reviewed journals; using population-based samples; employing standardised CMD measures; measuring use of formal health services for mental health reasons by people with CMD; testing the association between this outcome and any other factor(s). Risk of bias was assessed using the adapted Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We synthesised the results using "best fit framework synthesis", with reference to the Andersen socio-behavioural model.
   Results: Fifty two studies met inclusion criteria. 46 (88%) were from HIC.
   Predisposing factors: There was evidence linking increased likelihood of service use with female gender; Caucasian ethnicity; higher education levels; and being unmarried; although this was not consistent across all studies.
   Need factors: There was consistent evidence of an association between service utilisation and self-evaluated health status; duration of symptoms; disability; comorbidity; and panic symptoms. Associations with symptom severity were frequently but less consistently reported.
   Enabling factors: The evidence did not support an association with income or rural residence. Inconsistent evidence was found for associations between unemployment or having health insurance and use of services. There was a lack of research from LMIC and on contextual level factors.
   Conclusion: In HIC, failure to seek treatment for CMD is associated with less disabling symptoms and lack of perceived need for healthcare, consistent with suggestions that "treatment gap" statistics over-estimate unmet need for care as perceived by the target population. Economic factors and urban/rural residence appear to have little effect on treatment-seeking rates. Strategies to address potential healthcare inequities for men, ethnic minorities, the young and the elderly in HIC require further evaluation. The generalisability of these findings beyond HIC is limited. Future research should examine factors associated with health service utilisation for CMD in LMIC, and the effect of health systems and neighbourhood factors.

The capacity to empathize may be impaired in certain major neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs), affecting not only the patient, but also the caregivers.
   METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies investigating empathy changes, using an objective scale, in patients with MNCDs.
   RESULTS: The Interpersonal Reactivity Index was most commonly used to evaluate empathy in this population. Impairments in cognitive but not affective empathy were found in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and may be attributable to overall cognitive decline. Patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have demonstrated severe deficits in empathy, correlating with greater caregiver burden. Empathy changes in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, and Parkinson's disease dementia have not yet been studied. Intranasal oxytocin has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for empathy loss, but it has not been explored yet in patients with MNCDs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers need to be educated about empathy loss, which is an important part of the disease process in AD and FTD. Future research should further assess empathy changes in other MNCDs, as well as explore novel treatment options in this field.

AB  - Objectives: Alcohol misuse and depression are commonly co-occurring conditions. To date, no review has examined the most efficacious treatment model for psychosocial treatment of co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression. This systematic review determined the: (i) methodological quality of publications examining psychosocial treatment of co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression using a sequential, parallel or integrated treatment model; and (ii) effectiveness of each dual treatment model compared to single treatment for those with co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression.
   Methods: PubMed, Medline and PsycInfo databases were searched for studies which were included if they involved treatment for alcohol misuse and depression and could be classified into one of the three treatment models. Included studies were assessed using the Cochrane's Effective Practice and Organisation of Care risk of bias criteria. Relevant study characteristics and outcomes were extracted and are presented in a narrative review format.
   Results: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. None were categorised as low risk on the risk of bias criteria. No studies examined a sequential model of treatment, three examined a parallel model and four examined an integrated model of dual-focussed treatment. The studies examining the parallel model and two out of four studies examining the effectiveness of an integrated model demonstrated greater improvement for alcohol or depression outcomes compared to control conditions.
   Conclusion: Evidence for the psychosocial treatment of co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression is limited to a handful of studies. The evidence has several methodological limitations, which impact the interpretation of the findings. Therefore, while international guidelines recommend integrated dual-focussed treatment for co-occurring conditions, there is little evidence supporting the superiority of this treatment format for co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression. High-quality research demonstrating improvements in patient outcomes is required to ensure recommendations for clinical practice are based on strong empirical evidence.

AB  - Introduction: Common mental disorders (CMDs) including depressive and anxiety disorders during antenatal period is reported to affect both mother and child health outcomes. There is scarce evidence about burden of CMDs during pregnancy from Lower and Middle Income Countries.
   Objective: To review the evidence about the burden of common mental disorders among pregnant women
   Methods: Major databases were searched systematically for English language studies on prevalence of CMDs. Quality assessment of studies was done with the modified version of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-analytical studies.
   Results: Twenty three studies were included in the review. The prevalence of CMDs among pregnant women ranged from 1%-37%. Depression was more commonly studied (ranged from 1%-30%). Prevalence of GAD ranged from 1%-26%. Factors commonly associated with CMDs were lower SES, intimate partner violence, history of previous episode of CMDs, history of mental illness in family and unmarried status. Effect of CMDs on child health outcome was also detected.
   Conclusion: CMDs are common during pregnancy with varying prevalence depending on various settings and scales used.

AB  - Background: Emerging evidence suggests that cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) is effective in altering interpretation biases and reducing anxiety in adults. Less is known about the impact of CBM-I in young people, but some recent findings, including a meta-analysis of combined cognitive bias modification of interpretation and attention techniques, have cast doubt on its clinical utility. Given the current debate, this meta-analysis sought to establish the independent effects of CBM-I on interpretations biases and anxiety in youth. Methods: Studies were identified through a systematic literature search of PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, Web of Science and EMBASE between January 1992 and March 2017. Eligible studies aimed to target interpretation biases; did not combine CBM-I with another intervention; included a control condition; randomly allocated participants to conditions; assessed interpretation bias and/or anxiety as an outcome; included individuals up to age 18; and did not present previously reported data. Reference lists of included articles were checked for further eligible studies, and authors were contacted for unpublished data. Results: We identified 26 studies meeting eligibility criteria that included in the meta-analysis. CBM-I had moderate effects on negative and positive interpretations (g = -0.70 and g = -0.52, respectively) and a small but significant effect on anxiety assessed after training (g = -0.17) and after a stressor (g = -0.34). No significant moderators were identified. Conclusions: In contrast to previous meta-analytic findings, our results indicate that CBM-I has potential but weak anxiolytic effects in youth. Our findings suggest that it may be premature to disregard the potential value of CBM-I research and further research in this field is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Memantine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist currently used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease as an approved indication. However, as knowledge of signaling pathways is increasing, the therapeutic potential of memantine is being applied for the treatment of various psychiatric illnesses.
   METHODS: The PubMed online database was searched for the use of memantine in various psychiatric disorders. Case studies, open-label trials, and controlled trials from the search were included.
   RESULTS: Memantine monotherapy was found to exert efficacy in several neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, binge eating disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. For posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, memantine was found efficacious in augmentation with other medications. In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), memantine was used as both an augmentation to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and standalone therapy, and most published studies found it to improve OCD symptoms. For schizophrenia, memantine has been reported to be consistently effective for negative symptoms only. The manic phase of bipolar disorder also appears to benefit from memantine. The depressive phase of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder did not respond significantly to memantine. Catatonia as a symptom of various disorders improved in several case studies when memantine was used in combination with other medications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Memantine may have several therapeutic applications in psychiatry, reflecting the involvement of glutamate pathways in multiple psychiatric disorders.

AB  - AimThe impact of dysfunctional coping strategies during the prodromal phase of psychosis has recently been explored by several studies. What has yet to be clarified is whether maladaptive coping is evident in the prodromal phase and the impact that this might have on symptomatic and functional outcomes. The aim of this study was to review the findings on coping in individuals at ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR) in relation to symptoms and level of functioning.
   MethodsOriginal articles were identified by searching 7 databases using the terms prodrom*, ultra high risk, clinical high risk, at-risk mental state, coping style*, coping strategies, cope, coping and psychosis. We included original articles that: (1) reported a measure of coping and (2) evaluated UHR individuals.
   ResultsA total of 9 original articles of 335 that examined coping in individuals at high risk of psychosis were included. UHR subjects were more likely to use maladaptive coping strategies than healthy controls and were more likely to use emotion-focussed than task-oriented coping. Maladaptive coping was associated with higher levels of negative symptoms, whereas positive coping was associated with fewer negative symptoms. The coping style employed by UHR individuals was found to negatively influence their psychosocial functioning.
   ConclusionsIt is still unclear whether coping heightens or reduces the likelihood of transition to psychosis in relation to other factors, including environment. Longitudinal studies could clarify whether coping styles remain stable after the onset of psychosis or whether the emerging psychotic symptoms influence the coping strategies.

AB  - Objective Staging of psychiatric disorders is gaining momentum and the purpose of this review is to examine whether major mood disorders can be defined according to stages.
   Methods In April 2018 the PubMed electronic data base was scrutinized by a combination of various search terms like "major depressive disorder and staging," "bipolar disorder and neuroprogression," etc. To incorporate the latest findings the search was limited to the last 10 years. Both original and review articles were examined by reading the abstracts, and papers which were found to be particularly applicable were read in full and their reference lists were also consulted.
   Results A significant increase occurred in the number of papers published on the topic of staging of mood disorders. Staging formats were found for both major mood disorders, with the caveat that many more articles were discovered for bipolar disorder. Current evidence points to allostatic load and neuroprogression as the basis for staging of mood disorders.
   Conclusion Principal affective illnesses may be characterized by distinct stages, for instance early, intermediate and late. These phases inform the management so that clinicians should incorporate the staging schema into everyday practice and implement treatment strategies according to the phase of the illness.

AB  - Males and females sometimes significantly differ in their propensity to develop neurological disorders. Females suffer more from mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, whereas males are more susceptible to deficits in the dopamine system including Parkinson's disease (PD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. Despite this, biological sex is rarely considered when making treatment decisions in neurological disorders. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying sex differences in the healthy and diseased brain will help to devise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies optimal for each sex. Thus, the aim of this review is to discuss the available evidence on sex differences in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders regarding prevalence, progression, symptoms and response to therapy. We also discuss the sex-related factors such as gonadal sex hormones and sex chromosome genes and how these might help to explain some of the clinically observed sex differences in these disorders. In particular, we highlight the emerging role of the Y-chromosome gene, SRY, in the male brain and its potential role as a male-specific risk factor for disorders such as PD, autism, and ADHD in many individuals.

AB  - Advances in the field of Pediatric Oncology have led to increased survival rates in children with cancer, and addressing the emotional well-being and quality of life of this specific population is a critical component of care. Mind-body therapies (MBTs) are an adjuvant modality of treatment that appears to have a positive impact on patient quality of life, patient mental health, and family perceptions toward illness. In this review, we describe several evidence-based MBTs, such as art therapy, meditation, prayer, music therapy, hypnosis and relaxation techniques, their use, and our personal experience with MBT in our institution.
   Current data suggests that MBTs have been effective in decreasing symptoms related to oncologic pathology in children. Based on experience in our institution, the administration of these therapies can be expanded with the use of technology and also foster family inclusion in care, which can lead to improved quality of life for the patient and family. Further studies are warranted to ascertain the effects of MBTs in childhood cancer.
   MBTs are increasingly important in the care of youth with oncologic disease. It is necessary to increase the quantity and quality of research for the selection and inclusion of MBT in this population.

AB  - Background: Interest in social cognition in bipolar disorder (BD) has increased considerably over the past decade, with studies highlighting major impairments, especially in mental state reasoning, even during euthymia. A causal relationship between social cognition deficits and social functioning has already been established in individuals with schizophrenia, but there is still little information about links between social cognition and social functioning in BD. Our aim was therefore to review the relationship between functional outcome and social cognition in patients with BD.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Relevant articles were identified through literature searches in the MEDLINE/PubMed, EBSCOHost and Google Scholar databases for the years 2000-2017, using the keywords bipolar, social cognition, theory of mind, mentalizing, emotion recognition, emotion processing, and functioning. A total of 20 studies met our inclusion/exclusion criteria.
   Results: We found that functioning was significantly correlated with three domains of social cognition (ToM, emotion processing, and attribution bias). Twelve of 13 studies reported a correlation with emotion processing, but a correlation with ToM was only found in three of the 11 studies that assessed it. Six studies found an effect of depressive symptoms on emotion processing and no significant association was found with manic symptomatology.
   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, the present review is the first to specifically explore the relationship between social cognition and social functioning in patients with BD. This exploration is of interest, as it enhances current understanding of this disorder and, by so doing, should improve patient outcomes. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Negative affect and impaired emotion regulation skills are prevalent in patients with delusions and contribute to delusion formation and maintenance. This review evaluates existing research on interventions targeting negative affect and emotional processes as a causal mechanism on the pathway to delusions. A MEDLINE and PsycINFO search identified 7,909 articles. Five studies with randomized-controlled designs and three with uncontrolled designs met the inclusion criteria. Interventions comprised cognitive-behavioral and compassion-focused techniques. Overall, the review studies found positive intervention effects on negative affect and delusions. Where significant, controlled effect sizes ranged from small to large for negative affect and from moderate to large for delusions. Thus, existing research indicates that negative affect in patients with delusions can be modified by psychological therapy and points toward a carryover effect from the reduction of negative affect to a reduction of delusions. More large-scale randomized-controlled studies are needed to be able to draw valid conclusions on which types of interventions are most beneficial.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review focused on Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) services delivered under normal clinic conditions that included the patient outcomes of: 1) access/utilization of behavioral health services, 2) health status, and 3) satisfaction.
   Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, comprehensive database searches and rigorous coding procedures rendered 36 articles meeting inclusion criteria. The principle summary measures of odd ratios or Cohen's d effect sizes were reported.
   Results: Due to significant limitations in the methodological rigor of reviewed studies, robust findings only emerged for healthcare utilization: PCBH is associated with shorter wait-times for treatment, higher likelihood of engaging in care, and attending a greater number of visits. Several small, uncontrolled studies report emerging evidence that functioning, depression, and anxiety improve overtime. There was no evidence of greater improvement in patient health status when PCBH was compared to other active treatments. The limited available evidence supports that patient satisfaction with PCBH services is high.
   Conclusions: The implementation of PCBH services is ahead of the science supporting the usefulness of these services. Patient outcomes for PCBH are weaker than outcomes for Collaborative Care. More rigorous investigations of patient outcomes associated with PCBH are needed to allow for optimization of services.

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorders and depression are frequent conditions in childhood and adolescence. eMental healthcare technologies may improve access to services, but their uptake within health systems is limited.
   Objective: The objective of this review was to examine and describe how the implementation of eMental healthcare technologies for anxiety disorders and depression in children and adolescents has been studied.
   Methods: We conducted a search of 5 electronic databases and gray literature. Eligible studies were those that assessed an eMental healthcare technology for treating or preventing anxiety or depression, included children or adolescents (<18 years), or their parents or healthcare providers and reported findings on technology implementation. The methodological quality of studies was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Outcomes of interest were based on 8 implementation outcomes: acceptability (satisfaction with a technology), adoption (technology uptake and utilization), appropriateness ("fitness for purpose"), cost (financial impact of technology implementation), feasibility (extent to which a technology was successfully used), fidelity (implementation as intended), penetration ("spread" or "reach" of the technology), and sustainability (maintenance or integration of a technology within a healthcare service). For extracted implementation outcome data, we coded favorable ratings on measurement scales as "positive results" and unfavorable ratings on measurement scales as "negative results." Those studies that reported both positive and negative findings were coded as having "mixed results."
   Results: A total of 46 studies met the inclusion criteria, the majority of which were rated as very good to excellent in methodological quality. These studies investigated eMental healthcare technologies for anxiety (n=23), depression (n=18), or both anxiety and depression (n=5). Studies of technologies for anxiety evaluated the following: (1) acceptability (78%) reported high levels of satisfaction, (2) adoption (43%) commonly reported positive results, and (3) feasibility (43%) reported mixed results. Studies of technologies for depression evaluated the following: (1) appropriateness (56%) reported moderate helpfulness and (2) acceptability (50%) described a mix of both positive and negative findings. Studies of technologies designed to aid anxiety and depression commonly reported mixed experiences with acceptability and adoption and positive findings for appropriateness of the technologies for treatment. Across all studies, cost, fidelity, and penetration and sustainability were the least measured implementation outcomes.
   Conclusions: Acceptability of eMental healthcare technology is high among users and is the most commonly investigated implementation outcome. Perceptions of the appropriateness and adoption of eMental healthcare technology were varied. Implementation research that identifies, evaluates, and reports on costs, sustainability, and fidelity to clinical guidelines is crucial for making high-quality eMental healthcare available to children and adolescents.

AB  - Background: Since its emergence in the 1980s, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has become a reputable evidence-based psychological therapy for certain disorders. Trials examining the efficacy of ACT are spread across a broad spectrum of presentations, such as chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. Nevertheless, ACT has very rarely been trialed as an intervention for suicidal ideation (SI) or deliberate self-harm (DSH).
   Objective: The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy of ACT in reducing SI and DSH and to examine the suitability of reported SI, DSH, and other measures in determining the efficacy of ACT.
   Methods: We systematically reviewed studies on ACT as intervention for SI and self-harm. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were searched. The reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were examined to identify additional publications. Search terms were identified with reference to the terminology used in previous review papers on ACT and suicide prevention. The study design was not restricted to randomized controlled trials. Screening was completed by 2 reviewers, and all duplicates were removed. Publications were excluded if they were not published in English, were multicomponent therapy or were not based on ACT, or lacked a validated measure or structured reporting of SI/ DSH outcomes.
   Results: After removing the duplicates, 554 articles were screened for relevance. Following the screening, 5 studies that used ACT as an intervention for suicidal or self-harming individuals were identified. The studies used diverse methodologies and included 2 case studies, 2 pre-post studies, and 1 mHealth randomized controlled trial.
   Conclusions: The review found that ACT is effective in reducing SI in the 2 pre-post studies but not in other studies. However, given the small number and lack of methodological rigor of the studies included in this review, insufficient evidence exists for the recommendation of ACT as an intervention for SI or DSH.

AB  - Background: Mindfulness as a positive mental health intervention approach has been increasingly applied to address depression in young people. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in the treatment of depression among adolescents and young adults.
   Methods: Electronic databases and references in articles were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating MBSR and reporting outcomes for depressive symptoms among young people aged 12 to 25 years were included. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted by two reviewers independently. Hedges' g with a 95% confidence interval was calculated to represent intervention effect.
   Results: Eighteen RCTs featuring 2,042 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Relative to the control groups (e.g., no treatment, treatment as usual, or active control), MBSR had moderate effects in reducing depressive symptoms at the end of intervention (Hedges' g = -0.45). No statistically significant effects were found in follow-up (Hedges' g = -0.24) due to a lack of statistical power. Meta-regression found that the average treatment effect might be moderated by control condition, treatment duration, and participants' baseline depression.
   Conclusion: MBSR had moderate effects in reducing depression in young people at posttest. Future research is needed to assess the follow-up effects of MBSR on depressive symptoms among adolescents and young adults.

AB  - Background: Up to half of Western children and adolescents experience at least one type of childhood adversity. Individuals with a history of childhood adversity have an increased risk of psychopathology. Resilience enhancing factors reduce the risk of psychopathology following childhood adversity. A comprehensive overview of empirically supported resilience factors is critically important for interventions aimed to increase resilience in young people. Moreover, such an overview may aid the development of novel resilience theories. Therefore, we conducted the first systematic review of social, emotional, cognitive and/or behavioral resilience factors after childhood adversity.
   Methods: We systematically searched Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Scopus (e.g., including MEDLINE) for English, Dutch, and German literature. We included cohort studies that examined whether a resilience factor was a moderator and/or a mediator for the relationship between childhood adversity and psychopathology in young people (mean age 13-24). Therefore, studies were included if the resilience factor was assessed prior to psychopathology, and childhood adversity was assessed no later than the resilience factor. Study data extraction was based on the STROBE report and study quality was assessed with an adapted version of Downs and Black's scale. The preregistered protocol can be found at: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42016051978.
   Results: The search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 were included (eight nationalities, study sample n range: 59-6780). We found empirical support for 13 of 25 individual-level (e.g., high self-esteem, low rumination), six of 12 family-level (e.g., high family cohesion, high parental involvement), and one of five community-level resilience factors (i.e., high social support), to benefit mental health in young people exposed to childhood adversity. Single vs. multiple resilience factor models supported the notion that resilience factors should not be studied in isolation, and that interrelations between resilience factors should be taken into account when predicting psychopathology after childhood adversity.
   Conclusions: Interventions that improve individual, family, and/or social support resilience factors may reduce the risk of psychopathology following childhood adversity. Future research should scrutinize whether resilience factors function as a complex interrelated system that benefits mental health resilience after childhood adversity.

AB  - Among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), depression is prevalent and disabling, impacting both health outcomes and quality of life. There is a critical need for alternative pharmacological methods to treat PD depression, as mainstream antidepressant drugs are largely ineffective in this population. Currently, there are no recommendations for the optimal treatment of PD neuropsychiatric symptoms. Given the dual antidepressant and anti-dyskinetic effects of ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists for PD, this review aims to examine the current evidence of NMDA antagonists for treating neuropsychiatric symptoms, including memantine, amantadine, ketamine, dizoclopine, and d-cycloserine. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. We also searched the following databases up to March 1, 2018: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The following keywords were used: NMDA antagonist and Parkinson's disease. Two authors independently reviewed the articles identified from the search using specific selection criteria, focusing on studies of mood, psychiatric condition, depression, cognition, and quality of life, and the consensus was reached on the 20 studies included. There is a preliminary evidence that NMDA antagonists may modulate psychiatric symptoms in PD. However, current evidence of psychiatric symptommodifying effects is inconclusive and requires that further trials be conducted in PD. The repurposing of old NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine for depression and newer therapies, such as rapastinel, suggests that there is an emerging place for modulating the glutamatergic system for treating non-motor symptoms in PD.

AB  - International marriage migration is now one of the most prominent forms of migration in Asia, and the number of women migrating to South Korea for marriage has increased dramatically in the last two decades. In this article, we provide a systematic review regarding the health status and health-related issues of international marriage immigrant women. The literature search identified 620 articles, of which 53 studies are presented in the article. Three overarching categories including six subcategories were identified according to the research focus; 'Environmental factors of health' including social support and barriers, 'Health status' including physical, psychological and social health, and quality of life as 'Outcome of health'. Overall women immigrants by marriage showed relatively poor health outcomes. Social support was an important factor affecting the health status and quality of life in this population. We offer recommendations to develop and implement culturally and linguistically appropriate health promoting programs for international marriage immigrant women in South Korea.

AB  - Background: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disease predisposing affected individuals to a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Yet, considerable uncertainty exists regarding its impact on psychosocial wellbeing.
   Objectives: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between FH and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQL).
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and PubMed for peer-reviewed literature published in English between January 1, 1990 and January 1, 2018. Quantitative and qualitative studies were eligible if they included patients with confirmed FH and evaluated its association with symptoms of anxiety or depression, or HRQL. We performed a narrative synthesis of studies, including thematic analysis of qualitative studies, and where data permitted, random-effects meta-analysis reporting standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: We found 10 eligible studies measuring HRQL, depression and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analysis of 4 (n = 4293) and 5 studies (n = 5098), respectively, showed that patients with FH had slightly lower symptoms of anxiety (SMD: 0.29 [95% CI: 0.53, 0.041) and mental HRQL (SMD: 0.10 [95% 0.20, 0.00]) relative to general population controls. No significant differences existed in depressive symptoms (SMD: 0.04 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.19]) or physical HRQL scores (SMD: 0.02 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.12]).
   Conclusions: Our systematic review suggests that patients with FH may report small but measurable differences in anxiety symptoms and mental HRQL.

AB  - Objective: To determine the level of agreement across a set of evidence-based guidelines for management of the unipolar depressive disorders and with a focus on physical treatments.
   Method: A literature search was undertaken using the terms 'depression', depressive' and 'guidelines', using PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the National Guideline Clearinghouse. Twelve national psychiatric or professional guideline-producing organizations were identified from the period 2007-2017, with guidelines qualitatively reviewed by two assessors.
   Results: For major depressive disorder (MDD), there was general consensus to use an antidepressant (AD) in cases of greater severity, although disagreement on AD use in mild to moderate depression. There was some agreement on choice of AD class in first-line treatment recommendations, though great variability in second- and third-line management particularly in recommended augmentation and combined AD strategies. Electroconvulsive therapy was considered in all but one guideline, with other neurostimulation treatments being less consistently covered and with variable recommendations. Finally, there was low consistency in the management of dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder and treatment resistant depression.
   Conclusion: Our review identifies varying levels of consistency in guideline recommendations. Strategies to improve reliability in guideline formulation should also improve their validity.

AB  - Maternal sensitivity is a modifiable determinant of infant attachment security and a precursor to optimal child development. Contextual stressors undermine sensitivity, but research was yet to be synthesized. We aimed to identify (i) types of stress associations analyzed in studies of maternal sensitivity and (ii) the strength of effects of various stress factors. A systematic search identified all studies that used the Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (MBQS) to code sensitivity in dyadic observations and that reported a coefficient for MBQS associations with contextual stress. Identified stressors cohered around three spheres: sociodemography (maternal education, family income, composite SES, maternal age and cohabitation status); parenting stress (perceived maternal stress related to parenting); and mental health (specifically maternal internalizing symptoms). Seven meta-analyses (combined ns range 223-1239) of a subset of 30 effects from 20 articles, and a multi-level meta-analysis (N = 1324) assessed aggregated correlations with sensitivity. Significant mean effects emerged in expected directions, whereby all stress indicators were negatively associated with sensitivity. Small effects were found for associations with parenting stress (r = -0.13) and mental health indicators (r = -0.12). Generally moderate effects were found for associations with socio-demographic indicators (range r = -0.12 to r = -0.32). Emerging findings support the proposition that in various contexts of stress, maternal sensitivity to infant needs can be undermined. Implications and research directions are discussed.

AB  - Tobacco smoking, driven by the addictive properties of nicotine, continues to be a worldwide health problem. Based on the well-established role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in drug addiction, novel medication development strategies seek to halt nicotine consumption and prevent relapse to tobacco smoking by modulating glutamate transmission. The presynaptic inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) are key autoreceptors on glutamatergic terminals that maintain glutamate homeostasis. Accumulating evidence suggests the critical role of mGluR2/3 in different aspects of nicotine addiction, including acquisition and maintenance of nicotine taking, nicotine withdrawal, and persistent nicotine seeking even after prolonged abstinence. The involvement of mGluR2/3 in other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and pain, provides convincing evidence suggesting that mGluR2/3 may provide an effective therapeutic approach for comorbidity of smoking and these conditions. This focused review article highlights that mGluR2/3 provide a promising target in the search for smoking cessation medication with novel mechanisms of actions that differ from those of currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapies.

AB  - Despite the fact that the lifetime and yearly prevalence rates of mental illness continue rising, such diseases have only been acknowledged as involved in workplace health issue since the 2000s. Additionally, while the number of recognized cases of mental illnesses is rather low compared to their prevalence, they have a high likelihood of causing significant problems, including fatalities. Many workers are terrified of losing their jobs due to mental illness and therefore attempt to hide their mental health problems. For this reason, clinicians involved in occupational and environmental medicine should focus on interviews or screenings to identify such hidden mental health problems. More specifically, it would be helpful to evaluate job stress and depression in workplaces to ensure appropriate preventive actions and thereby reduce the prevalence of mental illness. Job stress not only causes mental illness and dissatisfaction with work, but also can increase the prevalence and morbidity of medical diseases, as well as other physical health problems. Depression is a major contributor to work loss and absence with effects surpassing almost all of the chronic medical disorder. These facts show why measure of job stress and depression should be highlighted in the occupational settings. This article introduces a variety of assessment tools to examine mental health, particularly stress and depression, in workplaces. These tools can be used by clinicians or professionals involved in the mental health, occupational safety, or health service fields for running diagnostics or screening tests.
