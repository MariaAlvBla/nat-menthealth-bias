AB  - Stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression are disproportionately prevalent in women. Women are more likely to experience depression and anxiety disorders during periods of marked hormonal fluctuations, suggesting that gonadal hormones are involved in stress pathology. Depression and anxiety are both associated with aberrant secretion of glucocorticoids, which also show marked fluctuations across the reproductive cycle and in response to gonadal steroids. Thus, interactions between gonadal and stress hormones may play a major role in predisposing females to stress-related disease. The purpose of this brief review is to highlight preclinical data regarding the role of estrogens in depression and anxiety-like behaviors. While it is evident the exogenous estrogens modulate affective behavior in rodents, there is some disagreement in the literature, perhaps related to experimental designs that vary with respect to administration parameters and stress. Beneficial effects of estrogens on mood are most likely due to estrogen receptor (ER)beta signaling. The antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of ER beta are consistent with its role in attenuating glucocorticoid responses to stress, suggesting that estrogens, acting at ER beta, may improve mood by suppressing glucocorticoid hyperactivity. However, additional studies demonstrate that ER beta signaling in the hippocampus is sufficient to induce antidepressant and anxiolytic behaviors. Thus, ER beta may improve mood via primary actions on hypothalamic (i.e., paraventricular nucleus) and/or extrahypothalamic sites. Overall, the preclinical research suggests that selective ER modulators targeting ER beta may be an attractive alternative or adjunct treatment to currently prescribed antidepressants or anxiolytics.

AB  - Background: Patient use of complementary and alternative treatments, including yoga, to manage mood and anxiety disorders, has been well documented. Despite research interest, there are few recent reviews of the evidence of the benefit of yoga in these conditions.
   Method: The PubMed, Medline and PsycInfo databases were searched for literature published up to July 2008, relating to yoga and depressive and anxiety disorders.
   Results: The paucity of reported studies and several methodological constraints limit data interpretation. In depressive disorders, yoga may be comparable to medication and the combination superior to medication alone. There is reasonable evidence for its use as second-line monotherapy or augmentation to medication in mild to moderate major depression and dysthymia, with early evidence of benefit in more severe depression. In anxiety disorders, yoga may be superior to medication for a subgroup of patients, but its benefits in specific conditions are still largely unknown. Second-line monotherapy is indicated in performance or test anxiety, but only preliminary evidence exists for obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yoga appears to be superior to no treatment and progressive relaxation for both depression and anxiety, and may benefit mood and anxiety symptoms associated with medical illness. It shows good safety and tolerability in short-term treatment.
   Conclusion: Reasonable evidence supports the benefit of yoga in specific depressive disorders. The evidence is still preliminary in anxiety disorders. Given its patient appeal and the promising findings thus far, further research on yoga in these conditions is encouraged. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - Pregnancy
KW  - Perinatal depression
KW  - Risk factor
KW  - Clinical presentation
KW  - Pharmacological treatment
AB  - This article reviews recent literature on mood and anxiety disorders during the perinatal period. We conducted a search of the PubMed databases. Key words included pregnancy, perinatal depression, risk factors, clinical presentation, drug treatment. Childbearing is one of the most complex periods of human experience; pregnant women and mothers who recently delivered are vulnerable to the entire spectrum of psychiatric disorders. The cumulative point-prevalence rates of major and minor depression range from 8.5% to 11% during pregnancy, and from 6.5% to 12.9% during the first year postpartum. Anxiety symptoms are frequently reported by pregnant women; in recent literature antenatal anxiety has received increased attention with regard to both its impact on infant outcomes and as a risk factor for postnatal depression. Gender-specific differences in the prevalence and clinical course of depression undoubtedly stem from a variety of factors, including biological differences between women and men. Several studies reveal the psychoactive effects of female hormones; low estrogen levels are associated with premenstrual syndrome, postpartum, and menopausal depression. Untreated perinatal mental disorders may have severe obstetrical and psychiatric short-and long-term consequences, not only for the woman but also for her family and mostly for the newborn baby, such as premature birth, cesarean section, instrumental vaginal deliveries, intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight, and postnatal complications. Every woman is potentially at risk for developing postpartum depression, women who present specific risk factors have a significantly increased risk for becoming depressed after delivery. These risk factors are widely studied in literature; the strongest predictors of postpartum depression are the experience of depression or anxiety during pregnancy or a previous depressive illness; in addition to these predictors, life stress and lack of social support have a moderate-severe effect size. Psychological factors and marital problems have a moderate effect size, while obstetric factors and socioeconomic status have a small effect size. Pharmacological treatment of mood and anxiety disorders are based on clinical experience and management of disorders during pregnancy, postpartum and lactation requires a careful balancing of maternal and fetal risks and benefits. Antidepressants are relatively safe in pregnancy and during lactation; a greater attention should be given to the use of stabilizers and neuroleptics, but clinical dates are still contradictory.

AB  - Objective: To provide a comprehensive review and evaluation of the literature pertaining to the psychiatric sequelae of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
   Methods: A structured search of the EMBASE, PsychINFO and MEDLINE databases was performed on articles published since the first use of STN DBS in 1993 for PD until March 2007. Non-human studies were excluded, along with studies reporting on unilateral DBS and studies reporting on the use of STN DBS for indications other than idiopathic PD. Ninety-seven articles were selected for inclusion in the review.
   Results: Patients with advanced PD have a high rate of psychiatric morbidity. STN DBS has been shown to be an effective treatment for the control of motor symptoms in advanced PD. Neurobehavioural side-effects are, however, relatively common following STN DBS. Side-effects include impaired executive function and verbal fluency, depression, hypomania, apathy, postoperative delirium, anxiety disorders and psychotic symptoms, especially hallucinations. The alteration in dopaminergic medication following surgery as well as the direct effect of STN stimulation both appear to contribute to the short-term and long-term postoperative psychiatric complications. Methodological issues that limit the applicability of the current literature in this field are highlighted.
   Conclusions: STN DBS is an effective treatment for the motor symptoms of advanced PD. However, further research is needed to assess the extent to which STN DBS contributes to or exacerbates psychiatric morbidity over and above that associated with advanced PD. Careful neuropsychiatric evaluation and monitoring are required in this patient group.

AB  - Background: The importance of cholesterol for physical and psychological well-being has been recognized for several decades. Changes in serum cholesterol levels may have a direct impact on mental performance, behavior, treatment response, survival and expected lifetime duration.
   Objectives: To examine the association between various mental disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental disorders) and cholesterol levels, and to discuss the possible treatment implications.
   Method: A MEDLINE search, citing articles from 1966 onward, supplemented by a review of bibliographies, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Criteria used to identify studies included (1) English language, (2) published studies with original data in peer-reviewed journals.
   Results: Clinical investigations of cholesterolemia in patients with major mental disorders have produced very conflicting results. Hypercholesterolemia has been reported in patients with schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD. Low cholesterol level has been reported in patients with major depression, dissociative disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder. It seems that both high and low serum total cholesterol may be associated with a higher risk of the premature death.
   Conclusion: Our current knowledge on the relation between cholesterolemia and mental disorders is poor and controversial. No definite or reliable insight into a pathophysiological link between cholesterol levels and mental disorders, treatment response and mortality rate is available. The lipoprotein profile, rather than total cholesterol levels, seems to be important.

AB  - For decades, research has demonstrated that chronic diseases characterized by dysregulation of inflammation are particularly susceptible to exacerbation by stress and emotion. Likewise, rates of depression and anxiety are overrepresented in individuals suffering from chronic inflammatory disease. In recent years, Substance P has been implicated in both the pathophysiology of inflammatory disease and the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety by 2 parallel fields of study. This review integrates the literature from these 2 parallel fields and examines the possibility that substance P dysregulation may be a point of convergence underlying the overlap of chronic inflammatory disease and mood and anxiety disorders. First, the involvement of substance P in peripheral inflammation and in the immune events associated with chronic inflammatory disease is discussed, with a focus on inflammatory bowel disease and asthma. Next, the function of substance P in the communication of peripheral inflammation to the brain is considered. Finally, to complete the bidirectional loop of brain-immune interactions, substance P expression in anxiety and depression as well as its potential role in the neural regulation of peripheral inflammation is reviewed.

AB  - This paper presents evidence of new developments in the detection and treatment of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders that have relevance for clinicians.
   An electronic search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and The Cochrane Library Database for the interval 1995-2005 for papers published in English.
   New developments were identified as follows:
   i) Broadening frames of reference within perinatal mental health.
   ii) Impact of disorders upon offspring.
   iii) Identifying women at risk of mental health problems.
   iv) Prevention and early intervention strategies.
   v) Treatments.
   Perinatal mental health is a rapidly expanding field that impacts upon the health and wellbeing of all members of families with infants and young children. An evidence base for best practice is slowly emerging but considerable work is still needed in relation to the identification of women at risk, standardisation of diagnostic procedures, reduction of adverse outcomes for women and infants, prevention, early intervention, and treatment of clinical disorders.

AB  - In the last few years, several strain of mice with genetically altered expression of a specific protein, be it receptor, monoamine transporter,. enzyme or signal transductor have been created, some of those concern proteins involved in the regulation of mood. Mice lacking a protein essential for mood regulation have showed an alteration of emotional behavior, when tested with behavioral paradigms assessing mood or anxiety disorders.
   In the field of affective disorders, these mice have brought a huge contribution to the understanding of mood disorders, showing that they can be the results of a large amount of different neuronal elements.
   Since behavioral paradigms to test antidepressant-like activity in rodents show several methodological limitations, the search for a common neurobiological marker linking genotype and phenotype becomes urgent and necessary. Here we propose that the electrophysiological assessment of the serotonin (5-HT) spontaneous firing activity may be an index to measure the 5-HT neurotransmission in mutant mice that is correlated to their mood status. In particular, we have analyzed three fines of mice that show changes of both 5-HT firing activity and mood: 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor and 5HT1A receptor null mice.
   We concluded that a decrease of 5-HT firing activity corresponds to a depressive-like phenotype, while an increase of 5-HT firing to a "depression-resistant" phenotype. The characterization of the phenotype of these genetically modified animals helps us to better identify putative receptors or neuronal elements involved in the pathogenesis of major depression in humans and to find new targets for antidepressant drugs discovery.

AB  - Evidence-based design (EBD) research has demonstrated the power of environmental design to support improved patient, family, and staff outcomes and to minimize or avoid harm in healthcare settings. While healthcare has primarily focused on fixing the body, there is a growing recognition that our healthcare system could do more by promoting overall wellness, and this requires expanding the focus to healing. This article explores how we can extend what we know from EBD about health impacts of spatial design to the more elusive goal of healing. By breaking the concept of healing into antecedent components (emotional, psychological, social, behavioral, and functional), this review of the literature presents the existing evidence to identify how healthcare spaces can foster healing. The environmental variables found to directly affect or facilitate one or more dimension of healing were organized into six groups of variables-homelike environment, access to views and nature, light, noise control, barrier-free environment, and room layout. While there is limited scientific research confirming design solutions for creating healing spaces, the literature search revealed relationships that provide a basis for a draft definition. Healing spaces evoke a sense of cohesion of the mind, body, and spirit. They support healing intention and foster healing relationships.

AB  - This meta-analysis included 729 studies from 161 articles investigating how acute stress responsivity (including stress reactivity and recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis, autonomic, and cardiovascular systems) changes with various chronic psychosocial exposures (Job stress; general life stress; depression or hopelessness; anxiety, neuroticism, or negative affect; hostility, aggression, or Type-A behavior; fatigue, burnout, or exhaustion; positive psychological states or traits) in healthy populations. In either the overall meta-analysis or the methodologically strong subanalysis, positive psychological states or traits were associated with reduced HPA reactivity. Hostility, aggression, or Type-A behavior was associated with increased cardiovascular (heart rate or blood pressure) reactivity, whereas anxiety, neuroticism, or negative affect was associated with decreased cardiovascular reactivity. General life stress and anxiety, neuroticism, or negative affect were associated with poorer cardiovascular recovery. However, regarding the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system, there were no associations between the chronic psychosocial factors and stress reactivity or recovery. The results largely reflect an integrated stress response pattern of hypo- or hyperactivity depending on the specific nature of the psychosocial background.

AB  - Recent accounts of major depression have tended to focus on dysfunction of frontothalamic-striatal reentrant circuits as a possible source of the disorder. Evidence of frontostriatal involvement in unipolar major depression from lesion and neuropsychological studies, and functional and structural imaging studies is examined. The high incidence of depressive symptomatology following left frontal and basal ganglia lesions implicate these as possible sites of dysfunction. Neuropsychological evidence indicates similar deficits in patients with major depression, perhaps with dorsolateral prefrontal deficits most prominent. Structural imaging studies report frontal and basal ganglia (BG) abnormalities particularly in cases of late-age onset depression. Resting state functional imaging studies show deficits in dorsolateral, anterior cingulate (medial frontal), and BG structures. Activation imaging studies show less consistent evidence of dorsolateral deficit, while anterior cingulate deficit is more consistently demonstrated. Variability in findings across studies may reflect differences between subtypes of depression and differences in methodology. Possible involvement of the BG in the psychomotor retardation of depression is examined. It is concluded that, while there is evidence of frontostriatal deficit in major depression, the exact nature of such deficits is uncertain. Issues such as component vs, system dysfunction need to be addressed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Due to the nature of their work, physicians are exposed to chronic stress. This may potentially lead to the widespread occurrence of occupational burnout syndrome (BS). The aim of this systematic review study was to summarize available published data concerning the prevalence of BS in Polish doctors. The literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Google Scholar. The last search was performed on September 27th, 2019. Only articles in English or Polish on graduated doctors practicing in Poland were taken into account. All types of original research were considered eligible. However, review articles, book chapters, case reports, case series, conference papers, study protocols and articles in languages other than English and Polish were excluded. There were no restrictions on age, seniority or specialty of study participants. The literature search revealed a total of 21 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results of individual studies were very diverse, which makes it difficult to draw specific conclusions. However, the problem of burnout among Polish doctors is valid and worth special attention from society, health policy leaders, and doctors themselves. High-quality research is essential to for a better understanding of this topic.

AB  - The growing understanding that mood disorders are dynamic in nature and fluctuate over variable epochs of time has compelled researchers to develop innovative methods of monitoring mood. Technological advancement now allows for the detection of minute-to-minute changes while also capturing a longitudinal perspective of an individual's illness. Traditionally, assessments of mood have been conducted by means of clinical interviews and paper surveys. However, these methods are often inaccurate due to recall bias and compliance issues, and are limited in their capacity to collect and process data over long periods of time. The increased capability, availability and affordability of digital technologies in recent decades has offered a novel, non-invasive alternative to monitoring mood and emotion in daily life. This paper reviews the emerging literature addressing the use of digital mood tracking technologies, primarily focusing on the strengths and inherent limitations of using these new methods including electronic self-report, behavioural data collection and wearable physiological biosensors. This developing field holds great promise in generating novel insights into the mechanistic processes of mood disorders and improving personalised clinical care. However, further research is needed to validate many of these novel approaches to ensure that these devices are indeed achieving their purpose of capturing changes in mood.

AB  - The concept, benefits and recommendations for the cultivation of compassion have been recognized in the contemplative traditions for thousands of years. In the last 30 years or so, the study of compassion has revealed it to have major physiological and psychological effects influencing well-being, addressing mental health difficulties, and promoting prosocial behavior. This paper outlines an evolution informed biopsychosocial, multicomponent model to caring behavior and its derivative "compassion" that underpins newer approaches to psychotherapy. The paper explores the origins of caring motives and the nature and biopsychosocial functions of caring-attachment behavior. These include providing a secure base (sources of protection, validation, encouragement and guidance) and safe haven (source of soothing and comfort) for offspring along with physiological regulating functions, which are also central for compassion focused therapy. Second, it suggests that it is the way recent human cognitive competencies give rise to different types of "mind awareness" and "knowing intentionality" that transform basic caring motives into potentials for compassion. While we can care for our gardens and treasured objects, the concept of compassion is only used for sentient beings who can "suffer." As psychotherapy addresses mental suffering, cultivating the motives and competencies of compassion to self and others can be a central focus for psychotherapy.

AB  - Mental disorders in adults with intellectual disability (ID) occur at rates much higher than in those without ID; however, many clinicians report little to no training in providing clinical services to this population. Due to the historically qualitative nature of the most literature in this field, it has been difficult for clinicians to identify appropriate accommodations and assessments to make treatment more accessible to those with ID. The objective of this scoping review was to identify psychotherapy practices for adults with ID in the areas of treatment accommodations and outcome measures/treatment monitoring tools. In the absence of treatment guidelines for this population, practices were drawn from treatment outcome research. Research reports describing treatment for this population were examined to identify the types of accommodations and practices employed by clinical research scientists when delivering psychotherapy. Specific practices, accommodations and tools are suggested based on the available research. The most common type of intervention was cognitive behavior therapy (i.e., 48.1%). Key aspects of accommodations to treatment included incorporating self-determination, the use of simplified language, visual supports, involving caregivers, and teaching prerequisite skills. This review details the accommodations and provides some practical suggestions and resources for clinicians when providing psychotherapy to adults with ID.

AB  - Coming from the vantage point of managing human relations to potentially problematic wildlife, we bring the following questions: Where do people's emotionally vigorous and polarized reactions originate? Why do these reactions to different scenarios of human-wildlife conflict appear similar? In this paper we provide the findings from an eclectic review of purposefully sampled literature on human relations to wolves, corvids and spiders. Based on this synthesis, we propose three answers to those questions: 1). The emotional vigor inherent in human-wildlife conflicts is caused by the activation of deep-seated and emotionally loaded factors, specifically worldviews on human-nature relations more broadly, an integral human motivation for seeking control, and symbolic associations to darkness. 2). The opposing attitudes on human-wildlife relations derive from people's diverging worldviews and different degrees of wanting control in a situation of human-wildlife conflict. 3). Despite ecological specificities, various cases of human-wildlife conflicts may evoke similar mental processes and, accordingly, the same reactions in people. Consequentially, it is possible to develop transferable solutions that may contribute to managing challenges in different instances of human-wildlife encounters.

AB  - Marine turtles are generally viewed as vulnerable to climate change because of the role that temperature plays in the sex determination of embryos, their long life history, long age-to-maturity and their highly migratory nature. Extant species of marine turtles probably arose during the mid-late Jurassic period (180-150 Mya) so have survived past shifts in climate, including glacial periods and warm events and therefore have some capacity for adaptation. The present-day rates of increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and associated temperature changes, are very rapid; the capacity of marine turtles to adapt to this rapid change may be compromised by their relatively long generation times. We consider the evidence and likely consequences of present-day trends of climate change on marine turtles. Impacts are likely to be complex and may be positive as well as negative. For example, rising sea levels and increased storm intensity will negatively impact turtle nesting beaches; however, extreme storms can also lead to coastal accretion. Alteration of wind patterns and ocean currents will have implications for juveniles and adults in the open ocean. Warming temperatures are likely to impact directly all turtle life stages, such as the sex determination of embryos in the nest and growth rates. Warming of 2 degrees C could potentially result in a large shift in sex ratios towards females at many rookeries, although some populations may be resilient to warming if female biases remain within levels where population success is not impaired. Indirectly, climate change is likely to impact turtles through changes in food availability. The highly migratory nature of turtles and their ability to move considerable distances in short periods of time should increase their resilience to climate change. However, any such resilience of marine turtles to climate change is likely to be severely compromised by other anthropogenic influences. Development of coastlines may threaten nesting beaches and reproductive success, and pollution and eutrophication is threatening important coastal foraging habitats for turtles worldwide. Exploitation and bycatch in other fisheries has seriously reduced marine turtle populations. The synergistic effects of other human-induced stressors may seriously reduce the capacity of some turtle populations to adapt to the current rates of climate change.
   Conservation recommendations to increase the capacity of marine turtle populations to adapt to climate change include increasing population resilience, for example by the use of turtle exclusion devices in fisheries, protection of nesting beaches from the viewpoints of both conservation and coastal management, and increased international conservation efforts to protect turtles in regions where there is high unregulated or illegal fisheries (including turtle harvesting). Increasing research efforts on the critical knowledge gaps of processes influencing population numbers, such as identifying ocean foraging hotspots or the processes that underlie the initiation of nesting migrations and selection of breeding areas, will inform adaptive management in a changing climate.

AB  - Meta-analyses suggest that mindfulness interventions have positive effects on mental health. Yet, how mindfulness interventions exert their effects is still largely unknown. Self-reported mindfulness may partially mediate the association between mindfulness interventions and change in self-reported mental health. We present the results of a novel application of three-level meta-analysis on the pre-post intervention data of 146 RCTs of mindfulness interventions (total N = 10,979), probing the efficacy of a broad range of mindfulness interventions and meditation training against active, treatment-as-usual (TAU), and wait-list control groups. We found that self-reported mindfulness not only increased in mindfulness interventions (d = 0.54, 95% CI [0.47, 0.61]), but also in active (nonmindfulness) controls (d = 0.27 [0.18, 0.36]) and wait-list controls (d = 0.10 [0.04, 0.17]; but not TAU controls: d = 0.04 [-0.03, 0.12]). In addition, change in mindfulness accounted for change in self-reported mental health (mindfulness interventions: d = 0.65 [0.57, 0.73]; active controls: d = 0.49 [0.36, 0.62]; TAU controls: d = 0.20 [0.12, 0.29]; wait-list controls: d = 0.22 [0.14, 0.30]) in all treatment and control groups alike. Thus, self-reported mindfulness apparently is no unique mediator of mindfulness interventions. It may either be more universal, merely a correlate of self-reported mental health, or both. Research should focus on the common denominator of mindfulness interventions and clinically relevant constructs with which self-reported mindfulness shares some of its characteristics. Limitations pertain to the indirect evidence of the three-level meta-analytic approach, the self-report nature of the data, and small-study effects, which suggest the presence of publication bias. The risk of bias may have led to the overestimation of effects and results could further be subjected to effects of shared method variance. Public Significance Statement This meta-analysis suggests that increases in self-reported mindfulness may explain the treatment efficacy of various mindfulness-based interventions, but also of nonmindfulness-based controls. Self-reported mindfulness thus may be no unique mediator of the effects of mindfulness interventions. The current evidence leaves open whether self-reported mindfulness might be a universal mediator of treatment effects, merely reflects changes of self-reported mental health in general, or both.

AB  - Working memory refers to a mental workspace, involved in controlling, regulating, and actively maintaining relevant information to accomplish complex cognitive tasks (e.g. mathematical processing). Despite the potential relevance of a relation between working memory and math for understanding developmental and individual differences in mathematical skills, the nature of this relationship is not well-understood. This paper reviews four approaches that address the relation of working memory and math: 1) dual task studies establishing the role of working memory during on-line math performance; 2) individual difference studies examining working memory in children with math difficulties; 3) studies of working memory as a predictor of mathematical outcomes; and 4) longitudinal studies of working memory and math. The goal of this review is to evaluate current information on the nature of the relationship between working memory and math provided by these four approaches, and to present some of the outstanding questions for future research.

AB  - Over the course of the first 2 years of life, infants are learning a great deal about the sound system of their native language. Acquiring the sound system requires the infant to learn about sounds and their distributions, sound combinations, and prosodic information, such as syllables, rhythm, and stress. These aspects of the phonological system are being learned simultaneously as the infant experiences the language around him or her. What binds all of the phonological units is the context in which they occur, namely, words. In this review, we explore the development of phonetics and phonology by showcasing the interactive nature of the developing lexicon and sound system with a focus on perception. We first review seminal research in the foundations of phonological development. We then discuss early word recognition and learning followed by a discussion of phonological and lexical representations. We conclude by discussing the interactive nature of lexical and phonological representations and highlight some further directions for exploring the developing sound system.

AB  - Purpose of review
   The nature and classification of sexual disorders has been a focus during work on the development of DSM-5 and ICD-11. This article proposes different conceptual approaches to the sexual disorders, including classical, critical and integrative positions. Disorders associated with sexual orientation, gender dysphoria/ incongruence and paraphilias/paraphilic disorders are discussed from each of these positions.
   Recent findings
   A range of conventional and nonconventional consensual sexual behaviours are prevalent but not necessarily indicative of a mental disorder; there is little diagnostic validity or clinical utility for including these in the nosology. When such behaviours are clinically excessive and associated with distress or impairment, however, a disorder may be present. Debate surrounds the medicalization of some sexual behaviours that are criminal in nature.
   Summary
   The classification of sexual behaviour as disordered is necessarily theory-dependent and value-laden. Nevertheless, reasoned debate about the relevant data and values is possible, and will hopefully further improve the diagnostic validity and clinical utility of psychiatric nosology.

AB  - We present an elementary proof of the quantum de Finetti representation theorem, a quantum analog of de Finetti's classical theorem on exchangeable probability assignments. This contrasts with the original proof of Hudson and Moody [Z. Wahrschein. verw. Geb. 33, 343 (1976)], which relies on advanced mathematics and does not share the same potential for generalization. The classical de Finetti theorem provides an operational definition of the concept of an unknown probability in Bayesian probability theory, where probabilities are taken to be degrees of belief instead of objective states of nature. The quantum de Finetti theorem, in a closely analogous fashion, deals with exchangeable density-operator assignments and provides an operational definition of the concept of an "unknown quantum state" in quantum-state tomography. This result is especially important for information-based interpretations of quantum mechanics, where quantum states, like probabilities, are taken to be states of knowledge rather than states of nature. We further demonstrate that the theorem fails for real Hilbert spaces and discuss the significance of this point. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Coronavirus refers to a group of widespread viruses. The name refers to the specific morphology of these viruses because their spikes look like a crown under an electron microscope. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has been reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was proclaimed an international public health emergency (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020, and on 11 March 2020, it was declared as a pandemic (World Health Organization 2020). The official name of the virus was declared by the WHO as "COVID-19 virus", formerly known as "2019-nCoV", or "Wuhan Coronavirus". The International Committee on Virus Taxonomy's Coronavirus Research Group has identified that this virus is a form of coronavirus that caused a severe outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome in 2002-2003 (SARS). As a result, the latest severe acute respiratory syndrome has been classified as a corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen by this committee. This disease spread quickly across the country and the world within the first 3 months of the outbreak and became a global pandemic. To stop COVID-19 from spreading, the governing agencies used various chemicals to disinfect different commercial spaces, streets and highways. However, people used it aggressively because of panic conditions, anxiety and unconsciousness, which can have a detrimental impact on human health and the environment. Our water bodies, soil and air have been polluted by disinfectants, forming secondary products that can be poisonous and mutagenic. In the prevention and spread of COVID-19, disinfection is crucial, but disinfection should be carried out with sufficient precautions to minimize exposure to harmful by-products. In addition, to prevent inhalation, adequate personal protective equipment should be worn and chemical usage, concentrations, ventilation in the room and application techniques should be carefully considered. In the USA, 60% of respondents said they cleaned or disinfected their homes more often than they had in the previous months. In addition to the robust use of disinfection approaches to combat COVID-19, we will explore safe preventative solutions here.

AB  - Moral courage, that is, defending moral beliefs despite personal risks, is often seen as a hallmark of prosocial behavior. We argue that prosociality in moral courage is, however, complex. While its prosociality is often evident at a higher societal level, it can be contested in some aspects of morally courageous acts. We review the literature on two such aspects and highlight that differences and conflicts in moral beliefs, as well as the confrontational nature of many morally courageous acts, call into question prosociality. We recommend that future research takes the complexity of prosociality in moral courage into account to obtain a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the psychological underpinnings of moral courage and its contributions to the functioning of societies.

The review suggests that multifaceted interventions are most effective. Integrated and comprehensive transition services should address skill instruction and self-awareness; provide customized informational, emotional, and instrumental supports to meet the needs of youth and families; provide direct opportunities and experiences for skill development; and address the welcoming nature of community activities and settings. The information can be used by rehabilitation managers and therapists in the design and delivery of transition services. Recommendations are made for future research with respect to strategies to facilitate youth transitions.

AB  - In joint action, multiple people coordinate their actions to perform a task together. This often requires precise temporal and spatial coordination. How do co-actors achieve this? How do they coordinate their actions toward a shared task goal? Here, we provide an overview of the mental representations involved in joint action, discuss how co-actors share sensorimotor information and what general mechanisms support coordination with others. By deliberately extending the review to aspects such as the cultural context in which a joint action takes place, we pay tribute to the complex and variable nature of this social phenomenon.

As a new field, the social brain sciences are probing the neural underpinnings of social behaviour and have produced a banquet of data that are both tantalizing and deeply puzzling. We are finding new links between emotion and reason, between action and perception, and between representations of other people and ourselves. No less important are the links that are also being established across disciplines to understand social behaviour, as neuroscientists, social psychologists, anthropologists, ethologists and philosophers forge new collaborations.

However, the discovery of the Higgs particle at 125 GeV, accompanied by the exclusion of many types of new physics expected in natural models, has called the principle into question. In addition, apart from the scale of weak interactions, there are other quantities in nature that appear unnaturally small and for which we have no proposal for a natural explanation. I first review the principle, then discuss some of the conjectures it has spawned. I then turn to some of the challenges to the naturalness idea and consider alternatives.

AB  - Depression has been observed to accompany chronic pain. Yet, controversy remains regarding the extent and nature of the relationship between these 2 disorders. The authors analyze the literature regarding depression rates in chronic pain and other chronic medical populations and argue that depression appears to be highest among chronic pain patients. Drawing from cognitive-behavioral models of depression, the authors explore the unique psychological experiences of living with chronic pain that may account for the high prevalence of depression. Then a diathesis-stress framework is proposed to conceptualize the development of depression in chronic pain. Clinical and heuristic implications are discussed.

AB  - The prevention of suicide requires an understanding of protective as well as risk factors, and the recognition of high-risk groups. Factors which increase the risk in patient populations include previous parasuicide, recent relapse or discharge, features of mental state (depression, psychosis), social circumstances (isolation, unemployment), and demographic characteristics (male sex, young age). Protective factors are under-researched but are likely to lie in the nature of psychiatric care. Consequently, community care may affect suicide by altering the level of protection at critical periods in an episode of illness. The clinical prevention of suicide should therefore be a priority for community services, and the relationship between suicide and mental health care should be researched by a national process of monitoring.

AB  - Social bonds may assist in cultivating a more positive attitude to life through commonly shared meanings about the COVID-19 pandemic. The key challenge, however, is how to foster social bonds meeting the changing demands in a post pandemic world. Yet, it is in the middle of a crisis that the conversation needs to start about how to strategically plan for the recovery. This is important not only in the current pandemic, but also in a post pandemic world. Reinforcing or fostering new social bonds is likely to bring positive experiences. The latter is central to human health and wellbeing, and has potential to contribute greatly in enhancing people's quality of life. In an attempt to foster place social bonding in the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond to subsequently contribute to wellbeing, this paper develops and proposes a new conceptual framework suggesting the need for adaptive social bonding interventions in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This is an essential measure to manage the significant impacts on our global health services due to a decline in people's mental health in addition to COVID-19 physical impacts. The paper discusses how promoting adaptive social bonding interventions (psycho-socio, digital and nature social bonding) can make people more resilient. It further discusses how they can be empowered psychologically, socially, and emotionally in the current challenging times. The conceptual framework posits that social bonding interventions can assist in maintaining better mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing and discusses how these wellbeing outcomes may also be experienced post the pandemic. This has important benefits and is of relevance to governments, policy makers and healthcare professionals in delivering better health care and equipping people with coping mechanisms both throughout the pandemic and in the long run.

AB  - Migraine is a neurological disorder defined by episodic attacks of chronic pain associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. It is known to be a complex disease with several environmental and genetic factors contributing to its susceptibility. Risk factors for migraine include head or neck injury (Arnold, Cephalalgia 38(1):1-211, 2018). Stress and high temperature are known to trigger migraine, while sleep disorders and anxiety are considered to be the comorbid conditions with migraine. Studies have reported various biomarkers, including genetic variants, proteins, and metabolites implicated in migraine's pathophysiology. Using the "omics" approach, which deals with genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, more specific biomarkers for various migraine can be identified. On account of its multifactorial nature, migraine is an ideal study model focusing on integrated omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The current review has been compiled with an aim to focus on the genomic alterations especially involved in the regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission, cortical excitability, ion channels, solute carrier proteins, or receptors; their expression in migraine patients and also specific proteins and metabolites, including some inflammatory biomarkers that might represent the migraine phenotype at the molecular level. The systems biology approach holds the promise to understand the pathophysiology of the disease at length and also to identify the specific therapeutic targets for novel interventions.

AB  - Military personnel often perform complex cognitive operations under unique conditions of intense stress. This requirement to perform diverse physical and mental tasks under stress, often with high stakes, has led to recognition of the term 'tactical athlete' for these performers. Impaired cognitive performance as a result of this stress may have serious implications for the success of military operations and the well-being of military service men and women, particularly in combat scenarios. Therefore, understanding the nature of the stress experienced by military personnel and the resilience of cognitive functioning to this stress is of great importance. This review synthesises the current state of the literature regarding cognitive resilience to psychological stress in tactical athletes. The experience of psychological stress in military personnel is considered through the lens of the Transactional Theory of stress, while offering contemporary updates and new insights. Models of the effects of stress on cognitive performance are then reviewed to highlight the complexity of this interaction before considering recent advancements in the preparation of military personnel for the enhancement of cognitive resilience. Several areas for future research are identified throughout the review, emphasising the need for the wider use of self-report measures and mixed methods approaches to better reflect the subjective experience of stress and its impact on the performance of cognitive operations.

AB  - Context: Cancer diagnosis and its therapeutic methods can lead to considerable psychological problems and decrease the levels of hope in patients. Due to the considerably important multidimensional effects of hope on the life of patients with cancer, this study aimed to assess the effect of psycho-socio-spiritual strategies on the hope level of patients with cancer.
   Evidence Acquisition: In this narrative review, electronic databases were searched including Google Scholar, Scientific Information Database, Magiran, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science (ISI), Ovid, and Scopus. Those articles published between 1978 and 2020 were retrieved and assessed through the abstract and full-text appraisal. Finally, 74 articles were included in this study.
   Results: Psycho-socio-spiritual strategies for affecting the hope level of patients with cancer were classified as follows: (1) psychological interventions (psychotherapy, counseling, coping skills training, stress management training, crisis management, individual or group supporting therapy, hope therapy, and psychoeducational interventions); (2) social interventions (social and family support intervention); and (3) spiritual interventions (logotherapy, religion therapy, and praying).
   Conclusions: Due to the chronic nature of cancer disease, in addition to the important role of pharmacological treatment such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, considering non-pharmacological approaches such as hope-fostering interventions for these patients is essential and can lead to a better quality of life.

AB  - Acute onset disasters impact children's and adolescents' psychological well-being, often leading to mental health challenges. The way a young person copes with the event plays a significant role in development of post-disaster psychopathology. Coping has been widely studied after acute onset disasters, however, difficulties conducting research in post-disaster contexts and the individualized nature of coping make accurate assessment of coping a significant challenge. A systematic literature search of multiple databases and previous reviews was conducted, exploring scholarly documentation of coping measurement and the relationship between coping and post-traumatic stress (PTSS) symptoms after acute onset disasters. A total of 384 peer-reviewed manuscripts were identified, and 18 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. The studies examined coping and post-traumatic stress in the wake of acute onset disasters such as terrorist events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires. Greater PTSS symptoms were related to internalizing, externalizing, rumination, and avoidant coping strategies. Coping measurement was constrained due to measurement variance, lack of developmentally and contextually vali-dated instruments, theoretical misalignment, and absence of comprehensive tools to assess coping. Robust and consistent measures of coping should be established to inform research and interventions to reduce the impact of disasters on children's and adolescents' well-being.

AB  - Stress leads to ill-health and disease, and with today's fast-pace western society, engaging in strategies to relieve stress is crucial for good health across the life-course. Activities such as focusing on positive characteristics, art/music therapies, mindfulness, yoga and engaging with nature and/or physical activity have been shown to reduce stress and enhance well-being. It is thought that patterns of cortisol secretion, which are regulated by the brain, are a key mediator of stress-disease and well-being-health links. Measurement of cortisol in saliva is a non-invasive and ecologically valid tool for detecting early changes in brain health, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of strategies in relieving stress and improving brain health as well as monitoring stress-related brain changes. This chapter will review the evidence that engaging in stress-relieving strategies promotes regulation and/or restoration of patterns of cortisol secretion. If such strategies are found to be effective in healthy populations, they could potentially inform ways of promoting brain health and the prevention or delay of clinical disorders involving disorders in the brain (e.g., Parkinson's disease) and symptoms experienced with such disorders. To inform this field of research, recommendations are provided for the use of salivary cortisol as a marker of early monitoring of brain health and effectiveness of stress-alleviating interventions.

AB  - BackgroundsThe range of theoretical conceptualizations of problematic exercise in psychometric assessment instruments makes it difficult to identify the components that define this phenomenon. A better understanding of the underlying components of problematic exercise may contribute to progress toward providing scientific evidence that allows for deciding whether problematic exercise should be considered a substantive mental health disorder. The objective of the present review was to examine and compare, through a content analysis of their items, the components of problematic exercise in psychometric assessment instruments identified in a recent systematic review. MethodsA total of 33 components of problematic exercise were identified in the 17 assessment instruments included in the present review. ResultsThe results show that, despite the lack of consensus in the operational definition of their factors and the variety of ways of wording their items, the instruments reflect some common components that might indicate core criteria (i.e., salience, withdrawal, and mood modification) or candidate components (i.e., conflict, and continuance despite problems) of problematic exercise. However, other components of different nature were shown to be specific to some of the problematic exercise conceptualizations on which the assessment instruments are based. ConclusionIn the interest of reaching a consensus that allows to advance in this research field, further studies are needed to resolve which components are inherently problematic.

AB  - Background: Deep brain stimulation is a treatment under investigation for a range of psychiatric disorders. It has shown promising results for therapy-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Other indications under investigation include Tourette's syndrome, anorexia nervosa and substance use disorders.Aims: To review current studies on psychiatric indications for deep brain stimulation (DBS), with focus on OCD and MDD.Method: A systematic search was carried out in MEDLINE, and the literature was searched to identify studies with DBS for psychiatric disorders. The identified studies were analysed based on patient characteristics, treatment results and adverse effects of DBS.Results: A total of 52 papers met the inclusion criteria and described a total of 286 unique patients treated with DBS for psychiatric indications; 18 studies described 112 patients treated with DBS for OCD in six different anatomical targets, while nine studies presented 100 patients with DBS for MDD in five different targets.Conclusion: DBS may show promise for treatment-resistant OCD and MDD but the results are limited by small sample size and insufficient randomized controlled data. Deep brain stimulation for OCD has received United States Food and Drug Administration approval. Other psychiatric indications are currently of a purely experimental nature.

AB  - Despite the increased prevalence of dementia little work has been done to explore the extent and nature of care-giving in black or Asian-UK populations. Evidence that does exist suggests that the consequences of care-giving are significant but different from those experienced by white carers and are mediated by a number of culture-related factors. These include: ethnically specific conceptualisations of dementia; expectations of family duty; religiosity; the adoption of positive re-appraisal strategies, and beneficial outcomes. Present approaches to research are narrow, do not take account of cultural dimensions and employ terminology and care-giving frameworks which are of limited relevance. That the evidence base is characterised by small-scale studies, and weak methodology further undermines its validity. Research deficits are systemic and fundamental and are both conceptual and methodological. A key contribution would be the development of a multi-dimensional theoretical model that takes account of the role played by culture, ethnicity and structural inequality in shaping care-giving experiences and profiles. Incorporating the perspectives of black and Asian caters, and the influence of the life course of individuals and communities and employing qualitative methods would also influence the direction of research, improve its quality and generate knowledge in this underdeveloped field.

AB  - Optimal early cognitive and emotional development are vital to reaching one's full potential and represent our best chance to improve the mental health of the population. The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis posits that adverse perinatal exposures can alter physiology and increase disease risk. As physiological plasticity decreases with age, interventions applied during gestation may hold the most promise for reducing the impact of mental disorders across the lifespan. However, this vast clinical potential remains largely unrealized as the majority of human DOHaD research is observational in nature. The application of more rigorous experimental designs [e.g. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)] not only represents a major step toward unlocking this potential, but are required to fully test the scientific validity of the DOHaD hypothesis as it pertains to mental illness. Here, we argue that the optimization of maternal diet and exercise during pregnancy represents our best chance to improve offspring neurodevelopment and reduce the burden of mental disorders. Follow-up studies of the offspring of pregnant women enrolled in new and existing RCTs of maternal gestational nutrition+exercise interventions are required to determine if acting during pregnancy can prevent and/or meaningfully reduce the prevalence and severity of mental disorders in the population.

AB  - The functioning of social collectives hinges on the willingness of their members to cooperate with one another and to help those who are in need. Here, we consider how such prosocial behavior is shaped by emotions. We offer an integrative review of theoretical arguments and empirical findings concerning how the experience of emotions influences people's own prosocial behavior (intrapersonal effects) and how the expression of emotions influences the prosocial behavior of others (interpersonal effects). We identified research on five broad clusters of emotions associated with opportunity and affiliation (happiness, contentment, hope), appreciation and self-transcendence (gratitude, awe, elevation, compassion), distress and supplication (sadness, disappointment, fear, anxiety), dominance and status assertion (anger, disgust, contempt, envy, pride), and appeasement and social repair (guilt, regret, shame, embarrassment). Our review reveals notable differences between emotion clusters and between intrapersonal and interpersonal effects. Although some emotions promote prosocial behavior in the self and others, most emotions promote prosocial behavior either in the self (via their intrapersonal effects) or in others (via their interpersonal effects), suggesting trade-offs between the functionality of emotional experience and emotional expression. Moreover, interpersonal effects are modulated by the cooperative versus competitive nature of the situation. We discuss the emerging patterns from a social-functional perspective and conclude that understanding the role of emotion in prosociality requires joint attention to intrapersonal and interpersonal effects.

AB  - Visceral afferent signals to the brain influence thoughts, feelings and behavior. Here we highlight the findings of a set of empirical investigations in humans concerning body-mind interaction that focus on how feedback from states of autonomic arousal shapes cognition and emotion. There is a longstanding debate regarding the contribution of the body to mental processes. Recent theoretical models broadly acknowledge the role of (autonomically-mediated) physiological arousal to emotional, social and motivational behaviors, yet the underlying mechanisms are only partially characterized. Neuroimaging is overcoming this shortfall; first, by demonstrating correlations between autonomic change and discrete patterns of evoked, and task-independent, neural activity; second, by mapping the central consequences of clinical perturbations in autonomic response and; third, by probing how dynamic fluctuations in peripheral autonomic state are integrated with perceptual, cognitive and emotional processes. Building on the notion that an important source of the brain's representation of physiological arousal is derived from afferent information from arterial baroreceptors, we have exploited the phasic nature of these signals to show their differential contribution to the processing of emotionally-salient stimuli. This recent work highlights the facilitation at neural and behavioral levels of fear and threat processing that contrasts with the more established observations of the inhibition of central pain processing during baroreceptors activation. The implications of this body-brain-mind axis are discussed.

In none of the subgroup analyses did males experience considerably more stress than females. Evaluation of a subsample of 39 studies that examined gender differences in psychological symptoms revealed that females reported more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosomatic problems (d = .282, r = .139) and that the sex difference in reports of psychological symptoms accounted for approximately 4% of the variance in. the sex differences in reports of stress. Possible explanations for the observed patterning of effects are discussed, as are recommendations for further research.

AB  - Objective: To discuss the impact of depression on work and how depression-related sick leave duration could be a potential indicator and outcome for measuring functionality in depression. Methods: Our review was based on a literature search and expert opinion that emerged during a virtual meeting of European psychiatrists that was convened to discuss this topic. Results: Current evidence demonstrates that depression-related sick leave duration is influenced by multiple disease-, patient- and work-related factors, together with societal attitudes towards depression and socioeconomic conditions. A wide variety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments and work-based interventions are effective in reducing depression-related sick leave duration and/or facilitating return to work. Recent real-world evidence showed that patients treated with antidepressant monotherapy appear to recover their working life faster than those receiving combination therapy. Although depression-related sick leave duration was found to correlate with severity of depressive symptoms, it cannot be used alone as a viable marker for disease severity. Conclusions: Given its multifactorial nature, depression-related sick leave duration is not on its own a viable outcome measure of depression severity but could be used as a secondary outcome alongside more formal severity measures and may also represent a useful measure of functionality in depression.

AB  - Background: The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is co-ordinating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry, funded under the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand Health Funding Authority.
   Method: For these guidelines, the CPG team reviewed the treatment outcome literature, consulted with practitioners and patients and conducted a meta-analysis of recent outcome research.
   Treatment recommendations: Education for the patient and significant others covering: (i) the nature and course of panic disorder and agoraphobia; (ii) an explanation of the psychopathology of anxiety, panic and agoraphobia; (iii) rationale for the treatment, likelihood of a positive response, and expected time frame.
   Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is more effective and more cost-effective than medication. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors are equal in efficacy and both are to be preferred to benzodiazepines. Treatment choice depends on the skill of the clinician and the patient's circumstances. Drug treatment should be complemented by behaviour therapy.
   If the response to an adequate trial of a first-line treatment is poor, another evidence-based treatment should be used. A second opinion can be useful. The presence of severe agoraphobia is a negative prognostic indicator, whereas comorbid depression, if properly treated, has no consistent effect on outcome.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Treatment of dual diagnosis [co-occurrence of a substance use disorder (SUD) in patients with mental illness] poses several challenges for mental health professionals. This article seeks to review the recent advances in dual diagnosis treatment with respect to pharmacotherapy and psychosocial approaches.
   Recent findings
   Atypical antipsychotics are commonly used for comorbid schizophrenia and SUD. Whereas there is no difference between risperidone and olanzapine, clozapine appears to have a distinct advantage in reducing psychotic symptoms as well as substance abuse (including smoking). There is emerging evidence that quetiapine is beneficial in dually diagnosed patients, particularly using alcohol, cocaine and amphetamine. A combination of naltrexone and sertraline was found to be effective in patients with depressive disorder and alcohol dependence. Effectiveness of atomoxetine is yet to be established in patients with comorbid adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with respect to decrease in substance abuse. Integrated intervention is the choice of treatment for patients with dual diagnosis.
   Summary
   In spite of the high association between substance use and psychiatric disorders, there is a surprising paucity of studies related to treatment and outcome. A few well-designed studies have been recently published and more studies of this nature are required in order to address the challenges posed in the treatment of dual disorders.

AB  - Despite it staggering body of research demonstrating sex differences in expressed emotion, very few theoretical models (evolutionary or non-evolutionary) offer a critical examination of the adaptive nature of such differences. From the perspective of a socio-relational framework, emotive behaviors evolved to promote the attraction and aversion of different types of relationships by advertising the two most parsimonious properties of reciprocity potential, or perceived attractiveness as a prospective social partner. These are the individual's (a) perceived capacity or ability to provide expedient resources, or to inflict immediate harm onto others, and their (b) perceived trustworthiness or probability of actually reciprocating altruism (Vigil 2007). Depending oil the unique social demands and relational constraints that each sex, evolved, individuals should be sensitive to advertise "capacit)," and "trustworthiness" cues through selective displays of dominant versus submissive and masculine versus feminine emotive behaviors, respectively. In this article, I introduce the basic theoretical assumptions and hypotheses of the framework, and show how the models provide a solid scaffold with which to begin to interpret common sex differences in the emotional development literature. I conclude by describing how the framework can be used to predict condition-based and situation-based variation in affect and other forms of expressive behaviors.

AB  - Objectives: Parental incarceration might impact children's body weight through household financial strain, lack of caregiving, social stigma, and stress. In this study, we systematically reviewed scientific literature linking parental incarceration to body weight status of children and young adults. Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed articles and abstracts. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the association between parental incarceration and children's body weight. Results: Five US-based studies were identified. Three examined children 17 years and younger, and 2 examined adults 18-34 years. After adjusting for individual, family and neighborhood characteristics, 2 reported a negative association, 2 reported a null relationship, and one reported a positive association between parental incarceration and children's weight. Meta-analysis did not identify an association between parental incarceration and children's body weight. Conclusion: Evidence linking parental incarceration to children's body weight remains limited due to the small body of heterogeneous literature and observational design. Future research should assess the impact of parental incarceration on body weight across children's stage of development, type and duration of incarceration, nature of conviction, population subgroup and geographical region, and elucidate the psychosocial pathways linking parental incarceration to unhealthy body weight.

AB  - After decades of stagnation, research on psychedelic substances (such as lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], psilocybin, or N,N-dimethyltryptamine [DMT]) has experienced a renaissance over the last 10 years, with various major research programs being conducted across Europe and the United States. This research primarily investigates the potential of psychedelics in the treatment of mental health disorders, their short- and long-term effects on recreational users, and the neurological and cognitive processes responsible for their effects. The present review provides a concise summary of the most recent insights gained from this research. We briefly outline the history of psychedelic research, the objective and subjective effects caused by these substances, the prevalence and socio-psychological correlates of their use, as well as their potential for harm. Subsequently, we review empirical research on the beneficial effects of psychedelics in clinical samples, focusing on their efficacy in the treatment of major depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders, and discuss research on the proposed neural and cognitive mechanisms behind these effects. We then review research on their effects on healthy subjects, focusing on psychological well-being as well as changes in personality, nature-relatedness, and creativity. Finally, we review empirical evidence regarding the long-term effects of single experiences with psychedelics and conclude with a summary and outlook.

AB  - Interactions of plastic particles with different organic/inorganic pollutants including heavy metals impact their ecotoxicological potential, and proper understanding in this regard is important for their ecological risk assessment. However, many studies have reported the interactions between micro-/nanoplastics (MNPs) and heavy metals (HMs), but the most prevalent interactive forces and factors monitoring their interactions are still not clear. So, the present review represents the mechanisms of interactions with special emphasis on major interactive forces and biophysicochemical and environmental factors influencing trace element's adsorption onto the surface of MNPs. Electrostatic interaction and pore-filling mechanism can best explain the HMs adsorption to MNPs. A number of biophysicochemical factors (such as biofilm, size, crystallinity, and surface charge) and environmental factors (such as pH, salt, and temperature) act together for mediating interactions and ecotoxicities of MNPs and HMs in the real environment. From a toxicological point of view, the synergistic mode of action may be more active in animals, whereas the antagonistic activity may be prevalent in plants. Besides polymer density, biofilm formation and agglomeration property of MNPs can control the vertical distribution of MNPs along the water column. Finally, the ecotoxicological potential of MNPs in the natural environment can be considered as a function of spatiotemporal variation in abiotic (including MNPs and heavy metals) and biotic components. This review will be helpful in the detail understanding of ecotoxicological risk assessment of MNPs in relation to their interaction with heavy metals.

AB  - Coal-based power generation is a principal source of electricity in India and many other countries. About 15-30% of the total amount of residue generated during coal combustion is fly ash (FA). FA is generally alkaline in nature and contains many toxic metals like Cr, Pb, Hg, As and Cd along with many essential elements like S, B, Ca, Na, Fe, Zn, Mn and P. Dumped FA contaminates the biosphere by mobilization of its fine particles and hazardous metals. Despite the negative environmental impact of FA, coal continues to be a major source of power production in India and therefore FA disposal is a major environmental issue. To overcome this problem, FA dumping sites have been started as a potential resource for biomass production of tree species. Phytoremediation is a strategy that uses plants to degrade, stabilize, and remove contaminants from soils, water and waste FA. Phytomanagement of FA is based on the plants' root systems, high biomass, woody nature, native nature, and resistance to pH, salinity, and toxic metals. Recently Indian researchers mostly from the National Botanical Research Institute have been working on phytoremediation and revegetation of FA dykes, inoculation of bacterial strains for reducing FA stress and biomass production from FA dykes. Many international researchers have worked on reclamation, revegetation and utilization of FA. FA utilization saves resources, mainly land (topsoil), water, coal, limestone and chemical fertilizer. Safe utilization of FA is a major concern around the world and regulatory bodies are enforcing stringent rules for the proper management of FA. This article summarizes various viable avenues in India for FA utilization and environmental management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The natural environment for mangrove plants is composed of a complex set of abiotic and biotic stress factors that include salinity, heavy metal, low oxygen, flooding, UV-B, water logging, and biotic interferences of various magnitude. Salinity stress exerts adverse effects on plants by disrupting the ionic and osmotic equilibrium of the cells leading to decrease in plant growth and development. Similarly, presence of heavy metals in environment induces a disturbance of the cellular redox balance, thereby affecting growth and productivity of mangrove plants. Anaerobic environment in mangroves manifested by anoxic or hypoxic condition exhibit various metabolic changes in plants to overcome the stress condition. Besides, the mangrove plants are also permanently exposed to various biotic stress factors that include microbial pathogens (viruses, bacteria and fungi), nematodes, insects etc. More often, these stress factors result in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within different cellular compartments of the plant cell that are detrimental to the survival of the plants. However, the mangrove plants can withstand these stress conditions through morphological and physiological adaptations and development of an efficient antioxidative defence system composed of non-enzymatic and enzymatic systems. The antioxidant system works in concert to control the cascades of uncontrolled oxidation and protect plant cells from oxidative damage by scavenging of ROS produced owing to different abiotic and biotic stresses. The present review highlights various abiotic and biotic stress conditions that are prevalent in mangrove environment and the manner in which mangrove plants overcome these stress situations through metabolic changes and induction of antioxidant defence system.

AB  - Loss of control eating is a core, transdiagnostic eating disorder symptom associated with psychological distress, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life. However, the factors that contribute to persistent loss of control eating despite negative consequences are not fully understood. Understanding the mechanisms that maintain loss of control eating is crucial to advance treatments that interrupt these processes. Affect regulation models of loss of control eating hypothesize that negative emotions trigger loss of control eating, and that loss of control eating is negatively reinforced because it temporarily decreases negative affect. Several variations on this basic affect regulation model have been proposed, including theories suggesting that negative affect decreases during loss of control eating rather than afterwards (escape theory), and that loss of control eating replaces one negative emotion with another that is less aversive (trade-off theory). Experience sampling designs that measure negative affect and eating behavior multiple times per day are optimally suited to examining the nuanced predictions of these affect regulation models in people's everyday lives. This paper critically reviews experience sampling studies examining associations between negative affect and loss of control eating, and discusses the implications for different affect regulation models of loss of control eating. The review concludes by proposing an expanded affect-focused model of loss of control eating that incorporates trait-level individual differences and momentary biological and environmental variables to guide future research. Clinical implications and recommendations are discussed.

AB  - Haemosporida is a large group of vector-borne intracellular parasites that infect amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. This group includes the different malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) that infect humans around the world. Our knowledge on the full life cycle of these parasites is most complete for those parasites that infect humans and, to some extent, birds. However, our current knowledge on haemosporidian life cycles is characterized by a paucity of information concerning the vector species responsible for their transmission among vertebrates. Moreover, our taxonomic and systematic knowledge of haemosporidians is far from complete, in particular because of insufficient sampling in wild vertebrates and in tropical regions. Detailed experimental studies to identify avian haemosporidian vectors are uncommon, with only a few published during the last 25 years. As such, little knowledge has accumulated on haemosporidian life cycles during the last three decades, hindering progress in ecology, evolution, and systematic studies of these avian parasites. Nonetheless, recently developed molecular tools have facilitated advances in haemosporidian research. DNA can now be extracted from vectors' blood meals and the vertebrate host identified; if the blood meal is infected by haemosporidians, the parasite's genetic lineage can also be identified. While this molecular tool should help to identify putative vector species, detailed experimental studies on vector competence are still needed. Furthermore, molecular tools have helped to refine our knowledge on Haemosporida taxonomy and systematics. Herein we review studies conducted on Diptera vectors transmitting avian haemosporidians from the late 1800s to the present. We also review work on Haemosporida taxonomy and systematics since the first application of molecular techniques and provide recommendations and suggest future research directions. Because human encroachment on natural environments brings human populations into contact with novel parasite sources, we stress that the best way to avoid emergent and reemergent diseases is through a program encompassing ecological restoration, environmental education, and enhanced understanding of the value of ecosystem services.

AB  - Recent research indicates a heightened risk of suicide in this population, a concern given that suicide may be more accepted for those with physical disabilities than for those without such disabilities. The relationship between physical disability and suicide has begun to be examined within empirically supported frameworks of suicide and indicates that interpersonal factors (e.g. perceived burdensomeness) and pain are mechanisms contributing to this heightened risk of suicide. The suicide rate after acquiring a physical disability, such as a spinal cord injury, and the greater odds of suicide after reporting having a disability further support the association between physical disability and suicide. The multifaceted nature of physical disability is reflected in its relationship with suicidal ideation and behaviors.

AB  - Are animals capable of empathy, problem-solving, or even self-recognition? Much research is dedicated to answering these questions and yet few studies have considered how humans form beliefs about animal minds. Evidence suggests that our mentalising of animals is a natural consequence of Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities. However, where beliefs regarding animal mind have been investigated, there has been slow progress in establishing the mechanism underpinning how this is achieved. Here, we consider what conclusions can be drawn regarding how people theorise about animal minds and the different conceptual and methodological issues that might limit the accuracy of conclusions currently drawn from this work. We suggest a new empirical framework for better capturing the human theory of animal mind, which in turn has significant political and social implications.

AB  - Interoception, the sense of the body's internal physiological state, underpins homeostatic reflexes, motivational states, and sensations contributing to emotional experiences. The continuous nature of interoceptive processing, coupled to behavior, is implicated in the neurobiological construction of the sense of self. Aberrant integration and control of interoceptive signals, originating in the brain and/or the periphery, can perturb the whole system. Interoceptive abnormalities are implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and in the symptomatic expression of developmental, neurodegenerative, and neurological disorders. Moreover, interoceptive mechanisms appear central to somatic disorders of brain-body interactions, including functional digestive disorders, chronic pain, and comorbid conditions. The present article provides an overview of disorders of interoception and suggests future directions for better understanding, diagnosis, and management of these disorders.

AB  - A host of learning, memory, and decision-making processes form the individual's response to threat and may be disrupted in anxiety and post-trauma psychopathology. Here we review the neural computations of threat, from the first encounter with a dangerous situation, through learning, storing, and updating cues that predict it, to making decisions about the optimal course of action. The overview highlights the interconnected nature of these processes and their reliance on shared neural and computational mechanisms. We propose an integrative approach to the study of threat-related processes, in which specific computations are studied across the various stages of threat experience rather than in isolation. This approach can generate new insights about the evolution, diagnosis, and treatment of threat-related psychopathology.

AB  - Changes in cognition, affect, and brain function combine to promote a shift in the nature of mentation in older adulthood, favoring exploitation of prior knowledge over exploratory search as the starting point for thought and action. Age-related exploitation biases result from the accumulation of prior knowledge, reduced cognitive control, and a shift toward affective goals. These are accompanied by changes in cortical networks, as well as attention and reward circuits. By incorporating these factors into a unified account, the exploration-to-exploitation shift offers an integrative model of cognitive, affective, and brain aging. Here, we review evidence for this model, identify determinants and consequences, and survey the challenges and opportunities posed by an exploitation-biased mental mode in later life.

AB  - A review of findings from the field of environmental psychology shows that humans are aesthetically attracted to natural contents and to particular landscape configurations. These features are also found to have positive effects on human functioning and can reduce stress. However, opportunities for contact with these elements are reduced in modern urban life. It is argued how this evolution can have subtle but nontrivial adverse effects on psychological and physiological well-being. These can be countered by integrating key features of natural contents and structural landscape features in the built environment. Several practical proposals are discussed, ranging from literal imitations of natural objects (such as plants) to the use of nature's fractal geometry in an architectural context.

AB  - The nature and neural implementation of emotions is the subject of vigorous debate. Here, we use Bayesian decision theory to address key complexities in this field and conceptualize emotions in terms of their relationship to survival-relevant behavioural choices. Decision theory indicates which behaviours are optimal in a given situation; however, the calculations required are radically intractable. We therefore conjecture that the brain uses a range of pre-programmed algorithms that provide approximate solutions. These solutions seem to produce specific behavioural manifestations of emotions and can also be associated with core affective dimensions. We identify principles according to which these algorithms are implemented in the brain and illustrate our approach by considering decision making in the face of proximal threat.

The experimental literature found that physically attractive people were perceived as more sociable, dominant, sexually warm, mentally healthy, intelligent, and socially skilled than physically unattractive people.  Yet, the correlational literature indicated generally trivial relationships between physical attractiveness and measures of personality and mental ability, although good-looking people were less lonely, less socially anxious, more popular, more socially skilled, and more sexually experienced than unattractive people.  Self-ratings of physical attractiveness were positively correlated with a wider range of attributes than was actual physical attractiveness.

AB  - Neuroendocrine studies examining the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis under baseline conditions and in response to neuroendocrine challenges have supported the hypothesis of altered HPA functioning in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  However, to date, there is much debate concerning the nature of HPA changes in PTSD.  Furthermore, in studies showing parallel findings in PTSD and major depressive disorder there is controversy regarding whether the HPA alterations suggest a specific pathophysiology of PTSD, or, rather, reflect comorbid major depressive disorder.  This review summarizes findings of HPA axis dysfunction in both PTSD and major depressive disorder, and shows distinct patterns of HPA changes, which are probably due to different mechanisms of action for cortisol and its regulatory factors.

In this review we discuss this research and recent electrophysiological data from behaving rats that demonstrate reduced neuronal coordination and processing efficiency in adolescents. A more comprehensive understanding of these processes will further our knowledge of adolescent behavioral vulnerabilities and the pathophysiology of mental illnesses that manifest during this period.

Nonetheless, better designed studies indicate that life events influence the course of bipolar disorder. Little is known, however about the nature of events that are of particular importance to this disorder. Given the strong biological vulnerability and the unique clinical aspects of bipolar disorder, certain forms of stress may have stronger interactions with vulnerability characteristics. Three major biological theories of bipolar disorder are discussed, with particular attention to their implications for investigations of Life events. Although tenuous, these models suggest that greater attention needs to be paid to particular dimensions of life events and the course of disorder.

AB  - Considering the inherent developmental nature of language learners' affective variables (e.g., their motivation, grit, foreign language enjoyment, and boredom), nuances of the development of these constructs need to be approached from a complex dynamic systems theory (CDST) perspective. Among the qualitative research methodologies compatible with the CDST is the social network analysis (SNA) with the interconnectedness and interdependence of systems within a social network at its core. In this article, an overall introduction to SNA is presented first and then followed by a review of the limited existing literature on second language acquisition (SLA) studies. Then, I argue why this innovative research method is suitable to investigate the dynamic nature of L2 learners' affective variables in the social network of classroom learning. I also suggest several relevant research questions that can potentially be formulated and answered using the SNA. The article ends with conclusive remarks on the need for a more extensive use of innovative CDST-compatible research methods such as SNA in the prospective SLA line of research.

AB  - The effect of pressure - by definition a 3-dimensional concept - on 2-dimensional systems brings a number of fundamental questions, which have been partly answered through newly engineered samples and experimental setups. In this review of the high-pressure Raman studies of graphene, we will in particular underline the importance of the presence of a supporting substrate and its role for the production of biaxial strain conditions in high pressure experiments. Raman shifts observed during these experiments may be related to the strain induced by the substrate rather than by the applied pressure, graphene stress, and hydrostatic pressure not being straightforwardly equivalent in this case of a composite 2D-on-3D material. We will also consider the effects of the nature of the substrate surface, the nature of the pressure transmitting media, as well as the effect of the number of layers on the high-pressure response of the 2D-system, by using the phonon behavior as strain probe as pressure is applied. The effects of adhesion and of strain transfer from the substrate to the 2D-system will be at the heart of our discussion. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Psychology and developmental psychology alike are dominated by a core assumption concerning the nature of representation, an assumption that representation has the nature of an encoding. I argue that this assumption is false and offer an alternative model of representation based on the pragmatics of action. Encodingism yields multitudinous and multifarious problems. problems which I have addressed in detail elsewhere. One of the central problems of encodingism, however. is that it creates a class of fatal problems collectively called ''the frame problems." I argue that the frame problems originate in the inherent requirement that encoding representations carry explicit content-if the content were not explicit, then the encoding would not encode anything and would not be a representation at all. These problems-and others, such that encodings cannot emerge, and, therefore, render development impossible-visit themselves on theories that are constructed within an encodingist set of presuppositions. Conversely, the interactive alternative model of representation that I offer has its own powerful consequences for development-the issues at stake are not trivial. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Social interactions for many species of animals are critical for survival, wellbeing, and reproduction. Optimal navigation of a social system increases chances for survival and reproduction, therefore there is strong incentive to fit into social structures. Social animals rely heavily on dominant-submissive behaviors in establishment of stable social hierarchies. There is a link between extreme manifestation of dominance/submissiveness and behavioral deviations. To understand neural substrates affiliated with a specific hierarchical rank, there is a real need for reliable animal behavioral models. Different paradigms have been consolidated over time to study the neurobiology of social rank behavior in a standardized manner using rodent models to unravel the neural pathways and substrates involved in normal and abnormal intraspecific social interactions. This review summarizes and discusses the commonly used behavioral tests and new directions for the assessment of dominance in rodents. We discuss the hierarchy inheritable nature and other critical issues regarding hierarchical rank manifestation which may help in designing social-rank-related studies that serve as promising pre-clinical tools in behavioral psychiatry.

AB  - Sociality has profound evolutionary roots and is observed from unicellular organisms to multicellular animals. In line with the view that social principles apply across levels of biological complexity, a growing body of data highlights the remarkable social nature of mitochondria - life-sustaining endosymbiotic organelles with their own genome that populate the cell cytoplasm. Here, we draw from organizing principles of behavior in social organisms to reveal that similar to individuals among social networks, mitochondria communicate with each other and with the cell nucleus, exhibit group formation and interdependence, synchronize their behaviors, and functionally specialize to accomplish specific functions within the organism. Mitochondria are social organelles. The extension of social principles across levels of biological complexity is a theoretical shift that emphasizes the role of communication and interdependence in cell biology, physiology, and neuroscience. With the help of emerging computational methods capable of capturing complex dynamic behavioral patterns, the implementation of social concepts in mitochondrial biology may facilitate cross-talk across disciplines towards increasingly holistic and accurate models of human health.

AB  - Aggressive individuals are thought to process social information in such a manner that the likelihood of engaging in aggressive acts increases drastically. Additionally, emotion and emotion regulation skills are implicated in aggressive and violent behavior as well. However, little attention has been paid to the reciprocal relations between emotion and emotion regulation and Social Information Processing (SIP) in explaining aggression. Therefore, the present study systematically examined extant research on the role of emotion and SIP in aggressive behavior. The results supported substantial overlap between emotion and emotion regulation processes and SIP in explaining aggression. Due to the paucity and nature of available studies, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the nature of their reciprocal relationships. However, the integration of cognition and emotion seems a promising avenue of research for explaining the development and manifestation of aggressive behavior, as well as to inform its prevention and treatment. Future research is needed to elucidate the likely intertwined roles of emotion and the entire SIP process in offender or at-risk populations.

AB  - Unawareness related to brain injury has implications for participation in rehabilitation, functional outcomes, and the emotional well-being of clients. Addressing disorders of awareness is an integral component of many rehabilitation programmes, and a review of the literature identified a range of awareness interventions that include holistic milieu-oriented neuropsychological programmes, psychotherapy, compensatory and facilitatory approaches, structured experiences, direct feedback, videotaped feedback, confrontational techniques, cognitive therapy, group therapy, game formats and behavioural intervention. These approaches are examined in terms of their theoretical bases and research evidence. A distinction is made between intervention approaches for unawareness due to neurocognitive factors and approaches for unawareness due to psychological factors. The socio-cultural context of unawareness is a third factor presented in a biopsychosocial framework to guide clinical decisions about awareness interventions. The ethical and methodological concerns associated with research on awareness interventions are discussed. The main considerations relate to the embedded nature of awareness interventions within rehabilitation programmes, the need for individually tailored interventions, differing responses according to the nature of unawareness, and the risk of eliciting emotional distress in some clients.

A potential part solution that is receiving increasing attention is computer-delivered psychological therapy, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic as health care systems moved to remote service delivery. However, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) requires active engagement by service users, and low adherence may minimize treatment effectiveness. Therefore, it is important to investigate the acceptability of cCBT to understand implementation issues and maximize potential benefits.
   Objective: This study aimed to produce a critical appraisal of published reviews about the acceptability of cCBT for adults.
   Methods: An umbrella review informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology identified systematic reviews about the acceptability of cCBT for common adult mental disorders. Acceptability was operationalized in terms of uptake of, dropping out from, or completion of cCBT treatment; factors that facilitated or impeded adherence; and reports about user, carer, and health care professional experience and satisfaction with cCBT. Databases were searched using search terms informed by relevant published research. Review selection and quality appraisal were guided by the JBI methodology and the AMSTAR tool and undertaken independently by 2 reviewers.
   Results: The systematic searches of databases identified 234 titles, and 9 reviews (covering 151 unique studies) met the criteria. Most studies were comprised of service users with depression, anxiety, or specifically, panic disorder or phobia. Operationalization of acceptability varied across reviews, thereby making it difficult to synthesize results. There was a similar number of guided and unguided cCBT programs; 34% of guided and 36% of unguided users dropped out; and guidance included email, telephone, face-to-face, and discussion forum support. Guided cCBT was completed in full by 8%-74% of the participants, while 94% completed one module and 67%-84% completed some modules. Unguided cCBT was completed in full by 16%-66% of participants, while 95% completed one module and 54%-93% completed some modules. Guided cCBT appeared to be associated with adherence (sustained via telephone). A preference for face-to-face CBT compared to cCBT (particularly for users who reported feeling isolated), internet or computerized delivery problems, negative perceptions about cCBT, low motivation, too busy or not having enough time, and personal circumstances were stated as reasons for dropping out. Yet, some users favored the anonymous nature of cCBT, and the capacity to undertake cCBT in one's own time was deemed beneficial but also led to avoidance of cCBT. There was inconclusive evidence for an association between sociodemographic variables, mental health status, and cCBT adherence or dropping out. Users tended to be satisfied with cCBT, reported improvements in mental health, and recommended cCBT. Overall, the results indicated that service users' preferences were important considerations regarding the use of cCBT.
   Conclusions: The review indicated that "one size did not fit all" regarding the acceptability of cCBT and that individual tailoring of cCBT is required in order to increase population reach, uptake, and adherence and therefore, deliver treatment benefits and improve mental health.

AB  - Opposing mood states and autonomic regulation are primarily anchored in the areas of the diencephalon and the bordering mesencephalic limbic brain regions with the hypothalamus as a "nodal point" of central autonomic regulation. In the case of mood regulation from a hypothalamic perspective there are upstream and downstream discharges, whereby the latter typically steer vegetative effectors through a dual noradrenergic-cholinergic mechanism. The ergotropic-trophotropic zones of the hypothalamus correspond to the division of the autonomic nervous system into sympathetic and parasympathetic and demonstrate in combination with the mesencephalic-limbic coupled ergotropic-trophotropic circuits the importance of the autonomic regulatory structure for central regulation.
   If one assumes in an ideal model, that the effector "mood", which through its middle set-point, its mono- and bipolar steering capacity and involuntary control shows itself characteristics of a vegetative effector, through central discharges in similar "vegetative ways" receives input from the ergotropic and trophotropic system, a describability of normal and polar mood states becomes evident. From the perspective of autonomic regulatory structure it follows that a multiplicity of ergotropic-trophotropic balances can bring the CNS to the same mood state. One exception is extreme anger and markedly elevated mood, which require a relatively narrow definition of the ergotropic-trophotropic balance of the CNS. Fear and depressed mood can however be integrated in ergotropic or trophotropic activation of the CNS, included as extremes in a continuum of in-between states and for example speak against anxiety or depressed mood as being states of continuous pathologic stress axis activation. From the autonomic regulatory structure follows from a functional perspective that the central nervous systems number of degrees of freedom increases upon sinking of the mood out of elevated mood or respectively upon the changeover from anger into anxiety.
   Manic and depressive mood are discussed under the aspect of autonomic control and clinical cases are presented. These point on the one hand to the systemic nature of particular forms of depression, on the other hand to the prognostic significance of the central autonomic reactivity. According to Gellhorn from a pathophysiologic standpoint we stress the nonantagonistic form of regulation, which can lead to an activation of trophotropic mechanisms at the cerebral level if the degree of diencephalic ergotropic activation exceeds a critical level. Under this aspect the appearance of a (prodromal) depressed mood as being a symptom of a compensatory regulation of the CNS to an excitatory cerebral process is discussed. The resulting amplified ergotropic and trophotropic activation of the CNS allows to expect, in addition to psychopathologic symptoms, a dysfunctional influence on the autonomic periphery, which is compatible with the appearance of peripheral hyperfunction and hypofunction, along with the prognostic worsening of a comorbid disease. The implications and the meaning of autonomic control structure for clinical psychiatry and neuropsychiatry are unfolded.

AB  - Climate change induced by anthropogenic warming of the earth's atmosphere is a daunting problem. This review examines one of the consequences of climate change that has only recently attracted attention: namely, the effects of climate change on the environmental distribution and toxicity of chemical pollutants. A review was undertaken of the scientific literature (original research articles, reviews, government and intergovernmental reports) focusing on the interactions of toxicants with the environmental parameters, temperature, precipitation, and salinity, as altered by climate change. Three broad classes of chemical toxicants of global significance were the focus: air pollutants, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including some organochlorine pesticides, and other classes of pesticides. Generally, increases in temperature will enhance the toxicity of contaminants and increase concentrations of tropospheric ozone regionally, but will also likely increase rates of chemical degradation. While further research is needed, climate change coupled with air pollutant exposures may have potentially serious adverse consequences for human health in urban and polluted regions. Climate change producing alterations in: food webs, lipid dynamics. ice and snow melt, and organic carbon cycling could result in increased POP levels in water, soil, and biota. There is also compelling evidence that increasing temperatures could be deleterious to pollutant-exposed wildlife. For example, elevated water temperatures may alter the biotransformation of contaminants to more bioactive metabolites and impair homeostasis. The complex interactions between climate change and pollutants may be particularly problematic for species living at the edge of their physiological tolerance range where acclimation capacity may be limited. In addition to temperature increases, regional precipitation patterns are projected to be altered with climate change. Regions subject to decreases in precipitation may experience enhanced volatilization of POPs and pesticides to the atmosphere. Reduced precipitation will also increase air pollution in urbanized regions resulting in negative health effects, which may be exacerbated by temperature increases. Regions subject to increased precipitation will have lower levels of air pollution, but will likely experience enhanced surface deposition of airborne POPs and increased run-off of pesticides. Moreover, increases in the intensity and frequency of storm events linked to climate change could lead to more severe episodes of chemical contamination of water bodies and surrounding watersheds. Changes in salinity may affect aquatic organisms as an independent stressor as well as by altering the bioavailability and in some instances increasing the toxicity of chemicals. A paramount issue will be to identify species and populations especially vulnerable to climate-pollutant interactions, in the context of the many other physical, chemical, and biological stressors that will be altered with climate change. Moreover, it will be important to predict tipping points that might trigger or accelerate synergistic interactions between climate change and contaminant exposures, (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with infant low birth weight and with multiple health indicators affecting childhood morbidity and mortality. The condition is twice as prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared to high-income countries but poorly studied.
   Aim: To conduct a review of published literature on interventions for perinatal depression in LMICs.
   Methods: A search of the literature was performed for articles published up to October 2017. The key inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed studies focusing on interventions for perinatal depression during pregnancy and/or up to one-year postpartum.
   Results: 1088 citations were retrieved, of which 18 studies with representation from countries in Africa, Asia, North America (Mexico) and South America were included. The majority of interventions were conducted in lower-income settings. Most were psychosocial in nature and often provided by lay health workers and in the community. Interventions integrated as part of general health programs and employing psychotherapeutic approaches were more effective and were also preferred. Only one study incorporated the use of psychiatric medications.
   Conclusion: Despite the limited publications, there is reasonable evidence for the benefit of psychological interventions in perinatal depression in LMICs. More research is needed to verify and extend these results and, in particular, to evaluate the benefit of adjunctive medications when treating moderate to severe depression and whether interventions can increase social supports.

AB  - Puberty is often implicated in the onset or exacerbation of psychopathology during adolescence, and pubertal timing and tempo have emerged as important predictors of wellbeing. In the psychosocial literature there is a tendency to view individual differences in the nature (timing and tempo) of pubertal development as either determined by stress experienced in childhood or as a determinant of the development of psychopathology; few studies, however, have examined puberty as both. We propose that pubertal timing and tempo are neither simply antecedents nor consequences with respect to onset or exacerbation of psychopathology, but rather as markers of accumulating risk such as that conceptualized as allostatic load. Further, we propose that integrating coping and self-regulation into models of off-time pubertal maturation presents an opportunity to forge linkages among the processes that precede and follow pubertal development, which may provide malleable intervention targets to offset the costs of early life stress and off-time maturation. The present narrative review synthesizes research from the following literatures: (1) the role of stress in determining the timing and tempo of pubertal development; (2) the role of stress in influencing how pubertal development affects socioemotional and behavioral outcomes during adolescence, and (3) the role of coping and self-regulation in understanding conditional adaptations to stress. Given the conclusions of this synthesis, critical recommendations are made for research and intervention work with adolescents.

AB  - The accumulating knowledge of the host-microbiota interplay gives rise to the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. The MGB axis depicts the interkingdom communication between the gut microbiota and the brain. This communication process involves the endocrine, immune and neurotransmitters systems. Dysfunction of these systems, along with the presence of gut dysbiosis, have been detected among clinically depressed patients. This implicates the involvement of a maladaptive MGB axis in the pathophysiology of depression. Depression refers to symptoms that characterize major depressive disorder (MDD), a mood disorder with a disease burden that rivals that of heart diseases. The use of probiotics to treat depression has gained attention in recent years, as evidenced by increasing numbers of animal and human studies that have supported the antidepressive efficacy of probiotics. Physiological changes observed in these studies allow for the elucidation of probiotics antidepressive mechanisms, which ultimately aim to restore proper functioning of the MGB axis. However, the understanding of mechanisms does not yet complete the endeavor in applying probiotics to treat MDD. Other challenges remain which include the heterogeneous nature of both the gut microbiota composition and depressive symptoms in the clinical setting. Nevertheless, probiotics offer some advantages over standard pharmaceutical antidepressants, in terms of residual symptoms, side effects and stigma involved. This review outlines antidepressive mechanisms of probiotics based on the currently available literature and discusses therapeutic potentials of probiotics for depression.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this paper is to critically review the literature on major mental illness and problematic substance use in order to provide clinicians and policymakers with evidence to support proposed directions for management of the above.
   Method: The available literature was accessed using computerised databases and manual searching.
   Results: The predominantly North American-based literature is largely descriptive. Those studies which attempt empirical evaluation are limited by methodological weaknesses which include small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, inadequate measurement of substance use, lack of experimental design, and treatment drift over time. However, there is consensus among most studies regarding prevalence rates and treatment.
   Conclusions: Problematic substance use is the most common comorbid condition among people with a major mental illness and is associated with poorer patient outcomes. There is evidence to suggest that the integration of mental health and drug and alcohol services will result in improved detection, assessment and management of comorbidity. Integration refers to the provision of comprehensive services by a single service with staff who are competent in both mental health and drug and alcohol skills. A tolerant, non-confrontational approach to substance use is most appropriate for people with a major mental illness. Treatment programs need to recognise the longitudinal nature of substance abuse and dependence. More research needs to be conducted in this field in order to establish guidelines for effective management.

AB  - In the last few decades, attention on new natural antimicrobial compounds has arisen due to a change in consumer preferences and the increase in the number of resistant microorganisms. Algae are defined as photosynthetic organisms that demonstrate a wide range of adaptability to adverse environmental conditions like temperature extremes, photo-oxidation, high or low salinity, and osmotic stress. Algae are primarily known to produce large amounts of secondary metabolite against various kinds of pathogenic microbes. Among these algae, micro and microalgae of river, lake, and algae of oceanic origin have been reported to have antimicrobial activity against the bacteria and fungi of pathogenic nature. Various polar and non- polar extracts of micro- and macro algae have been used for the suppression of these pathogenic fungi. Apart from these, certain algal derivatives have also been isolated from these having antibacterial and antifungal potential. Among the bioactive molecules of algae, polysaccharides, sulphated polysaccharides, phyco-cyanobilins polyphenols, lectins, proteins lutein, vitamin E, B-12 and K-1, peptides, polyunsaturated fatty acids and pigments can be highlighted. In the present review, we will discuss the biological activity of these derived compounds as antifungal/ antibacterial agents and their most promising applications. A brief outline is also given for the prospects of these isolated phytochemicals and using algae as therapeutic in the dietary form. We have also tried to answer whether alga-derived metabolites can serve as potential therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 like viral infections too.

AB  - Mental illness remains the greatest chronic health burden globally with few in-roads having been made despite significant advances in genomic knowledge in recent decades. The field of psychiatry is constantly challenged to bring new approaches and tools to address and treat the needs of vulnerable individuals and subpopulations, and that has to be supported by a continuous growth in knowledge. The majority of neuropsychiatric symptoms reflect complex gene-environment interactions, with epigenetics bridging the gap between genetic susceptibility and environmental stressors that trigger disease onset and drive the advancement of symptoms. It has more recently been demonstrated in preclinical models that epigenetics underpins the transgenerational inheritance of stress-related behavioural phenotypes in both paternal and maternal lineages, providing further supporting evidence for heritability in humans. However, unbiased prospective studies of this nature are practically impossible to conduct in humans so preclinical models remain our best option for researching the molecular pathophysiologies underlying many neuropsychiatric conditions. While rodents will remain the dominant model system for preclinical studies (especially for addressing complex behavioural phenotypes), there is scope to expand current research of the molecular and epigenetic pathologies by using invertebrate models. Here, we will discuss the utility and advantages of two alternative model organisms-Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster-and summarise the compelling insights of the epigenetic regulation of transgenerational inheritance that are potentially relevant to human psychiatry.</p>

AB  - The brainstem is a neglected brain area in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and autonomic dysfunction. In Depression, several observations have been made in relation to changes in one particular the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) which also points toward as key area in various age-related and neurodevelopmental diseases. The DRN is further thought to be related to stress regulated processes and cognitive events. It is involved in neurodegeneration, e.g., amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and impaired synaptic transmission in Alzheimer's disease as shown in our autopsy findings. The DRN is a phylogenetically old brain area, with projections that reach out to a large number of regions and nuclei of the central nervous system, particularly in the forebrain. These ascending projections contain multiple neurotransmitters. One of the main reasons for the past and current interest in the DRN is its involvement in depression, and its main transmitter serotonin. The DRN also points toward the increased importance and focus of the brainstem as key area in various age-related and neurodevelopmental diseases.
   This review describes the morphology, ascending projections and the complex neurotransmitter nature of the DRN, stressing its role as a key research target into the neural bases of depression.

AB  - Objectives:
   Service users with severe psychiatric illnesses, such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, are more likely to suffer from ill health. There is evidence that lifestyle interventions, for example, exercise, dietary advice and smoking cessation programmes for service users with severe mental illness can be of health benefit. This review was carried out to identify the literature pertaining to physical health interventions for service users who have experienced a first-episode psychosis (FEP), to examine the nature of the interventions which were carried out and to assess these interventions in terms of feasibility and efficacy.
   Methods:
   A narrative review was conducted in August 2019 by searching 'Pubmed' and 'Embase' electronic databases. Studies investigating the effect a physical health intervention had on service users who had experienced a FEP were included in the review.
   Results:
   Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria: 12 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative. Exercise, dietary advice, smoking cessation and motivational coaching were some of the physical health interventions utilised in the identified studies. Positive effects were seen in terms of physical health markers wherever they were investigated, particularly when the intervention was delivered early. The impact on psychiatric symptoms and longer-term impacts on health were less frequently assessed.
   Conclusions:
   Physical health interventions have a positive impact on service users who have experienced a FEP. More research is warranted in this area in Ireland. These studies should include controls, have longer follow-up periods and should assess the impact on psychiatric health.

AB  - Objective: While everyone including front-line clinicians should strive to prevent the maltreatment and other severe stresses experienced by many children and adults in everyday life, psychiatrists and other health professionals also need to consider how best to support, throughout the lifespan, those people affected by severe adversity. The first step in achieving this is a clear understanding of the definitions and concepts in the rapidly growing study of resilience. Our paper reviews the definitions of resilience and the range of factors understood as contributing to it, and considers some of the implications for clinical care and public health.
   Method: This narrative review took a major Canadian report published in 2006 as its starting point. The databases, MEDLINE and PsycINFO, were searched for new relevant citations from 2006 up to July 2010 to identify key papers considering the definitions of resilience and related concepts.
   Results: Definitions have evolved over time but fundamentally resilience is understood as referring to positive adaptation, or the ability to maintain or regain mental health, despite experiencing adversity. The personal, biological, and environmental or systemic sources of resilience and their interaction are considered. An interactive model of resilience illustrates the factors that enhance or reduce homeostasis or resilience.
   Conclusions: The 2 key concepts for clinical and public health work are: the dynamic nature of resilience throughout the lifespan; and the interaction of resilience in different ways with major domains of life function, including intimate relationships and attachments.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has traditionally been associated with cognitive and behavioral changes during both the acute and chronic phases of injury. Because of its noninvasive nature, neuroimaging has the potential to provide unique information on underlying macroscopic and microscopic biological mechanisms that may serve as causative agents for these neuropsychiatric sequelae. This broad scoping review identifies at least 4 common macroscopic pathways that exist between TBI and new-onset psychiatric disorders, as well as several examples of how neuroimaging is currently being utilized in clinical research. The review then critically examines the strengths and limitations of neuroimaging for elucidating TBI-related microscopic pathology, such as microstructural changes, neuroinflammation, proteinopathies, blood-brain barrier damage, and disruptions in cellular signaling. A summary is then provided for how neuroimaging is currently being used to investigate TBI-related pathology in new-onset neurocognitive disorders, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Identified gaps in the literature include a lack of prospective studies to definitively associate imaging findings with the development of new-onset psychiatric disorders, as well as antemortem imaging studies subsequently confirmed with postmortem correlates in the same study cohort. Although the spatial resolution and specificity of imaging biomarkers has greatly improved over the last 2 decades, we conclude that neuroimaging biomarkers do not yet exist for the definitive in vivo diagnosis of cellular pathology. This represents a necessary next step for further elucidating causal relationships between TBI and new onset psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, associated with the economic consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown, has led to mental health consequences among people worldwide. Protecting the mental well-being of populations is an imperative component of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. This scoping review attempts to present an overview of the existing tools to measure COVID-19-related mental health problems.
   Methods: Literature search was conducted in the PubMed electronic database using developed key search terms. Reference lists of the identified eligible articles were reviewed to locate relevant articles missed from the electronic database search. Fifteen scales measuring COVID-19-associated mental health problems, validated among diverse populations across the world, were included in this review.
   Results: The majority of these scales were validated among middle-aged adults in Turkey. Only a few validated scales encompass the negative socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19. None of the available scales focused on the aspects of suicidal ideation or behavioral responses/coping strategies, neither were they inclusive of participants from diverse age, geographic, and COVID-19 exposure groups.
   Conclusion: This scoping review highlights the need for future research to develop and validate comprehensive psychometric tools to assess COVID-19-associated mental health problems. Also, in view of the vulnerable nature of healthcare professionals for developing mental health concerns in the course of providing services for COVID-19-affected individuals, future psychometric research needs to concentrate on the development of measures specific for these professionals.

AB  - As fathers are increasingly involved in childcare, understanding the neurological underpinnings of fathering has become a key research issue in developmental psychobiology research. This systematic review specifically focused on (1) highlighting methodological issues of paternal brain research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and (2) summarizing findings related to paternal brain responses to auditory and visual infant stimuli. Sixteen papers were included from 157 retrieved records. Sample characteristics (e.g., fathers' and infant's age, number of kids, and time spent caregiving), neuroimaging information (e.g., technique, task, stimuli, and processing), and main findings were synthesized by two independent authors. Most of the reviewed works used different stimuli and tasks to test fathers' responses to child visual and/or auditory stimuli. Pre-processing and first-level analyses were performed with standard pipelines. Greater heterogeneity emerged in second-level analyses. Three main cortical networks (mentalization, embodied simulation, and emotion regulation) and a subcortical network emerged linked with fathers' responses to infants' stimuli, but additional areas (e.g., frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex) were also responsive to infants' visual or auditory stimuli. This review suggests that a distributed and complex brain network may be involved in facilitating fathers' sensitivity and responses to infant-related stimuli. Nonetheless, specific methodological caveats, the exploratory nature of large parts of the literature to date, and the presence of heterogeneous tasks and measures also demonstrate that systematic improvements in study designs are needed to further advance the field.

AB  - Cannabinoid agonists generally have a disruptive effect on memory, learning, and operant behavior that is considered to be hippocampus-dependent. Nevertheless, under certain conditions, cannabinoid receptor activation may facilitate neuronal learning processes. For example, CB1 receptors are essential for the extinction of conditioned fear associations, indicating an important role for this receptor in neuronal emotional learning and memory. This review examines the diverse effects of cannabinoids on hippocampal memory and plasticity. It shows how the effects of cannabinoid receptor activation may vary depending on the route of administration, the nature of the task (aversive or not), and whether it involves emotional memory formation (e. g., conditioned fear and extinction learning) or non-emotional memory formation (e. g., spatial learning). It also examines the memory stage under investigation (acquisition, consolidation, retrieval, extinction), and the brain areas involved. Differences between the effects of exogenous and endogenous agonists are also discussed. The apparently biphasic effects of cannabinoids on anxiety is noted as this implies that the effects of cannabinoid receptor agonists on hippocampal learning and memory may be attributable to a general modulation of anxiety or stress levels and not to memory per se. The review concludes that cannabinoids have diverse effects on hippocampal memory and plasticity that cannot be categorized simply into an impairing or an enhancing effect. A better understanding of the involvement of cannabinoids in memory processes will help determine whether the benefits of the clinical use of cannabinoids outweigh the risks of possible memory impairments.

AB  - The translational neuroscience of moral cognitions draws together developments throughout the fields of neuroscience pertaining to moral cognitions in order to better the human condition. That condition, seen through this lens, is one in which much of the violence and suffering we endure and inflict upon one another is based on moral cognitions-attitudes, beliefs, judgments-that are thought to result from correct or incorrect perceptions of moral properties. The biology tells a different story; namely, that moral cognitions, like other cognitions and mental states, are predicted and determined by biological mechanisms modulated by genotype, neurotransmitter availability and receptor density, neurophysiology, and individual differences among these as well as biology-environment interactions including nutrition, experience, and microbiome. A wealth of research has demonstrated that moral reasoning and judgments are easily alterable with the application of pharmaceuticals including SSRIs, and simpler treatments and conditions like the amount of time since one's last meal. Public health experts have pushed for analysis of violence and development of interventions treating violence as a public health pandemic. We see this research as a response to that call. Work in this field demonstrates that we are unaware of both the sources and nature of the cognitions on which we base much of our violent behaviors, societally and individually. Animal studies bolster the human subjects research, demonstrating the evolutionary roots of the causal mechanisms beneath our social structures and group formations.

AB  - Most neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, demonstrate preceding or on-going inflammatory processes. Therefore, discovering effective means of counteracting detrimental inflammatory mediators in the brain could help alter aging-related disease onset and progression. Fish oil and marine-derived omega-3, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3) have shown promising anti-inflammatory effects both systemically and centrally. More specifically, krill oil (KO), extracted from small Antarctic crustaceans, is an alternative type of LC n-3 with reported health benefits including improvement of spatial memory and learning, memory loss, systemic inflammation and depression symptoms. Similar to the more widely studied fish oil, KO contains the long chain fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which are essential for basic brain functions. Moreover, the phospholipid bound nature of fatty acids found in KO improves bioavailability and efficiency of absorption, thus supporting the belief that KO may offer a superior method of dietary n-3 delivery. Finally, KO contains astaxanthin, an antioxidant capable of reducing potentially excessive oxidative stress and inflammation within the brain. This review will discuss the potential benefits of KO over other marine-based LC n-3 on brain inflammation and cognitive function in the context of high fat diets and aging.

AB  - Students, staff, and faculty in higher education are facing unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent data revealed that a good number of academic activities and opportunities were disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants. While much uncertainty remains for the next academic year, how higher education institutions and their students might improve responses to the rapidly changing situation matters. This systematic review and framework proposal aim to update previous empirical work and examine the current evidence for the effectiveness of growth mindset interventions in young adults. To this end, a systematic search identified 20 empirical studies involving 5, 805 young adults. These studies examined growth mindset within ecologically valid educational contexts and various content areas. Generally, these findings showed that brief messages of growth mindset can improve underrepresented students' academic performance and facilitate other relevant psychological constructs. In addition, we argue, although growth mindset has been identified as a unitary concept, it is comprised of multiple interdependent skills, such as self-control, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. Understanding the nature of growth mindset may contribute to successful mindset implementation. Therefore, this article presents a practical framework to help educators in higher education rethink the multidimensionality of growth mindset and to provide their students with alternative routes to achieve their goals. Finally, additional articles were discussed to help evaluate growth mindset interventions in higher education.

TI  - Approach to Patients with 'Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures': A Review
KW  - Conversion disorders
KW  - non-epileptic seizures
KW  - epilepsy
AB  - Several terms have been used for pseudo-seizures, including psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), psychogenic seizures, hysterical seizures and hysteroepilepsy. Among them, the term 'non-epileptic seizures' is preffered. PNES outwardly may appear similar to epilepsy, but are caused purely by emotion. PNES are defined by modern psychiatry as conversion and dissociative disorders, but these disorders may coexist with many other psychiatric disorders including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and personality disorders. The aim of this article is to describe and to compare similarities and differences in epidemiological, psychiatric and semiologic variables between patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and other patients with epilepsy.
   Understanding the nature of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures is necessary in order to reach the right diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and signs. Once a firm diagnosis has been reached, presenting that diagnosis to the individual patient is the first, and one of the most important part of the treatment. Non-epileptic seizures, also reffered to as pseudoseizures, are paroxysmal behaviors with psychological comorbidities and are unresponsive to treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Systematic comparisons between patients with recent onset psychogenic seizures and patients with recent onset non-psychogenic seizures may lead to a better understanding of psychological concomitants and perhaps the aetiology of psychogenic seizures.
   A traumatic experience may be a potential risk factor for patients with PNES. The evidence suggests that a history of childhood abuse might be involved in the aetiology of at least some cases of psychogenic seizures. Such studies are important considering the early differential diagnosis of true epileptic versus psychogenic fits is notoriously difficult.

AB  - Antenatal depression is a known risk factor for postnatal depression; both are common disorders associated with negative impacts on child development. Few studies have followed up women from pregnancy and through the postnatal period to explore how rates of depression change. This review evaluates recent evidence on depression during pregnancy and after childbirth. A search of Embase, PsychINFO, MEDLINE and Cochrane Reviews was carried out to identify longitudinal studies on antenatal and postnatal depression. Studies that measured depression during pregnancy and up to 1 year after childbirth were evaluated against a set of criteria (e.g. less than 50 % attrition). Of the initial 523 studies identified, 16 studies met the final inclusion criteria with a total of 35,419 women. The average rate of antenatal depression across these studies was 17 and 13 % postnatal depression. The longitudinal nature of the studies revealed that on average 39 % of those who experienced antenatal depression went on to have postnatal depression. Similarly, on average, 47 % of those with postnatal depression had also experienced antenatal depression. On average, almost 7 % of women reported significant depressive symptoms in pregnancy that persisted after childbirth. The review provided evidence that rates of depression tend to be higher during pregnancy than in the first year following childbirth. Furthermore, the longitudinal data show that there is much movement between the groups categorised as depressed or not depressed. There is evidence that postnatal depression is often a continuation of existing antenatal depression.

AB  - Knowledge on the brain processes underlying mental disorders has significantly increased in recent decades, but in spite of the very important research efforts being made, there is no biological marker available for such disorders. For example, neurophysiological techniques (EEG or MEG), have been widely utilized in the investigation of the most important psychiatric syndromes such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder or obsessive/compulsive disorder. The outcomes of some of those neurophysiological studies have made it possible to develop statistical models having very high sensitivity and specificity, although those models have not been incorporated into the day to day clinical practice. A possible explanation for this situation is that an inadequate analysis procedure which might be missing some important quantums of information contained in brain signals is being used. In this sense, new methods of non-linear analysis have been proposed for the investigation of neurophysiological data. Particularly, the analysis of brain signal complexity has been widely utilized in the investigation of psychiatric disorders. Parameters of EEG or MEG complexity usually estimate the predictability of brain oscillations and/or the number of independent oscillators underlying the observed signals. More importantly, complexity parameters seem to be sensitive to the temporal components of brain activity, and therefore might reflect the dynamical nature of psychiatric disorders. This paper reviews some of the most relevant studies within this field, especially those focusing on the diagnosis, follow-up and prediction of response to treatment.

AB  - Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) may be understood as a physical and behavioral expression of emotional distress. Over the past 70 years, it has been variably formulated as a type of emotional reaction to various stressors. NSSI has complex goals, sometimes implicit, but overall it serves as a transient psychological relief. Many believe that NSSI is a maladaptive behavior and is not related to suicide, with the primary differentiating factor between suicide and NSSI being the 'intention' to die. NSSI is an important mental health problem in current modern societies, and it is part of a trend in current psychiatric and mental health practice to medicalize maladaptive behaviors or psychological distress. Aims: To review the prevalence, associated factors, purpose, and psychological and social significance of NSSI in developing countries. Method: This article is a narrative review. However, of the total 1,094 articles, 13 articles were included to derive information on the prevalence and methods of NSSI in the developing country. Results: NSSI rates are very variable, ranging from 11.5% to as high as 33.8%, depending on the nature of the sample and study design, but data show an increasing trend globally, including in developing countries. Conclusion: The recent emerging data does not support the notion that it is common in developed Western countries, though the meaning, context and reason for NSSI might differ in developing and developed countries. NSSI is almost equally prevalent in both developing and developed countries.

AB  - The extent of cultural variation in emotion perception has long been assumed to be bounded by underlying universality. A growing body of research reveals, however, that evidence of universality in emotion perception is method-bound. Without the assumption of underlying universality, new lines of inquiry become relevant. Accumulating evidence suggests that cultures vary in what cues are relevant to perceptions of emotion. Further, cultural groups vary in their spontaneous inferences; mental state inference does not appear to be the only, or even most routine, mode of perception across cultures. Finally, setting universality assumptions aside requires innovation in the theory and measurement of culture. Recent studies reveal the promise of refinements in psychological approaches to culture. Together, the available evidence is consistent with a view of emotion perceptions as actively constructed by perceivers to fit the social and physical constraints of their cultural worlds.

Consistent with hypotheses derived from recent theorizing about the moral nature of emotion. CSA survivors who did not voluntarily disclose CSA showed greater facial expressions of shame, whereas CSA survivors who voluntarily disclosed CSA expressed greater disgust. Expressions of disgust also signaled sexual abuse accompanied by violence. Consistent with recent theorizing about smiling behavior, CSA nondisclosers made more polite smiles. whereas nonabused participants expressed greater genuine positive emotion. Discussion addressed the implications of these findings for the study of disclosure Of traumatic events, facial expression, and the links between morality and emotion.

AB  - Recent data concerning ultradian (circahoralian) intracellular rhythms are used to assess the biochemical mechanism of direct cell-cell communication. New results and theoretical considerations suggest a fractal nature of ultradian rhythms and their self-organisation. The fundamental and innate nature of these rhythms relates to their self-similarity at different levels of cell and tissue organisation. They can be detected in cell-free systems as well as in cells and organs in vivo. Such rhythms are a means of finding an optimal state of cell function rather than achieving a state of absolute stability. As a consequence, oscillations, being irregular and numerous by the set of periods, are resilient to functional overload and injury. Recent data on the maintenance of their fractal structure and, especially on the selection of optimal periods are discussed. The positive role of chaotic dynamics is stressed.
   The Ultradian rhythm of protein synthesis in hepatocytes in vitro was used as a marker of direct cell-cell communication. The system demonstrates cell cooperation and synchronisation throughout the cell population, and suggests that the ultradian rhythms arc self-organised. These observations also led to the detection of mechanisms of direct cell-cell communication in which extracellular factors have an essential role. Experimental evidence Indicated the involvement of gangliosides and/or catecholamines In this large-scale synchronisation of protein Synthesis. The response of all, or a major part, of the cell population is important after the initial trigger effect, a periodic pattern is retained for some time. The influence Of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases on protein phosphorylation can be a final step in the phase modulation of rhythms during cell-cell synchronisation.
   The intercellular medium plays an Important role in self-synchronisation of ultradian rhythms between individual cells. Low cooperative activity of hepatocytes of old rats resulted from altered composition of the intercellular medium rather than direct effects of animal and cellular ageing. Similarly. in the whole body, changes in levels of gangliosides and catecholamines in the blood serum, a natural intercellular medium, can be critical events in age-dependent changes of the scrum and accordingly cell-cell synchronisation. Hepatocytes of old rats exhibit some of the properties of young cells following an increase in blood serum ganglioside level, as well as, In in vitro conditions, after the addition of gangliosides to the culture medium.
   Together with data on ultradian Functional and metabolic rhythms, all the material reviewed here allows us to propose a mechanism of direct cell-cell cooperation via the medium in which the cells exist.. that supplements the nervous and hormonal central regulation of organ functions. Ultradian Intracellular rhythms may thus provide a finer framework within which the Integrated dynamics of respiration, heart rate, brain activity, and ex,en behavioural patterns, are brought to an optimal functional pattern. Innate and direct cell-cell cooperation may have been employed as a means of intercellular regulation during the course of metazoan evolution, that preceeded nervous regulation and is presently retained in mammals.

AB  - The quality of parenting is a complex and multiply determined construct that is strongly influenced by the larger ecological context in which it evolves. A substantial body of literature has documented associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and parenting but has been limited in its consideration of factors that may explain or moderate the nature of this relation. The socioeconomic conditions within which a family lives may powerfully influence parenting through its effects on parental mental health and via differential access to resources. Parents' childrearing knowledge and cultural values may also vary along a socioeconomic gradient, with downstream effects on parenting. Further, both socioeconomic factors and parenting can independently shape children's health and development. A more comprehensive understanding of linkages between SES and parenting may inform preventive intervention efforts to support families from disadvantaged environments.

Here we synthesize findings from human and animal studies focusing on sensitive periods and their regional and circuit specificity and highlight the challenge and power of such cross-species approaches in informing the 'next steps' to optimize cognitive and emotional health in developing children. We propose designs for neurodevelopmental optimization research programs utilizing randomized enhancement trials in early childhood to inform public health strategies on prevention and early intervention.

Within the present globalized context, ambivalent public perceptions of refugees are shattering the protective nature of the post migratory environment in refugee receiving countries. This raises new challenges for refugees' mental health and calls for systemic responses to address both pre-migratory trauma and losses and post migratory adversities. Recent evidence on the effectiveness of mental health treatment for refugees confirms the utility of trauma-focused psychotherapy and the limits of psychopharmacology for stress related disorders in this group. Training of mental health professionals may improve the quality of care for refugees by deconstructing prevalent prejudices about them and promoting empathic understanding. Mental health professionals may also advocate by providing information about social determinants refugee mental health to policy makers and promoting psychosocial interventions and protective social policies.

Depression can often lead to behaviors and thoughts related to suicide and aggression, which have a social and economic burden to the United Kingdom. One construct that has been theorized as having an association with these behaviors is alexithymia. People with alexithymia have difficulties identifying and describing their emotional experiences. To date, there is no consensus on types or causes of alexithymia. Whilst the literature evidences a strong relationship between alexithymia and suicidality and aggression, little is known about the nature of this relationship. The present article will attempt to describe the extant literature on this relationship, drawing out some of the contentions and unanswered questions.

AB  - The olfactory system-and odor perception by extension-is susceptible to state-dependent influences. This review delves into human behavioral research in this area, and also touches on mechanistic evidence and examples from animal work. The review summarizes studies on the impact of satiety state on olfaction, highlighting the robust effects of food intake on the perceived pleasantness of food odors and olfactory decision-making. The impacts of other behavioral states on olfaction are also discussed. While research in this area is more limited, preliminary evidence suggests that odor perception is altered by circadian state, sleep deprivation, and mood. The flexibility in olfactory function described here can be considered adaptive, as it serves to direct behavior toward stimuli with high state-dependent value.

AB  - The global climate crisis can be perceived as a threat to existential human needs like control, certainty, and personal existence. These threat appraisals elicit an affective state of individual anxiety - one of the strongest motivators of individual pro-environmental behavior and collective policies and activism. Direct action against a threat is associated with other affective approach-motivated states that help to overcome anxiety: Recent findings show collective emotions of anger, guilt, and 'being moved' increase collective engagement but also show a positive relationship between positive activation and individual behavior. Climate threat furthermore promotes palliative responses, such as ingroup defense, identification with nature, or salient common humanity. Here, collective responses seem to reduce anxiety, and when combined with proenvironmental norms, even promote pro-environmental action.

AB  - People often have trouble performing 2 relatively simple tasks concurrently. The causes of this interference and its implications for the nature of attentional limitations have been controversial for 40 years, but recent experimental findings are beginning to provide some answers. Studies of the psychological refractory period effect indicate a stubborn bottleneck encompassing the process of choosing actions and probably memory retrieval generally, together with certain other cognitive operations. Other limitations associated with task preparation, sensory-perceptual processes, and timing can generate additional and distinct forms of interference. These conclusions challenge widely accepted ideas about attentional resources and probe reaction time methodologies. They also suggest new ways of thinking about continuous dual-task performance, effects of extraneous stimulation (e.g., stop signals), and automaticity. Implications for higher mental processes are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Although cognitive behavior therapy is a widely accepted treatment for depression, the problematic nature of efficacy studies is insufficiently recognized.
   Method: The authors reviewed original studies and quantitative analyses on the use of cognitive behavior therapy for depression.
   Results: The authors suggested that claims for cognitive behavior therapy's efficacy on depression have been overstated, questioned whether its efficacy fits within its theoretical underpinning, and argued against viewing cognitive behavior therapy as a universal rather than a targeted strategy.
   Conclusions: Although cognitive behavior therapy may act more by its nonspecific therapeutic ingredients, the authors argued that by testing cognitive behavior therapy's efficacy in heterogeneous study groups, rather than in specific subgroups, failure to differentiate it from control therapies may have been ensured.

AB  - This article reviews the international research literature on the relationship of urbanization, mental health, and social deviancy. Attention is called to the multidisciplinary and multisectoral nature of the topic, and to its associated definitional, conceptual, and methodological issues and challenges. Selected research literature on rural-urban differences in mental health and social deviancy is reviewed. There is little consensus on the causal relationship between urbanization, mental health, and social deviancy, although numerous environmental and social pathogenic processes have been posited and investigated. Data indicate rural and urban milieus can have both pernicious and salutary consequences and that more research is needed to specify critical etiological factors and their relationship to subpopulation characteristics. Suggestions for improving future research efforts are offered, including the use of more complex theoretical models, measurement indices, and data analysis procedures.

AB  - Neuroticism is a dimension of personality that captures trait individual differences in the tendency to experience negative thoughts and feelings. Established theories explain neuroticism in terms of threat sensitivity, but have limited heuristic value since they cannot account for features of neuroticism that are unrelated to threat, such as creativity and negative psychological states experienced in benign, threat-free environments. We address this issue by proposing that neuroticism stems from trait individual differences in activity in brain circuits that govern the nature of self-generated thought (SGT). We argue our theory explains not only the association of neuroticism with threat sensitivity but also the prominence within the neurotic mind of representations of information that are unrelated to the way the world is right now, such as creativity and nonsituational 'angst'.

AB  - Recent theoretical discussions of optimism as an inherent aspect of human nature converge with empirical investigations of optimism as ill individual difference to show that optimism call be a highly beneficial psychological characteristic linked to good mood, perseverance, achievement, and physical health. Questions remain about optimism as a research topic and more generally as a societal value. Is the meaning of optimism richer than its current conceptualization ill cognitive terms? Are optimism and pessimism mutually exclusive? What is the relationship between optimism and reality and what are the costs of optimistic beliefs that prove to be wrong? How can optimism be cultivated? How does optimism? play itself out across different cultures? Optimism promises to be one of the im- portant topics of interest to positive social science, as long as it is approached in an even-handed way.

AB  - A major programme of dam building is underway in many of the world's tropical countries. This raises the question of whether existing research is sufficient to fully understand the impacts of dams on tropical river systems. This paper provides a systematic review of what is known about the impacts of dams on river flows, sediment dynamics and geomorphic processes in tropical rivers. The review was conducted using the SCOPUS (R) and Web of Science (R) databases, with papers analysed to look for temporal and geographic patterns in published work, assess the approaches used to help understand dam impacts, and assess the nature and magnitude of impacts on the flow regimes and geomorphology ('hydromorphology') of tropical rivers. As part of the review, a meta-analysis was used to compare key impacts across different climate regions. Although research on tropical rivers remains scarce, existing work is sufficient to allow us to draw some very broad, general conclusions about the nature of hydromorphic change: tropical dams have resulted in reductions in flow variability, lower flood peaks, reductions in sediment supply and loads, and complex geomorphic adjustments that include both channel incision and aggradation at different times and downstream distances. At this general level, impacts are consistent with those observed in other climate regions. However, studies are too few and variable in their focus to determine whether some of the more specific aspects of change observed in tropical rivers (e.g. time to reach a new, adjusted state, and downstream recovery distance) differ consistently from those in other regions. The review helps stress the need for research that incorporates before-after comparisons of flow and geomorphic conditions, and for the wider application of tools available now for assessing hydromorphic change. Very few studies have considered hydromorphic processes when designing flow operational policies for tropical dams. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Humans build hierarchical relations, in which they coordinate according to rankings. Rankings need to be mentally represented in order to be communicated and constituted. These mental representations are grounded: They depend on the body and its interactions with the physical and social environment. The review reports evidence from four fields on the nature of this grounding. Work on nonverbal behavior shows that rank is inferred from various magnitudes related to bodily size and strength. Conversely, rank is envisioned using the same magnitudes. Schematized versions of these and other magnitude and dimensional cues influence cognition about ranks. Finally, cognition about ranks shows characteristics of magnitude. These lines of work converge in the conclusion that humans have developed a general representation of rank as a magnitude grounded in bodily size and strength.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder that is manifested in the form of both motor and non-motor symptoms such as resting tremor, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, depression, and cognitive impairment. PD is progressive in nature, ultimately leading to debilitating disruption of activities of daily living. Recently, a myriad of research has been focused on non-pharmacological interventions to alleviate the motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease. However, while there is a growing body of evidence supporting exercise as a viable therapy option for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, there is a lack of literature enumerating a specific exercise sequence for patients with PD. In this literature review, we analyze the success of specific modalities of exercise in order to suggest an optimal exercise regimen for Parkinson's disease patients.

AB  - Sexual function of women can be affected by many factors resulting in female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Sexual dysfunction is a common problem among women of all ages and has negative effects not only on their quality of lives but also on the sexual function and quality of life of their partners. It can also affect mental health of the entire family and society. Regarding the multidimensional nature of female sexual dysfunction and considering its consequences, this condition needs to be recognised in its early stages in order to prevent future consequences and impacts. This article discusses biopsychosocial aspect of female sexual function, classifications and risk factors of female sexual dysfunction and investigates current approaches to identify and treat this problem.

AB  - TOBACCO smoking is the most important preventable cause of death and disease. Despite an increased awareness of the addictive nature of smoking and availability of effective treatments, smoking continues to be widespread among individuals with psychiatric disorders. Moreover, mental health professionals remain reluctant to address smoking among their patients for a variety of reasons. Recent research has provided a wealth of data that have shaped the concept of tobacco smoking as a chronic addictive disorder and also demonstrated the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions. This paper reviews the important factors that contribute to smoking and the various pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for smoking cessation from a biopsychosocial perspective. It also makes recommendations for the rational use of these interventions to treat nicotine dependence in individuals with psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Defense mechanisms and coping strategies are discussed as two different types of adaptational processes. They may be clearly differentiated on the basis of the psychological processes involved, but not on the basis of their relation to outcome measures. Criteria that critically differentiate between defense and coping processes include the conscious/unconscious status and the intentional/nonintentional nature of the processes. Criteria based on the dispositional or situational status of the process, and on the conceptualization of the processes as hierarchical, are found to be more a matter of emphasis than of critical difference. A criterion that attempts to differentiate between defense and coping processes on the basis of their relation to psychological or physical health is found to be without support once the bias in self-report outcome measures is recognized.

AB  - Music, as language, is a universal human trait. Throughout human history and across all cultures, people have produced and enjoyed music. Despite its ubiquity, the musical capacity is rarely studied as a biological function. Music is typically viewed as a cultural invention. In this paper, the evidence bearing on the biological perspective of the musical capacity is reviewed. Related issues, such as domain-specificity, innateness, and brain localization, are addressed in an attempt to offer a unified conceptual basis for the study of music processing. This scheme should facilitate the study of the biological foundations of music by bringing together the fields of genetics, developmental and comparative research, neurosciences, and musicology.

AB  - Background: Increasing physical activity in older adults remains a key public health priority in countries with a high burden of non-communicable disease, yet current interventions have failed to substantially increase population uptake with UK data suggesting that only half of 65-74year olds report meeting recommended levels. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic and inductive qualitative synthesis of the large body of qualitative research describing what influences physical activity at this age, and older adults' experiences of physical activity.
   Methods: A qualitative meta-ethnography was chosen as the study design as this inductive approach can provide novel insights and generate new theory about physical activity and ageing. Papers were identified by searching electronic databases and key citations. Peer-reviewed primary qualitative studies and systematic reviews were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: community-dwelling participants aged 60years or older or in the retirement transition period; reporting on leisure-time physical activity; utilising a rigorous qualitative methodology. A line of argument approach was employed to generate a theory about how older adults think and feel about physical activity.
   Results: Thirty-nine papers met the inclusion criteria and were synthesised. The emergent theory suggested transition to older age can challenge people's sense of self and their role in life. Physical activity can help in regaining feelings of purpose, of being needed in collective group activity, and by creating habitual routine and structure to the day. In overcoming real and perceived barriers, and by taking up or sustaining physical activities, older adults can further build self-esteem all of which contributes to a fulfilling older age.
   Conclusion: Current failures to increase population levels of physical activity in older adults may be explained by an approach overly focused on the health benefits of activity. Insights from this study suggest we need to reframe our approach to consider the wider set of goals and aspirations which are of greater personal importance to older adults, and future interventions should focus on how physical activity can contribute to life satisfaction, sense of purpose, and sense of role fulfilment in older age.

AB  - Purpose. The impact of individual perceptions on health is well-established. However, no valid ann reliable measure of individual wellness perceptions exists. Therefore, the purpose was to introduce a measure called the Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS).
   Design. Convenience sampling facilitated recruitment of a sample large enough to perform factor analysis with adequate power (.85). The appropriateness of factor analysis is supported by Bartlett's test (chi(2) = 7110, p less than or equal to .01) and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (.91).
   Setting. The sample (n = 558) was composed of 3M Inc. employees from multiple sites in Austin, Texas (n = 393); employees from MuRata Electronics, Inc., College Station, Pennsylvania (n = 53); and students enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin (n = 112).
   Subjects. Racial, gender, and age distribution was, respectively, 6.3% African-American (n = 35), 8.2% Asian (n = 46), 73.3% Caucasian (n = 409), 9.5% Hispanic (n = 53), and 2.7% other (n = 15); 47.8% male (n = 267), and 52.2% female (n = 291); and 36.8 years.
   Measures. Measures included the Perceived Wellness Survey, and two additional versions of the Perceived Wellness Survey designed to measure both discriminant and face validity. Perceived Wellness Survey subscales include physical, spiritual, intellectual, psychological, social, and emotional dimensions.
   Results. All subscales were correlated (p less than or equal to .05) with the Perceived Wellness Survey composite and with each other. Evidence of internal consistency (alpha = .88 to .93), and discriminant, face, and factorial validity was provided. Finally, the Perceived Wellness Survey appears to be a unidimensional scale.
   Conclusion. The unidimensional nature of the Perceived Wellness Survey suggests that perceptions of wellness in various dimensions are intertwined by their affective nature. The Perceived Wellness Survey appears to be reasonably valid and reliable; however, further research is needed.

AB  - A systematic review was conducted, following PRISMA guidelines, to examine the application of finite mixture models (FMMs) in the study of neighbourhoods and health. Two reviewers screened 814-studies identified through database searches and citation tracking. Data were extracted from 19-studies that met the inclusion criteria, and a risk of bias analysis undertaken. Data were synthesised narratively, with a focus on methodological issues idiosyncratic to FMMs. Motivated by a desire to account for neighbourhood heterogeneity, studies sought to identify meaningful neighbourhood-level typologies that explained the distributional nature of health outcomes. Neighbourhood-centred applications of FMMs were promising but there remains scope for advancement. Research-based recommendations are outlined to strengthen prospective neighbourhood-centred studies applying FMMs.

AB  - Psychological or psychiatric disturbances occur in association with therapeutic abortions but they seem to be marked, severe, or persistent in only a minority (approximately 10%) of women. These consist mostly of caseness depression and anxiety. Psychoses are very uncommon, being reported in only 0.003% of cases - most of whom have a history of previous psychiatric illness. Certain groups are especially at risk from adverse psychological sequelae; these include those with a past psychiatric history, younger women, those with poor social support, the multiparous, and those belonging to sociocultural groups antagonistic to abortion. This is not to overlook the fact that, adopting a crisis-resolution framework, subsequent termination of an unwanted pregnancy is itself 'therapeutic'. A better understanding of the nature of the risk factors would enable clinicians to identify vulnerable women for whom some form of psychological intervention might be beneficial.

We first briefly describe the evolution of the borderline construct in psychoanalysis and psychiatry. Then we provide clinically and empirically informed model of domains of personality function and dysfunction that provides a roadmap for thinking about personality pathology from a developmental psychopathology standpoint and examine the nature and phenomenology of BPD in terms of these domains of functioning. Next, we describe prominent dynamic theories of etiology of BPD, and examine these in relation to the available research. Finally, we describe psychodynamic conceptions of treatment and the way BPD phenomena manifest in treatment, followed again by consideration of relevant research, particularly on transference-countertransference constellations empirically identified in the treatment of patients with BPD.

AB  - Background Marginalised groups ('populations outside of mainstream society') experience severe health inequities, as well as increased risk of experiencing patient safety incidents. To date however no review exists to identify, map and analyse the literature in this area in order to understand 1) which marginalised groups have been studied in terms of patient safety research, 2) what the particular patient safety issues are for such groups and 3) what contributes to or is associated with these safety issues arising. Methods Scoping review. Systematic searches were performed across six electronic databases in September 2019. The time frame for searches of the respective databases was from the year 2000 until present day. Results The searches yielded 3346 articles, and 67 articles were included. Patient safety issues were identified for fourteen different marginalised patient groups across all studies, with 69% (n = 46) of the studies focused on four patient groups: ethnic minority groups, frail elderly populations, care home residents and low socio-economic status. Twelve separate patient safety issues were classified. Just over half of the studies focused on three issues represented in the patient safety literature, and in order of frequency were: medication safety, adverse outcomes and near misses. In total, 157 individual contributing or associated factors were identified and mapped to one of seven different factor types from the Framework of Contributory Factors Influencing Clinical Practice within the London Protocol. Patient safety issues were mostly multifactorial in origin including patient factors, health provider factors and health care system factors. Conclusions This review highlights that marginalised patient groups are vulnerable to experiencing a variety patient safety issues and points to a number of gaps. The findings indicate the need for further research to understand the intersectional nature of marginalisation and the multi-dimensional nature of patient safety issues, for groups that have been under-researched, including those with mental health problems, communication and cognitive impairments. Such understanding provides a basis for working collaboratively to co-design training, services and/or interventions designed to remove or at the very least minimise these increased risks.

AB  - The dual nature of touch has long been understood. The sense of touch seems to carry information at the same time about the external object touching our skin, and also about our body itself. However, how these two interact has remained obscure. We present an analytic model of how tactile information interacts with mental body representations in the brain. Four such interactions are described: the link between the body surface and the maps in primary somatosensory cortex, the contribution of somatosensory cortical information to mental body representations, the feedback pathway from such higher representations back to primary tactile processing in somatosensory cortex, and the modulation of tactile object perception by mental body representations.

AB  - Background The Department of Health defines needs as "the ability to benefit from healthcare interventions". Outcome measurement is an integral component of needs assessment because it underpins 'ability to benefit'.
   Aims To propose a framework for addressing the measurement of outcome in relation to mentally disordered offenders (MDOs).
   Method Based on a literature search, the paper reviews the definition and measurement of outcome in general mental health care and specifically in relation to MDOs. It analyses the problems of conducting outcome research in relation to MDOs.
   Results A framework for outcome measurement in relation to MDOs is presented. Outcome is placed within a broader framework that relates to service evaluation.
   Conclusions Current measurement of outcome in relation to MDOs is inadequate. A comprehensive framework that acknowledges the multi-dimensional nature of outcome is essential. Researchers must be able to justify the dimensions they prioritise.

AB  - Increasingly, national governments across the globe are prioritizing investments in neuroscience. Currently, seven active or in-development national-level brain research initiatives exist, spanning four continents. Engaging with the underlying values and ethical concerns that drive brain research across cultural and continental divides is critical to future research. Culture influences what kinds of science are supported and where science can be conducted through ethical frameworks and evaluations of risk. Neuroscientists and philosophers alike have found themselves together encountering perennial questions; these questions are engaged by the field of neuroethics, related to the nature of understanding the self and identity, the existence and meaning of free will, defining the role of reason in human behavior, and more. With this Perspective article, we aim to prioritize and advance to the foreground a list of neuroethics questions for neuroscientists operating in the context of these international brain initiatives.

AB  - The purpose of this article is a theoretical one, namely to make the case for a critical-reflectivist approach to the study of regionalism in Africa and beyond. We argue that contemporary changes in the global political economy require political economists to reconsider how we study regional processes and actors. The article provides insights into the sociology of the field of study by recounting its evolution, reviewing key debates and tracing the dominance of rationalist theories on regional integration and regionalism. Subsequently, the article questions the ontological premises of state-centrism and market logics in conventional regional theorization that does not take account of the complexities and multidimensionality of regions and regional processes. Traditional approaches to regionalism fail to do justice to regional manifestations and the repercussions of Africa's changing transnational relations as well as to crucial dynamics within regional civil societies. In this respect, the analytical value of both Robert W. Cox's World Order Approach (WOA) and the New Regionalism(s) Approach (NRA) for challenging the theoretical hegemony in the field of study is elaborated on. The theoretical framework proposed in this article points to neglected dimensions of regionalization and stresses both structural factors as well as the myriad of regional actors and their respective regional strategies as drivers of the changing nature of developing regionalisms in Africa. The authors' claim that regionalism is everything but a 'states only' domain is substantiated by the proposed conceptualization of regional civil society, a persistent analytical 'blind spot' in the study of regionalism. Drawing eclectically on the WOA and the NRA, the article provides a theoretical 'entry-point' for the analytical incorporation of regional civil societies into the political economy of African regionalisms. The article concludes by arguing that analytical and theoretical sensitivity to potentially transformative societal actors and processes at the regional level becomes increasingly relevant in the context of shared experiences of neoliberal globalization/regionalization as well as of Africa's new 'partnerships' with emerging powers.

AB  - Marine biodiversity worldwide is under increasing threat, primarily as a result of over-harvesting, pollution and climate change. Chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) have a perceived higher intrinsic risk of extinction compared to other fish. Direct fishing mortality has driven many declines, even though some smaller fisheries persist without associated declines. Mixed-species fisheries are of particular concern, as is illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The lack of specific management and reporting mechanisms for the latter means that many chondrichthyans might already be susceptible to extinction from stochastic processes entirely unrelated to fishing pressure itself. Chondrichthyans might also suffer relatively more than other marine taxa from the effects of fishing and habitat loss and degradation given coastal habitat use for specific life stages. The effects of invasive species and pollution are as yet too poorly understood to predict their long-term role in affecting chondrichthyan population sizes. The spatial distribution of threatened chondrichthyan species under World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List criteria are clustered mainly in (1) south-eastern South America; (2) western Europe and the Mediterranean; (3) western Africa; (4) South China Sea and Southeast Asia and (5) south-eastern Australia. To determine which ecological and life history traits predispose chondrichthyans to being IUCN Red-Listed, and to examine the role of particular human activities in exacerbating threat risk, we correlated extant marine species' Red List categorisation with available ecological (habitat type, temperature preference), life history (body length, range size) and human-relationship (whether commercially or game-fished, considered dangerous to humans) variables. Threat risk correlations were constructed using generalised linear mixed-effect models to account for phylogenetic relatedness. We also contrasted results for chondrichthyans to marine teleosts to test explicitly whether the former group is intrinsically more susceptible to extinction than fishes in general. Around 52% of chondrichthyans have been Red-Listed compared to only 8% of all marine teleosts; however, listed teleosts were in general placed more frequently into the higher-risk categories relative to chondrichthyans. IUCN threat risk in both taxa was positively correlated with body size and negatively correlated albeit weakly, with geographic range size. Even after accounting for the positive influence of size, Red-Listed teleosts were still more likely than chondrichthyans to be classified as threatened. We suggest that while sharks might not have necessarily experienced the same magnitude of deterministic decline as Red-Listed teleosts, their larger size and lower fecundity (not included in the analysis) predispose chondrichthyans to a higher risk of extinction overall. Removal of these large predators can elicit trophic cascades and destabilise the relative abundance of smaller species. Predator depletions can lead to permanent shifts in marine communities and alternate equilibrium states. Climate change might influence the phenology and physiology of some species, with the most probable response being changes in the timing of migrations and shifts in distribution. The synergistic effects among harvesting, habitat changes and climate-induced forcings are greatest for coastal chondrichthyans with specific habitat requirements and these are currently the most likely candidates for extinction.
   Management of shark populations must take into acount the rate at which drivers of decline affect specific species. Only through the detailed collection of data describing demographic rates, habitat affinities, trophic linkages and geographic ranges, and how environmental stressors modify these, can extinction risk be more precisely estimated and reduced. The estimation of minimum viable population sizes, below which rapid extinction is more likely due to stochastic processes, is an important component of this endeavour and should accompany many of the current approaches used in shark management worldwide.

AB  - Objective: Negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, and depression, have emerged as potentially important risk factors for coronary heart disease. The purpose of this article is to consider the nature and function of emotions, to review epidemiological evidence for an association between the three negative emotions and coronary heart disease (CHD), to discuss briefly the mechanisms by which emotions may be linked to CHD, and to consider this evidence in light of theoretical insights provided by mainstream psychological research on emotions. Methods: We collected articles published between 1980 and 1998 on the relationship between each negative emotion and CHD. We also collected review articles or chapters published during the same time period that considered mechanisms by which emotions may increase CHD risk. We used a qualitative approach to review the published literature. Results: Evidence that anxiety is involved in the onset of CHD is strongest, whereas evidence for an association between anger and CHD is limited but suggestive. Although depression has consistently been linked to mortality following a myocardial infarction, evidence for its role in the onset of coronary disease is quite mixed. Numerous unresolved issues leave our current understanding of the emotion-health relationship incomplete. Psychological theories of emotion are considered to help address gaps in our knowledge. Conclusion: Growing evidence indicates that negative emotions may influence the development of CHD. The focused and specific consideration of negative emotions and their possible role in the etiology of CHD gives insight into current knowledge and suggests important directions for future research.

AB  - COVID-19 has significantly affected the work environment of nurses. In the face of the challenges posed by stressors in clinical practice, some nurses adapt and prove to be resilient. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the nature of care itself and the new ways of working are potentially very stressful. We aim to analyze the resilience of care nurses to the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a systematic review of nurse caregiver resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Our search was conducted in the WOS, Medline/PubMed, Cochrane, BVS/LILACS, and Cuiden databases. The inclusion criteria were: studies published in Spanish or English; carried out from March 2020 to May 2021 on nurses caring for patients with COVID-19; and investigating the factors influencing the psychological impact, resilience, strategies to develop it, and interventions to promote it during this pandemic and others, such as SARS, MERS, or ebola. The quality of the studies and the risk of bias were evaluated following ICROMS, STROBE and AMSTAR-2 criteria. Twenty-two studies were selected. Most of the studies highlighted the presence of stressors in nurses, emphasizing those of the environment, which converged in dysfunctional responses that hurt their resilience. The most persuasive factors were social and organizational support. Coping strategies developed by nurses and especially interventions by organizations were detected as instruments to foster resilience, but have not been well researched. Resilience has a key moderating role in mitigating the psychological impact of nurses in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background Child anxiety sensitivity (AS) is measured almost exclusively using the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI). Yet, in the context of significant discrepancies regarding the CASI factors and how they are scored and reported, it remains unclear whether the CASI reliably and validly assesses the purported multifactorial AS construct. Objective This paper will: (1) provide a comprehensive summary of previous CASI factor analyses by which these factor structures were identified, (2) evaluate evidence regarding the multifactorial nature of AS in youth, and (3) discuss potential directions for continued research in this area. Method In a PsycInfo search, peer-reviewed studies published between 1991 and 2018 were identified for inclusion if they examined the factor structure of the CASI or reported data on the CASI subscales as administered to child participants. Results Findings from the 50 studies reviewed suggested that (1) the 18-item CASI does not consistently yield internally reliable assessments of specific AS facets, (2) significant discrepancies exist regarding the CASI subscales identified, the items comprising these scales, and their predictive validity in terms of anxiety, and (3) alternatives to assess the multifactorial construct of AS in youth do exist, but they have not been systematically examined in the literature. Conclusions Directions for future study include further examining expanded scales for AS in youth, continued study of shorter scales assessing more consistently reliable AS content, and evaluating the utility of an expanded response scale for the CASI.

AB  - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is associated with the administration of antipsychotic agents and other drugs such as L-dopa, antidepressants, and antihistaminic agents. Unexpected changes in mental status. new-onset catatonia, episodic tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, dysarthria, dysphagia, diaphoresis, sialorrhea, incontinence, low-grade temperature elevations, and rigidity should arouse suspicion. Several lines of evidence provide support for the involvement of dopamine. Most of the drugs implicated in NMS are D-2 dopamine receptor antagonists. Central noradrenergic activity is also possibly related to the disorder, as sympathetic hyperactivity is associated with the active phase of NMS. Currently, the definitive role of GABA deficiency in NMS is yet to be established. Differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, lethal catatonia, lithium toxicity, serotonin syndrome, and heat stroke. A high degree of suspicion and the discontinuation of antipsychotic agents even if the diagnosis is not established are essential for the safety of the patient. Treatment of NMS should be individualized and be based empirically on the character, duration, and severity of the clinical signs and symptoms noted. The initial step in the treatment of NMS is the removal of the offending agent. Full-blown NMS is a serious condition and requires immediate supportive, nutritive, and electrolyte therapies. The administration of drugs that can improve NMS, such as IV dantrolene and/ or oral bromocriptine, may also be taken into consideration, based oil the severity and nature of the NMS.

   Understanding patient experiences of detention under mental health legislation is crucial to efforts to reform policy and practice.
   Aims
   To synthesise qualitative evidence on patients' experiences of assessment and detention under mental health legislation.
   Method
   Five bibliographic databases were searched, supplemented by reference list screening and citation tracking. Studies were included if they reported on patient experiences of assessment or detention under mental health legislation; reported on patients aged 18 years or older; collected data using qualitative methods; and were reported in peer-reviewed journals. Findings were analysed and synthesised using thematic synthesis.
   Results
   The review included 56 papers. Themes were generally consistent across studies and related to information and involvement in care, the environment and relationships with staff, as well as the impact of detention on feelings of self-worth and emotional state. The emotional impact of detention and views of its appropriateness varied, but a frequent theme was fear and distress during detention, including in relation to the use of force and restraint. Where staff were perceived as striving to form caring and collaborative relationships with patients despite the coercive nature of treatment, and when clear information was delivered, the negative impact of involuntary care seemed to be reduced.
   Conclusions
   Findings suggest that involuntary in-patient care is often frightening and distressing, but certain factors were identified that can help reduce negative experiences. Coproduction models may be fruitful in developing new ways of working on in-patient wards that provide more voice to patients and staff, and physical and social environments that are more conducive to recovery.

AB  - Purpose - Telephone crisis services are increasingly subject to a requirement to "prove their worth" as a suicide prevention strategy. The purpose of this paper is to: first, provide a detailed overview of the evidence on the impact of telephone crisis services on suicidal users; second, determine the limitations of the outcome measures used in this evidence; and third, suggest directions for future research.
   Design/methodology/approach - MEDLINE via Pubmed (from 1966), PsycINFO APA (from 1967) and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses (all to 4 June 2015) were searched. Papers were systematically extracted by title then abstract according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Findings - In total, 18 articles met inclusion criteria representing a range of outcome measures: changes during calls, reutilization of service, compliance with advice, caller satisfaction and counsellor satisfaction. The majority of studies showed beneficial impact on an immediate and intermediate degree of suicidal urgency, depressive mental states as well as positive feedback from users and counsellors.
   Research limitations/implications - A major limitation pertains to differences in the use of the term "suicidal". Other limitations include the lack of long-term follow-up and of controlled research designs. Future research should include a focus on long-term follow-up designs, involving strict data protection. Furthermore, more qualitative research is needed in order to capture the essential nature of the intervention.
   Originality/value - This paper attempts to broaden the study and the concept of "effectiveness" as hitherto used in the literature about telephone crisis services and offers suggestions for future research.

AB  - Background and aims Violence against pregnant women is a significant public health problem, resulting in disability and various physical and mental health disorders. This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the prevalence of physical, verbal, sexual, psychological, emotional, economic, and other types of violence among pregnant women in Iran. Methods Bibliographic databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus, and also Iranian databases including Scientific Information Database (SID), Magiran, and Civilica were searched from 2002 to September 16, 2020. Following a random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated the pooled prevalence of exposure to different types of violence among Iranian pregnant women. Overall, 61 articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed in this systematic review. Results The prevalence of physical violence was 19.0% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 14.0, 24.0), verbal violence was 42.0% (95% CI: 24.0, 61.0), sexual violence was 26.0% (95% CI: 20.0, 32.0), psychological violence was 37.0% (95% CI: 28.0, 46.0), emotional violence was 51.0% (95% CI: 40.0, 62.0), economic 39.0% (95% CI: 19.0, 60.0), and the prevalence of other types of violence was 54.0% (95% CI: 46.0, 62.0). Conclusions This study revealed that Iranian pregnant women are often exposed to different types of violence. Therefore, screening for violence in this vulnerable group seems necessary due to the sensitive nature of pregnancy and its importance in maternal left-to-right markhealth. This alarming rate of violence calls for adopting upstream policies and interventions to reduce violent practices against pregnant women in Iran.

AB  - The mind is embodied; thoughts and feelings interact with states of physiological arousal and physical integrity of the body. In this context, there is mounting evidence for an association between psychiatric presentations and the expression variant connective tissue, commonly recognised as joint hypermobility. Joint hypermobility is common, frequently under-recognised, significantly impacts quality of life, and can exist in isolation or as the hallmark of hypermobility spectrum disorders (encompassing joint hypermobility syndrome and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). In this narrative review, we appraise the current evidence linking psychiatric disorders across the lifespan, beginning with the relatively well-established connection with anxiety, to hypermobility. We next consider emerging associations with affective illnesses, eating disorders, alongside less well researched links with personality disorders, substance misuse and psychosis. We then review related findings relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and stress-sensitive medical conditions. With growing understanding of mind-body interactions, we discuss potential aetiopathogenetic contributions of dysautonomia, aberrant interoceptive processing, immune dysregulation and proprioceptive impairments in the context of psychosocial stressors and genetic predisposition. We examine clinical implications of these evolving findings, calling for increased awareness amongst healthcare professionals of the transdiagnostic nature of hypermobility and related disorders. A role for early screening and detection of hypermobility in those presenting with mental health and somatic symptoms is further highlighted, with a view to facilitate preventative approaches alongside longer-term holistic management strategies. Finally, suggestions are offered for directions of future scientific exploration which may be key to further delineating fundamental mind-body-brain interactions.</p>

AB  - Objective: Multimorbidity refers to the individual has two or more medical conditions, which include physical multimorbidity (two or more physical conditions), mental multimorbidity (two or more mental conditions) and physical and mental multimorbidity (one or more mental and one or more physical conditions). This study is to assess the relationship between multimorbidity and suicidal ideation (SI) by conducting a meta-analysis.
   Methods: Through using subject word and random word, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and PubMed were searched for related records up to March 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality were used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were performed. The publication bias was evaluated by the funnel plots, Begg's test and Egger's test.
   Results: A total of 19 studies were included for analysis. The pooled odd ratio (OR) for the association between multimorbidity and SI was 2.90 (95%CI 2.29-3.67, P < .001). Subgroup analysis based on nature of study, category of multimorbidity, country, whether adjusted the covariates, and quality ratings was performed. The result of sensitivity analysis indicated that no individual studies had a substantial impact on the pooled OR. There was no publication bias in the studies.
   Conclusions: Multimorbidity is one important factor in increased risk of SI. It is critical to assessing SI among patients with multimorbidity in primary care and specialty medical practices, particularly among physical and mental multimorbidity patients who may have higher risk of SI.

AB  - In healthy adults, autobiographical memories (AMs) evoked by music appear to have unique cognitive characteristics that set them apart from AMs evoked by other cues. If this is the case, we might expect music cues to alleviate AM deficits in clinical disorders. This systematic review examines music-evoked autobiographical memories (MEAMs) in clinical populations, focusing on cognitive characteristics, and whether MEAMs differ from AMs evoked by other stimuli. We identified 15 studies featuring participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant - Frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), acquired brain damage, and depression. We found that music evokes AMs in these disorders, and that familiar music was more likely to evoke AMs. Compared with healthy controls, AD participants had a relative advantage for MEAMs over picture-evoked AMs. People with damage to the medial prefrontal cortex showed preserved access to MEAMs in terms of frequency, but a relative disadvantage regarding the episodic richness for MEAMs, but not for memories cued by pictures, compared to controls. Participants with bv-FTD had fewer AMs evoked after both music and pictures than healthy controls. Across conditions, MEAMs were generally specific and retrieved fast, suggesting little retrieval effort. MEAMs were also positive, except in depression, where as many negative as positive AMs were produced. These findings suggest several underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms of MEAMs, including anxiety reduction, increased fluency, music-evoked emotions, reminiscence, and involuntary retrieval, and that these might be moderated by musical abilities and memory for music. In conclusion, MEAMs appear to be relatively well preserved, especially in AD. This article is categorized under: Psychology > Memory

AB  - Introduction In the United Kingdom and many other countries, debt accrued during higher education has increased substantially in recent decades. The prevalence of common mental health problems has also increased alongside these changes. However, it is as yet unclear whether there is an association between financial stress and mental health among higher education students. Methods We conducted a rapid review of the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Eligible studies were English-language publications testing the association between any indicator of financial stress and mental health among higher education students in the UK. Papers were located through a systematic search of PsychINFO, PubMed and Embase up to November 2018. Results The search strategy yielded 1272 studies-9 met the inclusion criteria. A further two were identified through hand-searching. The median sample size was 408. Only three of seven studies found an association between higher debt and worse mental health. There was a consistent cross-sectional relationship between worse mental health and both experience of financial difficulties (seven of seven studies) and debt worry/financial concern (four of five studies), though longitudinal evidence was mixed and limited to six studies. Conclusion Among higher education students in the UK, there is little evidence that the amount of debt is associated with mental health. However, more subjective measures of increased financial stress were more consistently associated with worse mental health outcomes. Nevertheless, the identified evidence was judged to be weak; further research is required to examine whether links between financial stress and mental health outcomes are robust and causal in nature.

AB  - Despite significant advances in psychiatric and psychological treatment over the last 30 years, suicide deaths have increased. Unfortunately, neuroscience insights have yielded few translational interventions that specifically target suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In our view, this is attributable to two factors. The first factor is our limited integration of neurocircuitry models with contemporary suicide theory. The second challenge is inherent to the variable nature of suicide risk over time. Few interventional neuroscience studies evaluate how temporal fluctuations in risk affect treatment, despite evidence that temporality is a key component distinguishing suicide phenotypes. To wit, individual variability in risk trajectories may provide different treatment targets to engage as a patient moves between suicidal ideation and attempt. Here, we first review contemporary ideation-to-action theories of suicide from a neurobiological perspective, focusing on valence and executive function circuits and the key role of state-induced (e.g., within stressful contexts) functional modulation on longitudinal risk trajectories. We then describe neural correlates of suicide reduction following various interventions, ranging from circuit specific (i.e., transcranial magnetic stimulation) to broader pharmacological (i.e., ketamine, lithium) to psychological (i.e., brief cognitive therapy). We then introduce novel strategies for tracking risk in naturalistic settings and real time using ecological momentary interventions. We provide a critical integration of the literature focusing on the intersection between targets and temporality, and we conclude by proposing novel research designs integrating real-time and biologically based interventions to generate novel strategies for future suicide reduction research.

AB  - The relationship between adverse experiences and the emergence of pathology has often focused on characteristics of the stressor or of the individual (stressor appraisals, coping strategies). These features are thought to influence multiple biological processes that favor the development of mental and physical illnesses. Less often has attention focused on the aftermath of traumatic experiences, and the importance of safety and reassurance that is necessary for longer-term well-being. In some cases (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) this may be reflected by a failure of fear extinction, whereas in other instances (e.g., historical trauma), the uncertainty about the future might foster continued anxiety. In essence, the question becomes one of how individuals attain feelings of safety when it is fully understood that the world is not necessarily a safe place, uncertainties abound, and feelings of agency are often illusory. We consider how individuals acquire resilience in the aftermath of traumatic and chronic stressors. In this respect, we review characteristics of stressors that may trigger particular biological and behavioral coping responses, as well as factors that undermine their efficacy. To this end, we explore stressor dynamics and social processes that foster resilience in response to specific traumatic, chronic, and uncontrollable stressor contexts (intimate partner abuse; refugee migration; collective historical trauma). We point to resilience factors that may comprise neurobiological changes, such as those related to various stressor-provoked hormones, neurotrophins, inflammatory immune, microbial, and epigenetic processes. These behavioral and biological stress responses may influence, and be influenced by, feelings of safety that come about through relationships with others, spiritual and place-based connections.

AB  - Lay Abstract The persistent nature of Autism spectrum disorder, the high comorbidity with other disabilities or psychopathologies, and the added intensity of treatments and interventions can take a toll on parents of children with autism. Parents are also faced with higher risks of unemployment, divorce, and poorer mental health than parents of children with other disorders. Such parenting stress can be further exacerbated by cultural and environmental factors such as the more conservative and collectivistic Asian values. This review aimed to find and synthesize all qualitative evidence pertaining to the parenting experiences and needs of Asian primary caregivers of children with autism. The findings provided insight to parents' personal parenting journey; their adaptation and coping strategies, perception of family, community, and social support received; their experiences with healthcare, education, and social services; their future hopes for their children; and the unique parenting experiences of immigrants. Apart from highlighting the different cultural influence of parenting a child with autism in the Asian and Western context, the review has also revealed Asian parental needs for increased availability and accessibility to autism-related information, well-trained healthcare professionals and educators, a more holistic and inclusive education system, a need to further increase the public's awareness of autism, and culturally sensitive services. Therefore, it is necessary for healthcare and education providers to adopt a culturally sensitive approach or develop culturally tailored supportive programs to provide this group of Asian parents with adequate emotional and informational support that increases their parenting self-efficacy and alleviate their parenting stress.

AB  - ObjectiveThis review explores the influence of anxiety and depression on the experience of positive psychotic symptoms, and investigates the possibility of a causal role for anxiety and depression in the emergence and persistence of psychosis.
   MethodA systematic literature search was undertaken, producing a number of papers which comment on the links between anxiety and depression, and the experience of delusions and hallucinations. In addition, evidence which could contribute to our understanding of the causal role of anxiety and depression was highlighted.
   ResultsThe findings show that both anxiety and depression are associated in meaningful ways with the severity of delusions and hallucinations, the distress they elicit and their content. However, the cross-sectional nature of the majority of studies and the focus on certain symptom subtypes tempers the validity of the findings. Data from non-clinical samples, studies which track the longitudinal course of psychosis and those which examine the impact of anxiety and depression on the prognosis for people experiencing psychosis, offer some support for the possibility of an influential role for anxiety and depression.
   ConclusionWe conclude that anxiety and depression are related to psychotic symptom severity, distress and content and are also linked with sub-clinical experiences, symptom development, prognosis and relapse. These links may imply that anxiety and depression could be targets for therapeutic intervention. The article concludes with suggestions for further research, highlighting avenues which may circumvent the limitations of the body of work as it stands.

AB  - The study of emotion is rife with debate over issues as fundamental as how to define emotion, and such disputes are particularly common in the nonhuman animal emotion literature. Here, we seek to address some of these issues, especially in terms of how they relate to animal research. Definitional issues are prevalent; clear definitions are often not given of crucial terms, including emotion,' and even where provided, such terms may be used inconsistently throughout a single paper. Further disagreement over the structure of emotions, and the nature of conscious experiences involved, leads to consistent differences in authors' criteria for emotions. We concur with those who believe that animals experience emotions and believe that animal emotions should be studied in their own right, not only as they compare to those of humans. We also propose several avenues for future research that we believe will further our understanding of animal emotions. First, the use of multiple measurement methods to assess emotional responses is most likely to provide the information necessary to distinguish between various states and opens the field to more research in harder-to-study species, such as marine mammals. Second, researchers should also endeavor to increase the range of emotions studied, particularly positive ones, in order to move toward a more balanced range of studied states. Finally, we believe that several aspects of personality research would prove beneficial to the study of animal emotions, particularly the distinction between trait and state emotion and the use of the rating method.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this article was to review the international scientific research literature about the social and psychological health outcomes associated with participation in team sport and to synthesise the key issues about team sport as a health-promoting activity. Methods: The methodological framework guiding the review process is the integrative research review. A search of 10 key electronic databases was conducted to identify both quantitative and qualitative studies addressing the social and/or psychological health outcomes from participation in a team sport. A total of 6,097 publications were identified and 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. Results: A wide range of different positive social, psychological, and psychosocial health outcomes associated with team sport participation were identified in the studies, with emotional social support, sense of belonging, higher self-esteem, social network, and social interaction being the most frequently reported health benefits. In addition, three key issues influencing the psychological and social health outcomes of team sport participation as a health-promoting activity were identified: (1) team sport versus individual sport, (2) competitive versus non-competitive structure, and (3) commitment and continuation. Conclusions: There is consistent evidence that participation in a team sport is associated with improved social and psychological health independent of the type of team sport, age, somatic, or mental health problems. The findings indicate that team sport could be more efficient in promoting health and ensuring exercise participation and continuation than individual sport. However, when utilising team sports for health purposes, precautions must be taken with regard to their inherent competitive nature.

AB  - A comprehensive review of the design principles and methodological approaches that have been used to make inferences from the research on disasters in children is needed.
   To identify the methodological approaches used to study children's reactions to three recent major disasters-the September 11, 2001, attacks; the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami; and Hurricane Katrina.
   This review was guided by a systematic literature search.
   A total of 165 unduplicated empirical reports were generated by the search and examined for this review. This included 83 references on September 11, 29 on the 2004 Tsunami, and 53 on Hurricane Katrina.
   A diversity of methods has been brought to bear in understanding children's reactions to disasters. While cross-sectional studies predominate, pre-event data for some investigations emerged from archival data and data from studies examining non-disaster topics. The nature and extent of the influence of risk and protective variables beyond disaster exposure are not fully understood due, in part, to limitations in the study designs used in the extant research. Advancing an understanding of the roles of exposure and various individual, family, and social factors depends upon the extent to which measures and assessment techniques are valid and reliable, as well as on data sources and data collection designs. Comprehensive assessments that extend beyond questionnaires and checklists to include interviews and cognitive and biological measures to elucidate the negative and positive effects of disasters on children also may improve the knowledge base.

AB  - The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a key role in the neuroendocrine response to stress and in maintaining physiological homoeostasis. However, stress that is chronic in nature can lead to HPA axis dysfunction and increase the risk for developing affective disorders, particularly if the stress is experienced during vulnerable periods in life. Sex differences in how the HPA axis responds to stress are well established, with females typically displaying heightened responses. The underlying cause of these sex differences is important to understand, as many neuropsychiatric disorders disproportionately affect females. Much research has provided evidence for gonadal sex steroids in underpinning sex differences in HPA axis responsivity; however, we suggest that neuroactive metabolites of these steroids also play a key role in the brain in mediating sex differences in HPA axis responses to stress. The relationship between neuroactive steroids and stress is complex. Acute stress rapidly increases neuroactive steroid production, which can in turn modulate activity of the HPA axis. However, under chronic stress conditions, stress can impact the brain's capacity to generate steroids, and this in turn has corollary effects on HPA axis function that may increase the propensity for psychopathology, given both HPA axis dysfunction and deficits in neuroactive steroids are implicated in affective disorders. Hence, here we review the evidence from animal and human studies for sex differences in the interactions between neuroactive steroids and the stress axis at various stages of life, under physiological and pathophysiological stress conditions and consider the implications for health and disease.

AB  - Addiction is a mental illness in which psychiatric conditions imply a prominent burden. Psychopathological symptoms in substance use disorder (SUD) patients are usually viewed as being assignable to the sphere of a personality trait or of comorbidity, leaving doubts about the presence of a specific psychopathology that could only be related to the toxicomanic process. Our research group at the University of Pisa has shed light on the possible definition of a specific psychopathological dimension in SUDs. In heroin use disorder patients, performing an exploratory principal component factor analysis (PCA) on all the 90 items included in the SCL-90 questionnaire led to a five-factor solution. The first factor accounted for a depressive "worthlessness and being trapped" dimension; the second factor picked out a " somatic symptoms" dimension; the third identified a "sensitivity-psychoticism" dimension; the fourth a "panic-anxiety" dimension; and the fifth a " violence-suicide" dimension. These same results were replicated by applying the PCA to another Italian sample of 1,195 heroin addicts entering a Therapeutic Community Treatment. Further analyses confirmed the clusters of symptoms, independently of demographic and clinical characteristics, active heroin use, lifetime psychiatric problems, kind of treatment received, and, especially, other substances used by the patient such as alcohol or cocaine. Moreover, these clusters were able to discriminate patients affected by addiction from those affected by psychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder. Our studies seem to suggest the trait-dependent, rather than the state-dependent, nature of the introduced psychopathology dimensions of SUDs.

AB  - Aloe vera is a perennial, drought-resisting and succulent plant belonging to the Liliaceal family, which historically has been used for a variety of medicinal purposes. Scientific investigations on A. vera have gained more attention the last several decades due to its reputable medicinal properties. After describing Aloe in a botanical point of view, the papers relating with the chemical composition of skin and gel of Aloe, particularly describes the gel of Aloe. The chemical analysis reveals that A. vera contains various carbohydrate polymers, notably glucomannans, along with a range of other organic and inorganic components. The heterogeneous nature of Aloe products may contribute to the diverse biological and therapeutic activities that have been observed including promotion of wound healing, antifungal activity, hypoglycemic or antidiabetic effects, antiinflammatory, anticancer, immunomodulatory and gastroprotective properties etc. On the other hand, different factors also affecting the chemical composition of the gel, such as species and variety, climatic and soil conditions, cultivation methods and stress adaptation are enumerated and discussed. In this review, the historical uses, the botany, the chemistry, pharmacological activity and clinical trial, adverse effects and agricultural cultivation of A. vera will be described. This paper concludes that it still remains uncertain as to which of the component(s) is responsible for these physiological properties, more researches are needed to confirm the therapeutic and beneficial effects and to definitively clarify the myth surrounding Aloe vera. In addition, promoting its large-scale cultivation such as beach planting and seawater irrigation is also a meaty theme to study and debate.

AB  - Introduction. People seeking for psychotherapeutic help present with a variety of conditions including stress, depression, anxiety, and maladaptive individual difference factors. This paper reviews the studies investigating the link between these conditions and immunity. Findings. The relationship between stress-related conditions and immunity varies depending on the nature of the stressor. Acute time-limited stressors are associated with an upregulation of natural immunity, brief naturalistic stressors with a shift from cellular to humoral immunity, while long-term and chronic stressors with a decrease in most functional immune measures. Depression is associated with changes in both enumerative and functional immune measures. The most consistent association is with decreased cellular immunity. There is considerable heterogeneity in study findings that may be accounted for by clinical and demographic factors. Only limited evidence has been presented for an association between anxiety and changes in immune function. The results are somewhat inconsistent and no firm conclusions can be drawn from these studies. Relatively few studies investigated the relationship between maladaptive individual difference factors and immunity. Replicated findings include an association between alexithymia and impaired cellular immunity and altered cytokine balance with a shift towards proinflammatory mediators, and a link between Type C and Type C-related coping and HIV progression and impaired immunity, Conclusions. Several conditions leading people to psychotherapy are associated with changes in immune function. However, several findings are preliminary and demand replication. Also, most of the evidence is correlational and further studies allowing for causal inferences are needed. Future psychoimmunology studies should better clarify the clinical relevance of the findings.

AB  - It is well established that a subgroup of women are particularly vulnerable to affective dysregulation during times of hormonal fluctuation. One underrecognized reproductive transition may be late-onset postpartum depression (PPD) in the context of weaning from breastfeeding and the resumption of menstruation. The goal of this review is to propose a biologically plausible mechanism for affective dysregulation during these transitions. The relationship between affective symptoms and neurohormonal changes associated with weaning will be investigated through a hypothesis-driven review of relevant literature. Neurosteroids, like allopregnanolone (ALLO), are widely recognized for augmenting GABAergic inhibition and having a powerful anxiolytic effect (Belelli D and Lambert JL, Nature Reviews Neuroscience 6:565-575, 2005). However, when ALLO is administered after prolonged withdrawal, there may be a paradoxical anxiogenic effect (Smith et al., Psychopharmacology 186:323-333, 2006; Shen et al., Nat Neurosci 10:469-477, 2007). Weaning from breastfeeding is a physiologic example of fluctuating levels of ALLO after prolonged withdrawal. We propose that the complex hormonal milieu during weaning and resumption of menstruation may modify GABA(A) receptors such that ALLO may contribute to rather than ameliorate depressive symptoms in vulnerable individuals. The proposed model provides an initial step for understanding the mechanisms by which the changing hormonal environment during weaning and resumption of menstruation may contribute to an increased risk of depression in a subgroup of women who are hormonally sensitive. Future research investigating this model would be valuable both to identify women at increased risk for developing mood symptoms late in postpartum and to inform treatment for this and related reproductive depressive disorders.

AB  - Previous research has hypothesised increased uric acid levels, possibly because of an amplified purinergic metabolism and a reduced adenosine activity, in subjects with bipolar disorder. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at estimating if individuals with bipolar disorder had uric acid levels higher than both healthy controls and subjects with major depression (trait marker hypothesis). It also tested if uric acid levels could differ in different phases of bipolar disorder (state marker hypothesis). Meta-analyses were carried out generating pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs), using random-effects models. Heterogeneity between studies was estimated using the 12 index. Relevant sensitivity and meta-regression analyses were conducted.
   We searched main Electronic Databases, identifying twelve studies that met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses showed increased uric acid levels in individuals with bipolar disorder as compared with both healthy controls (SMD = 0.65, p < 0.001, I-2 = 82.9%) and those with major depression (SMD = 0.46, p < 0.001; 12 = 68.7%). However, meta-regression analyses confirmed this association only as compared with healthy controls. Finally, though uric acid levels were higher in manic/mixed phases as compared with depressive ones (SMD = 0.34; p = 0.04, I-2 = 58.8%), a sensitivity analysis did not confirm the association.
   In sum, our meta-analysis shows that subjects with bipolar disorder have uric acid levels higher than healthy controls. The potential role of factors that might clarify the nature of this association deserves additional research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diverse approaches to the treatment of depressive disorders are necessary to improve evidence-based practice and maximize treatment outcomes. As a result, a range of behaviors and other factors associated with the onset and course of depressive disorders should be examined more comprehensively. Behavioral activation (BA) is a treatment approach to these disorders that can be tailored to address certain health behaviors within the context of depression in an attempt to promote health behaviors whose adoption and maintenance can prove complementary in the treatment of depression. We conducted a scoping review of published studies in which BA-based interventions were used to promote certain health behaviors in individuals with depression. Our search of Medline and the Web of Science identified 336 potential candidate studies. Following screening and with the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria to isolate potentially eligible full-text records, we ultimately identified and evaluated 20 papers that report the nature and efficacy of these modified interventions. Across various domains, including substance use, exercise, medication adherence, and occupational and social success, we found evidence that many-but not all-of the studies we reviewed demonstrated that BA-based interventions were efficacious in promoting the health behavior of interest as well as reducing depressive symptomatology in participants. Implications for more widespread dissemination of such interventions, especially via mobile and web-based platforms due to their accessibility and affordability, are discussed. More research on the feasibility and efficacy of BA-based interventions tailored toward various determinants of health behavior and comorbidities of depressive disorders is warranted.

AB  - Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) constitutes an enigmatic amnestic condition. In view of the admittedly limited knowledge regarding the nature of TGA, we decided to systematically review existing evidence for the generally regarded benign course of the disease. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO were searched for relevant articles. Observational (case-control, cross-sectional and cohort) controlled studies were retrieved. TGA diagnosis was made according to the diagnostic criteria of Caplan, validated by Hodges and Warlow. The TGA group was compared with either healthy controls (HC) or/and individuals with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA). The long-term risks of dementia, epilepsy, psychological-emotional disturbances, as well as long-term vascular and (vascular or nonvascular) mortality risks, were evaluated. Quality assessment was based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Literature search provided 12 eligible articles. Retrospective, prospective or mixed cohort designs were implemented in every study. Five articles registered a high quality, five registered a moderate quality, while two articles were assessed as part of the grey literature (conference abstract, abstract in English-article in Spanish). Overall, retrieved evidence was suggestive of similar vascular and mortality risks in TGA patients and HC, while TIA individuals exhibited elevated risks. Moreover, psychological disturbances were comparable between TGA and healthy individuals. On the other hand, studies for dementia and epilepsy obtained contradictory results, indicating both a similar and an increased risk in the TGA group compared to the HC group. Therefore, additional high-quality studies are warranted for the acquisition of more determining conclusions regarding the long-term risk of dementia and epilepsy in TGA.

AB  - The "Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP)" study is a prospective-longitudinal study program in a community sample (Munich, Germany) of adolescents and young adults. The program was launched in 1994 to study the prevalence and incidence of psychopathological syndromes and mental disorders, to describe the natural course and to identify vulnerability and risk factors for onset and progression as well as psychosocial consequences. This paper reviews methods and core outcomes of this study program.
   The EDSP is based on an age-stratified random community sample of originally N = 3021 subjects aged 14-24 years at baseline, followed up over 10 years with up to 3 follow-up waves. The program includes a family genetic supplement and nested cohorts with lab assessments including blood samples for genetic analyses. Psychopathology was assessed with the DSM-IV/M-CIDI; embedded dimensional scales and instruments assessed vulnerability and risk factors.
   Beyond the provision of age-specific prevalence and incidence rates for a wide range of mental disorders, analyses of their patterns of onset, course and interrelationships, the program identified common and diagnosis-specific distal and proximal vulnerability and risk factors including critical interactions.
   The EDSP study advanced our knowledge on the developmental pathways and trajectories, symptom progression and unfolding of disorder comorbidity, highlighting the dynamic nature of many disorders and their determinants. The results have been instrumental for defining more appropriate diagnostic thresholds, led to the derivation of symptom progression models and were helpful to identify promising targets for prevention and intervention.

TI  - The Association between Maternal Experiences of Interpersonal Discrimination and Adverse Birth Outcomes: A Systematic Review of the Evidence
KW  - discrimination
KW  - birth outcomes
KW  - women's health
AB  - In the present systematic review, we argue that maternal experiences of interpersonal discrimination at least partially account for the disproportionate rates of adverse birth outcomes in minority populations. Since the 1990s, research in this area has slowly, but steadily increased, shedding more light on the insidious nature of interpersonal discrimination and its toxic health effects. With the aim of bringing this topic to the fore in academic as well as clinical settings, this paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the empirical knowledge on the relationship between maternal experiences of discrimination and birth outcomes. Of 5901 articles retained in the literature search, 28 met the predefined inclusion criteria. Accounting for a range of health and behavioral factors, the vast majority of these studies support the notion that maternal experiences of interpersonal discrimination predict a range of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and various physiological markers of stress (allostatic load) in both mother and child pre- and postpartum. Several moderators and mediators of this relationship were also identified. These related primarily to the type (first-hand and vicarious), timing (childhood, adolescence, and adulthood), frequency, and pervasiveness of discrimination experienced, as well as to maternal mental health and coping. More research into these factors, however, is required to definitively determine their significance. We discuss these findings as they relate to the general health repercussions of interpersonal discrimination, as well as in terms of applied prenatal care and interventions. Ultimately, we argue that assessing maternal experiences of interpersonal discrimination in prenatal care may represent a considerable asset for mitigating existing majority-minority disparities in adverse birth outcomes.

AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM), a poorly understood rheumatic condition, is characterized by chronic pain and psychiatric comorbidities, most notably depression and anxiety. Additional symptoms include sleep difficulties, fatigue, and various cognitive impairments. Furthermore, FM is surrounded by social stigma, due to the unclear nature and etiology of this condition. While there is widespread evidence for the emotional and psychological suffering of those with FM, the scope of suicidality, as well as the underlying factors that are associated with suicidal ideation and behavior among this population, are not well understood. The present review, which is the first of its kind, aims to summarize existing data on the prevalence of suicide-related outcomes among FM patients, highlight factors associated with suicidal ideation and behavior in FM, and identify gaps in the literature to better inform research and clinical care. Studies were extracted from the literature that measured suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, and/or completed suicide among FM patients. Results indicated that both suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior were prevalent among individuals suffering from FM. Psychiatric comorbidity, sleep difficulties, and inpatient hospitalization were associated with both suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Functional impairment was associated with suicidal ideation in FM. Factors associated with higher levels of suicidal behavior in FM included female gender, unemployment and lower income, medical comorbidity, and drug dependence. While an understanding of currently recognized risk factors is important for improving FM research and clinical care, some clear methodological and conceptual limitations of the reviewed studies were identified. Future work should focus on longitudinal studies, as well as on gaining a better biological and psychological understanding of the underpinnings of FM and suicidality.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review of the evidence of associations between postpartum depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, body image and weight status in the first 12months post birth.Background: The postpartum period places the mother and infant at risk of a number of negative health outcomes. Mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety are common in the postpartum, as are poor body image and excessive weight retention as women adjust to their post pregnancy body. However, the associations between body image, weight status and psychological distress are not currently well understood.Methods: Articles in English, published between 2006 and 2017, involving singleton pregnancies of normally developing infants and maternal depression or anxiety were eligible for this systematic review.Results: From the total of 1805articles located, 12 were identified as relevant and were subsequently reviewed in full. In the nine studies of depressive symptoms, body image or weight status, four found a significant relationship. Significant associations were not found in the three studies investigating postpartum anxiety symptoms, body image or weight. Body dissatisfaction was associated significantly with poorer postpartum weight status in all nine studies.Conclusions: Further research is needed to determine the nature of the relationships between body image, weight status and depressive and anxiety symptoms across the first year after birth. This information will assist health professionals to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours in the postpartum, as well as inform clinical interventions that target behaviour change to prevent the worsening of these issues and related negative outcomes.

AB  - Glucocorticoid hormones play a pivotal role in the response to stressful challenges. The surge in glucocorticoid hormone secretion after stress needs to be tightly controlled with characteristics like peak height, curvature and duration depending on the nature and severity of the challenge. This is important as chronic hyper- or hypo-responses are detrimental to health due to increasing the risk for developing a stress-related mental disorder. Proper glucocorticoid responses to stress are critical for adaptation. Therefore, the tight control of baseline and stress-evoked glucocorticoid secretion are important constituents of an organism's resilience. Here, we address a number of mechanisms that illustrate the multitude and complexity of measures safeguarding the control of glucocorticoid function. These mechanisms include the control of mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) occupancy and concentration, the dynamic control of free glucocorticoid hormone availability by corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and the control exerted by glucocorticoids at the signaling, epigenetic and genomic level on gene transcriptional responses to stress. We review the beneficial effects of regular exercise on HPA axis and sleep physiology, and cognitive and anxiety-related behavior. Furthermore, we describe that, possibly through changes in the GABAergic system, exercise reduces the impact of stress on a signaling pathway specifically in the dentate gyrus that is strongly implicated in the behavioral response to that stressor. These observations underline the impact of life style on stress resilience. Finally, we address how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting glucocorticoid action can compromise stress resilience, which becomes most apparent under conditions of childhood abuse.

AB  - As the most fascinating, complex, and dynamic part of our organism, the human brain is shaped by many interacting factors that not only are of neurobiological (including sex hormones) and environmental origin but are also sociocultural in their very nature (such as social roles). Gender is one of these factors. Most neurological, neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and psychosomatic disorders are characterized by impairments in visual social cognition (primarily body language reading and face perception) and a skewed sex ratio: females and males are affected differently in terms of clinical picture, prevalence, and severity. Is the social brain sex specific? This is still an open question. For a long time and for many reasons, sex differences have been overlooked or entirely ignored in neuroscience and biomedical research: there is a paucity of neuroimaging work examining sex differences in the social brain. However, the pattern of experimental behavioral data in both healthy, typically developing individuals and patients with deficient social cognition is beyond simple interpretation: contrary to popular wisdom, females are not always more proficient in understanding social signals, and their social abilities may be particularly affected by disease. Clarification of how neurobiological sex and sociocultural gender affect the social brain would provide novel insights into understanding gender-specific vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. This interaction is far beyond simplicity. Although sex differences represent a rather delicate topic, underestimation or exaggeration of possible effects retards progress in the field.

AB  - Orientation: Research regarding the well-being of judges is essential given the effects thereof on their work and contextual performance.
   Research purpose: This study aimed to review qualitative and quantitative empirical studies on the well-being of judges. Because of the limited availability of empirical studies on this topic, research in only five countries was included.
   Motivation for the study: The state of judges' well-being may affect, among others, their decision-making ability and their decorum in court.
   Research approach/design and method: A scoping review was used to synthesise research evidence on the well-being of judges. Relevant literature was searched using computerised databases, covering the period from January 2008 to May 2018. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Using the ATLAS.ti 8 programme for qualitative data analysis, the data were extracted from 11 articles.
   Main findings: A variety of job demands, such as judges' heavy workloads and time constraints, emotional demands of their work, negative work-home interference and their safety concerns, had a negative effect on their well-being. Despite the stressors and occupational demands to which judges were subjected, some judges experienced high levels of well-being because of, inter alia, the autonomy they had over certain aspects of their work, the nature of their work and positive relationships with their colleagues.
   Practical/managerial implications: Interventions should be employed to address stressors and job demands, as well as job resources that affect judges' well-being.
   Contribution/value-add: This study adds to scientific knowledge vis-a-vis the well-being of judges.

AB  - Objective: Increasingly, disruption of the gastrointestinal ecosystem is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of several medical conditions, including depression. Antibiotics can induce substantial changes in the gastro-intestinal microbiota and several lines of evidence suggest that antibiotics exposure may increase the risk of developing depression. This systematic review examined this potential association. Methods: PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases, as well as unpublished resources, were searched for studies in humans published from 2000 onwards. The studies needed to consider the connection between antibiotic exposure (either alone or in combination with other antibiotics and medications) and the development of depressive symptoms and/or disorders (in isolation to other psychological conditions). Results: Nine studies met the eligibility criteria. All were observational in nature. The studies were conducted in different age groups with various indications for receiving antibiotics. Together, these relatively low-quality studies suggest a potential association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent development of depression symptoms. Specifically, studies from the United Kingdom and Sweden indicate that the risk of depression is increased by at least 20%, with the former (over 1 million participants) reporting an increased risk with the number of courses and agents used, that persists with a slow decline over the ten years following exposure. Conclusions: The inherent limitations associated with the studies' methodologies make a reliable conclusion difficult. While the risk of antimicrobial resistance may prohibit large randomised clinical trials in healthy in-dividuals, future placebo-controlled trials with antibiotics-based protocols (e.g. for acne) should explore their effect on mental health.

AB  - This narrative review paper aims to build a common understanding of the vulnerabilities of children with chronic medical conditions who face exceptional challenges due to nature of the illness, deformity, injury, and traumatic healthcare encounters which could potentially lead to long-term psychological effects. The presence of chronic medical diagnoses in children and the subsequent impacts including social stigma, as well as their age and developmental level, may amplify adjustment challenges in parenting considerations, school, peer relations, career, and future relationships. Children may be traumatized by unfamiliar and painful healthcare experiences. Hospitalization can lead to increased feelings of isolation, fear, and self-doubt when children do not receive emotionally safe psychological support necessary to minimize the accompanying stress and anxiety. School experiences and parenting children with chronic illnesses have additional intersecting socialization characteristics. This paper highlights a vision for furthering the groundwork within Indian pediatric settings to promote emotional safety and psychosocial care. Principles from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the World Health Organization's definition of health create an impetus for giving a voice to children with chronic medical conditions. While there are sporadic psychosocial services for children with chronic needs, they lack consistency, and this indicates a need and an opportunity for developing a unique career for human development and psychology professionals to address these concerns. As exemplars, two psychosocial care programs in India that help foster resilience in these children are highlighted. Although limited, extant research regarding the experiences of children with chronic medical conditions in India is discussed, and implications for future research and academic initiatives are interwoven within this paper.

AB  - Peripartum severe mental disorders (PSMDs) encompass schizophrenia, affective psychosis, and psychotic and non-psychotic forms of bipolar disorders. PSMDs are well documented in high-income countries. However, much less is known about the prevalence of PSMDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim was to review the available literature systematically and estimate the prevalence of PSMDs among women in LMICs. We searched the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Maternity and Infant Care databases systematically from the date of inception to Dec 31, 2020, for English-language publications with data on the prevalence of PSMDs among women in World Bank-defined LMICs. Selection of studies, extraction of data and assessment of study quality were each undertaken independently by at least two of the investigators. A total of five studies (completed in three countries spanning two continents) met the inclusion criteria. Five studies reported cumulative incidence of postpartum psychosis (ranging from 1.1 to 16.7 per 1000 births). We found no studies on the prevalence of severe mental disorder during pregnancy in these settings. Marked heterogeneity in methodology precluded meta-analysis. These findings indicate that PSMDs occur at a similar prevalence in low- and middle-income to high-income countries. However overall, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence from these settings. There is a need for rigorous studies with standardized methods to increase knowledge of the nature, prevalence, and determinants of PSMDs among women in resource-constrained LMICs to inform policies, service development, program planning and health professional training.

AB  - In addition to their role as signaling molecules of the immune system, cytokines may participate in central neurotransmission. Variations of the central and/or peripheral levels of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-beta (IL-1beta), impact on neuroendocrine processes as well as central neurotransmitter activity. To a considerable extent, these effects are reminiscent of those elicited by psychogenic stressors. The current review describes recent findings consistent with a role for these cytokines in the neurochemical and behavioral manifestations of clinical depression, as well as the cellular death associated with cerebral ischemia. Moreover, the increasing use of cytokines in the immunotherapeutic treatment of various autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and cancers prompted us to consider the potential role of central processes in subserving the mood-related side-effects elicited by these treatments. Finally, a single administration of TNF-alpha has been shown to elicit a time-dependent sensitization effect, wherein the behavioral and neurochemical responses elicited by later cytokine treatment are greatly enhanced. Thus, particular attention was devoted to the possibility that elevated levels of TNF-alpha, through either exogenous (e.g. immunotherapy) or endogenous (e.g. brain damage or stressors) means may sensitize neurotransmitter or second messenger pathways important for the pathology. Given the time-dependent nature of cytokine sensitization effects, the schedule of cytokine administration during immunotherapy, or the timing of cytokine up-regulation in response to traumatic or stressful events may favor the development of sensitized central processes, which may influence clinical outcome.

AB  - Brain mapping studies using dynamic imaging methods demonstrate areas where regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) decreases, as well as areas where flow increases, during performance of various experimental tasks. Task specificity holds for both sets of cerebral blood flow changes (Delta CBF), respectively, providing the opportunity to investigate areas that become "deactivated" and "activated" in the experimental condition relative to the control state. Such data yield the intriguing observation that in areas implicated in emotional processing, such as the amygdala, the posteromedial orbital cortex, and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, although flow increases as expected during specific emotion-related tasks, flow decreases during performance of some attentionally demanding, cognitive tasks. Conversely, in some of the areas that appear to subserve cognitive functions, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, flow increases while performing attentionally demanding cognitive tasks, but decreases during some experimentally induced and pathological emotional states. Although the specific nature of such reciprocal patterns of regional Delta CBF remains unclear, they may reflect an important cross-modal interaction during mental operations. The possibility that neural activity is less active in areas required in emotional processing during some higher cognitive processes holds implications for the mechanisms underlying interactions between cognition and emotion. Furthermore, the possibility that neural activity in some cognitive-processing areas is suppressed during intense emotional states suggests mechanisms by which extreme fear or severe depression may interfere with cognitive performance.

AB  - Traditional therapeutic methods in psychiatry, such as psychopharmacology and psychotherapy help many people suffering from mental disorders, but in the long-term prove to be effective in a relatively small proportion of those affected. Therapeutically, resistant forms of mental disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder lead to persistent distress and dysfunction in personal, social, and professional aspects. In an effort to address these problems, the translational approach in neuroscience has initiated the inclusion of novel or modified unconventional diagnostic and therapeutic techniques with promising results. For instance, neuroimaging data sets from multiple modalities provide insight into the nature of pathophysiological mechanisms such as disruptions of connectivity, integration, and segregation of neural networks, focusing on the treatment of mental disorders through instrumental biomedical methods such as electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). These methodologies have yielded promising results that have yet to be understood and improved to enhance the prognosis of the severe and persistent psychotic and affective disorders. The current review is focused on the translational approach in the management of schizophrenia and mood disorders, as well as the adaptation of new transdisciplinary diagnostic tools such as neuroimaging with concurrently administered psychopathological questionnaires and integration of the results into the therapeutic framework using various advanced instrumental biomedical tools such as ECT, TMS, tDCS and DBS.

AB  - Nurses have been found to experience higher levels of stress-related burnout compared to other health care professionals. Despite studies showing that both job satisfaction and burnout are effects of exposure to stressful working environments, leading to poor health among nurses, little is known about the causal nature and direction of these relationships. The aim of this systematic review is to identify published research that has formally investigated relationships between these variables. Six databases (including CINAHL, COCHRANE, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PROQUEST and PsyINFO) were searched for combinations of keywords, a manual search was conducted and an independent reviewer was asked to cross validate all the electronically identified articles. Of the eighty five articles that were identified from these databases, twenty one articles were excluded based on exclusion criteria; hence, a total of seventy articles were included in the study sample. The majority of identified studies exploring two and three way relationships (n = 63) were conducted in developed countries. Existing research includes predominantly cross-sectional studies (n = 68) with only a few longitudinal studies (n = 2); hence, the evidence base for causality is still very limited. Despite minimal availability of research concerning the small number of studies to investigate the relationships between work-related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and the general health of nurses, this review has identified some contradictory evidence for the role of job satisfaction. This emphasizes the need for further research towards understanding causality.

AB  - Background Measurement of service content is necessary to understand what services actually provide and explain variation in service outcomes. There is no consensus about how to measure content of care in mental health services. Method Content of care measures for use in mental health services were identified through a search of electronic databases, hand searching of references from selected studies and consultation with experts in the field. Measures are presented in an organising methodological framework. Studies which introduced or cited the measures were read and investigations of empirical associations between content of care and outcomes were identified. Results Twenty five measures of content of care were identified, which used three different data collection methods and five information sources. Seven of these measures have been used to identify links between content of care and outcomes, most commonly in Assertive Community Treatment settings. Discussion Measures have been developed which can provide information about service content. However, there is a need for measures to demonstrate more clearly a theoretical or empirical basis, robust psychometric properties and feasibility in a range of service settings. Further comparison of the feasibility and reliability of different measurement methods is needed. Contradictory findings of associations between service content and outcomes may reflect measures' uncertain reliability, or that crucial process variables are not being measured. Conclusion Measures providing a greater depth of information about the nature of interventions are needed. In the absence of a gold standard content of care measure, a multi-methods approach should be adopted.

AB  - Background: Evidence maps are a method of systematically characterising the range of research activity in broad topic areas and are a tool for guiding research priorities.
   Aims: Evidence-mapping' methodology was used to quantify the nature and distribution of recent peer-reviewed research into the mental health and wellbeing of Australian emergency services personnel.
   Methods: A search of the PsycINFO, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases was performed for primary research articles that were published between January 2011 and July 2016.
   Results: In all, 43 studies of primary research were identified and mapped. The majority of the research focused on organisational and individual/social factors and how they relate to mental health problems/wellbeing. There were several areas of research where very few studies were detected through the mapping process, including suicide, personality, stigma and pre-employment factors that may contribute to mental health outcomes and the use of e-health. No studies were detected which examined the prevalence of self-harm and/or harm to others, bullying, alcohol/substance use, barriers to care or experience of families of emergency services personnel. In addition, there was no comprehensive national study that had investigated all sectors of emergency services personnel.
   Conclusion: This evidence map highlights the need for future research to address the current gaps in mental health and wellbeing research among Australian emergency services personnel. Improved understanding of the mental health and wellbeing of emergency services personnel, and the factors that contribute, should guide organisations' wellbeing policies and procedures.

AB  - Purpose Trauma-informed care and practice (TICP) has gained international attention since the mid-1990s, but its recent adoption in Australia has been met with various barriers, including a lack of training and education opportunities to enhance professional knowledge and practice. This paper aims to identify and further understand what is occurring in TICP training and education for health and human service professionals in Australia; specifically, what is known about TICP content and training strategies being used. Design/methodology/approach A scoping methodology was used to undertake a systematic search of the literature to identify and map the scope and nature of research activity on TICP training and education for professionals in Australia. Based on the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, removal of duplications, abstract review and full-text screening, six studies met the inclusion criteria for content analysis in this review. Findings The studies showed that TICP training and education was occurring predominantly in the Australian health sector for nursing professionals and improved knowledge, confidence to respond to disclosures of trauma and approaches to care. Training was commonly delivered through one-day workshops and brief Web-based approaches. The findings suggested that there is a need for consensus on TICP content to ensure that fidelity to the principles of TICP is promoted in unique workplace settings and for ongoing commitment by relevant stakeholders and funding bodies. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review exploring what is happening across disciplines and sectors for trauma-informed education. The findings have implications for clinicians, professionals, educators and researchers.

AB  - Background The opportunities for psychiatry deriving from available or likely genetic advances are reviewed.
   Method Clinical implications are considered in the context of both the misconceptions and benefits associated with relevant genetic findings.
   Results Misconceptions include that: heritability estimates have a 'true' fixed value; a high heritability means that environmental interventions will be ineffective; a high heritability within groups means that differences between groups will also be due to genes; genetic effects are determinative; 'genetic' means single abnormal genes; genes associated with disease must be bad and justify eugenic measures; gene therapy will be widely applicable; and genetic screening of the general population will be useful. The benefits include demonstrations that: both genes and environment have an ubiquitous influence; some prevailing diagnostic assumptions are mistaken; genes influence development; the effects of nature and nurture are not separate; and environmental effects tend to be person-specific. The potential value of molecular genetics lies in elucidation of causal processes as they apply to both brain systems and nature-nurture interplay; improving diagnosis and genetic counselling; and the development of improved pharmacological interventions.
   Conclusion Advances in genetics will make a major impact on clinical psychiatry, and should bring practical benefits for both prevention and treatment.

AB  - Mercury is a toxic heavy metal which is widely dispersed in nature. Most human exposure results from fish consumption or dental amalgam. Mercury occurs in several chemical forms, with complex pharmacokinetics. Mercury is capable of inducing a wide range of clinical presentations. Diagnosis of mercury toxicity can be challenging but can be obtained with reasonable reliability. Effective therapies for clinical toxicity have been described.

AB  - Dental fear/anxiety is a widely recognised problem affecting a large proportion of the population. It can result in avoidance and/or difficulty accepting dental care. We believe that psychological intrusion may play a role in the aetiology and maintenance of dental fear for at least some individuals. In this narrative review we will take a developmental perspective in order to understand its impact across the lifespan. We will consider the nature of 'self,' parenting styles, the details of intrusive parenting or parental psychological control, and briefly touch upon child temperament and parental anxiety. Finally, we draw together the supporting (largely unrecognised) evidence available in the dental literature. We illustrate the paper with clinical examples and discuss possibly effective ways of addressing the problem. We conclude that psychological intrusion appears to play an important role in dental fear, for at least some individuals, and we call for detailed research into the extent and exact nature of the problem. A simple means of identifying individuals who are vulnerable to psychological intrusion would be useful for dentists.

AB  - Peptic ulcer occurs due to the erosive action of the acid gastric juice upon an area of mucous membrane that may be presumed to have become devitalized in some way and thus to have lost its normal powers of resistance to its own enzymes. Being a psychosomatic illness various psychological factors have been found to be associated with the occurrence and/or persistence of the disease. The present study deals with the nature of anger, life event stress, conflict and defense mechanism of 30 peptic ulcer patients and 30 unaffected individuals. MANOVA and further analysis through ANOVA were computed to statistically analyse the data. The results of the study revealed that peptic ulcer patients had lower trait anger, angry temperament, anger-out and defensive function; and higher anger-in and life event stress than the individuals in the comparative group. Findings also revealed differences in needs, conflicts and defenses between the two groups. Thus it can be concluded that peptic ulcer patients may have a tendency to suppress their anger, experience significantly greater life event stress, experience a significant conflict of autonomy versus compliance along with having low defensive functioning.

AB  - Although memory has long been recognized as a generative process, neural research of memory in recent decades has been predominantly influenced by Tulving's "mental time traveling" perspective and focused on the reac-tivation and consolidation of encoded memory representations. With the development of multiple powerful analytical approaches to characterize the contents and formats of neural representations, recent studies are able to provide detailed examinations of the representations at various processing stages and have provided exciting new insights into the transformative nature of episodic memory. These studies have revealed the rapid, sub-stantial, and continuous transformation of memory representation during the encoding, maintenance, consoli-dation, and retrieval of both single and multiple events, as well as event sequences. These transformations are characterized by the abstraction, integration, differentiation, and reorganization of memory representations, enabling the long-term retention and generalization of memory. These studies mark a significant shift in perspective from remembering to reconstruction, which might better reveal the nature of memory and its roles in supporting more effective learning, adaptive decision-making, and creative problem solving.

AB  - IntroductionAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric disorder that is difficult to treat and often follows a protracted course. A number of theoretical models have been proposed for the etiology and maintenance of AN. Two domains that have received substantial attention in the literature on AN are affect and reward/punishment processes. However, despite an overlap in the nature and implications of these processes, studies of AN addressing these constructs have typically investigated them independently.PurposeThe purpose of this narrative review is to integrate the literature on the role of affect, reward, and punishment in AN.MethodWe provide a focused narrative overview of the literature relating to the affect, reward, and punishment in AN via a synthesis of recent reviews and meta-analyses.ResultsWe first describe several prominent affect and reward/punishment-based conceptualizations of AN, followed by a brief overview of the existing empirical literature in these domains.ConclusionWe provide a critical discussion of the disparate nature of these literatures in AN, including associated limitations. We then conclude with an extensive discussion of directions for future research that integrate the study of affect and reward/punishment processes in AN.Level of evidenceLevel V, narrative review.

AB  - The concept of occupational health and safety (OHS) for commercial sex workers has rarely been investigated, perhaps because of the often informal nature of the workplace, the associated stigma, and the frequently illegal nature of the activity. We reviewed the literature on health, occupational risks, and safety among commercial sex workers. Cultural and local variations and commonalities were identified. Dimensions of OHS that emerged included legal and policing risks, risks associated with particular business settings such as streets and brothels, violence from clients, mental health risks and protective factors, alcohol and drug use, repetitive strain injuries, sexually transmissible infections, risks associated with particular classes of clients, issues associated with male and transgender commercial sex workers, and issues of risk reduction that in many cases are associated with lack of agency or control, stigma, and legal barriers. We further discuss the impact and potential of OHS interventions for commercial sex workers. The OHS of commercial sex workers covers a range of domains, some potentially modifiable by OHS programs and workplace safety interventions targeted at this population. We argue that commercial sex work should be considered as an occupation overdue for interventions to reduce workplace risks and enhance worker safety.

AB  - Envisioning the future of positive psychology (PP) requires looking at its past. To that end, I first review prior critiques of PP to underscore that certain early problems have persisted over time. I then selectively examine recent research to illustrate progress in certain areas as well as draw attention to recurrent problems. Key among them is promulgation of poorly constructed measures of well-being and reliance on homogeneous, privileged research samples. Another concern is the commercialization of PP, which points to the need for greater oversight and quality control in profit-seeking endeavors. Looking ahead, I advocate for future science tied to contemporary challenges, particularly ever-widening inequality and the pandemic. These constitute intersecting catastrophes that need scientific attention. Such problems bring into focus "neglected negatives " that may be fueling current difficulties, including greed, indifference, and stupidity. Anger, which defies easy characterization as positive or negative, also warrants greater scientific study. Going forward I advocate for greater study of domains that likely nurture good lives and just societies - namely, participation in the arts and encounters with nature, both currently under study. Overall, my entreaty to PP is to reckon with persistent problems from its past, while striving toward a future that is societally relevant and virtuous.

AB  - Volatile chemicals used widely as solvents can produce acute effects on the nervous system and behavior after inhalation exposure, and many are subject to abuse. This review considers the nature of the acute effects of volatile organic solvents by comparing their actions to those of classical CNS depressant drugs such as the barbiturates, benzodiazepines and ethanol. Like CNS depressant drugs, selected inhalants have been shown to have biphasic effects on motor activity, disrupt psychomotor performance, have anticonvulsant effects, produce biphasic drug-like effects on rates of schedule-controlled operant behavior, increase rates of punished responding, enhance the effects of depressant drugs, serve as reinforcers in self-administration studies and share discriminative stimulus effects with barbiturates and ethanol. Toluene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane, as well as subanesthetic concentrations of halothane, have been the most extensively studied; however, it is unclear whether important differences may exist among solvents in their ability to produce a depressant profile of acute effects. The possibility that selected solvents can have acute effects similar to those of depressant drugs may shed light on the nature of their acute behavioral toxicology and on their abuse.

AB  - Research on person perception typically emphasizes cognitive processes of information selection and interpretation within the individual perceiver and the nature of the resulting mental representations. The authors focus instead on the ways person perception processes create, and are influenced by, the patterns of impressions that are socially constructed, transmitted, and filtered through social networks. As the socially situated cognition perspective (E. R. Smith & G. R. Semin, 2004) suggests, it is necessary to supplement consideration of intra-individual cognitive processes with an examination of the social context. The authors describe a theoretical model of processes of distributed social cognition that takes account of 3 levels: the individual perceiver, the interacting dyad, and the-social network in which they are embedded. The authors' model assumes that perceivers elicit or create as well as interpret impression-relevant information in dyadic interaction and that perceivers obtain information from 3rd-party sources who are linked to perceivers and targets in social networks. The authors also present results of a multiagent simulation of a subset of these processes. Implications of the theoretical model are discussed, for the possibility of correcting biases in person perception and for the nature of underlying mental representations of persons.

AB  - Humans are a cultural species, constantly navigating a complex web of culturally bound practices, norms, and worldviews. This article provides a brief overview of the relatively young field of cultural psychology, which investigates the many ways psychology and culture interweave with one another. Highlighting the cultural nature of the human species, it draws upon research on cultural evolution, enculturation, and developmental processes. This review further summarizes a number of cultural differences in how people perceive the self, and the behavioral consequences that follow from these differences, in the domains of internal and external attribution styles, motivations for self-enhancement, approach/avoidance, primary and secondary control, as well as motivations for distinctiveness and conformity. Additionally, the review discusses research on the intersection of culture and emotion, as well as cultural differences in cognition, perception, and reasoning. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The study of personality requires that we understand what we mean by the terms personality and development. Whereas the concept of personality-including individual characteristics that are consistent over concert and time-is appealing, serious issues in regard to consistency of characteristics over different contexts and over time remain, suggesting to me that although correlations may be significant, there is relatively little variance accounted for. As such, there is little consistency. The study of human development also has difficulties, especially the idea that earlier events lead to or can predict later events. In this article, these 2 classes of difficulties are addressed. The data suggest that individual characteristics, especially in children, are not consistent over context and time, and that earlier events do not predict later ones. This leads to the conclusion that an analysis of behavior in context may be the best way to understand the changing nature of personality growth and development.

AB  - The investigation of marital conflict has reached a crossroads. Over 25 years of research on marital conflict behavior yields a relatively clear picture of its topography, but its relevance for changing the marital relationship remains controversial. We can continue to amass observations in a relatively atheoretical manner and hope that patterns capable of guiding clinical activity will emerge, or we can begin creating a unified theoretical framework to indicate new directions for clinical activity and empirical investigation. Before exploring the latter option, this chapter reviews briefly the impact of marital conflict on mental, physical, and family health and what is known about the nature of conflict in marriage. After highlighting some recent theoretically grounded advances, we illustrate how conceptualizing marital conflict behavior as goal directed provides an integrative theoretical framework for treatment, prevention, and marital conflict research.

AB  - The interest in psilocybin as a therapeutic approach has grown exponentially in recent years. Despite increasing access, there remains a lack of practical guidance on the topic for health care professionals. This is particularly concerning given the medical complexity and vulnerable nature of patients for whom psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy may be considered. This article aims to provide health care professionals with an overview of practical considerations for psilocybin therapy, rooted in a patient safety focus. Within this piece we will review basic psilocybin pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, indications, practical therapeutic strategies (e.g., dosing, administration, monitoring) and safety considerations (e.g., contraindications, adverse events, and drug interactions). With this information, our goal is to increase the knowledge and comfort of health care professionals to discuss and counsel their patients on psilocybin therapy, ultimately improving patient care and safety.

AB  - Research on the mental representation of time ('subjective time') has provided broad insights into the nature of time perception and temporal processing. As the field comprises different scientific disciplines, such as psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience, studies differ with regard to the basic terms and concepts used. For this reason, research on subjective time lacks a coherent conceptual system. We argue that research in the field of subjective time should aim at establishing such a system, i.e., a more standardized terminology, in order to strengthen its theoretical basis and to support an efficient communication of results. Based on key empirical findings and concepts that are commonly (but inconsistently) used in the literature, we argue for a conceptual framework for the study of subjective time that differentiates between three types of mental representations of time: basic temporal processing, time perception in terms of passage, and time perception in terms of duration.

AB  - This review brings together the literature that pertains to the role of relational reasoning, or the ability to discern meaningful patterns within any stream of information, in the mental work of scientists, medical doctors, and engineers. Existing studies that measure four forms of relational reasoning-analogy, anomaly, antinomy, and antithesis-are included in this review. These studies are organized into four groups based on their general measurement paradigm: those that use naturalistic observation methods to study relational reasoning in vivo; those that take a historical perspective to describe the construct as it arises in recordo; those that manipulate relevant variables in an in vitro or laboratory setting; and those that formulate computer models and algorithms to simulate relational reasoning in silico. Principal findings from this literature are presented and discussed, as are enduring questions about the nature and consequences of relational reasoning.

AB  - Emotion regulation involves the pursuit of desired emotional states (i.e., emotion goals) in the service of superordinate motives. The nature and consequences of emotion regulation, therefore, are likely to depend on the motives it is intended to serve. Nonetheless, limited attention has been devoted to studying what motivates emotion regulation. By mapping the potential benefits of emotion to key human motives, this review identifies key classes of motives in emotion regulation. The proposed taxonomy distinguishes between hedonic motives that target the immediate phenomenology of emotions, and instrumental motives that target other potential benefits of emotions. Instrumental motives include behavioral, epistemic, social, and eudaimonic motives. The proposed taxonomy offers important implications for understanding the mechanism of emotion regulation, variation across individuals and contexts, and psychological function and dysfunction, and points to novel research directions.

AB  - South Asians are at a greater risk of developing dementia due to having a higher incidence of diabetes than the UK population as a whole. Despite this they seem under-represented in service use for dementia. This review aimed to provide an overview of research on the perceptions of dementia in the South Asian community and the role of culture, religion and spirituality in these conceptualisations. Following a systematic literature search, five articles were reviewed and analysed thematically. Six themes were identified; South Asians' knowledge of general mental illness and aging; the nature of dementia and its symptoms, beliefs about the causes of dementia; community perceptions regarding dementia; treatment for dementia as well as how service provision could be improved. In this under-researched area, the available evidence highlights that South Asians understanding of dementia is likely to be implicated in the low uptake of services. Future research is identified.

In this review, we focus on NVC as it pertains to individuals and social interaction. We concentrate specifically on (a) the meanings and correlates of cues that are enacted (sent) by encoders and (b) the perception of nonverbal cues and the accuracy of such perception. Frameworks are presented for conceptualizing and understanding the process of sending and receiving nonverbal cues. Measurement issues are discussed, and theoretical issues and new developments are covered briefly. Although our review is primarily oriented within social and personality psychology, the interdisciplinary nature of NVC is evident in the growing body of research on NVC across many areas of scientific inquiry.

Yet no framework has been presented in the psychological literature to advance scholarship regarding the significance of BHK. While other constructs (e.g., racial identity and racial socialization) importantly highlight the significance of history, they are limited in accounting for the multifaceted nature of BHK. The purpose of this article is to present a conceptual framework that demonstrates the utility of BHK in facilitating mental health and psychological liberation among Black youth. Toward this goal, this article highlights theory and research related to definitions of BHK, liberation tasks associated with BHK, and interactional processes significant to coping and mental health among Black youth, particularly as they navigate racial encounters.

AB  - Personality traits and personal values are important psychological characteristics, serving as important predictors of many outcomes. Yet, they are frequently studied separately, leaving the field with a limited understanding of their relationships. We review existing perspectives regarding the nature of the relationships between traits and values and provide a conceptual underpinning for understanding the strength of these relationships. Using 60 studies, we present a meta-analysis of the relationships between the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality traits and the Schwartz values, and demonstrate consistent and theoretically meaningful relationships. However, these relationships were not generally large, demonstrating that traits and values are distinct constructs. We find support for our premise that more cognitively based traits are more strongly related to values and more emotionally based traits are less strongly related to values. Findings also suggest that controlling for personal scale-use tendencies in values is advisable.

Psychosocial or psychodynainic etiology was denied or distorted in line with the political ideology of the Communist Party Psychiatry was primarily conterned with psychotic disorders, and this diagnostic category was sometimes applied based on political considerations. Neurotic disorders were ignored by psychiatry or were regarded as the remnants of capitalism. Several neurotic disorders characterized by high levels of somatization were considered to be neurological or physical in nature. The majority of "mental patients" were institutionalized for a long periods in large-scale psychiatric hospitals. Treatment of psychiatric disorders depended largely on a few influenced by the

As Decision Making is a typical human mental process, it seems natural to apply the CW methodology in order to create and enrich decision models in which the information that is provided and manipulated has a qualitative nature. In this paper we make a review of the developments of CW in decision making. We begin with an overview of the CW methodology and we explore different linguistic computational models that have been applied to the decision making field. Then we present an historical perspective of CW in decision making by examining the pioneer papers in the field along with its most recent applications. Finally, some current trends, open questions and prospects in the topic are pointed out.

AB  - Psychophysiological perspectives can provide unique insights into the nature and motivations of children's prosociality and inform our understanding of individual differences. Here, I review current research on prosociality involving some of the most common physiological measures in developmental psychology, including cortisol, various sympathetic nervous system measures, and high-frequency heart rate variability. The literature has been quite mixed, in part because the link between physiology and prosociality is context-dependent and person-dependent. However, recent advances are refining our understanding of the basic physiological mechanisms of prosociality. Resting physiology that contributes to a balance of regulation and vigilance prepares children to effectively cope with future social challenges, like noticing and attending to the needs of others. Experiencing some arousal is an important aspect of empathy-related responding, but physiological patterns of both heightened and hypoarousal can undermine prosociality. Physiological flexibility in response to others' needs may support emotional and behavioral flexibility important for prosociality.

AB  - Alcoholism is a complex psychiatric disorder that has a multifactorial etiology. Epigenetic mechanisms are uniquely capable of accounting for the multifactorial nature of the disease in that they are highly stable and are affected by environmental factors, including alcohol itself. Chromatin remodeling causes changes in gene expression in specific brain regions contributing to the endophenotypes of alcoholism such as tolerance and dependence. The epigenetic mechanisms that regulate changes in gene expression observed in addictive behaviors respond not only to alcohol exposure but also to comorbid psychopathology such as the presence of anxiety and stress. This review summarizes recent developments in epigenetic research that may play a role in alcoholism. We propose that pharmacologically manipulating epigenetic targets, as demonstrated in various preclinical models, hold great therapeutic potential in the treatment and prevention of alcoholism.

AB  - Depending on its nature, duration, and intensity, stress can exert potent and bidirectional modulatory effects on pain, either reducing pain (stress-induced analgesia) or exacerbating it (stress-induced hyperalgesia). The descending pain pathway has been implicated in both stress-induced analgesia and stress-induced hyperalgesia. The endogenous opioid system is widely distributed throughout the descending pain pathway and regulates nociceptive signaling, emotionality, and the response to stress. Here we review the evidence for a key role of the endogenous opioid system in stress-induced modulation of pain in rodents and humans. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying opioidergic regulation of stresspain interactions may help in identifying novel therapeutic strategies for the improved treatment of comorbid pain and stress-related disorders.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare, debilitating condition which presents with progressive and inconsistent neurological features. The main symptoms are stiffness and intermittent, painful muscle spasms, triggered and exacerbated by stressful and emotional stimuli. The fluctuating clinical nature of SPS, and otherwise normal neurological examination, often lead to a misdiagnosis of conversion disorder. Psychiatric symptoms frequently accompany this disorder and patients are often first seen by psychiatrists. SPS is autoimmune-based: antibodies are directed against glutamate decarboxylase, resulting in dysregulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain which is considered the cause of the neuropsychiatric symptomatology. SPS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conversion disorder. Effective management requires early detection, a collaborative approach with GABA-ergic medication and intravenous immunoglobulins, and management of concomitant psychiatric disorders. We describe a patient with SPS. Only one other case has been reported in South Africa.

AB  - A systematic overview of the literature on palliative care for people with severe persistent mental illness (SPMI) was conducted to inform clinical practice, research, and education. Empirical studies and nonempirical papers were included. Few empirical Studies exist. There is even less information about the palliative care needs of, or the nature of palliative care provided to, people with SPMI. Mental health, primary care, and palliative care providers need to partner with people who have SPMI in developing and providing palliative care. The field of palliative care for people with SPMI is wide open and in need of methodologically Sound studies that will help define the issues that exist for this vulnerable population. Recognizing the similarities between mental health and palliative care should lead to collaborative ventures and discussions in an attempt to address common and parallel issues.

AB  - The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents the world with the medical challenge associated with multifactorial nature of this pathology. Indeed COVID-19 affects several organs and systems and presents diversified clinical picture. COVID-19 affects the brain in many ways including direct infection of neural cells with SARS-CoV-2, severe systemic inflammation which floods the brain with pro-inflammatory agents thus damaging nervous cells, global brain ischaemia linked to a respiratory failure, thromboembolic strokes related to increased intravascular clotting and severe psychological stress. Often the COVID-19 is manifested by neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms that include dizziness, disturbed sleep, cognitive deficits, delirium, hallucinations and depression. All these indicate the damage to the nervous tissue which may substantially increase the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and promote dementia.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder and the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Despite decades of research, there is still no cure for PD and the complicated intricacies of the pathology are still being worked out. Much of the research on PD has focused on neurons, since the disease is characterized by neurodegeneration. However, neuroglia has become recognized as key players in the health and disease of the central nervous system. This review provides a current perspective on the interactive roles that alpha-synuclein and neuroglial senescence have in PD. The self-amplifying and cyclical nature of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, alpha-synucleinopathy, neuroglial senescence, neuroglial chronic activation and neurodegeneration will be discussed. Finally, the compelling role that senolytics could play as a therapeutic avenue for PD is explored and encouraged.

AB  - In the last two decades, a substantive body of empirical work investigated the association between individual differences of electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha asymmetry and affective/motivational dispositions. Recent work indicated that several methodological problems persist in this field. The present paper reviews these problems with a focus on the reliability and validity of measures of anterior resting EEG asymmetry, which serve as a proxy for trait-like asymmetries of cortical activity. These issues include the treatment of ocular and muscle artifacts, the choice of the EEG reference, the use of current source density (CSD) measures, the state-trait nature of resting asymmetry, and the treatment of state-like fluctuations of the measures. In addition, the statistical problem of inflated type-I error due to multiple testing is also considered and different approaches to counteract this problem are suggested. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The local algebras of the maximal Coset model C-max associated with a chiral Conformal subtheory A subset of B are shown to coincide with the local relative commutants of A in B, provided A possesses a stress-energy tensor.
   Making the same assumption, the adjoint action of the unique inner-implementing representation U-A associated with A subset of B on the local observables in B is found to define net-endomorph isms of B. This property is exploited for constructing from B a conformally covariant holographic image in (1 + 1) dimensions which proves useful as a geometric picture for the joint inclusion A V C-max subset of B.
   Immediate applications to the analysis of current subalgebras are given and the relation to normal canonical tensor product subfactors is clarified. A natural converse of Borchers' theorem on half-sided translations is made accessible.

AB  - This paper examines the applicability of predictive coding as an explanatory model for perception. This is carried out from two perspectives. First, the central assumptions of the model are re-examined in light of the neuroscientific evidence for the structure and functioning of key brain areas involved in perception. The inferential processes involved in predictive coding are then investigated in the context of ambiguous stimuli. This showed that while predictive coding may provide an accurate explanation for our perceptual experiences in some cases, there are also several instances where the picture is not as clear cut. Following on from this, particular emphasis is placed on ambiguous art in order to examine the psychological and cognitive implications of predictive coding in affective states. This not only sheds light on the impact of predictive coding for cognition and emotion, but also helps clarify the nature of ambiguous art.

AB  - Extensive animal and recent human research have helped inform neuroendocrinological models of social cognition, motivation and behavior. In this review, we first summarize important findings regarding oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and testosterone in the domains of affiliation, social cognition, aggression and stress/anxiety. We then suggest ways in which human research can continue to profit from animal research, particularly by exploring the interactive nature of neuromodulatory effects at neurochemical, organismic and contextual levels. We further propose methods inspired by the animal literature for the ecologically valid assessment of affiliative behavior in humans. We conclude with suggestions for how human research could advance by directly assessing specific social cognitive and motivational mechanisms as intermediate variables. We advocate a more comprehensive look at the distinct networks identified by social neuroscience and the importance of a motivational state, in addition to approach and avoidance, associated with quiescence and homeostatic regulation.

A number of perceptual-cognitive skills that contribute to our ability to perceive the intentions of opponents are highlighted, such as the ability to: (a) pick up advance information from an opponent's postural orientation, (b) identify stimulus familiarity in patterns of play, (c) explore the visual scene in an efficient and effective manner, and (d) ascertain the most likely options facing an opponent at any given moment in time. A framework is presented to illustrate how these different perceptual-cognitive skills interact in a continuous and dynamic manner during performance. Finally, an attempt is made to illustrate how the interaction between these perceptual-cognitive skills, as well as the nature of the link between perception and action, may be influenced by player, task, and situational constraints.

AB  - In recent years researchers from diverse disciplines in the life sciences have turned their attention to the issue of developmental stability in the organism. Their key measure, fluctuating asymmetry (FA), is defined as the random, stress-induced deviations from perfect symmetry that develop during the development of bilaterally symmetrical traits. This is regarded as a promising measure of the stress experienced by individuals during their development, as well as the interaction between genetic and environmental forces which affect that development. FA also sheds light on several domains within psychological research, such as the interplay between nature and nurture during human development, etiology of mental health, mating and choice of partners, and even perception of facial beauty. This study reviews the manifestation and sources of FA in humans, and seeks to provide some insight regarding their relevance and possible application to various domains in psychology.

AB  - Background: Disruptions in rest and activity patterns are core features of bipolar disorder (BD). However, previous methods have been limited in fully characterizing the patterns. There is still a need to capture dysfunction in daily activity as well as rest patterns in order to more holistically understand the nature of 24-h rhythms in BD. Recent developments in the standardization, processing, and analyses of wearable digital actigraphy devices are advancing longitudinal investigation of rest activity patterns in real time. The current systematic review aimed to summarize the literature on actigraphy measures of rest-activity patterns in BD to inform the future use of this technology. Methods: A comprehensive systematic review using PRISMA guidelines was conducted through PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases, for papers published up to February 2021. Relevant articles utilizing actigraphy measures were extracted and summarized. These papers contributed to three research areas addressed, pertaining to the nature of rest-activity patterns in BD, and the effects of therapeutic interventions on these patterns. Results: Seventy articles were included. BD was associated with longer sleep onset latency and duration, particularly during depressive episodes and with predictive value for worsening of future manic symptoms. Lower overall daily activity was also associated with BD, especially during depressive episodes, while more variable activity patterns within a day were seen in mania. A small number of studies linked these disruptions with differential patterns of brain functioning and cognitive impairments, as well as more adverse outcomes including increased suicide risk. The stabilizing effect of therapeutic options, including pharmacotherapies and chronotherapies, on activity patterns was supported. Conclusion: The use of actigraphy provides valuable information about rest-activity patterns in BD. Although results suggest that variability in rhythms over time may be a specific feature of BD, definitive conclusions are limited by the small number of studies assessing longitudinal changes over days. Thus, there is an urgent need to extend this work to examine patterns of rhythmicity and regularity in BD. Actigraphy research holds great promise to identify a much-needed specific phenotypic marker for BD that will aid in the development of improved detection, treatment, and prevention options

AB  - The first step to providing effective healthcare is accurate assessment and diagnosis. The importance of accurate assessment is particularly important for chronic pain, given its subjective and multidimensional nature. The purpose of the current review is to discuss the dilemma of chronic pain assessment within a translational framework. First, assessment issues specific to chronic pain will be introduced along the entire continuum of translational activities. Important barriers along the continuum include inconsistent measurement of pain, possibly inaccurate preclinical models, and other practical limitations such as time, cost, and training. Second, the review will highlight promising areas worth further consideration in research and practice to bridge some of the gaps that currently impede effective chronic pain assessment and care. Specifically, consideration will be given to observational, biological, and technology-driven measures of chronic pain.

AB  - Medical errors in the general medical sector result in significant patient deaths and injuries, as well as high costs to the health care system. Despite the growing literature on errors in medical and surgical specialties, few studies have examined the incidence, nature, predictors, and prevention of errors that may occur in mental health treatment settings. The purpose of the current review is to examine the lessons learned from patient-safety research in the general medical sector, provide examples of types of errors in psychiatry, review the errors identified in the literature, offer a discussion of error-reduction strategies for improving patient safety, and provide recommendations for future research. Increased attention to medical errors in psychiatry is necessary in order to build safer health systems and promote a culture of safety among providers, thereby producing better care for patients with mental disorders.

AB  - A growing number of research findings have challenged the conception that memory for traumatic events is highly accurate or even indelible in nature. Research involving soldiers indicates that realistic levels of high stress decrease the accuracy of eyewitness memory. In addition, recent findings from several studies show quite clearly that memories for stressful events - including those from combat trauma - are malleable and vulnerable to alteration by exposure to misinformation. Under high stress, our brains facilitate the formation of "gist" memories that allow us to avoid future dangers but which may not contain the detail and precision demanded by the judicial system. Although mental health professionals ought to play a role in educating the courts about mental illness and trauma, it is unwise for them to become advocates for the idea that traumatic memories are indelible, factual accounts of events.

AB  - Modeling neuropsychiatric disorders in animals poses a significant challenge due to the subjective nature of diverse often overlapping symptoms, lack of objective biomarkers and diagnostics, and the rudimentary understanding of the pathophysiology. Successful translational research requires animal models that can inform about disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Here, we review behavioral and neurobiological findings from selected animal models, based on presumed etiology and risk factors, for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. We focus on the use of appropriate statistical tools and newly developed Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to link biomarkers from animal models with the human disease. We argue that this approach will lead to development of only the most robust animal models for specific psychiatric disorders and may ultimately lead to better understanding of the pathophysiology and identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Developments in the assessment and treatment of school refusal have often been hampered by a failure to recognise its essentially heterogeneous nature. This paper provides a review of major conceptual complexities that have helped to undermine developments in clinical practice. In particular, it considers the distinction between school refusal and truancy, and school phobia and separation anxiety. Common approaches to the assessment and treatment of school refusal are outlined. Although behavioural and cognitive behavioural approaches are now widely accepted as central to treatment, it is increasingly recognised that individually tailored programmes, utilising a range of approaches, are most likely to prove successful. An approach focusing upon the functions, rather than the symptoms, of school refusal is advocated as having most promise for assessment and the subsequent formulation of individual prescriptive treatment.

AB  - Anhedonia, the diminished capacity to experience pleasant emotions, is a common, treatment-resistant feature of schizophrenia that is often included among the negative symptoms of this disorder. This selective review describes the 3 most commonly used approaches to assess anhedonia in schizophrenia: interview-based measures, self-report trait questionnaires, and laboratory-based assessments of emotional experience. For each assessment approach, psychometric properties, relationships to other symptoms and features of schizophrenia, and relationships with the other assessment approaches are evaluated. It is concluded that anhedonia can be reliably assessed and constitutes a distinctive, clinically important aspect of schizophrenia that should be included in a comprehensive evaluation of negative symptoms. Current efforts to define more precisely the nature of the hedonic deficit in schizophrenia are discussed, and recommendations for optimal assessment of anhedonia in clinical trials of novel treatments for negative symptoms are provided.

AB  - Exposure to stress has profound, but complex, actions on motivated behavior and decision-making. These effects are central to core symptoms of a number of psychiatric disorders that are precipitated or augmented by stress, such as depressive disorders and substance use disorders. Studying the neural substrates of stress's effects on motivation has revealed that stress affects multiple targets on circuits throughout the brain using diverse molecular signaling processes. Moreover, stress does not have unitary effects on motivated behavior, but differences in the intensity, duration, intermittency, controllability and nature of the stressor produce qualitatively and quantitatively different behavioral endpoints. Unsurprisingly, the results of neuroscientific investigations into stress and motivation often open more questions than they resolve. Here we discuss contemporary results pertaining to the neural mechanisms by which stress alters motivation, identify points of contention and highlight integrative areas for continuing research into these multifaceted complexities.

AB  - What the cerebellum does to sensorimotor and vestibular control, it also does to cognition, emotion, and autonomic function. This hypothesis is based on the theories of dysmetria of thought and the universal cerebellar transform, which hold that the cerebellum maintains behavior around a homeostatic baseline, automatically, without conscious awareness, informed by implicit learning, and performed according to context. Functional topography within the cerebellum facilitates the modulation of distributed networks subserving multiple different functions. The sensorimotor cerebellum is represented in the anterior lobe with a second representation in lobule VIII, and lesions of these areas lead to the cerebellar motor syndrome of ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria and impaired oculomotor control. The cognitive / limbic cerebellum is in the cerebellar posterior lobe, with current evidence pointing to three separate topographic representations, the nature of which remain to be determined. Posterior lobe lesions result in the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS), the hallmark features of which include deficits in executive function, visual spatial processing, linguistic skills and regulation of affect. The affective dyscontrol manifests in autism spectrum and psychosis spectrum disorders, and disorders of emotional control, attentional control, and social skill set. This report presents an overview of the rapidly growing field of the clinical cognitive neuroscience of the cerebellum. It commences with a brief historical background, then discusses tract tracing experiments in animal models and functional imaging observations in humans that subserve the cerebellar contribution to neurological function. Structure function correlation studies following focal cerebellar lesions in adults and children permit a finer appreciation of the functional topography and nature of the cerebellar motor syndrome, cerebellar vestibular syndrome, and the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology - the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome. The ability to detect the CCAS in real time in clinical neurology with a brief and validated scale should make it possible to develop a deeper understanding of the clinical consequences of cerebellar lesions in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders with a link to the cerebellum.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive loss of neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) and serve as a major cause of morbidity, mortality and functional dependence especially among the elderly. Despite extensive research and development efforts, the success rate of clinical pipelines has been very limited. However, microRNAs (miRs) have been proved to be of crucial importance in regulating intracellular pathways for various pathologic conditions including those of a neurodegenerative nature. There is ample evidence of altered levels of various miRs in clinical samples of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients with potentially major clinical implications. In the current review, we aim to summarize the relevant literature on the role of miRs in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) as the two globally predominant neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - Even the most extreme environmentalists along the nature-nurture continuum in psychology now acknowledge that genes often contribute to individual differences in behavior. Behavioral traits are complex, reflecting the aggregate effects of many genes. These genetic effects are interactive, inter se and with the environments in which they are expressed. Human studies of addictive behaviors have clearly implicated both environmental and genetic influences. This review selects drug dependence as a paradigmatic addiction, and further, concentrates on the extensive literature with genetic animal models. Both traditional studies with inbred strains and selected lines and studies exploiting the new molecularly based technologies of the genomics era are discussed. Future directions for further contribution of animal models studies to our understanding of the brain dysregulations characteristic of addictions are identified.

AB  - Much of the existing psychological literature on depression is based on research with college students. An important question is whether depression in college students represents an appropriate analogue of depression in clinical patients. The purpose of the present article is to review past evidence on this issue from a critical perspective. Past arguments are examined, and little support is found for the position that depression research with college students is not warranted. Moreover, the results of studies with student and clinical samples are compared, and the findings are generally similar across populations. Next, a number of methodological issues are identified that may actually favor the use of depressed college students, and some methodological recommendations for future research are outlined. Finally, an appeal is made for research that directly examines the analogue-clinical issue and the nature of college student depression.

AB  - Human behavioral genetic research aimed at characterizing the existence and nature of genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in cognitive ability, personality and interests, and psychopathology is reviewed. Twin and adoption studies indicate that most behavioral characteristics are heritable. Nonetheless, efforts to identify the genes influencing behavior have produced a limited number of confirmed linkages or associations. Behavioral genetic research also documents the importance of environmental factors, but contrary to the expectations of many behavioral scientists, the relevant environmental factors appear to be those that are not shared by reared together relatives. The observation of genotype-environment correlational processes and the hypothesized existence of genotype-environment interaction effects serve to distinguish behavioral traits from the medical and physiological phenotypes studied by human geneticists. Behavioral genetic research supports the heritability, not the genetic determination, of behavior.

AB  - Sheep breeding is one of the most important branches of rural industry in Russia, which has deep historical roots, satisfies the needs of the population in wool, mutton, sheepskins and other products. The industry provides employment and incomes for considerable part of the rural population, allows preserving the traditional way of life in many rural regions. The branch of sheep breeding has been in depressive state for the last twenty years because of its unprofitability. The industry still lags behind in technological, technical, organizational and economic indicators. The nature of reproduction of sheep is based on the extensive type of development; and the field has been narrowed down compared to previously years. The negative consequences of this are manifested in economic and social aspects that lead to incomplete use of rangelands. As a result, situation does not meet the national interests, and regional governmental authorities and research community are especially focused on the sheep breeding industry.

AB  - Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) has been suggested to increase prosocial behavior in children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Out of all the animals used in AAT, dogs have been found to be the most utilized and accessible. This systematic review examines the current state of literature on canine-assisted therapy (CAT) for children with ASD based on peer-reviewed articles. Five studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. All articles found that presence of a therapy dog was correlated with increased frequency and duration of social behavior both throughout treatment and, in the case of one study, at follow-up. However, methodological limitations such as small sample sizes and sub-optimal analytic procedures suggest that existing studies might not accurately reflect the true nature of the relationship between CAT and social behavior. Therefore, further exploration of this area of research using methodologically strong studies is warranted and necessary. Recommendations for future research are included.

AB  - Traditional theories of categorization in which categories are assumed to be grounded in perceptual similarity or theories ignore an important basis of conceptual structure: the emotion that a stimulus elicits in a perceiver. This article discusses the nature of, constraints on, and conditions of use of emotional response categories. Experiments in which participants sorted triads of concepts that shared both emotional and nonemotional relations indicate that individuals use emotional response categories when they are experiencing emotional states. Multidimensional scaling of similarity judgments by emotional and nonemotional perceivers supports a selective attention mechanism of these effects. Participants induced to feel happy or sad emotional states weighted the emotional responses associated with stimuli more heavily than people in relatively neutral states. The triad and multidimensional scaling findings, along with functional considerations, suggest that emotional response categorization is not only tenable, but necessary for a complete account of categorization.

AB  - Social identities are associated with normative standards for thought and action, profoundly influencing the behavioral choices of individual group members. These social norms provide frameworks for identifying the most appropriate actions in any situation. Given the increasing complexity of the social world, however, individuals are more and more likely to identify strongly with multiple social groups simultaneously. When these groups provide divergent behavioral norms, individuals can experience social identity conflict. The current manuscript examines the nature and consequences of this socially conflicted state, drawing upon advances in our understanding of the neuropsychology of conflict and uncertainty. Identity conflicts are proposed to involve activity in the Behavioral Inhibition System, which in turn produces high levels of anxiety and stress. Building upon this framework, four strategies for resolving identity conflict are reviewed.

AB  - Is it better to be realistic or optimistic? A realistic outlook improves chances to negotiate the environment successfully, whereas an optimistic outlook places priority on feeling good. But are realistic and optimistic outlooks necessarily in conflict? The author suggests that the fuzzy nature Of accuracy typically places only loose boundaries on what it means to be realistic. As a result, there are many forms of optimism that do not, in principle, yield unrealistic assessments. Nevertheless, there remain numerous "optimistic biases " that do involve self-deception, or convincing oneself of desired beliefs without appropriate reality checks. The author describes several ways that realistic and unrealistic optimism can be differentiated and explores the impact of this distinction for current views of optimism. This critique reveals how positive psychology may benefit from a focus on personal meaning and knowledge as they relate to making the most of life.

AB  - Dependence to opiates, including illicit heroin and prescription pain killers, and treatment of the opioid use disorder (OUD) have been longstanding problems over the world. Despite intense efforts to scientific investigation and public health care, treatment outcomes have not significantly improved for the past 50 years. One reason behind the continuing use of heroin worldwide despite such efforts is its highly addictive nature. Brain imaging studies over the past two decades have made significant contribution to the understanding of the addictive properties as to be due in part to biological processes, specifically those in the brain structure and function. Moreover, traditional clinical neuropsychology studies also contribute to the account in part for the treatment refractory nature of the drug abuse. However, there is a gap between those studies, and the rates of relapse are still high. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to understand the fundamental neural mechanism of CUD. How does the brain of an OUD patient functionally and cognitively differ from others? This brief review is to compare and contrast the current literature on non-invasive resting state neuroimaging and clinical neuropsychological studies with the focus on the abstinence stage in OUD. The results show as follow:
   1. Brain connectivity strength in the reward system, dysregulation of circuits associated with emotion and stress, enhanced beta and alpha power activity, and high impulsivity are induced by CUD.
   2. Some recovery signs in cognition are demonstrated in OUD subjects after prolonged abstinence, but not in the subjects undergoing methadone treatment.
   3. Normalization in the composition of brain oscillations especially in the temporal region is induced and restored by methadone treatment in roughly 6 months in mean duration for OUDs having a mean opioid-use history of 10 years.
   We hope that the review provides valuable implications for clinical research and practice and paves anew insight into the future path to the identification of potential biomarkers and clinical outcome predictors in CUD in the domains of brain regions, functions, and behaviors.

AB  - Depression is a serious medical condition and is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Current depression diagnostics and assessment has significant limitations due to heterogeneity of clinical presentations, lack of objective assessments, and assessments that rely on patients' perceptions, memory, and recall. Digital phenotyping (DP), especially assessments conducted using mobile health technologies, has the potential to greatly improve accuracy of depression diagnostics by generating objectively measurable endophenotypes. DP includes two primary sources of digital data generated using ecological momentary assessments (EMA), assessments conducted in real-time, in subjects' natural environment. This includes active EMA, data that require active input by the subject, and passive EMA or passive sensing, data passively and automatically collected from subjects' personal digital devices. The raw data is then analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify behavioral patterns that correlate with patients' clinical status. Preliminary investigations have also shown that linguistic and behavioral clues from social media data and data extracted from the electronic medical records can be used to predict depression status. These other sources of data and recent advances in telepsychiatry can further enhance DP of the depressed patients. Success of DP endeavors depends on critical contributions from both psychiatric and engineering disciplines. The current review integrates important perspectives from both disciplines and discusses parameters for successful interdisciplinary collaborations. A clinically-relevant model for incorporating DP in clinical setting is presented. This model, based on investigations conducted by our group, delineates development of a depression prediction system and its integration in clinical setting to enhance depression diagnostics and inform the clinical decision making process. Benefits, challenges, and opportunities pertaining to clinical integration of DP of depression diagnostics are discussed from interdisciplinary perspectives.

Research on genetic and psychosocial influences suggests that a life course framework composed of a transactional etiology sheds light on the complex nature of polysubstance misuse. Further, given the extensive comorbidity with mental illness and behavioral dysregulation, viewing polysubstance misuse as asymmetrical in the population is helpful for guiding broad decision-making around prevention and policy.

AB  - We review the dynamic patterns of cell behaviours in the marginal zone of amphibians with a focus on how the progressive nature and the geometry of these behaviours drive blastopore closure. Mediolateral cell intercalation behaviour and epithelial-mesenchymal transition are used in different combinations in several species of amphibian to generate a conserved pattern of circumblastoporal hoop stresses. Although these cell behaviours are quite different and involve different germ layers and tissue organization, they are expressed in similar patterns. They are expressed progressively along presumptive lateral-medial and anterior-posterior axes of the body plan in highly ordered geometries of functional significance in the context of the biomechanics of blastopore closure, thereby accounting for the production of similar patterns of circumblastoporal forces. It is not the nature of the cell behaviour alone, but the context, the biomechanical connectivity and spatial and temporal pattern of its expression that determine specificity of morphogenic output during gastrulation and blastopore closure. Understanding the patterning of these dynamic features of cell behaviour is important and will require analysis of signalling at much greater spatial and temporal resolution than that has been typical in the analysis of patterning tissue differentiation.

AB  - The ancient Greek philosophers took a highly cognitive view of the emotions in general, and of love (philia) in particular. At the same time, they recognized that some kinds of attraction operated on the level of perception, and were not fully cognitive in nature: attraction or affection of this sort (called natural philia) is found in animals, which lack reason in the full sense of the word (as the Greeks understood it) as well as in human beings, whereas the emotion of love in the full sense of the term was regarded as being specific to human beings. In addition to philia (in both senses), the Greeks employed the term eros to identify the sentiment erotic passion or "falling in love." The relationship between philia and eros, and in particular the connection of the latter term with cognition, has not been fully explored. In this paper, it is argued that eros too entailed cognition, in the sense that it involved belief and not just perception, but that, unlike philia, it was conceived, at least in some quarters, as a consequence of false belief. It is thus a human sentiment, and does not pertain to animals (though of course they can experience sexual attraction). False beliefs give rise to a mistaken sense of what human nature requires, and this in turn is responsible for the obsessive character of erotic passion.

AB  - Violence against psychiatric staff seems to be on the increase. Such abuse can lead to mental health consequences for the staff and a reluctance to be closely involved with patients. Few Swedish investigations have examined violence against mental nurses and psychiatrists, or undertaken comparative studies between them. In this study we examined the extent, nature and determinants (i.e. risk factors) of violence against psychiatric nurses (n = 731) and psychiatrists (n = 320) working in the eight health care districts of Stockholm. These caregivers were assessed cross-sectionally by means of a questionnaire covering various areas (e.g. violence and work environment). The majority of the participants (85%) reported having been exposed to violence during their careers, with 57% being victimized in the past 12 months. Physical violence was common, and factors such as negative attitudes to work and diminished sense of autonomy were associated with an increased vulnerability to violence. Nurses and Psychiatrists did not differ in violence variables. In spite of the weaknesses of the design (cross-sectional self-selecting sample), this study corroborates previous findings and identifies personal factors associated with violence that have received little attention in the literature (e.g. lack of respect for the organization of care).

AB  - This paper presents a review of past and current research on the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (AS) in children. It is suggested that the widely used criteria for diagnosing AS in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV are insufficient and invalid for a reliable diagnosis of AS. In addition, when these diagnostic criteria are applied, there is the potential bias of receiving a diagnosis towards the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Through a critical review of 69 research studies carried out between 1981 and 2010, this paper shows that six possible criteria for diagnosing AS (specifically, the age at which signs and symptoms related to autism become apparent, language and social communication abilities, intellectual abilities, motor or movement skills, repetitive patterns of behaviour and the nature of social interaction) overlap with the criteria for diagnosing autism. However, there is a possibility that some finer differences exist in the nature of social interaction, motor skills and speech patterns between groups with a diagnosis of AS and autism. These findings are proposed to be of relevance for designing intervention studies aimed at the treatment of specific symptoms in people with an autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - Study objective: To evaluate trials of parenting programmes, regarding their use of intention to treat (ITT).
   Design: Individual trials included in two relevant Cochrane systematic reviews were scrutinised by two independent reviewers. Data on country of origin, target audience, trial type, treatment violations, use of ITT, and the management of missing data were extracted.
   Main results: Thirty trial reports were reviewed. Three reported the use of an ITT approach to data analysis. Nineteen reported losing subjects to follow up although the implications of this were rarely considered. Insufficient detail in reports meant it was difficult to identify study drop outs, the nature of treatment violations, and those failing to provide outcome assessments. In two trials, study drop outs were considered as additional control groups, violating the basic principle of ITT.
   Conclusions: It is recommended that future trial reports adhere to CONSORT guidelines. In particular ITT should be used for the main analyses, with strategies for managing treatment violations and handling missing data being reported a priori. Those conducting trials need to acknowledge the social nature of these programmes can sometimes result in erratic parent attendance and participation, which would only increase the chances of missing data. The use of approaches that can limit the proportion of missing data is therefore recommended.

AB  - Ageing workers can be found in almost ail occupations. Assessment of fitness to work in these workers is important, as it aims to match their functional capacity (which is reduced compared to younger workers), to the demands of their work (which may remain the same as that for younger workers). This outcome of assessment is influenced by the interaction between functional capacity, state of health, the nature of work. and possibilities for work accommodation. The assessment of functional capacity should include physical, mental and social capacity, as well as assessment of any disability. In addition to clinical or laboratory measurements, several authors have suggested the use of a 'work ability index' for specific occupations as a practical means of selecting the appropriate worker for the job. This index can also be used for monitoring functional capacity. In addition, as for any fitness to work assessment, a good understanding of the nature of the work and the work environment is required, and possibilities for work accommodations considered. While changes in the work environment and working conditions can be made to suit the functional capacity of the ageing worker, the maintenance of functional capacity is another important issue. There is a place for a greater role for disease screening and health promotion for such workers.

AB  - Modern readers who investigate religious theories and practices are exposed to diverse truth claims and worldviews. Such claims are often conflicting and subject the readers to various misconceptions and misguidance. In Buddhism, the Buddha is said to have awakened to the true nature of existence and attained final liberation from suffering, referred to as "enlightenment." How was he able to convince his disciples of his self-claimed enlightenment? Can his reasoning be applied to modern readers, who are well-educated, but overloaded with the incessant proliferation of digital information? The Buddha, specifically in the Kalama Sutta, presents empirically testable guidelines, termed the "Ten Criteria," which were formulated as an integrated interplay of reasoning and morality. This essay examines the Buddha's strategy, which is empirical and pragmatic in nature and embraces the fundamental principles of modern science. We contend that his proposed methodology is verifiably evocative of a moral discipline, while presenting a pedagogical approach to the teacher-student dynamic. Serving as a reference point, this view may help modern readers in differentiating the right truth from the biased post-truths, which appeal to emotion and personal belief.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and synthesize research results focusing on the work environment of employees with an immigrant background in Sweden. We focus on the main conditions identified in the working environment of immigrant employees and how these conditions may affect their health and well-being. The concept of "minority stress" and the attachment theory are used to understand and interpret the findings. We systematically searched for literature published between the years of 1990 and 2020 in four databases, Web of Science, PubMed, SocIndex, and Academic Search Elite. We started the selection process by reading title and abstracts, then proceeded to read a selection of full-text studies and eliminated those that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. We did a quality assessment on the full-text studies based on the MMAT-tool, and then performed a narrative synthesis of the results. The results show that immigrants experience several stressors in their work environment, including physical, psychological, and social risks. These risks are, among other things, associated with the nature of the jobs that immigrants are overrepresented in, with minority-related stressors such as discrimination, harassment, and threats on the basis of ethnic background, and with the lack of social support from managers and colleagues. Results also highlight beneficial factors in the immigrants' working environment and show the importance of a supportive, inclusive, and empowering management. Our main conclusion is that Swedish workplaces need to introduce more active measures to raise awareness of and combat workplace discrimination, work harder to promote inclusion at the workplace, and eliminate physical, psychological, and social health hazards specific to immigrant employees. The leadership and management have an important role to play here, as does the employees' trade unions and its special functions.

AB  - Recently, PM2.5 (atmospheric fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) have received so much attention that the observations, source appointment and countermeasures of it have been widely studied due to its harmful impacts on visibility, mood (mental health), physical health, traffic safety, construction, economy and nature, as well as its complex interaction with climate. A review on the PM2.5 related research is necessary. We start with summary of chemical composition and characteristics of PM2.5 that contains both macro and micro observation results and analysis, wherein the temporal variability of concentrations of PM2.5 and major components in many recent reports is embraced. This is closely followed by an overview of source appointment, including the composition and sources of PM2.5 in different countries in the six inhabitable continents based on the best available results. Besides summarizing PM2.5 pollution countermeasures by policy, planning, technology and ideology, the World Air Day is proposed to be established to inspire and promote the crucial social action in energy-saving and emission-reduction. Some updated knowledge of the important topics (such as formation and evolution mechanisms of hazes, secondary aerosols, aerosol mass spectrometer, organic tracers, radiocarbon, emissions, solutions for air pollution problems, etc.) is also included in the present review by logically synthesizing the studies. In addition, the key research challenges and future directions are put forward. Despite our efforts, our understanding of the recent reported observations, source identifications and countermeasures of PM2.5 is limited, and subsequent efforts both of the authors and readers are needed.

AB  - Neuroplasticity may be defined as the ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to respond to changes in the internal and external environment and it is well established that some stimuli have the ability to facilitate or impair neuroplasticity depending on the pre-existing milieu. A classic example of a stimulus that can both facilitate and impair neuroplasticity is stress. Indeed, the ability of CNS to respond to acute stress is often dependent upon the prior stress history of the individual. While responses to acute stress are often viewed as adaptive in nature, stress reactivity in subjects with prior chronic stress experiences are often linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. In rodent studies, chronic stress exposure produces structural and functional alterations in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex that are consistent across different types of stress paradigms. Conversely, the amygdala appears to exhibit differential structural and functional responses to stress that are dependent on a variety of factors, including the type of stressor performed and the duration of the stress paradigm. This is most evident in output measures including morphological analysis of amygdala neurons, measurement of glutamatergic tone in amygdalar subdivisions and the analysis of amygdala-centric behaviors. Accordingly, this review will provide an overview of the effects of stress on the structural and functional plasticity of the rodent amygdala, especially in relation to the differential effects of repeated or chronic stress paradigms on dendritic architecture, neurochemistry of the glutamatergic system and behavior.

AB  - Objective: A sense of belonging - the subjective feeling of deep connection with social groups, physical places, and individual and collective experiences - is a fundamental human need that predicts numerous mental, physical, social, economic, and behavioural outcomes. However, varying perspectives on how belonging should be conceptualised, assessed, and cultivated has hampered much-needed progress on this timely and important topic. To address these critical issues, we conducted a narrative review that summarizes existing perspectives on belonging, describes a new integrative framework for understanding and studying belonging, and identifies several key avenues for future research and practice.
   Method: We searched relevant databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ClinicalTrials.gov, for articles describing belonging, instruments for assessing belonging, and interventions for increasing belonging.
   Results: By identifying the core components of belonging, we introduce a new integrative framework for understanding, assessing, and cultivating belonging that focuses on four interrelated components: competencies, opportunities, motivations, and perceptions.
   Conclusion: This integrative framework enhances our understanding of the basic nature and features of belonging, provides a foundation for future interdisciplinary research on belonging and belongingness, and highlights how a robust sense of belonging may be cultivated to improve human health and resilience for individuals and communities worldwide.
   What this topic adds:
   The review article draws together disparate perspectives on belonging and harnesses the strengths of this multitude of perspectives to help advance the field.
   The paper provides a framework that can help inform researchers, practitioners, and individuals seeking to increase a sense of belonging in themselves and in the organizations and groups in which they work and live.
   We posit that competencies, opportunities, motivations, and perceptions are central elements in strategies that can be used to increase our individual and collective sense of belonging for the betterment of society.

AB  - Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an abundant neurotrophin in the adult brain. Serum BDNF levels might be used as a proxy for its central expression. Considering conflicting reports, we aimed to answer "How do serum/CSF levels of BDNF change in patients with PD?".
   Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases including 12 eligible studies. Five studies compared BDNF in serum of PD patients versus healthy controls (HC) and 3 studies provided BDNF levels in sera of non-depressed and depressed PD patients (NDPD and DPD). Review Manager and Software version 3.0 were used for meta-analysis and meta-regressions. Mean difference (MD) was used for measurement of effect size.
   Results: PD patients had reduced serum BDNF levels compared to HC (MD = -2.99 ng/mL). Serum BDNF was highest in DPD patients compared to HC (MD = -4.83 ng/mL), with no difference between DPD and NDPD patients in serum BDNF levels. Among co-variates that were eligible for meta-regression, age, sex, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) motor stage had significant positive associations with the effect size in the difference of serum BDNF between patients and HC.
   Conclusions: PD patients had reduced serum BDNF levels compared to HC, regardless of presence of co-morbid depression. PD is at least equally effective in reducing serum BDNF levels as depression. Motor progression predicts serum BDNF downregulation in PD. Acute exercise improves motor function and depressive symptoms in PD probably via BDNF upregulation. The paradoxical rise in serum BDNF in advance PD is probably compensatory in nature.

AB  - Placebo is an intervention with no therapeutic effect that is used as a control in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Placebo effects and responses can produce a beneficial effect that cannot be attributed to the properties of the intervention itself, since it is usually inactive, and should, therefore, be due to the patient's expectations about treatment (placebo effects), or confounding factors such as natural history, co-interventions, biases, among other co-factors (placebo responses). However, adverse events (AEs) may occur when using a placebo intervention, a phenomenon that is called nocebo. Like placebo, the nocebo effect is a cognitive and idiosyncratic phenomenon with specific biological bases, controlled by distinctive neurotransmitters within mapped brain areas most likely located within the network of the limbic system.
   Nocebo responses has been found to be very prevalent in various neurological conditions, in particular, in many brain disorders including headache, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and motor neuron disease. Pooled AE rates in the placebo groups (nocebo AE rates) vary from 25% in the symptomatic treatment for multiple sclerosis RCTs to almost 80% in motor neuron disease RCTs. Pooled dropout rates because of AEs in the placebo groups (i.e., nocebo dropout rates) vary from 2% in multiple sclerosis RCTs to almost 10% in PD RCTs. Across all brain disorders, the nature of AEs reported in the placebo-treated subjects mirrors those reported by active drug-treated subjects, suggesting that awareness of drug side-effect profiles might have influenced patient expectations and, thus, nocebo responses.
   Unexplored brain diseases where nocebo should be studied further include mental disorders (i.e., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), vascular disorders (i.e., acute ischemic stroke, vascular dementia), degenerative disorders (i.e., frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia) and other systemic atrophies of the brain (i.e., hereditary ataxias).

AB  - While there is evidence of clinical improvement of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with treatment, its neural underpinnings are insufficiently clear. Moreover, it is unknown whether similar neurophysiological changes occur in PTSD specifically after child abuse, given its enduring nature and the developmental vulnerability of the brain during childhood.
   We systematically reviewed PTSD treatment effect studies on structural and functional brain changes from PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PILOTS and the Cochrane Library. We included studies on adults with (partial) PTSD in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) or pre-post designs (excluding case studies) on pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Risk of bias was evaluated independently by two raters. Brain coordinates and effect sizes were standardized for comparability.
   We included 15 studies (6 RCTs, 9 pre-post), four of which were on child abuse. Results showed that pharmacotherapy improved structural abnormalities (i.e., increased hippocampus volume) in both adult-trauma and child abuse related PTSD (3 pre-post studies). Functional changes were found to distinguish between groups. Adult-trauma PTSD patients showed decreased amygdala and increased dorsolateral prefrontal activations post-treatment (4 RCTs, 5 pre-post studies). In one RCT, child abuse patients showed no changes in the amygdala, but decreased dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate and insula activation post-treatment.
   In conclusion, pharmacotherapy may reduce structural abnormalities in PTSD, while psychotherapy may decrease amygdala activity and increase prefrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate and hippocampus activations, that may relate to extinction learning and re-appraisal. There is some evidence for a distinct activation pattern in child abuse patients, which clearly awaits further empirical testing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundPathways to care are actions and strategies employed by individuals in order to get help for health-related distress and the related processes of care providers. On several systematic reviews regarding pathways to mental health care (PMHC), studies regarding South American countries were not present. This review synthesizes qualitative and quantitative research about PMHC in Brazil.MethodsLILACS, MEDLINE and SCIELO databases were searched for papers regarding PMHC in Brazil. The results were organized in pathway stages, based on Goldberg and Huxley's model of Levels and Filters' and on Kleinman's framework of Popular, Folk and Professional health sectors'. Analysis also considered the changes in national mental health policy over time.Results25 papers were found, with data ranging from 1989 to 2013. Complex social networks were involved in the initial recognition of MH issues. The preferred points of first contact also varied with the nature and severity of problems. A high proportion of patients is treated in specialized services, including mild cases. There is limited capacity of primary care professionals to identify and treat MH problems, with some improvement from collaborative care in the more recent years. The model for crisis management and acute care remains unclear: scarce evidence was found over the different arrangements used, mostly stressing lack of integration between emergency, hospital and community services and fragile continuity of care.ConclusionsThe performance of primary care and the regulation of acute demands, especially crisis management, are the most critical aspects on PMHC. Although primary care performance seems to be improving, the balanced provision and integration between services for adequate acute and long-term care is yet to be achieved.

AB  - Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious condition with debilitating consequences for the mother, offspring, and the whole family. The scope of negative outcomes of PPD highlights the need to specify effective diagnostics and treatment which might differ from major depressive disorder (MDD). In order to improve our clinical care, we need to better understand the underlying neuropathological mechanisms of PPD. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of published neuroimaging studies assessing functional, structural, and metabolic correlates of PPD. Methods: Relevant papers were identified using a search code for English-written studies in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases published by March 2022. Included were studies with structural magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, both resting-state and task-related, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or positron emission tomography. The findings were analyzed to assess signatures in PPD-diagnosed women compared to healthy controls. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022313794). Results: The total of 3,368 references were initially identified. After the removal of duplicates and non-applicable papers, the search yielded 74 full-text studies assessed for eligibility. Of them, 26 met the inclusion criteria and their findings were analyzed and synthesized. The results showed consistent functional, structural, and metabolic changes in the default mode network and the salient network in women with PPD. During emotion-related tasks, PPD was associated with changes in the corticolimbic system activity, especially the amygdala. Discussion: This review offers a comprehensive summary of neuroimaging signatures in PPD-diagnosed women. It indicates the brain regions and networks which show functional, structural, and metabolic changes. Our findings offer better understanding of the nature of PPD, which clearly copies some features of MDD, while differs in others.

AB  - Background: Previous research indicates that the physical environment of healthcare facilities plays an important role in the health, well-being, and recovery outcomes of patients. However, prior works on mental healthcare facilities have incorporated physical environment effects from general healthcare settings and patient groups, which cannot be readily transferred to mental healthcare settings or its patients. There appears to be a specific need for evidence synthesis of physical environmental effects in mental healthcare settings by psychopathology.Purpose: This review evaluates the state (in terms of extent, nature and quality) of the current empirical evidence of physical environmental on mental health, well-being, and recovery outcomes in mental healthcare inpatients by psychopathology.Method: A systematic review (PRISMA guidelines) was performed of studies published in English, German, Dutch, Swedish, and Spanish, of all available years until September 2020, searched in Cochrane, Ovid Index, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science and identified through extensive hand-picking. Inclusion criteria were: Adult patients being treated for mental ill-health (common mental health and mood disorders, Cochrane frame); inpatient mental health care facilities; specifications of the physical and socio-physical environment (e.g., design features, ambient conditions, privacy); all types of empirical study designs. Quality assessment and data synthesis were undertaken.Results: The search retrieved 1,068 titles of which 26 met the inclusion criteria. Findings suggest that there is only indicative evidence of the impact of the physical healthcare environment on patients' mental health, well-being, and recovery outcomes. There is significant lack of pathology-specific evidence. Methodological shortcomings and empirical scarcity account for the poor evidence.Conclusion: This review highlights the need for more research using advanced study designs.

AB  - The recognition and incorporation of evidence-based neuroscientific concepts into creative arts therapeutic knowledge and practice seem valuable and advantageous for the purpose of integration and professional development. Moreover, exhilarating insights from the field of neuroscience coincide with the nature, conceptualization, goals, and methods of Creative Arts Therapies (CATs), enabling comprehensive understandings of the clinical landscape, from a translational perspective. This paper contextualizes and discusses dynamic brain functions that have been suggested to lie at the heart of intra- and inter-personal processes. Touching upon fundamental aspects of the self and self-other interaction, the state-of-the-art neuroscientific-informed views will shed light on mechanisms of the embodied, predictive and relational brain. The conceptual analysis introduces and interweaves the following contemporary perspectives of brain function: firstly, the grounding of mental activity in the lived, bodily experience will be delineated; secondly, the enactive account of internal models, or generative predictive representations, shaped by experience, will be defined and extensively deliberated; and thirdly, the interpersonal simulation and synchronization mechanisms that support empathy and mentalization will be thoroughly considered. Throughout the paper, the cross-talks between the brain and the body, within the brain through functionally connected neural networks and in the context of agent-environment dynamics, will be addressed. These communicative patterns will be elaborated on to unfold psychophysiological linkage, as well as psychopathological shifts, concluding with the neuroplastic change associated with the formulation of CATs. The manuscript suggests an integrative view of the brain-body-mind in contexts relevant to the therapeutic potential of the expressive creative arts and the main avenues by which neuroscience may ground, enlighten and enrich the clinical psychotherapeutic practice.

AB  - Studies of amygdala functioning have occupied a significant place in the history of understanding how the brain controls behavior and cognition. Early work on the amygdala placed this small structure as a key component in the regulation of emotion and affective behavior. Over time, our understanding of its role in brain processes has expanded, as we have uncovered amygdala influences on memory, reward behavior, and overall functioning in many other brain regions. Studies have indicated that the amygdala has widespread connections with a variety of brain structures, from the prefrontal cortex to regions of the brainstem, that explain its powerful influence on other parts of the brain and behaviors mediated by those regions. Thus, many optogenetic studies have focused on harnessing the powers of this technique to elucidate the functioning of the amygdala in relation to motivation, fear, and memory as well as to determine how the amygdala regulates activity in other structures. For example, studies using optogenetics have examined how specific circuits within amygdala nuclei regulate anxiety. Other work has provided insight into how the basolateral and central amygdala nuclei regulate memory processing underlying aversive learning. Many experiments have taken advantage of optogenetics' ability to target either genetically distinct subpopulations of neurons or the specific projections from the amygdala to other brain regions. Findings from such studies have provided evidence that particular patterns of activity in basolateral amygdala (BLA) glutamatergic neurons are related to memory consolidation processes, while other work has indicated the critical nature of amygdala inputs to the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens (NA) in regulating behavior dependent on those downstream structures. This review will examine the recent discoveries on amygdala functioning made through experiments using optogenetics, placing these findings in the context of the major questions in the field.

AB  - The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a lipid-based neurotransmitter complex that plays crucial roles in the neural control of learning and memory. The current model of eCB-mediated retrograde signaling is that eCBs released from postsynaptic elements travel retrogradely to presynaptic axon terminals, where they activate cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB(1)Rs) and ultimately decrease neurotransmitter release on a short- or long-term scale. An increasing body of evidence has enlarged this view and shows that eCBs, besides depressing synaptic transmission, are also able to increase neurotransmitter release at multiple synapses of the brain. This indicates that eCBs act as bidirectional regulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Recently, studies unveiled links between the expression of eCB-mediated long-term potentiation (eCB-LTP) and learning, and between its dysregulation and several pathologies. In this review article, we first distinguish the various forms of eCB-LTP based on their mechanisms, resulting from homosynaptically or heterosynaptically-mediated processes. Next, we consider the neuromodulation of eCB-LTP, its behavioral impact on learning and memory, and finally, eCB-LTP disruptions in various pathologies and its potential as a therapeutic target in disorders such as stress coping, addiction, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and pain. Cannabis is gaining popularity as a recreational substance as well as a medicine, and multiple eCB-based drugs are under development. In this context, it is critical to understand eCB-mediated signaling in its multi-faceted complexity. Indeed, the bidirectional nature of eCB-based neuromodulation may offer an important key to interpret the functions of the eCB system and how it is impacted by cannabis and other drugs.

AB  - Humans are highly social beings, yet people with social anhedonia experience reduced interest in or reward from social situations. Social anhedonia is a key facet of schizotypal personality, an important symptom of schizophrenia, and increasingly recognized as an important feature in a range of other psychological disorders. However, to date, there has been little examination of the similarities and differences in social anhedonia across diagnostic borders. Here, our goal was to conduct a selective review of social anhedonia in different psychological and life course contexts, including the psychosis continuum, depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, and autism spectrum disorders, along with developmental and neurobiological factors. Current evidence suggests that the nature and expression of social anhedonia vary across psychological disorders with some groups showing deficient learning about, enjoyment from, and anticipation of the pleasurable aspects of social interactions, while for others, some of these components appear to remain intact. However, study designs and methodologies are diverse, the roles of developmental and neurobiological factors are not routinely considered, and direct comparisons between diagnostic groups are rare-which prevents a more nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved. Future studies, parsing the wanting, liking, and learning components of social reward, will help to fill gaps in the current knowledge base. Consistent across disorders is diminished pleasure from social situations, subsequent withdrawal, and poorer social functioning in those who express social anhedonia. Nonetheless, feelings of loneliness often remain, which suggests the need for social connection is not entirely absent. Adolescence is a particularly important period of social and neural development and may provide a valuable window on the developmental origins of social anhedonia. Adaptive social functioning is key to recovery from mental health disorders; therefore, understanding the intricacies of social anhedonia will help to inform treatment and prevention strategies for a range of diagnostic categories.

AB  - Objective: Diet is increasingly recognized as a potentially modifiable factor influencing the onset and outcomes of psychiatric disorders. Whereas, previous research has shown long-term schizophrenia is associated with various nutritional deficiencies, this meta-analysis aimed to determine the prevalence and extent of nutritional deficits in first-episode psychosis (FEP). Method: A search of electronic databases conducted in July 2017 identified 28 eligible studies, examining blood levels of 6 vitamins and 10 minerals across 2612 individuals: 1221 individuals with FEP and 1391 control subjects. Meta-analyses compared nutrient levels in FEP to nonpsychiatric controls. Clinical correlates of nutritional status in patient samples were systematically reviewed. Results: Significantly lower blood levels of folate (N = 6, n = 827, g = -0.624, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.176 to -0.072, P = .027) and vitamin D (N = 7, n = 906, g = -1.055, 95% CI = -1.99 to -0.119, P = .027) were found in FEP compared to healthy controls. Synthesis of clinical correlates found both folate and vitamin D held significant inverse relationships with psychiatric symptoms in FEP. There was also limited evidence for serum level reductions of vitamin C (N = 2, n = 96, g = -2.207, 95% CI = -3.71 to -0.71, P = .004). No differences were found for other vitamins or minerals. Conclusions: Deficits in vitamin D and folate previously observed in long-term schizophrenia appear to exist from illness onset, and are associated with worse symptomology. Further research must examine the direction and nature of these relationships (ie, mediator, moderator, or marker) with clinical status in FEP. Future trials assessing efficacy of nutrient supplementation in FEP samples should consider targeting and stratifying for baseline deficiency.

AB  - Objective: To describe the theory and methodology of the multi-wave, prospective Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) study. The goal of MAVAN is to examine the pre-and postnatal influences, and their interaction, in determining individual differences in mental health.
   Method: MAVAN is a community-based, birth cohort study of pregnant Canadian mothers and their offspring. Dyads are assessed longitudinally, with multiple assessments of both mother and child in home and laboratory across the child's development. Study measures, including assessments of cognitive and emotional function, are described. The study uses a candidate gene approach to examine gene-environment interdependence in specific developmental outcomes. Finally, the study includes measures of both brain-based phenotypes and metabolism to explore comorbidities associated with child obesity. One of the unique features of the MAVAN protocol is the extensive measures of the mother-child interaction. The relation between these measures will be discussed.
   Results: Evidence from the MAVAN project shows interesting results about maternal care, families, and child outcomes. In our review, preliminary analyses showing the correlations between measures of maternal care are reported. As predicted, early evidence suggests that maternal care measures are positively correlated, over time.
   Conclusions: This review provides evidence for the feasibility and value of laboratory-based measures embedded within a longitudinal birth cohort study. Though retention of the samples has been a challenge of MAVAN, they are within a comparable range to other studies of this nature. Indeed, the trade-off of somewhat greater participant burden has allowed for a rich database. The results yielded from the MAVAN project will not only describe typical development but also possible targets for intervention. Understanding certain endophenotypes will shed light on the pathogenesis of various mental and physical disorders, as well as their interrelation.

KW  - Psychopathology
KW  - Psychosis
KW  - CAPGRAS-SYNDROME
AB  - Introduction: Delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS) are a group of psychopathological experiences occurring in psychosis, involving the misidentification of a person or place. DMS are often accompanied by hostility towards the object of delusional misidentification. This is of a particular concern in perinatal mental illness due to the potential disruption of the mother-infant bond, and risk of neglect, violence, or infanticide towards a misidentified child. This review aimed to collate all published cases of DMS in postpartum psychosis to further understand how these syndromes present in perinatal mental illness. Methods: In August 2021, an online database search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Embase to identify all publications reporting DMS in the perinatal period. Results: Nine papers were included in the review involving 8 case reports of Capgras syndrome and one case series involving 4 cases of Fregoli syndrome. Three cases identified organic pathology, which may have contributed to the presentation. The most common subject of misidentification was the patient's husband (n = 7), followed by their baby (n = 6), hospital staff (n = 4), other family members (n = 3), and self (n = 1). Five cases remark on the impact of perinatal illness on the maternal-infant bond, of which four result in the mother being unwilling to care for the infant as the result of their delusional beliefs. Conclusion: This is the first systematic review of the literature in this field. Although small in number, these cases reveal several important learning points including that DMS can occur with or without underlying organic disease. Active exploration of the nature of delusions in postpartum psychosis is required to mitigate the risk of harm to the infant and mother-infant bond. It may also uncover that these syndromes are more common in postpartum psychosis than previously realized. (C) 2022 The Author(s).Published by S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The structure of the brain and the nature of evolution suggest that, despite its uniqueness, language likely depends on brain systems that also subserve other functions. The declarative/procedural (DP) model claims that the mental lexicon of memorized word-specific knowledge depends on the largely temporal-lobe substrates of declarative memory, which underlies the storage and use of knowledge of facts and events. The mental grammar, which subserves the rule-governed combination of lexical items into complex representations, depends on a distinct neural system. This system, which is composed of a network of specific frontal, basal-ganglia, parietal and cerebellar structures, underlies procedural memory, which supports the learning and execution of motor and cognitive skills, especially those involving sequences. The functions of the two brain systems, together with their anatomical, physiological and biochemical substrates, lead to specific claims and predictions regarding their roles in language. These predictions are compared with those of other neurocognitive models of language. Empirical evidence is presented from neuroimaging studies of normal language processing, and from developmental and adult-onset disorders. It is argued that this evidence supports the DP model. It is additionally proposed that "language" disorders, such as specific language impairment and non-fluent and fluent aphasia, may be profitably viewed as impairments primarily affecting one or the other brain system. Overall, the data suggest a new neurocognitive framework for the study of lexicon and grammar. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Burnout is a widespread, multifactorial, and mainly psychological phenomenon. The pathogenesis of burnout is commonly described within the bio-psycho-social model of health and disease. Recent literature suggests that the phenomenon of burnout may be broader so that the three dimensions might not reflect the multifaceted and complex nature of the syndrome. Consequently, this review aims to identify the diversity of factors related to burnout, to define overarching categories based on these, and to clarify whether the bio-psycho-social model adequately describes the pathogenesis of burnout-holistically and sufficiently.
   Method: Five online databases (PubMed, PubPsych, PsychARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and Google Scholar) were systematically searched using defined search terms to identify relevant studies. The publication date was set between January 1981 and November 2020. Based on the selected literature, we identified factors related to burnout. We aggregated these factors into a comprehensible list and assigned them to overarching categories. Then, we assigned the factors to the dimensions of an extended model of health and disease.
   Results: We identified a total of 40 burnout-related factors and 10 overarching categories. Our results show that in addition to biological, psychological, and socio-environmental factors, various factors that can be assigned to a spiritual and work cultural dimension also play an important role in the onset of burnout.
   Conclusion: An extended bio-psycho-socio-spirito-cultural model is necessary to describe the pathogenesis of burnout. Therefore, future studies should also focus on spiritual and work cultural factors when investigating burnout. Furthermore, these factors should not be neglected in future developments of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention options.

AB  - Evidence suggests that psychopathology is associated with an advanced brain ageing process, typically mapped using machine learning models that predict an individual's age based on structural neuroimaging data. The brain predicted age difference (brain-PAD) captures the deviation of brain age from chronological age. Substantial heterogeneity between studies has introduced uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the brain-PAD in adult psychopathology. The present meta-analysis aimed to quantify structural MRI-based brain-PAD in adult psy-chotic and mood disorders, while addressing possible sources of heterogeneity related to diagnosis subtypes, segmentation method, age and sex. Clinical factors influencing brain ageing in axis 1 psychiatric disorders were systematically reviewed. Thirty-three studies were included for review. A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a brain-PAD of +3.12 (standard error = 0.49) years in psychotic disorders (n = 16 studies), +2.04 (0.10) years in bipolar disorder (n = 5), and +0.90 (0.20) years in major depression (n = 7). An exploratory meta-analysis found a brain-PAD of +1.57 (0.67) in first episode psychosis (n = 4), which was smaller than that observed in psychosis and schizophrenia (n = 10, +3.87 (0.61)). Patient mean age significantly explained heterogeneity in effect size estimates in psychotic disorders, but not mood disorders. The systematic review determined that clinical factors, such as higher symptom severity, may be associated with a larger brain-PAD in psychopathology. In conclusion, larger structural MRI-based brain-PAD was confirmed in adult psychopathology. Preliminary evidence was ob-tained that brain ageing is greater in those with prolonged duration of psychotic disorders. Accentuated brain ageing may underlie the cognitive difficulties experienced by some patients, and may be progressive in nature.

AB  - Between 1939 and 1997, there have been 59 volumes of Psychosomatic Medicine. Over this period there were 200 articles dealing with blood pressure. About 90% of these were concerned with high blood pressure. This article reviews all of these papers both from an historical perspective and critically. Although there has been a significant growth in the rate of articles published since 1939, there has always been a strong interest in the nature of hypertension particularly the roles of affects and emotions in the natural history of the disease. For example, volume 1, number 1 of the Journal includes a symposium on high blood pressure in which Franz Alexander stated his well-known hypothesis that the chronic inhibition of rage plays a causal role in the production of hypertension. In various forms, the notion that anger is an important mediator of hypertension has neither been proved nor abandoned. One major conclusion drawn from this review is that the current research on high blood pressure is drifting somewhat aimlessly. It has become preoccupied with demonstrations that various stimuli or situations (usually characterized as stresses) can acutely raise blood pressure. Despite this focus, neither the necessary nor the sufficient conditions for labeling a stimulus as stress has ever been agreed upon. Likewise, there have been many demonstrations of an iatrogenic effect on blood pressure, but neither the behavioral mechanisms underlying this effect nor the strategies for eliminating it have been explicated. Finally, this article identifies several areas where it would be useful to review and integrate current knowledge. Hopefully, such integrations could play a significant role in focusing and shaping future research and clinical practice.

AB  - As of July 20, 2021, Covid-19 has killed 4,086,000 people, infected at least 190,169,833 others, and devastated the world's economy. To slow the spread of the virus, numerous governments instituted "lockdown" policies and quarantines, limiting social interactions to the immediate household. The experience of isolation and uncertainty have contributed to increased fear, anxiety, and loneliness; with limited options of research-supported interventions. Although different in nature, the experiences of quarantine and lockdown have been likened to incarceration. Past research has found meditation and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) to be effective psychological treatments for prisoners and may therefore translate well into effective methods for the maintenance of psychological well-being for individuals quarantined during the pandemic. More recently, research investigating the effects of meditation and MBIs during the pandemic have demonstrated preliminary evidence for beneficial psychological improvements. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA), the current narrative review paper: 1) examines the parallels and differences between the experience of quarantine and imprisonment, 2) investigates the mechanisms through which meditation and mindfulness enact their effects, and 3) systematically reviews literature on the benefits of various types of meditation and MBIs for inmates and individuals in lockdown or quarantine. With this knowledge, the public can garner applicable insight into the potential use of meditation and MBIs for individuals forced to cope with pandemic lockdowns and quarantines. Two hundred and twenty one (221) articles were identified through Pubmed and Google Scholar, and 24 articles were ultimately included in the manuscript.

KW  - GAD
KW  - Psychotherapy
KW  - CBT

KW  - Psychoanalysis
KW  - Well-being therapy
AB  - Objective
   Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common and distressing condition, which typically has a persistent course and is often resistant to treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has long been considered the first-line psychotherapeutic option for GAD, but many patients, and especially the elderly, do not experience long-lasting benefits. The aim of this review is to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of CBT and other psychological interventions to guide the development of new approaches and encourage new controlled studies to improve clinical outcomes.
   Methods
   We conducted a computerized literature search through PubMed and Google Scholar using the term generalized anxiety disorder/GAD, both alone and in combinations with the terms psychological treatment, cognitive behavioural therapy/CBT, CBT Packages, new CBT approaches, third wave CBT, internet computer-based CBT, psychodynamic therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy, applied relaxation, AR and mindfulness. The identified articles were further reviewed to scan for additional suitable articles. The search took place between October 2011 and September 2012.
   Results
   Cognitive behavioural therapy has been the most studied psychological treatment and is recommended as a first choice intervention for GAD. Applied relaxation has demonstrated similar effectiveness as CBT. Novel approaches and adaptations of GAD, such as well-being therapy, have been developed to provide a wider range of therapeutic choices: although preliminary results are encouraging, further studies are needed to establish their efficacy and relative value when compared to more conventional CBT.
   Conclusions
   CBT, applied relaxation, psychodynamic approaches, internetcomputer-based CBT, mindfulness techniques, interpersonal emotional processing therapy metacognitive model and wellbeing therapy have all shown beneficial effects in treating GAD. The current "gold standard" in treating GAD remains CBT, but given the nature of the disorder, clinicians should be aware of the other therapeutic options when making treatment decisions in accordance with patients' needs.

AB  - Objective: To establish specific criteria by which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) discontinuation syndrome may be identified. Data sources: MEDLINE and PSYCHLIT databases were searched for case reports published from 1986 to 1997 inclusive, and references of relevant articles were also searched. Study selection: Forty-six case reports of symptoms following the discontinuation of fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine or sertraline were selected. Three studies of SSRI discontinuation were also reviewed. Data extraction: Demographic and treatment information, as well as the timing, duration, number, nature and frequency of dicontinuation symptoms. Data synthesis: Paroxetine was most frequently implicated. The drug had been tapered in half of the cases. In some cases, symptom onset began during taper, whereas, in most cases, symptoms began within 1 to 3 days of drug discontinuation. Fifty-three different symptoms were reported, with dizziness being the most common. Other common symptoms were nausea or emesis, fatigue, headache, gait instability and insomnia. Shock-like sensations, paresthesia and visual disturbances were the most rare. Without intervention, symptoms persisted for more than a week in half of the cases. In cases in which the SSRI was restarted, symptoms resolved within 72 hours. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms recurred when the same SSRI was again discontinued. Conclusions: Findings were used to construct diagnostic criteria for the SSRI discontinuation syndrome. These criteria are 2 or more of the following symptoms developing within 1 to 7 days of discontinuation or reduction in dosage of an SSRI after at least 1 month's use, when these symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment and are not due to a general medical condition or recurrence of a mental disorder: dizziness, light-headedness, vertigo or feeling faint; shock-like sensations or paresthesia; anxiety; diarrhea; fatigue; gait instability; headache; insomnia; irritability; nausea or emesis; tremor; and visual disturbances.

AB  - Background
   Major depressive disorder is a common, recurrent, disabling and costly disorder that is often severe and/or chronic, and for which non-remission on guideline concordant first-line antidepressant treatment is the norm. A sizeable percentage of patients diagnosed with MDD do not achieve full remission after receiving antidepressant treatment. How to understand or approach these 'refractory', 'TRD' or 'difficult to treat' patients need to be revisited. Treatment resistant depression (TRD) has been described elsewhere as failure to respond to adequate treatment by two different antidepressants. This definition is problematic as it suggests that TRD is a subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD), inferring a boundary between TRD and depression that is not treatment resistant. However, there is scant evidence to suggest that a discrete TRD entity exists as a distinct subtype of MDD, which itself is not a discrete or homogeneous entity. Similarly, the boundary between TRD and other forms of depression is predicated at least in part on regulatory and research requirements rather than biological evidence or clinical utility.
   Aim
   This paper aims to investigate the notion of treatment failure in order to understand (i) what is TRD in the context of a broader formulation based on the understanding of depression, (ii) what factors make an individual patient difficult to treat, and (iii) what is the appropriate and individualised treatment strategy, predicated on an individual with refractory forms of depression?
   Method
   Expert contributors to this paper were sought internationally by contacting representatives of key professional societies in the treatment of MDD - World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry, Australasian Society for Bipolar and Depressive Disorders, International Society for Affective Disorders, Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologium and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments. The manuscript was prepared through iterative editing.
   Outcomes
   The concept of TRD as a discrete subtype of MDD, defined by failure to respond to pharmacotherapy, is not supported by evidence. Between 15 and 30% of depressive episodes fail to respond to adequate trials of 2 antidepressants, and 68% of individuals do not achieve remission from depression after a first-line course of antidepressant treatment. Failure to respond to antidepressant treatment, somatic therapies or psychotherapies may often reflect other factors including; biological resistance, diagnostic error, limitations of current therapies, psychosocial variables, a past history of exposure to childhood maltreatment or abuse, job satisfaction, personality disorders, co-morbid mental and physical disorders, substance use or non-adherence to treatment. Only a subset of patients not responding to antidepressant treatment can be explained through pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics mechanisms. We propose that non remitting MDD should be personalised, and propose a strategy of 'deconstructing depression'. By this approach, the clinician considers which factors contribute to making this individual both depressed and 'resistant' to previous therapeutic approaches. Clinical formulation is required to understand the nature of the depression.
   Many predictors of response are not biological, and reflect a confluence of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors, which may influence the illness in a particular individual. After deconstructing depression at a personalised level, a personalised treatment plan can be constructed. The treatment plan needs to address the factors that have contributed to the individual's hard to treat depression. In addition, an individual with a history of illness may have a lot of accumulated life issues due to consequences of their illness, and these should be addressed in a recovery plan.
   Limitations
   A 'deconstructing depression' qualitative rubric does not easily provide clear inclusion and exclusion criteria for researchers wanting to investigate TRD.
   Conclusions
   MDD is a polymorphic disorder and many individuals who fail to respond to standard pharmacotherapy and are considered hard to treat. These patients are best served by personalised approaches that deconstruct the factors that have contributed to the patient's depression and implementing a treatment plan that adequately addresses these factors. The existence of TRD as a discrete and distinct subtype of MDD, defined by two treatment failures, is not supported by evidence.

Unlike other normal bodily processes, menstruation is linked with religious and cultural meanings that can affect the perceptions of young girls as well as the ways in which the adults in the communities around them respond to their needs.
   Objectives: This review aims to answer the following questions: (1) how knowledgeable are adolescent girls in low-and middle-income countries about menstruation and how prepared are they for reaching menarche, (2) who are their sources of information regarding menstruation, (3) how well do the adults around them respond to their information needs, (4) what negative health and social effects do adolescents experience as a result of menstruation, and (5) how do adolescents respond when they experience these negative effects and what practices do they develop as a result?
   Methods: Using a structured search strategy, articles that investigate young girls' preparedness for menarche, knowledge of menstruation and practices surrounding menstrual hygiene in LMIC were identified. A total of 81 studies published in peer-reviewed journals between the years 2000 and 2015 that describe the experiences of adolescent girls from 25 different countries were included.
   Results: Adolescent girls in LMIC are often uninformed and unprepared for menarche. Information is primarily obtained from mothers and other female family members who are not necessarily well equipped to fill gaps in girls' knowledge. Exclusion and shame lead to misconceptions and unhygienic practices during menstruation. Rather than seek medical consultation, girls tend to miss school, self-medicate and refrain from social interaction. Also problematic is that relatives and teachers are often not prepared to respond to the needs of girls.
   Conclusion: LMIC must recognize that lack of preparation, knowledge and poor practices surrounding menstruation are key impediments not only to girls' education, but also to self-confidence and personal development. In addition to investment in private latrines with clean water for girls in both schools and communities, countries must consider how to improve the provision of knowledge and understanding and how to better respond to the needs of adolescent girls.

AB  - Present technologies for wastewater treatment do not sufficiently address the increasing pollution situation of receiving water bodies, especially with the growing use of personal care products and pharmaceuticals (PPCP) in the private household and health sector. The relevance of addressing this problem of organic pollutants was taken into account by the Directive 2013/39/EU that introduced (i) the quality evaluation of aquatic compartments, (ii) the polluter pays principle, (iii) the need for innovative and affordable wastewater treatment technologies, and (iv) the identification of pollution causes including a list of principal compounds to be monitored. In addition, a watch list of 10 other substances was recently defined by Decision 2015/495 on March 20, 2015. This list contains, among several recalcitrant chemicals, the painkiller diclofenac and the hormones 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol. Although some modern approaches for their removal exist, such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), retrofitting most wastewater treatment plants with AOPs will not be acceptable as consistent investment at reasonable operational cost. Additionally, by-product and transformation product formation has to be considered. The same is true for membrane-based technologies (nanofiltration, reversed osmosis) despite of the incredible progress that has been made during recent years, because these systems lead to higher operation costs (mainly due to higher energy consumption) so that the majority of communities will not easily accept them. Advanced technologies in wastewater treatment like membrane bioreactors (MBR) that integrate biological degradation of organic matter with membrane filtration have proven a more complete elimination of emerging pollutants in a rather cost- and labor-intensive technology. Still, most of the presently applied methods are incapable of removing critical compounds completely. In this opinion paper, the state of the art of European WWTPs is reflected, and capacities of single methods are described. Furthermore, the need for analytical standards, risk assessment, and economic planning is stressed. The survey results in the conclusion that combinations of different conventional and advanced technologies including biological and plant-based strategies seem to be most promising to solve the burning problem of polluting our environment with hazardous emerging xenobiotics.

AB  - By linking the past with the future, our memories define our sense of identity. Because human memory engages the conscious realm, its examination has historically been approached from language and introspection and proceeded largely along separate parallel paths in humans and other animals. Here, we first highlight the achievements and limitations of this mind-based approach and make the case for a new brain-based understanding of declarative memory with a focus on hippocampal physiology. Next, we discuss the interleaved nature and common physiological mechanisms of navigation in real and mental spacetime. We suggest that a distinguishing feature of memory types is whether they subserve actions for single or multiple uses. Finally, in contrast to the persisting view of the mind as a highly plastic blank slate ready for the world to make its imprint, we hypothesize that neuronal networks are endowed with a reservoir of neural trajectories, and the challenge faced by the brain is how to select and match preexisting neuronal trajectories with events in the world.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents a frequent consequence of a variety of extreme psychological stressors. Lists of empirically supported treatments for PTSD usually include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), but nonresponse and dropout rates in these treatments often are high. We review the treatment dropout and nonresponse rates in 55 studies of empirically supported treatments for PTSD, review the literature for predictors of dropout and nonresponse, discuss methodological inconsistencies in the literature that make comparisons across studies difficult, and outline future directions for research. Dropout rates ranged widely and may have depended, at least in part, on the nature of the study population. It was not uncommon to find nonresponse rates as high as 50%. Standard methods of reporting dropout and nonresponse rates are needed for reporting outcomes. We suggest guidelines for collecting data to help identify characteristics and predictors of dropouts and nonresponders.

AB  - Persistent and vexing health disadvantages accrue to African Americans despite decades of work to erase the effects of race discrimination in this country. Participating in these efforts, psychologists and other social scientists have hypothesized that African Americans' continuing experiences with racism and discrimination may lie at the root of the many well-documented race-based physical health disparities that affect this population. With newly emerging methodologies in both measurement of contextual factors and functional neuroscience, an opportunity now,exists to cleave together a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which discrimination has harmful effects on health. In this article; we review emerging work that locates the cause of race-based health disparities in the external effects of the contextual social space on the internal world of brain functioning and physiologic response. These approaches reflect the growing interdisciplinary nature of psychology in general, and the field of race relations in particular.

AB  - Trinucleotide, or triplet, repeats consist of 3 nucleotides consecutively repeated (eg, CCG CCG CCG CCG CCG) within a region of DNA, a not uncommon motif in the genome of humans and other species. In 1991, a new type of genetic mutation was discovered, known as a dynamic or expansion mutation, in which the number of triplets in a repeat increases and the length becomes unstable. During the past decade, nearly 20 diseases-including Huntington disease, 2 forms of the fragile X syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy-caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions have been identified. The unstable nature of the expanded repeat. leads to remarkable patterns of inheritance in these diseases, distinctly at odds with traditional notions of mendelian genetics. We review the clinical and genetic features of these disorders, with a particular emphasis on their psychiatric manifestations, We also critically examine the hypothesis that expansion mutations may have an etiologic role in psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism.

AB  - Accumulating evidence from the field of neuroscience indicates a crucial role for epigenetic regulation of gene expression in development and aging of nervous system and suggests that aberrations in the epigenetic machinery are involved in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Epidemiologic evidence on epigenetics in psychiatry, however, is currently very sparsely available, but is consistent with a mediating role for epigenetic mechanisms in bringing together inherited and acquired risk factors into a neurodevelopmental etiological model of psychiatric disorders. Here, we review evidence from the epidemiological and neuroscience literature, and aim to converge the evidence into an etiological model of psychiatric disorders that encompasses environmental, genetic and epigenetic contributions. Given the dynamic nature of the epigenetic machinery and the potential reversibility of epigenetic modifications, future well-designed interdisciplinary and translational studies will be of key importance in order to identify new targets for prevention and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Within the spectrum of disorders that manifest obsessive-compulsive (OC) features lies a sub-cluster of neurological conditions. Autism and Parkinson's disease (PD) are examples of two such neurological disorders that seem quite dissimilar on the surface. Yet, both conditions can include repetitive behaviors of a compulsive-impulsive nature. Furthermore, while autism and PD differ in other associated symptom domains that shape the course of each disorder, both disorders share some phenomenology in the core domain of repetitive behaviors and involve basal ganglia and frontal lobe dysfunction, similar to OC disorder (OCD). Accordingly, examination of the similarities and differences between autism and PD may provide insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of OC spectrum disorders. The current review focuses on the phenomenology. comorbidity, course of illness, family history, brain circuitry, and treatment of autism and PD, as they relate to OCD and OC spectrum disturbances.

AB  - Intracellular organic osmolytes are present in certain organisms adapted to harsh environments. These osmolytes protect intracellular macromolecules against denaturing environmental stress. In contrast to the usually benign effects of most organic osmolytes, the waste product urea is a well-known perturbant of macromolecules. Although urea is a perturbing solute which inhibits enzyme activity and stability, it is employed by some species as a major osmolyte. The answer to this paradox was believed to be the discovery of protective osmolytes (methylamines). We review the current state of knowledge on the various ways of counteracting the harmful effects of urea in nature and the mechanisms for this. This review ends with the mechanistic idea that cellular salt (KCl/NaCl) plays a crucial role in counteracting the effects of urea, either by inducing required chaperones or methylamines, or by thermodynamic interactions with urea-destabilised proteins. We also propose future opportunities and challenges in the field.

AB  - Patients with medically unexplained symptoms comprise from 15% to 30% of all primary care consultations. Physicians often assume that psychological factors account for these symptoms, but current theories of psychogenic causation, somatization, and somatic amplification cannot fully account for common unexplained symptoms. Psychophysiological and sociophysiological models provide plausible medical explanations for most common somatic symptoms. Psychological explanations are often not communicated effectively, do not address patient concerns, and may lead patients to reject treatment or referral because of potential stigma. Across cultures, many systems of medicine provide sociosomatic explanations linking problems in family and community with bodily distress. Most patients, therefore, have culturally based explanations available for their symptoms. When the bodily nature and cultural meaning of their suffering is validated, most patients will acknowledge that stress, social conditions, and emotions have an effect on their physical condition. This provides an entree to applying the symptom-focused strategies of behavioural medicine to address the psychosocial factors that contribute to chronicity and disability.

AB  - Diffusible ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-) are vital for healthy function of all cells, especially brain cells. Unfortunately, the diffusible nature of these ions renders them difficult to study with traditional microscopy in situ within ex vivo brain tissue sections. This mini-review examines the recent progress in the field, using direct elemental mapping techniques to study ion homeostasis during normal brain physiology and pathophysiology, through measurement of ion distribution and concentration in ex vivo brain tissue sections. The mini-review examines the advantages and limitations of specific techniques: proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE), X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and the sample preparation requirements to study diffusible ions with these methods.

AB  - A growing trend of neuroimaging, behavioral, and computational research has investigated the topic of outcome uncertainty in decision-making. Although evidence to date indicates that humans are very effective in learning to adapt to uncertain situations, the nature of the specific cognitive processes involved in the adaptation to uncertainty are still a matter of debate. In this article, we reviewed evidence suggesting that cognitive control processes are at the heart of uncertainty in decision-making contexts. Available evidence suggests that: (1) There is a strong conceptual overlap between the constructs of uncertainty and cognitive control; (2)There is a remarkable overlap between the neural networks associated with uncertainty and the brain networks subserving cognitive control; (3) The perception and estimation of uncertainty might play a key role in monitoring processes and the evaluation of the "need for control"; (4) Potential interactions between uncertainty and cognitive control might play a significant role in several affective disorders.

AB  - For many centuries, philosophers and scientists have pondered the origins and nature of human intuitions about the properties of points, lines, and figures on the Euclidean plane, with most hypothesizing that a system of Euclidean concepts either is innate or is assembled by general learning processes. Recent research from cognitive and developmental psychology, cognitive anthropology, animal cognition, and cognitive neuroscience suggests a different view. Knowledge of geometry may be founded on at least two distinct, evolutionarily ancient, core cognitive systems for representing the shapes of large-scale, navigable surface layouts and of small-scale, movable forms and objects. Each of these systems applies to some but not all perceptible arrays and captures some but not all of the three fundamental Euclidean relationships of distance (or length), angle, and direction (or sense). Like natural number (Carey, 2009), Euclidean geometry may be constructed through the productive combination of representations from these core systems, through the use of uniquely human symbolic systems.

Diseases which exhibit a more complex pattern of inheritance now afford the next challange in the application of genetic mapping to the field of human disease, This article aims to review the application of genetic mapping to affective disorders.
   Method: Review of literature concerning the molecular genetics of affective disorders.
   Findings: This article describes the evidence for a genetic role in affective disorders, reviews the research to date and describes the difficulties arising out of the complex nature of these disorders.
   Conclusions: Although progress to date in psychiatric genetics has been somewhat disappointing, the combined approach of using all the genetic tools currently available on large collections of affected individuals and families should enable the genetic basis of affective disorders to be identified.

AB  - The authors review a range of evidence concerning the motivational underpinnings of anger as an affect, with particular reference to the relationship between anger and anxiety or fear. The evidence supports the view that anger relates to an appetitive or approach motivational system, whereas anxiety relates to an aversive or avoidance motivational system. This evidence appears to have 2 implications. One implication concerns the nature of anterior cortical asymmetry effects. The evidence suggests that such asymmetry reflects direction of motivational engagement (approach vs. withdrawal) rather than affective valence. The other implication concerns the idea that affects form a purely positive dimension and a purely negative dimension, which reflect the operation of appetitive and aversive motivational systems, respectively. The evidence reviewed does not support that view. The evidence is, however, consistent with a discrete-emotions view (which does not rely on dimensionality) and with an alternative dimensional approach.

AB  - 89-94One of the most common psychiatric disorders in children is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Its course and outcome are heterogeneous. Sensory processing problems impact the nature of response to daily events. ADHD and sensory problems may occur together and interact. No published review article about sensory processing problems in children with ADHD were found. A systematic search, conducted on Pub-Med (up to January 2010), and Google Scholar, yielded 255 abstracts on sensory processing problems in children including 11 studies about sensory problems in children with ADHD. Sensory processing problems in children with ADHD is not a well studied area. Sensory processing problems in children with ADHD are more common than in typically developing children. Findings do not support that ADHD subtypes are distinct disorders with regard to sensory processing problems. However, co-morbidity with oppositional defiant disorder and anxiety are predictors of more severe sensory processing problems in children with ADHD. Psychiatry investig 2011;8:89-94

AB  - Using taxa as indicators of environmental impacts is widespread. Indicators are chosen because they are considered to be easy to measure, sensitive to stresses and respond to stresses in predictable ways. Here, we review these criteria by addressing the nature of the relationships between some characteristic of taxa and the environmental variables they are supposed to indicate. It is crucial that variables measured as indicators be strongly and consistently correlated (through space and time) with levels of the environmental variables. Appropriate experiments must be done to establish that an observed correlation is causal, or the correlation cannot be considered sufficient to identify a useful indicator. Finally, it is necessary to establish that the taxa directly respond to changes in the environmental variables they are supposed to indicate. Appropriate methodologies to establish these criteria are considered and we evaluate studies in which these criteria have or have not been met. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, I highlight the discipline of developmental psychopathology as an integrative framework that builds upon the historical underpinnings of a constructivist perspective. After presenting illustrative developmental psychopathology principles that I consider to be central to a constructivist view, I turn my attention to the role of experience on brain development. This serves as the entree into a discussion of research conducted with maltreated children on brain event-related potentials (ERPs) and the cognitive processing of emotional stimuli, neuroendocrine functioning, and acoustic startle. Each of these components of brain functioning serve to underscore how different neurobiological systems reflect the way in which individuals ascribe meaning to traumatic experiences. Research on child maltreatment, an "experiment of nature," reveals that maltreated children actively construct their reality at both the biological and psychological levels of analysis, at least in part based on the meaning these children impute to their caregiving experiences.

AB  - Neuroeconomics is a rapidly expanding field at the interfaces of the human sciences. The interdisciplinary nature of this field results in several challenges when attempts are made to solve puzzling questions in human decision making, such as why and how people discount future gains. We argue that an empirical approach based on dynamic systems theory (DST) could inspire and advance the neuroeconomic investigation of decision-making processes in three ways: by enriching the mental model, by extending the empirical tool set, and by facilitating interdisciplinary exchange. The present article addresses the challenges neuroeconomics faces by focusing on intertemporal choice. After a brief introduction of DST and related research, a DST-based conceptual model of decision making is developed and linked to underlying neural principles. On this basis, we outline the application of DST-informed empirical strategies to inter-temporal choice. Finally, we discuss the general consequences of and possible objections to the proposed approach to research in intertemporal choice and the field of neuroeconomics.

AB  - This study systematically reviewed and thematically analyzed studies that investigated psychosocial support services provided to Syrian refugees with disabilities between 2011 and 2020. Nine studies published in the English language were identified from database searches (Google Scholar, PsychInfo, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and Scopus). Results showed that the forms of psychosocial support services provided to Syrian refugees with disabilities were varied based on the nature of the study and the disability type. The results also provided detailed information about methods, participants, and findings of the identified studies. The thematic analysis results identified six themes that represent the factors related to the psychosocial support services, which were assessment, mental health, psychological well-being, rehabilitation, social participation, and vulnerability. This study provided a set of recommendations that may improve the quality of mental health and psychosocial support services provided to Syrian refugees with disabilities and their families, which are professional development, researches, and policy reforming.

AB  - Persistent depressive disorder is a chronic mood disorder that is common and often more disabling than episodic major depression. In DSM-5, the term subsumes several chronic depressive presentations, including dysthymia with or without superimposed major depressive episodes, chronic major depression, and recurrent major depression without recovery between episodes. Dysthymia can be difficult to detect in psychiatric and primary care settings until it intensifies in the form of a superimposed major depressive episode. Although information is scarce concerning the cause of persistent depressive disorder including dysthymia, the causation is likely to be multifactorial. In this narrative Review, we discuss current knowledge about the nosology and neurobiological basis of dysthymia and persistent depressive disorder, emphasising a dimensional perspective based on course for further research. We also review new developments in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for persistent depressive disorder, and propose a tailored, modular approach to accommodate its multifaceted nature.

AB  - Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and risk of lifetime and past year intimate partner violence (IPV) among males and females with eating disorders.
   Methods: Systematic review. We searched 15 electronic databases, supplemented by hand searching, citation tracking, updating a review on victimisation and mental disorder and expert recommendations.
   Results: Eight papers were included, involving 6775 females and 4857 males. Individual studies reported that eating disorders are associated with a high prevalence and increased odds of lifetime IPV among both males and females. Evidence is lacking on eating disorder and past year IPV, on whether associations between eating disorder and IPV vary by type of IPV, and temporality.
   Discussion: More research is needed to investigate the strength and nature of the association between eating disorders and IPV, including with regards to the direction of causality between eating disorders and IPV, and whether associations are mediated by childhood abuse.

AB  - A critical aspect of much human behaviour is the generation and regulation of sequential activities. Such behaviour is seen in both naturalistic settings such as routine action and language production and laboratory tasks such as serial recall and many reaction time experiments. There are a variety of computational mechanisms that may support the generation and regulation of sequential behaviours, ranging from those underlying Turing machines to those employed by recurrent connectionist networks. This paper surveys a range of such mechanisms, together with a range of empirical phenomena related to human sequential behaviour. It is argued that the empirical phenomena pose difficulties for most sequencing mechanisms, but that converging evidence from behavioural flexibility, error data arising from when the system is stressed or when it is damaged following brain injury, and between-trial effects in reaction time tasks, point to a hybrid symbolic activation-based mechanism for the generation and regulation of sequential behaviour. Some implications of this view for the nature of mental computation are highlighted.

AB  - Zinc signalling has a crucial impact on the proper functioning of the brain. Disturbances within the zincergic system may lead to neuropsychological disorders, including major depression. Studying this disease and designing effective treatment is hampered by its heterogeneous etiology and the diversified nature of the symptoms. Over the years, studies have shown that zinc deficiency and disturbances in the expression profile of the zinc receptor - GPR39 - might be a useful neurobiological indicator of a pathological state. Zinc levels and the zinc receptor are altered by classic antidepressant treatment, which indicates possible reciprocity between the monoaminergic system and zinc signalling. Disruptions in this specific interplay might be a cause of a pathological depressive state, and restoring balance and cooperation between those systems might be key to a successful form of pharmacotherapy. In this review, we aim to describe interactions between the serotonergic and zincergic systems and to highlight their significance in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression.

AB  - Use of antidepressants (ADs) in general, and in pregnant notwithstanding, has been increasing globally in recent decades. Associations with a wide range of adverse perinatal and childhood outcomes following prenatal ADs exposure have been observed in registry-based studies, with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) frequently reported. Studies using animal models, sibling analyses, and negative control approaches, have linked dysfunctional serotonin metabolism with ASD, but did not convincingly tease apart the role of maternal mental health from that of ADs. As work to decipher the nature of the AD-ASD association continues, this review raises some public health concerns pertinent to a hypothetical conclusion that this association is causal, including the need to identify specific gestation periods with higher risk, the importance of precise assessment of the ASD potential prevention that might be attributed to AD discontinuation, and the estimation of risks associated with prenatal exposure to untreated depression.

AB  - Activation of the kynurenine pathway is one of the described mechanisms by which inflammation can induce depression. It involves multiple pathways including interference with the bioavailability of tryptophan central to the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin.
   In this systematic review, we examine the relationship between kynurenine metabolites (kynurenine, kynurenic acid, tryptophan, quinolinic acid, the ratio of kynurenine and tryptophan) and mood disorders by conducting a meta-analysis.
   Fifty-six studies were identified, 21 met inclusion criteria and 14 were deemed suitable (9 investigating unipolar depression and 5 bipolar disorder).
   We found decreased levels of kynurenine in unipolar major depression vs. healthy controls but studies were significantly heterogeneous in nature. No significant differences were found in tryptophan levels or kynurenine/tryptophan ratios. Kynurenine metabolites are likely to play a role in major depression but an exact etiological role in mood disorder seem complex and requires further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical comorbidity is commonly encountered in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). The presence of medical comorbidity has diagnostic, prognostic, treatment, and etiologic implications underscoring the importance of timely detection and treatment.
   METHODS: A selective review of relevant articles and reviews published in English-language databases (1968 to April 2011) was conducted. Studies describing epidemiology, temporality of onset, treatment implications, and prognosis were selected for review.
   RESULTS: A growing body of evidence from epidemiologic, clinical, and biologic studies suggests that the relationship between medical illness and mood disorder is bidirectional in nature. It provides support for the multiplay of shared and specific etiologic factors interlinking these conditions.
   CONCLUSION: This article describes the complex interactions between medical illness and mood disorders and provides a meaningful approach to their comorbid clinical diagnosis and management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium commonly appears on the differential diagnostic list of psychiatric patients in acute care settings. When a patient is unable or unwilling to answer questions about orientation, determination of possible delirium or other probable etiologies becomes difficult. The role of the standard electroencephalogram (SEEG) in evaluating such patients is not known.
   METHODS: Exhaustive MEDLINE and PsycInfo searches were performed for the period 1950-2007 for all articles cross-referenced for "delirium" and "EEG." The focus was on method, comorbid conditions, demographics, and prevalence and nature of reported abnormalities.
   RESULTS: We reviewed a total of 45 articles, of which 12 met criteria for more stringent review. All findings are presented in chronological order. Our analysis focuses on SEEG, although we also allude to quantitative EEG when described.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse slowing of the EEG is considered one of the hallmarks of an encephalopathic process and is commonly reported in psychiatric patients. The EEG may be helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with a difficult-to-assess mental status.

AB  - Objective: We conducted a comprehensive review of the English language literature on the comorbidity of anxiety symptoms/disorders in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) in order to determine: their prevalence rates in clinical and non-clinical populations, the temporal relationship of anxiety comorbidity to SSDs, and the effect of comorbidity on outcome.
   Method: Medline and PsychInfo databases were searched, from 1966 to September 2004 and 1887 to September 2004 respectively.
   Results: Overall lifetime prevalence rates for any anxiety disorder ranged from 30% to 85% with most studies showing rates higher than in the general population. In more than 50% of patients, the anxiety disorder preceded the onset of psychosis. Patients with comorbid panic symptoms were more frequent service users, had additional comorbidities and were more likely to be suicidal. Comorbid obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) tended to be associated with poorer social functioning, worse cognitive impairment and motor symptoms.
   Conclusions: There is a clear link between SSDs and anxiety disorders though its nature remains unclear. This has important implications for psychiatric nosology, aetiology and treatment.

AB  - Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are classified as a somatoform conversion disorder. We present a case of a 24-year-old male with a past psychiatric history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorder, admitted to our inpatient psychiatric unit. The patient experienced multiple episodes of seizures during hospitalization. Work up was unremarkable, and PNES were suspected and later confirmed with video-electroencephalography (video-EEG). He underwent supervised withdrawal of antiepileptic medications with the initiation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which reduced the frequency of seizures. Diagnosis of PNES can present as a challenge and failure to diagnose its psychological nature can lead to a delay in the psychological intervention. CBT leads to a decrease in seizure frequency, and improvement in psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life. It is important to consider PNES in the differential diagnosis of seizures presented by psychiatric patients, as CBT is necessary for better patient outcomes.

AB  - The episodic and chronic nature of bipolar disorder usually requires long-term treatment in all patients, yet there is an unmet need for well-tolerated and clinically effective maintenance therapy with enhanced patient adherence. Few well-tolerated treatment options are currently available that are both effective in all phases of bipolar disorder and prevent recurrence of episodes. Lithium has well-established efficacy in the prevention of further manic episodes and may also be effective in the prevention of depression and suicide, but safety is a concern due to narrow therapeutic window. For valproate and carbamazepine, data appear much less compelling. Lamotrigine has shown to be effective for long-term prevention of depressive episodes. Controlled studies suggest that atypical antipsychotics may also have mood-stabilizing properties and might become standard for long-term therapy in the new future. The role of psychoeducation in improving adherence to medication in long-term treatment and overall patient outcomes is also crucial.

AB  - Background: The increase in frequency and intensity of urban flooding is a global challenge. Flooding directly impacts residents of industrialized cities with aging combined sewer systems, as well as cities with less centralized infrastructure to manage stormwater, fecal sludge, and wastewater. Green infrastructure is growing in popularity as a sustainable strategy to mimic nature-based flood management. Although its technical performance has been extensively studied, little is known about the effects of green stormwater infrastructure on human health and social well-being.
   Methods: We conducted a multidisciplinary systematic review of peer-reviewed and gray literature on the effects of green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management on individuals', households', and communities' a) physical health; b) mental health; c) economic well-being; and d) flood resilience and social acceptance of green infrastructure. We systematically searched databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus; the first 300 results in Google Scholar; and websites of key organizations including the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Study quality and strength of evidence was assessed for included studies, and descriptive data were extracted for a narrative summary.
   Results: Out of 21,213 initial results, only 18 studies reported health or social well-being outcomes. Seven of these studies used primary data, and none allowed for causal inference. No studies connected green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management to mental or physical health outcomes. Thirteen studies were identified on economic outcomes, largely reporting a positive association between green infrastructure and property values. Five studies assessed changes in perceptions about green infrastructure, but with mixed results. Nearly half of all included studies were from Portland, Oregon.
   Conclusions: This global systematic review highlights the minimal evidence on human health and social well-being relating to green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management. To enable scale-up of this type of infrastructure to reduce flooding and improve ecological and human well-being, widespread acceptance of green infrastructure will be essential. Policymakers and planners need evidence on the full range of benefits from different contexts to enable financing and implementation of instfrastructure options, especially in highly urbanized, flood-prone settings around the world. Therefore, experts in social science, public health, and program evaluation must be integrated into interdisciplinary green infrastructure research to better relate infrastructure design to tangible human outcomes.

AB  - The user participatory nature of the social web has revolutionized the use of the conventional web. The social web is an integral part of our daily life. Due to the resulting exponential growth of the social web, a number of research domains have emerged, involving research activities that aim to study human nature, to analyse human sentiments and emotions, and to find the impact of various users in the social networks. Recently, the research focus has shifted to identifying a user's influence on other users in a social network. In the recent literature, we find a number of models proposed to find the most influential users in the blogging community. In this paper, we review the models to find these influential bloggers. The existing models are classified into feature-based and network-based categories. The feature-based models consider the salient factors to measure bloggers' influence. The network models, on the other hand, consider the graph-based social network structure of the bloggers to identify those who have the most impact on fellow members. This survey introduces each model with its features, novel aspects, and the datasets used. In addition to the discussion about the model, a comparative analysis of the datasets is presented. We conclude by discussing applications of the relevant literature, exploring open research issues and challenges, and sharing possible future directions in this active area of research.

AB  - The nature of harmand therefore moral judgmentmay be misunderstood. Rather than an objective matter of reason, we argue that harm should be redefined as an intuitively perceived continuum. This redefinition provides a new understanding of moral content and mechanismthe constructionist Theory of Dyadic Morality (TDM). TDM suggests that acts are condemned proportional to three elements: norm violations, negative affect, andimportantlyperceived harm. This harm is dyadic, involving an intentional agent causing damage to a vulnerable patient (AP). TDM predicts causal links both from harm to immorality (dyadic comparison) and from immorality to harm (dyadic completion). Together, these two processes make the dyadic loop, explaining moral acquisition and polarization. TDM argues against intuitive harmless wrongs and modular foundations, but embraces moral pluralism through varieties of values and the flexibility of perceived harm. Dyadic morality impacts understandings of moral character, moral emotion, and political/cultural differences, and provides research guidelines for moral psychology.

AB  - Recent progress in the study of attention and performance is discussed, focusing on the nature of attentional control and the effects of practice. Generally speaking, the effects of mental set are proving more pervasive than was previously suspected, whereas automaticity is proving less robust. Stimulus attributes (e.g. onsets, transients) thought to have a "wired-in" ability to capture attention automatically have been shown to capture attention only as a consequence of voluntarily adopted task sets. Recent research suggests that practice does not have as dramatic effects as is commonly believed. While it may turn out that some mental operations are automatized in the strongest sense, this may be uncommon. Recent work on task switching is also described; optimal engagement in a task set is proving to be intimately tied to learning operations triggered by the actual performance of a new task, not merely the anticipation of such performance.

AB  - Problem identification: Expanding on previous work in specific cancer populations, this review aimed to explore factors associated with decisional regret following treatment for a range of cancer types.
   Literature search: A systematic search of four databases identified 1747 studies, using search terms relating to cancer survivors and decisional regret. Following quality appraisal, correlates of regret were abstracted and analyzed using narrative synthesis.
   Data evaluation/synthesis: Seventy-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Factors associated with treatment regret were categorized as being either modifiable or less modifiable. Regret was associated with various sociodemographic factors, physical health, treatment type, an unsatisfactory decision-making process, poorer mental health and lack of social support.
   Conclusion: Results highlight the complex nature of regret and illustrate how this can be experienced following a range of cancer treatments. As regret can be an obstacle to full-recovery from cancer, this review suggests some ways in which the emergence of regret may be mitigated.

AB  - Morality and emotions are linked, but what is the nature of their correspondence? Many whole number accounts posit specific correspondences between moral content and discrete emotions, such that harm is linked to anger, and purity is linked to disgust. A review of the literature provides little support for these specific morality-emotion links. Moreover, any apparent specificity may arise from global features shared between morality and emotion, such as affect and conceptual content. These findings are consistent with a constructionist perspective of the mind, which argues against a whole number of discrete and domain-specific mental mechanisms underlying morality and emotion. Instead, constructionism emphasizes the flexible combination of basic and domain-general ingredients such as core affect and conceptualization in creating the experience of moral judgments and discrete emotions. The implications of constructionism in moral psychology are discussed, and we propose an experimental framework for rigorously testing morality-emotion links.

AB  - There is increasing evidence to suggest both a symptomatic overlap and a clinically significant degree of co occurrence between Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia but the nature of such relationships remain unclear. We reviewed the literature reporting prevalence rates of Autistic like Traits (ALTs) and ASD in populations with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder. A search of three large databases was conducted and from this seven studies met the criteria for inclusion. The point prevalence rates for ALTs ranged from 9.6% to 61%, whilst the prevalence rates for diagnosed ASD ranged from < 1% to 52% across outpatient and inpatient populations. This suggests that prevalence rates of ALTs and ASD in psychosis populations are much higher than in the general population. This has important implications regarding future research, and clinical implications in terms of ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Social relationships play a key role in depression. This is apparent in its etiology, symptomatology, and effective treatment. However, there has been little consensus about the best way to conceptualize the link between depression and social relationships. Furthermore, the extensive social-psychological literature on the nature of social relationships, and in particular, research on social identity, has not been integrated with depression research. This review presents evidence that social connectedness is key to understanding the development and resolution of clinical depression. The social identity approach is then used as a basis for conceptualizing the role of social relationships in depression, operationalized in terms of six central hypotheses. Research relevant to these hypotheses is then reviewed. Finally, we present an agenda for future research to advance theoretical and empirical understanding of the link between social identity and depression, and to translate the insights of this approach into clinical practice.

AB  - Cognitive effort is thought to be familiar in everyday life, ubiquitous across multiple variations of task and circumstance, and integral to cost/benefit computations that are themselves central to the proper functioning of cognitive control. In particular, cognitive effort is thought to be closely related to the assessment of cognitive control's costs. I argue here that the construct of cognitive effort, as it is deployed in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, is problematically unclear. The result is that talk of cognitive effort may paper over significant disagreement regarding the nature of cognitive effort, and its key functions for cognitive control. I highlight key points of disagreement, and several open questions regarding what causes cognitive effort, what cognitive effort represents, cognitive effort's relationship to action, and cognitive effort's relationship to consciousness. I also suggest that pluralism about cognitive effort-that cognitive effort may manifest as a range of intentional or non-intentional actions the function of which is to promote greater success at paradigmatic cognitive control tasks-may be a fruitful and irenic way to conceive of cognitive effort. Finally, I suggest that recent trends in work on cognitive control suggests that we might fruitfully conceive of cognitive effort as one key node in a complex network of mental value, and that studying this complex network may illuminate the nature of cognitive control, and the role of consciousness in cognitive control's proper functioning.

AB  - This article contains a discussion of the elusive nature of the concept of randomness. a review of findings from experiments with randomness production and randomness perception tasks. and a presentation of theoretical treatments of people's randomization capabilities and limitations. The importance of task instructions and the difficulty of interpreting results when instructions are vague or ambiguous are stressed. The widely held view that people are incapable of generating or recognizing randomness is shown to lack the strong experimental support that has sometimes been claimed for it.

AB  - Andrea Smorti's Telling to Understand provides an opportunity to mentalise linguistic productions in the light of narrative understanding and the relationality underlying the nature of communication processes. In the post-modern polyglot society, narrative understanding abreacts meanings emerging from the coexistence and interaction of different linguistic universes. In the elicitation of meanings, the different forms of narration become tales that consecutively become stories if inserted into a chronologically ordered system. Such stories are maintained by causal links that guarantee continuity and coherence to the narrative production.

AB  - In recent years, researchers have been making substantial advances in understanding the central role of emotions in intractable conflict. We now know that discrete emotions uniquely shape policy preferences in conflict through their unique emotional goals and action tendencies in all stages of conflict including conflict management, conflict resolution and reconciliation. Drawing on this understanding, recent research also points to emotion regulation as a path to reduce conflict and advance peace, exploring both direct and indirect strategies of emotion regulation.

AB  - The obvious hazard of a cold exposure under natural as well as artificial conditions is tissue cooling and the associated sequel of more or less harmful effects from cold injury to discomfort. The nature, risk and magnitude of effects depend largely on the cooling effect, which results from the interaction of climatic factors (air temperature, mean radiant temperature, humidity and wind), protection (clothing) and metabolic heat production (activity). Assessment of cold stress should be based on methods which measure or predict this cooling effect in a relevant and reliable way. The nature of cooling encompasses (1) whole-body cooling, (2) extremity cooling, (3) convective cooling (wind chill), (4) conductive cooling (contact) and (5) airway-cooling. The review contains a description of methods for evaluation of the various types of cold stress, as well as a discussion of their capacity and limitations. On the basis of selected methods, recommendations related to lowest permissible temperatures and other measures are discussed and compared with published data. Apparently, local cooling in most cases produces discomfort and harmful effects, before more significant whole-body cooling develops. With strong wind or movement at very low temperature, frostnip of unprotected skin may quickly develop. For most other conditions extremity (digit) cooling determines duration of exposure. However, as digit cooling largely depends on whole-body heat balance, it is important to control body cooling by selection and use of appropriate protective clothing.

AB  - In order to take advantage of the potential offered by the medium of virtual reality (VR), it will be essential to develop an understanding of how to maximize the desirable experience of "presence" in a virtual space ("being there"), and how to minimize the undesirable feeling of "cybersickness" (a constellation of discomfort symptoms experienced in VR). Although there have been frequent reports of a possible link between the observer's sense of presence and the experience of bodily discomfort in VR, the amount of literature that discusses the nature of the relationship is limited. Recent research has underlined the possibility that these variables have shared causes, and that both factors may be manipulated with a single approach. This review paper summarizes the concepts of presence and cybersickness and highlights the strengths and gaps in our understanding about their relationship. We review studies that have measured the association between presence and cybersickness, and conclude that the balance of evidence favors a negative relationship between the two factors which is driven principally by sensory integration processes. We also discuss how system immersiveness might play a role in modulating both presence and cybersickness. However, we identify a serious absence of high-powered studies that aim to reveal the nature of this relationship. Based on this evidence we propose recommendations for future studies investigating presence, cybersickness, and other related factors.

AB  - It is not too late, but about time to realize how damaging IT overuse can be. The present paper discusses why it is of tremendous importance to study the effect of the Internet, smartphone, and other new digital technologies on individuals' productivity and well-being. Besides its recognized addictive nature, it also becomes clear that such technology inevitably alters our natural social lives, which has, in our opinion, the potential to harm entire societies. In developed countries, we are more or less all using digital devices for communication purposes; we surf the Internet and we download apps on a daily basis. We present two lines of argument as to why the study of technological (over)use and its consequences is of tremendous importance. First, we outline under which circumstances use of smartphones and Internet can make us unproductive. Second, we anchor the (over)use of technologies in an affective neuroscience framework. Both these approaches to describing and understanding the consequences of digital technology use clearly show that many humans are already overusing technology. Therefore, we also provide some initial ideas on how to cut down technology use in order to live more satisfying and happier lives. Let us look into each other's eyes and begin to spend more quality time with our loved ones outside in nature instead of staring at digital devices.

AB  - y Natural products (NPs) will continue to serve humans asmatchless source of novel drug leads and an inspiration for the synthesis of non-natural drugs. As our scientific understanding of 'nature' is rapidly expanding, itwould be worthwhile to illuminate the pharmacological distinctions of NPs to the scientific community and the public. Flavonoids have long fascinated scientists with their remarkable structural diversity as well as biological functions. Consequently, this review aims to shed light on the sources and pharmacological significance of a dietary isoflavone, biochanin A, which has been recently emerged as a multitargeted and multifunctional guardian of human health. Biochanin A possesses anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-microbial, and hepatoprotective properties. It combats cancer development by inducing apoptosis, inhibition of metastasis and arresting cell cycle via targeting several deregulated signaling pathways of cancer. It fights inflammation by blocking the expression and activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines via modulation of NF-.B and MAPKs. Biochanin A acts as a neuroprotective agent by inhibiting microglial activation and apoptosis of neurons. As biochanin A has potential to modulate several biological networks, thus, it can be anticipated that this therapeutically potent compound might serve as a novel lead for drug development in the near future.

AB  - Background : During the last decades, the research on mother-infant dyad has produced a great amount of data, methods and theories, which largely contributed to set a revolution in the way we look at developmental changes during infancy and childhood. Very different constructs depict the different aspects of the "dyadic dance" occurring between a mother and her infant; nonetheless, a comprehensive and consistent systematization of these concepts in a coherent theoretical landscape is still lacking.
   Aim : In the present work, we aim at disentangling the different theoretical and methodological definitions of 9 dyadic constructs and we highlight their effects on infants' and children developmental outcomes
   Methods : A literature search has been conducted on three databases-PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science. Three different reviews are reported here: (1) a review on the theoretical definitions of dyadic constructs; (2) a review of operational definitions, settings and methods of dyadic processes; (3) a systematic review of dyadic processes' outcomes for infants' and children developmental trajectories.
   Results : Two constructs emerged as wide meta-theoretical concepts (reciprocity and mutuality) and seven described specific processes (attunement, contingency, coordination, matching, mirroring, reparation, synchrony). A global model resuming the relationships among different processes is reported, which highlights the emergence of two specific cycles of dyadic functioning (i.e., matching-mismatching-reparation-synchrony; contingency, coordination, attunement, mirroring). A comprehensive review of the adopted measures is also provided. Finally, all the processes provided significant contributions to infants' behavioral, cognitive, and socio-emotional development during the first 3 years of age, but limited research has been conducted on specific processes(e.g. reparation and mirroring).
   Conclusion : The present study provides an original research-grounded framework to consider the different nature of mother-infant dyadic processes within a unified dyadic eco-system. Different levels of evidence emerged for the role of diverse mother-infant dyadic processes on infants' and children development. Open questions and future research directions are highlighted.

AB  - IMPORTANCE In recent years, there has been increased focus on subthreshold stages of mental disorders, with attempts to model and predict which individuals will progress to full-threshold disorder. Given this research attention and the clinical significance of the issue, this article analyzes the assumptions of the theoretical models in the field.
   OBSERVATIONS Psychiatric research into predicting the onset of mental disorder has shown an overreliance on one-off sampling of cross-sectional data (ie, a snapshot of clinical state and other risk markers) and may benefit from taking dynamic changes into account in predictive modeling. Cross-disciplinary approaches to complex system structures and changes, such as dynamical systems theory, network theory, instability mechanisms, chaos theory, and catastrophe theory, offer potent models that can be applied to the emergence (or decline) of psychopathology, including psychosis prediction, as well as to transdiagnostic emergence of symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Psychiatric research may benefit from approaching psychopathology as a system rather than as a category, identifying dynamics of system change (eg, abrupt vs gradual psychosis onset), and determining the factors to which these systems are most sensitive (eg, interpersonal dynamics and neurochemical change) and the individual variability in system architecture and change. These goals can be advanced by testing hypotheses that emerge from cross-disciplinary models of complex systems. Future studies require repeated longitudinal assessment of relevant variables through either (or a combination of) micro-level (momentary and day-to-day) and macro-level (month and year) assessments. Ecological momentary assessment is a data collection technique appropriate for micro-level assessment. Relevant statistical approaches are joint modeling and time series analysis, includingmetric-based and model-based methods that draw on the mathematical principles of dynamical systems. This next generation of prediction studies may more accurately model the dynamic nature of psychopathology and system change as well as have treatment implications, such as introducing a means of identifying critical periods of risk for mental state deterioration.

AB  - Background: To date, a diagnosis in psychiatry is largely based on a clinical interview and questionnaires. The retrospective and subjective nature of these methods leads to recall and interviewer biases. Therefore, there is a clear need for more objective and standardized assessment methods to support the diagnostic process. The introduction of virtual reality (VR) creates the possibility to simultaneously provoke and measure psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, VR could contribute to the objectivity and reliability in the assessment of psychiatric disorders.
   Objective: In this literature review, we will evaluate the assessment of psychiatric disorders by means of VR environments. First, we investigate if these VR environments are capable of simultaneously provoking and measuring psychiatric symptoms. Next, we compare these measures with traditional diagnostic measures.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search using PubMed, Embase, and Psycinfo; references of selected articles were checked for eligibility. We identified studies from 1990 to 2016 on VR used in the assessment of psychiatric disorders. Studies were excluded if VR was used for therapeutic purposes, if a different technique was used, or in case of limitation to a non-clinical sample.
   Results: A total of 39 studies were included for further analysis. The disorders most frequently studied included schizophrenia (n = 15), developmental disorders (n = 12), eating disorders (n = 3), and anxiety disorders (n = 6). In attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the most comprehensive measurement was used including several key symptoms of the disorder. Most of the studies, however, concerned the use of VR to assess a single aspect of a psychiatric disorder.
   Discussion: In general, nearly all VR environments studied were able to simultaneously provoke and measure psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, in 14 studies, significant correlations were found between VR measures and traditional diagnostic measures. Relatively small clinical sample sizes were used, impeding definite conclusions. Based on this review, the innovative technique of VR shows potential to contribute to objectivity and reliability in the psychiatric diagnostic process.

AB  - Background Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as voiding symptoms, overactive bladder, and interstitial cystitis, and anxiety disorders are often comorbid conditions in patients. However, the existing evidence regarding the rates and nature of the co-occurrence of these conditions has not been systematically evaluated. The aim of this study was to examine these relationships. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the relationship between LUTS and anxiety. We searched for articles published from January 1990 to July 2019 in PubMed, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. Outcomes were anxiety-related disorders and symptoms (clinically significant anxiety) and LUTS. We performed random-effects meta-analyses, inspected funnel plots, and applied the Egger's test to evaluate publication bias. We followed PRISMA guidelines and recorded our protocol on PROSPERO (ID = CRD42019118607). Results We identified 814 articles, of which 94 fulfilled inclusion criteria, and 23 had sufficient data for meta-analysis. The odds ratio (OR) for clinically significant anxiety among individuals with LUTS was 2.87 (95% CI: 2.38,3.46, p < .001). The OR for LUTS among individuals with clinically significant anxiety was 2.87 (95% CI: 1.07,7.74, p < .001), although very few studies examined this relationship. A large value of I-2 index suggests high heterogeneity between studies. Conclusion The results demonstrate a significant association between clinically significant anxiety and LUTS in both females and males. There were limited studies on younger individuals and on individuals ascertained for clinically significant anxiety, which should motivate further study in these areas. Understanding the co-occurrence of these conditions will lead to better prevention and interventions to ameliorate the progression of the symptoms and improve the quality of life. A thorough assessment of anxiety may provide more optimal care for LUTS patients.

AB  - A model of the mind by which psi functioning maybe better understood is described. A phenomenological approach is taken, and the model that is developed is psychological, teleological, and not physically reductionistic. This model assumes that each organism, by its nature, extends beyond itself into the larger pre-sensory surround. Psi is assumed to be neither knowledge nor action, but to belong to the outermost temporal edge of those normal pre-experiential mental processes by which the mind structures all its experiences and commences all its actions. Psi processes are posited to function normally as the unconscious leading edge of the development of all consciousness and all intention. This unconscious functioning is normal and continuous, and is a constituent element of all experience. Like subliminal apprehensions, presensory apprehensions sometimes can be seen by the anticipatory arousal of networks of meaning and affective activation that they evoke, and that function normally to help our minds select and understand the contents of our experience and initiate our actions. These anticipatory, orienting networks are ordinarily experienced as inadvertencies, events (both "inner" and "outer") that seem to have no particular meaning but that implicitly express the action of the orienting activity. Such inadvertencies are marginal to consciousness, and ordinarily may be noticed only when the mind is not occupied with conscious work. By sensitively consulting the implications of inadvertencies, traces of the psi effect may be noticed. It is assumed that unconscious mental processes, including psi processes, are motivated by personal intentions and needs, also largely unconscious. The problems of psi-hitting, psi-missing, and directional switching are addressed. Implications of the model for understanding psi-conducive states are developed, and a relationship between psi and states of dissociation or prolonged confusion or uncertainty is proposed. Persons who are relatively "psychic" are either more prone to intentions and states of mind that facilitate production of such marginal material, or have developed more interest and skills in the introspective examination with which they can be understood, or both. The roots of the model and its relation to some other conceptual contributions in parapsychology are examined.

AB  - Arsenic (As), cited as the most hazardous substance by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR, 2005), is an ubiquitous metalloid which when ingested for prolonged periods cause extensive health effects leading to ultimate untimely death. Plants and microbes can help mitigate soil and groundwater As problem since they have evolved elaborate detoxification machineries against this toxic metalloid as a result of their coexistence with this since the origin of life on earth. Utilization of the phytoremediation and bioremediation potential of the plants and microbes, respectively, is now regarded as two innovative tools that encompass biology, geology, biotechnology and allied sciences with cutting edge applications for sustainable mitigation of As epidemic. Discovery of As hyperaccumulating plants that uptake and concentrate large amounts of this toxic metalloid in their shoots or roots offered new hope to As phytoremediation, solar power based nature's own green remediation. This review focuses on how phytoremediation and bioremediation can be merged together to form an integrated phytobial remediation which could synergistically achieve the goal of large scale removal of As from soil, sediment and groundwater and overcome the drawbacks of the either processes alone. The review also points to the feasibility of the introduction of transgenic plants and microbes that bring new hope for more efficient treatment of As. The review identifies one critical research gap on the importance of remediation of As contaminated groundwater not only for drinking purpose but also for irrigation purpose and stresses that more research should be conducted on the use of constructed wetland, one of the most suitable areas of application of phytobial remediation. Finally the review has narrowed down on different phytoinvestigation and phytodisposal methods, which constitute the most essential and the most difficult part of pilot scale and field scale applications of phytoremediation programs.

AB  - Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a disorder frequently encountered by occupational health care specialists. The health care management of this disorder has involved a diverse set of clinical procedures. The present article is a review of the literature related to CTS with an emphasis on occupational-related CTS. MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycLIT: and NIOSHTIC databases from 1985-1997 were searched for treatment outcome studies related to CTS Treatments of interest included surgery, physical therapy drug therapy: chiropractic treatment biobehavioral interventions and occupational rehabilitation. A systematic review of the effects of these interventions on symptoms, medical status, function, return to work, psychological well-being and patient satisfaction was completed. Compared to other treatments, the majority of studies assessed the effects of surgical interventions. Endoscopic release was associated with higher levels of physical functioning and fewer days to return to work when compared to open release. Limited evidence indicated: 1) steroid injections and oral use of B6 were associated with pain reduction; 2) in comparison to splinting, range of motion exercises appeared to be associated with less pain and fewer days to return to work; 3) cognitive behavior therapy yielded reductions in pain, anxiety, and depression; and, 4) multidisciplinary occupational rehabilitation was associated with a higher percentage of chronic cases returning to work than usual care. Workers' compensation status was associated with increased time to return to work following surgery. Conclusions are preliminary due to the small number of well-controlled studies, variability in duration of symptoms and disability, and the broad range of reported outcome measures. While there are several opinions regarding effective treatment, there is very little scientific support for the range of options currently used in practice. Despite the emerging evidence of the multivariate nature of CTS, the majority of outcome studies have focused on single interventions directed at individual etiological factors or symptoms and functional limitations secondary to CTS.

AB  - Aims. The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify and synthesise analytic studies examining the association between exposure to parental psychopathology in childhood and the nature of subsequent suicide-related thoughts (SRT) and suicide-related behaviour (SRB) (severity of ideation, planned/unplanned attempts/lethality) and to describe the direction, and magnitude of associations. The secondary objective was to determine if the associations from the primary objective differ by the type(s) and timing of parental psychopathology, sex/gender of the parent and child and is mediated by child psychiatric symptoms and family functioning. Methods. A systematic review was conducted using guidelines from the PRISMA statement. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, psycINFO, Web of Science and grey literature sources were searched by two reviewers to March, 2017. Studies were included if they examined any parental psychopathology (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria or equivalent) or SRT or SRB and offspring SRT or SRB occurring from birth Results. Out of 10 231 studies identified, 54 were included for review. Studies were clinically and methodologically heterogeneous with none at low risk of bias (ROB). Nine studies with moderate ROB indicated a significantly increased risk of offspring SRT, suicide attempts (SA) and suicide among those exposed to maternal SA and suicide in childhood or adolescence. In the remaining 45 studies with higher ROB this association persisted. Several studies (67%) did not confirm that the exposure occurred in the offspring's childhood or adolescence. Findings were suggestive of a mediating effect of offspring psychiatric symptoms, however, few studies examined mediation and effect modification of contextual variables. Conclusions. Offspring exposed to maternal SA are at an increased risk of these same behaviours early in life. Prospective attention to the types and timing of maternal and paternal psychopathology and the intermediate pathways to offspring SRT and SRB onset is needed and could have implications for informing modifiable targets for early intervention and prevention.

AB  - Background: Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are experienced more frequently by patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) than previously assumed. However, consensus is lacking on how to treat them.
   Objective: To provide a systematic review of studies reporting on AVH in patients with BPD, with a focus on the efficacy of treatment of psychotic symptoms.
   Methods: For this review a systematic search was made in the PubMed and Ovid databases, and mean weighted prevalence rates, adjusted for sample size, were computed.
   Results: The search yielded 36 studies describing a total of 1,263 patients. Auditory hallucinations (including AVH) were reported in 27% of hospitalized BPD patients; AVH were reported in 25% of all patients and in 24% of outpatients. Of the hallucinating patients, 78% experienced AVH at least once per day, for a duration of several days to many years. On the whole, patients with BPD regarded their voices as malevolent and omnipotent in nature. Compared to patients with schizophrenia, the phenomenological characteristics of AVH were similar and the ensuing distress was equal or even higher, whereas scores for other positive symptoms were lower. The presence of AVH in BPD was associated with an increase of suicide plans and attempts, and more frequent hospitalization. Moreover, AVH in the context of BPD were associated with higher prevalence rates for post-traumatic stress disorder and emotional abuse. The efficacy of antipsychotics was investigated in 21 studies. Based on these studies, we conclude that both typical and atypical antipsychotics tend to have positive effects on AVH experienced in the context of BPD. The efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy and non-invasive brain stimulation has not yet been systematically assessed.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that AVH experienced in the context of BPD are in need of proper diagnosis and treatment, and that antipsychotics tend to be beneficial in treating these (and other psychotic) symptoms. There is an urgent need for studies assessing the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy and non-invasive brain stimulation in this underdiagnosed and undertreated group.

AB  - The knowledge that diverse populations of dopaminergic neurons within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) can be distinguished in terms of their molecular, electrophysiological and functional properties, as well as their differential projections to cortical and subcortical regions has significance for key brain functions, such as the regulation of motivation, working memory and sensorimotor control. Almost without exception, this understanding has evolved from landmark studies performed in the male sex. However, converging evidence from both clinical and pre-clinical studies illustrates that the structure and functioning of the VTA dopaminergic systems are intrinsically different in males and females. This may be driven by sex differences in the hormonal environment during adulthood ('activational' effects) and development (perinatal and/or pubertal 'organizational' effects), as well as genetic factors, especially the SRY gene on the Y chromosome in males, which is expressed in a sub-population of adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Stress and stress hormones, especially glucocorticoids, are important factors which interact with the VTA dopaminergic systems in order to achieve behavioral adaptation and enable the individual to cope with environmental change. Here, also, there is male/female diversity not only during adulthood, but also in early life when neurobiological programing by stress or glucocorticoid exposure differentially impacts dopaminergic developmental trajectories in male and female brains. This may have enduring consequences for individual resilience or susceptibility to pathophysiological change induced by stressors in later life, with potential translational significance for sex bias commonly found in disorders involving dysfunction of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic systems. These findings highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of the sexual dimorphism in the VTA if we are to improve strategies for the prevention and treatment of debilitating conditions which differentially affect men and women in their prevalence and nature, including schizophrenia, attention/deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, anxiety, depression and addiction.

AB  - The state of animal models for bipolar disorder (BPD) is deficient, creating a major problem in the research related to this devastating disorder and in our ability to translate molecular findings to the clinic. An ideal model, a "bipolar animal" is most likely unattainable as long as we do not fully understand the biological basis of the disorder, and no models are currently available to reflect the cycling nature of the disease. Yet, additional, better and more practical models need to be developed to support research efforts in the field. The present paper suggests two approaches for the development of new models. The first approach, recently introduced in the literature, is based on modeling different facets of the disease with an attempt to create a test battery that will cover a number of BPD-related behaviors. Whereas each separate model may not have strong validity when used alone, additional strength may come when certain models are combined. One example for modeling a facet of the disorder is brought showing that aggressive behavior in resident mice can be ameliorated by the dissimilar mood stabilizers lithium and valproate suggesting a possible use of the model as part of the battery, representing the aggressive facet of mania. The second approach is based on identifying behavioral differences between existing strains of animals and identifying strains that may have a behavioral phenotype that resembles aspects of BPD. A similar approach has been used previously to model other psycliiatric disorders and can be utilized for BPD research. An example of this possible approach is shown with the Black Swiss mice strain that appears to have more manic-like behaviors compared to other strains. Both approaches will not culminate to an ideal, all encompassing model of BPD but may provide useful and relatively uncomplicated tools for research of the disorder.

AB  - Drivers in public transportation are at risk of experiencing potential traumatic events such as accidents involving persons, collisions, or suicides. In this context, the question arises to what extent psychological traumatization and posttraumatic diseases occur.
   The aim of this systematic review was to describe the frequency and nature of work-related posttraumatic disorders, to analyze risk and prognostic factors after potentially traumatic events (accidents resulting in damage to property and/or in injury or death), and address sick leave after such events in the realm of public transportation, based on the available literature.
   Systematic review based on four databases (PubMed, PSYNDEX/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, PILOTS) between 1980 and June 2013.
   We identified seven studies (four longitudinal, three cross-sectional) that examine employees after person under train (PUT) events. PTSD prevalences varied broadly between 0.7 and 17 %. The same applies to dysthymia/neurotic depression (1-26 %). However, similarly low prevalences of major depression (1.3-2.8 %) and panic disorder (0.5-1.3 %) have been observed. Risk factors of PTSD comprised individual, work-related, event-related, and prognostic aspects. Following the traumatic event, a total of 69-81 % of the drivers were absent, and if sick leave occurs, this was on average 3-19 days.
   It became evident that drivers in public transportation run a high risk of sick leave. It was also striking that despite the immense impact of PUT and high number of suicides, only an infinitesimal number of studies exists. Due to various differences (period of follow-up, instrument of measurement and study period), it turned out that the comparability of the results of the studies is limited. For various reasons, further research is urgently needed, as from an occupational health point of view the issue of posttraumatic diseases and implications for fitness for service should be addressed.

AB  - Background Secondary schools in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) provide health promotion, preventive, and early intervention services. Nevertheless, literature indicates that the modules of these services are either adapted or modified from existing mental health programs in developed countries. The literature also highlights the provision of non-comprehensive services (mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention), in LMICs. These findings inform the need for undertaking this systematic literature review. The aim of this review was thus to identify the modules of school-based mental health programs (SBMHP) that have been implemented in LMICs to guide the development of a culturally sensitive comprehensive mental health program for adolescents in a LMIC country. Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was used to guide this review. The following databases were searched in September 2018, to identify the relevant literature: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and ERIC. The search was conducted by the first author and reviewed by the authors. Results Following the screening process, a total of 11 papers were identified and reviewed for quality. The systematic review highlighted that the mental health programs provided in schools included: an introduction module, a communication and relationship module, a psychoeducation module, a cognitive skills module, a behavioral skills module, establishing social networks for recovery and help seeking behavioral activities and a summary/conclusion module. Conclusion This review sheds light on the characteristics of the programs in LMICs. Two programs were found to be universal in nature. Five programs were directed at key risk factors or at-risk groups, and four were early intervention programs. The review also revealed that only one program out of the 11 programs included modules for parents. The synthesis indicated that all the identified programs were adapted or modified from existing programs. The dearth of comprehensive programs in LMICs was also revealed. Lastly, the review revealed seven modules that can be useful for developing a SBMHP.

AB  - Today it is well acknowledged that both nature and nurture play important roles in the genesis of psychopathologies, including drug addiction. Increasing evidence suggests that genetic factors contribute for at least 40-60% of the variation in liability to drug dependence. Human genetic studies suggest that multiple genes of small effect, rather than single genes, contribute to the genesis of behavioral psychopathologies. Therefore, the use of inbred rat strains might provide a valuable tool to identify differences, linked to genotype, important in liability to addiction and related disorders. In this regard, Lewis and Fischer 344 inbred rats have been proposed as a model of genetic vulnerability to drug addiction, given their innate differences in sensitivity to the reinforcing and rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, as well their different responsiveness to stressful stimuli. This review will provide evidence in support of this model for the study of the genetic influence on addiction vulnerability, with particular emphasis on differences in mesolimbic dopamine (DA) transmission, rewarding and emotional function. It will be highlighted that Lewis and Fischer 344 rats differ not only in several indices of DA transmission and adaptive changes following repeated drug exposure, but also in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness, influencing not only the ability of the individual to cope with stressful events, but also interfering with rewarding and motivational processes, given the influence of corticosteroids on dopamine neuron functionality. Further differences between the two strains, as impulsivity or anxiousness, might contribute to their different proneness to addiction, and likely these features might be linked to their different DA neurotransmission plasticity. Although differences in other neurotransmitter systems might deserve further investigation, results from the reviewed studies might open new vistas in understanding aberrant deviations in reward and motivational functions.

AB  - Considerable research has been undertaken regarding the mental health inequalities experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI+) youth as a consequence of societal and individual prejudice, stigma and discrimination. Far less research has focussed on protective factors that promote wellbeing for this population. A scoping review was conducted using a six-stage methodological framework, and is reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR statement. This explored the extent, range and nature of the peer-reviewed, published, academic literature on what is known about the protective factors that promote LGBTI+ youth wellbeing. Six databases were systematically searched applying Population-Concept-Context key inclusion criteria, complemented by contact with authors to identify additional sources, reference checks and hand searches. Ninety-six individual research records were identified and analysed, drawing from Honneth's Recognition Theory. Interpersonal relations with parents (n = 40), peers (n = 32) and providers (n = 22) were associated with indicators of enhanced wellbeing, as were LGBTI+ community relations (n = 32). Importantly, online (n = 10), faith (n = 10) and cultural (n = 5) communities were potentially protective. Content and thematic analysis highlighted the importance of Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) (n = 23) offering powerful protective opportunities through intersecting interpersonal, community and legal forms of recognition. GSAs enhance allyship by peers and providers (n = 21), facilitate access to LGBTI+ community networks (n = 11) and co-exist alongside inclusive policies (n = 12), curricular (n = 5) and extracurricular activities (n = 1). This scoping review underscores the need to move beyond the predominant focus on risk factors for LGBTI+ youth, which subsequently inform protectionist approaches. It concludes with an appeal to develop mechanisms to apply recognitive justice to policy, practice and, importantly, future research directions. This emphasises the salience of enhanced understandings of inclusion, which is rights-based, universally available and of potential benefit to all.

AB  - BackgroundDespite robust evidence of fathers' impact on children and mothers, engaging with fathers is one of the least well-explored and articulated aspects of parenting interventions. It is therefore critical to evaluate implicit and explicit biases manifested in current approaches to research, intervention, and policy.
   MethodsWe conducted a systematic database and a thematic hand search of the global literature on parenting interventions. Studies were selected from Medline, Psychinfo, SSCI, and Cochrane databases, and from gray literature on parenting programs, using multiple search terms for parent, father, intervention, and evaluation. We tabulated single programs and undertook systematic quality coding to review the evidence base in terms of the scope and nature of data reporting.
   ResultsAfter screening 786 nonduplicate records, we identified 199 publications that presented evidence on father participation and impact in parenting interventions. With some notable exceptions, few interventions disaggregate father' or couple' effects in their evaluation, being mostly driven by a focus on the mother-child dyad. We identified seven key barriers to engaging fathers in parenting programs, pertaining to cultural, institutional, professional, operational, content, resource, and policy considerations in their design and delivery.
   ConclusionsBarriers to engaging men as parents work against father inclusion as well as father retention, and undervalue coparenting as contrasted with mothering. Robust evaluations of father participation and father impact on child or family outcomes are stymied by the ways in which parenting interventions are currently designed, delivered, and evaluated. Three key priorities are to engage fathers and coparenting couples successfully, to disaggregate process and impact data by fathers, mothers, and coparents, and to pay greater attention to issues of reach, sustainability, cost, equity, and scale-up. Clarity of purpose with respect to gender-differentiated and coparenting issues in the design, delivery, and evaluation of parenting programs will constitute a game change in this field.

He expands his own contributions to the literature over the last fifteen years, incorporating the burgeoning data from research on disturbances of attachment as precursor to dissociation. Utilizing clinical material, he then contrasts DID with trauma and dissociation in adulthood as well as with schizophrenia. He contends that the complexity and myriad. manifestations of this condition warrant deeper psychoanalytic exploration to help elucidate not only its true nature, but also to further our understanding of all psychopathology.

AB  - What kind mechanisms one deems central for the evolutionary process deeply influences one's understanding of the nature of organisms, including cognition. Reversely, adopting a certain approach to the nature of life and cognition and the relationship between them or between the organism and its environment should affect one's view of evolutionary theory. This paper explores this reciprocal relationship in more detail. In particular it argues that the view of living and cognitive systems, especially humans, as deeply integrated beings embedded in and transformed by their genetic, epigenetic (molecular and cellular), behavioral, ecological, socio-cultural and cognitive-symbolic legacies calls for an extended evolutionary synthesis that goes beyond either a theory of genes juxtaposed against a theory of cultural evolution and or even more sophisticated theories of gene-culture coevolution and niche construction. Environments, particularly in the form of developmental environments, do not just select for variation, they also create new variation by influencing development through the reliable transmission of non-genetic but heritable information. This paper stresses particularly views of embodied, embedded, enacted and extended cognition, and their relationship to those aspects of extended inheritance that lie between genetic and cultural inheritance, the still gray area of epigenetic and behavioral inheritance systems that play a role in parental effect. These are the processes that can be regarded as transgenerational developmental plasticity and that I think can most fruitfully contribute to, and be investigated by, developmental psychology.

It is argued that this would be a further step forward in the evolution of mental health services as it would benefit the service users, their families, carers and staff working in acute psychiatric inpatient units.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide primary care physicians and medical specialists with an experiential psychosomatic framework for understanding patients with body distress symptoms. The framework relies on somatic awareness, a normal part of consciousness, to resolve the dualism inherent in conventional multidisciplinary approaches. Somatic awareness represents a guiding healing heuristic which acknowledges the validity of the patient's physical symptoms and uses body sensations to identify the psychological, physiological, and social factors needed for symptom self-regulation. The experiential approach is based on psychobiologic concepts which include bodily distress disorder, central sensitization, dysfunctional breathing, and contextual nature of mood.

AB  - Rett syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder and a leading cause of severe mental retardation in girls. The nature of the cognitive abnormalities in Rett, as described in humans and other animal models, and its potential reversibility and treatment are the subject of this review. Rett syndrome is associated with severe mental retardation and a host of impairments that include social and motor deficits, and respiratory and bone abnormalities. More than 80% of Rett girls have mutations in the gene that encodes MeCP2, which is a protein with a complex set of functions that include transcriptional repression and activation. The complex phenotype associated with Rett and the knowledge of the causal genetic mutation provide a unique opportunity within the autism spectrum to explore the relationship between transcriptional control, brain abnormalities and specific behavioral functions, importantly the elusive cognitive dysfunctions associated with mental retardation. The nature of the cognitive abnormalities related to Rett and the potential reversibility and treatment of these abnormalities have not been studied as extensively as some of the other aspects of the Rett phenotype. The cognitive phenotype associated with Rett is also less well studied relative to that in other well known developmental disorders, such as Down syndrome and Fragile X. Nevertheless, some recent studies provide hope that the cognitive impairments, as well as other symptoms of Rett, can be rescued. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Face processing relies on a distributed, patchy network of cortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes that respond disproportionately to face stimuli, other cortical regions that are not even primarily visual (such as somatosensory cortex), and subcortical structures such as the amygdala. Higher-level face perception abilities, such as judging identity, emotion and trustworthiness, appear to rely on an intact face-processing network that includes the occipital face area (OFA), whereas lower-level face categorization abilities, such as discriminating faces from objects, can be achieved without OFA, perhaps via the direct connections to the fusiform face area (FFA) from several extrastriate cortical areas. Some lesion, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings argue against a strict feed-forward hierarchical model of face perception, in which the OFA is the principal and common source of input for other visual and non-visual cortical regions involved in face perception, including the FFA, face-selective superior temporal sulcus and somatosensory cortex. Instead, these findings point to a more interactive model in which higher-level face perception abilities depend on the interplay between several functionally and anatomically distinct neural regions. Furthermore, the nature of these interactions may depend on the particular demands of the task. We review the lesion and TMS literature on this topic and highlight the dynamic and distributed nature of face processing.

AB  - Recent findings in psychiatric genetics have crystallized concerns that diagnostic categories used in the clinic map poorly onto the underlying biology. If we are to harness developments in genetics and neuroscience to understand disease mechanisms and develop new treatments, we need new approaches to patient stratification that recognize the complexity and continuous nature of psychiatric traits and that are not constrained by current categorical approaches. Recognizing this, the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) has developed a novel framework to encourage more research of this kind. The implications of these recent findings and funding policy developments for neuroscience research are considerable.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread form of dementia, characterized by memory loss and reduction of cognitive functions that strongly interfere with normal daily life. Numerous evidences show that aggregates of the amyloid beta peptide, formed by 39 to 42 amino acid residues (A beta 39-43), from soluble small oligomers to large fibrils are characteristic markers of this pathology. However, AD is a complex disease and its neurodegenerative molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood. Growing evidence suggests a link between A beta polymorphic nature, oligomers and fibrils, and specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration. The A beta variable nature and its multiplicity of interactions with different proteins and organelles reflect the complexity of this pathology. In this review, we analyze the effects of the interaction between A beta peptide and different cellular compartments in relation to the different kinds and sizes of amyloid aggregates. In particular, A beta interaction with different cell structures such as the plasma membrane, mitochondria, lysosomes, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum is discussed. Further, we analyze the A beta peptide ability to modify the structure and function of the target organelle, inducing alteration of its physiological role thus contributing to the pathological event. Dysfunction of cellular components terminating with the activation of the cellular death mechanism and subsequent neurodegeneration is also taken into consideration.

AB  - Objective self-awareness theory has undergone fundamental changes in the 3 decades since Duval and Wicklund's (1972) original formation. We review new evidence that bears on the basic tenets of the theory. Many of the assumptions of self-awareness theory require revision, particularly how expectancies influence approach and avoidance of self-standard discrepancies; the nature of standards, especially when they are changed; and the role of causal attribution in directing discrepancy reduction. However, several unresolved conceptual issues remain; future theoretical and empirical directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent thinking in positive psychology has promoted the idea that positive and moral emotions facilitate prosocial (perhaps caring) behavior (Fredrickson, 2004; Haidt, 2003a). One prominent theory proposes that certain affective dispositions (e.g., empathy, gratitude) serve as "moral motives" for prosocial action, as they provide a link between other facets of moral character and prosocial action (McCullough, Kilpatrick, Emmons, and Larsen, 2001). Following this line of thought, and the social intuitionist model of moral motivation (SIM motivation) presented in Part 2, this article introduces (hypothesizes) a conceptual model of ten moral emotion-related capacities (virtues) that recent research suggests may be fundamental to a flourishing capacity for generative care: trust, love, elevation, empathy, compassion, gratitude, positive pride, guilt, forgiveness, and humility. The objectives of this article are, first, to describe this model; second, to suggest future directions for theoretical and empirical development of the model; and third, to discuss how it contributes to the emerging relational spirituality paradigm (Hall, 2004; Shults & Sandage, 2006). The article proposes that these moral affective capacities (MACs) represent one plausible model of the "virtues of acknowledged dependence" (Machityre, 1999), an "ecology of virtue" that describes the nature of a flourishing relational environment (Flanagan, 2007), and capacities that likely motivate and enable Christian kenotic love (Polkinghorne, 2001). The article concludes by looking ahead to future discussions of emotion and transformation in the relational spirituality paradigm, specifically the nature of the moral dilemma that persons encounter as they strive to develop a virtuous character (Leffel, 2007c).

AB  - Objective: Pyschonouroimmunology, which investigates the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the immune system, has been greatly advanced by the use of animal models. The objective of this paper is to describe animal models of disease that can or might be utilized to elucidate neural-immune interactions that alter pathogenesis.
   Methods: This paper reviews animal studies that have demonstrated a link among the brain, behavior, immunity, and disease, highlighting models in which the potential contribution of CNS-immune interactions has not yet been explored.
   Results: Animal studies allow for careful control of environmental stimuli, genetic background, and immunological challenge. As such, they are an important component of psychoneuroimmunology research. Models in which one might study the role of psychosocial factors in immunologically mediated disease processes, as in the case of other pathophysiologic processes, profit from an ability to manipulate both stressful events and the magnitude of the challenge to the immune system.
   Conclusions: Animal studies in psychoneuroimmunology highlight the complexity of the interactions among behavior, the brain, the immune system, and pathogen. The genetic background of the animal (both in terms of central nervous and immune system responses), its previous history, the nature of the stressor, the nature of the pathogen and the type of immune response generated are some of the interacting factors that determine the magnitude and direction of stress-induced changes in disease outcome.

AB  - The last few years have seen a rapid growth of interest amongst researchers in the crossmodal correspondences. One of the correspondences that has long intrigued artists is the putative association between colours and odours. While traditionally conceptualised in terms of synaesthesia, over the last quarter century or so, at least 20 published peer-reviewed articles have assessed the consistent, and non-random, nature of the colours that people intuitively associate with specific (both familiar and unfamiliar) odours in a non-food context. Having demonstrated such consistent mappings amongst the general (i.e. non-synaesthetic) population, researchers have now started to investigate whether they are shared cross-culturally, and to document their developmental acquisition. Over the years, several different explanations have been put forward by researchers for the existence of crossmodal correspondences, including the statistical, semantic, structural, and emotional-mediation accounts. While several of these approaches would appear to have some explanatory validity as far as the odour-colour correspondences are concerned, contemporary researchers have focussed on learned associations as the dominant explanatory framework. The nature of the colour-odour associations that have been reported to date appear to depend on the familiarity of the odour and the ease of source naming, and hence the kind of association/representation that is accessed. While the bidirectionality of odour-colour correspondences has not yet been rigorously assessed, many designers are nevertheless already starting to build on odour-colour crossmodal correspondences in their packaging/labelling/branding work.

These methods constitute psychodynamically oriented ways of assessing therapeutic change in psychological structures in both long-term, intensive and brief treatment. We also consider how differences in pretreatment characteristics among patients have an important impact on the therapeutic process and on the nature of therapeutic change.

AB  - Although there is an abundance of evidence linking the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to adverse early-life experiences, the precise nature of the association remains unclear. Some evidence suggests early-life adversity leads to cortisol hyper-reactivity, while other evidence suggests adversity leads to cortisol hypo-reactivity. Here, we distinguish between trauma and adversity, and use p-curves to interrogate the conflicting literature. In Study 1, trauma was operationalized according to DSM-5 criteria; the p-curve analysis included 68 articles and revealed that the literature reporting associations between trauma and blunted cortisol reactivity contains evidential value. Study 2 examined the relationship between adversity and cortisol reactivity. Thirty articles were included in the analysis, and p-curve demonstrated that adversity is related to heightened cortisol reactivity. These results support an inverted U-shaped function relating severity of adversity and cortisol reactivity, and underscore the importance of distinguishing between "trauma" and "adversity".

   Studies on work ability published from 1985 to 2006 were identified through a structured search in PubMed, and Web of Science. Studies were included if the WAI was used as measure of work ability and if quantitative information was presented on determinants of work ability.
   In total, 20 studies were included with 14 cross-sectional studies and six longitudinal studies. Factors associated with poor work ability, as defined by WAI, were lack of leisure-time vigorous physical activity, poor musculoskeletal capacity, older age, obesity, high mental work demands, lack of autonomy, poor physical work environment, and high physical work load.
   The WAI is associated with individual characteristics, lifestyle, demands at work, and physical condition. This multifactorial nature of work ability should be taken into account in health promotion programmes aimed at maintaining and promoting the participation of the labour force and improvement of the performance at work.

AB  - Recently, the relationship between visual art and brain function and disease has raised considerable interest among neurologists, neuroscientists, and artists themselves. Visual art production involves multiple processes including basic motor skills, such as the coordination of movements, visual spatial processing, emotional output, a socio-cultural context, as well as obviously creativity. Thus, the relationship between artistic output and brain diseases is particularly complex, and brain disorders may lead to an impairment of artistic production in multiple domains. Understanding the nature of aphasia, which leads to significant changes in human life in the physical, psychological, social and professional sphere, makes us aware of the importance of the individual (objective and subjective) and the social (collective and cultural) self system in the process of creation, especially in artists. Observing the works of artists with aphasia, we notice that each of them perceives the surrounding world differently. One wonders what makes them present reality in one way and not in another. It is true that all works of art show reality in thousands of different ways, and only an unoriginal artist will employ someone else's vision - one already used in a work. It should not be forgotten, however, that the work of artists with aphasia often takes on features resulting from the nature of the problems they face and is initially unoriginal, as they have to overcome fundamental technical difficulties and problems of technique. In this article, we present the possibilities for rehabilitation, of strengthening artists with aphasia, in order for them to find the self lost as a result of illness.

AB  - The evidence supporting the involvement of a number of systems in the neurobiological etiopathology of psychosis has recently grown exponentially. Indeed, the focus of research has changed from measuring solely neurotransmitters to estimating parameters from fields like immunity, stress/endocrine, redox, and metabolism. Yet, little is known regarding the exact role of each one of these fields on the formation of not only the brain neuropathological substrate in psychosis but also the associated general systemic pathology, in terms of causality directions. Research has shown deviations in the levels and/or function of basic effector molecules of the aforementioned fields namely cytokines, pro-/anti- oxidants, glucocorticoids, catecholamines, glucose, and lipids metabolites as well as kynurenines, in psychosis. Yet the evidence regarding their impact on neurotransmitters is minimal and the findings concerning these systems' interactions in the psychotic context are even more dispersed. The present review aims to draw holistically the frame of the hitherto known "players" in the field of psychosis' cellular pathobiology, with a particular focus on their in-between interactions.

AB  - The human brain has a remarkable capacity to adapt to and learn from a wide range of variations in the environment. However, environmental challenges can also precipitate psychiatric disorders in susceptible individuals. Why any given experience should induce one brain to adapt while another is edged toward psychopathology remains poorly understood. Like all aspects of psychological function, both nature (genetics) and nurture (life experience) sculpt the brain's response to stressful stimuli. Here we review how these two influences intersect at the epigenetic regulation of neuronal gene transcription, and we discuss how the regulation of genomic DNA methylation near key stress-response genes may influence psychological susceptibility or resilience to environmental stressors. Our goal is to offer a perspective on the epigenetics of stress responses that works to bridge the gap between the study of this molecular process in animal models and its potential usefulness for understanding stress vulnerabilities in humans.

AB  - There are several independent prospective studies showing that a wide variety of forms of prenatal stress can have long-term effects on the behavioural and cognitive outcome for the child. Animal studies have shown that prenatal stress, as well as affecting behaviour, can also reprogram the function of the HPA axis in the offspring. However, the effects on the HPA axis are very variable depending on the nature of the stress, its timing in gestation, the genetic strain of the animal, the sex and age of the offspring and whether basal or stimulated HPA axis responses are studied. There are also several recent studies showing long-term effects of prenatal stress on basal cortisol levels, or cortisol responses to stress, in humans. The designs of these studies differ considerably, many are small, and the effects on outcome are also varied. There is little evidence, so far, that altered function of the HPA axis in the child mediates the behavioural or cognitive alterations observed to be associated with prenatal stress.

AB  - Through a systematic review of the literature, we draw attention to factors associated with burnout and the effects on the military with a special focus on the US Air Force. Our review consists of the military and human resource development (HRD) literature on burnout. We integrate insights from the review of both literature on burnout and develop a conceptual model based on four major themes. First, significant factors associated with burnout such as the occupational nature of work were identified. The second and third themes describe the effects of burnout on the individual (health and reduced professional efficacy) and organization (commitment, job performance, and increased turnover). Fourth, strategies for minimizing burnout suggest that leadership support is important for service members. Specifically, a climate of support through open communication, realistic resiliency training, and expanding opportunities for career growth are likely to mitigate burnout. We utilize military and HRD perspectives on burnout and present implications for theory and research, as well as recommendations, for improving practice in military settings.

AB  - Contemporary biological psychiatry uses clinical and experimental (animal) models to increase our understanding of brain pathogenesis. Modeling psychiatric disorders is currently performed by targeting various key neurobehavioral clusters of phenotypic traits (domains), including affective, cognitive, social, motor and reward. Analyses of such domains and their 'smaller units' - individual endophenotypes - are critical for the study of complex brain disorders and their neural underpinnings. The spectrum nature of brain disorders and the importance of pathogenetic linkage among various disordered domains or endophenotypes have also been recognized as an important strategic direction of translational research. Here, we discuss cross-domain analyses of animal models, and focus on their value for mimicking the clinical overlap between disordered neurobehavioral domains in humans. Based on recent experimental evidence, we argue that understanding of brain pathogenesis requires modeling the clinically relevant inter-relationships between various individual endophenotypes (or their domains).

AB  - Individuals diagnosed with major mental disorders such as schizophrenia are more likely to have engaged in violent behavior than mentally healthy members of the same communities. Although aggressive acts can have numerous causes, research about the underlying neurobiology of violence and aggression in schizophrenia can lead to a better understanding of the heterogeneous nature of that behavior and can assist in developing new treatment strategies. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent literature and discuss some of the neurobiological correlates of aggression and violence. The focus will be on schizophrenia, and the results of neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies that have directly investigated brain functioning and/or structure in aggressive and violent samples will be discussed as well as other domains that might predispose to aggression and violence such as deficits in responding to the emotional expressions of others, impulsivity, and psychopathological symptoms. Finally gender differences regarding aggression and violence are discussed. In this context several methodological and conceptional issues that limited the comparison of these studies will be addressed.

AB  - Currently, there is a lot of interest in cannabis use as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia. Cognitive dysfunction associated with long-term or heavy cannabis use is similar in many respects to the cognitive endophenotypes that have been proposed as vulnerability markers of schizophrenia. In this overview, we examine the similarities between these in the context of the neurobiology underlying cognitive dysfunction, particularly implicating the endogenous cannabinoid system, which plays a significant role in attention, learning and memory, and in general, inhibitory regulatory mechanisms in the brain. Closer examination of the cognitive deficits associated with specific parameters of cannabis use and interactions with neurodevelopmental stages and neural substrates will better inform our understanding of the nature of the association between cannabis use and psychosis. The theoretical and clinical significance of further research in this field is in enhancing our understanding of underlying pathophysiology and improving the provision of treatments for substance use and mental illness.

AB  - Rationale: The devastating nature of schizophrenia and treatment limitations have triggered a search for early detection methods to enable interventions to be implemented as soon as the first signs and symptoms appear. In this effort, several studies have investigated the cognitive functions in individuals regarded as being in at-risk mental states (ARMS) for psychosis.
   Objective: Our aim was to make a systematic review of the literature regarding basic and social cognition in individuals in ARMS following the guidelines of the PRISMA statement.
   Results: In general, the results of the 49 articles included in the review show that individuals in ARMS have pervasive cognitive deficits that seem to be greater in individuals who later convert to psychosis.
   Conclusions: Cognitive impairment can be detected in individuals considered to be in ARMS according to current classifications and may serve as a risk marker for psychotic conversion; however, the lack of standardized criteria to define ARMS and of homogeneous cognitive assessment methods hamper the generalization of findings from different studies.

AB  - Psychosis confers a disproportionate risk of violence on women compared with men, but such women barely affect national crime statistics anywhere. Much research in the field does not include women at all. In our literature review. we found that information about women, psychosis and violence generally had to be extracted from studies including women but focussing on men; not uncommonly analyses 'controlled for gender' rather than treating it as interesting in itself. A tendency for women to be older than men at onset of psychosis may not apply to those who become violent, but women with psychosis do seem to start offending later and desist sooner. Rates of seriously adverse childhood experiences are similar between women and men with psychosis. except for sexual abuse-more frequently reported by the women. Some evidence of special patterns for women in the nature of psychosis and violence relationships requires more exploration, as do treatment questions. With so few women in any one service, multi-centre co-operation in research with them will be essential. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is ample empirical evidence for an asymmetry in the way that adults use positive versus negative information to make sense of their world; specifically, across an array of psychological situations and tasks, adults display a negativity bias, or the propensity to attend to, learn from, and use negative information far more than positive information. This bias is argued to serve critical evolutionarily adaptive functions, but its developmental presence and ontogenetic emergence have never been seriously considered. The authors argue for the existence of the negativity bias in early development and that it is evident especially in research on infant social referencing but also in other developmental domains. They discuss ontogenetic mechanisms underlying the emergence of this bias and explore not only its evolutionary but also its developmental functions and consequences. Throughout, the authors suggest ways to further examine the negativity bias in infants and older children, and they make testable predictions that would help clarify the nature of the negativity bias during early development.

AB  - Conscious experience is fluid; it rarely remains on one topic for an extended period without deviation. Its dynamic nature is illustrated by the experience of mind wandering, in which attention switches from a current task to unrelated thoughts and feelings. Studies exploring the phenomenology of mind wandering highlight the importance of its content and relation to meta-cognition in determining its functional outcomes. Examination of the information-processing demands of the mind-wandering state suggests that it involves perceptual decoupling to escape the constraints of the moment, its content arises from episodic and affective processes, and its regulation relies on executive control. Mind wandering also involves a complex balance of costs and benefits: Its association with various kinds of error underlines its cost, whereas its relationship to creativity and future planning suggest its potential value. Although essential to the stream of consciousness, various strategies may minimize the downsides of mind wandering while maintaining its productive aspects.

AB  - Focusing on avoiding failure or negative outcomes (avoidance motivation) can undermine creativity, due to cognitive (e.g., threat appraisals), affective (e.g., anxiety), and volitional processes (e.g., low intrinsic motivation). This can be problematic for people who are avoidance motivated by nature and in situations in which threats or potential losses are salient. Here, we review the relation between avoidance motivation and creativity, and the processes underlying this relation. We highlight the role of optimism as a potential remedy for the creativity undermining effects of avoidance motivation due to its impact on the underlying processes. Optimism, expecting to succeed in achieving success or avoiding failure, may reduce negative effects of avoidance motivation, as it eases threat appraisals, anxiety, and disengagement-barriers playing a key role in undermining creativity. People experience these barriers more under avoidance than under approach motivation, and beneficial effects of optimism should therefore be more pronounced under avoidance than approach motivation. Moreover, due to their eagerness, approach motivated people may even be more prone to unrealistic over-optimism and its negative consequences.

AB  - Intelligence (i.e., g, general mental ability) is an individual difference that is arguably more important than ever for success in the constantly changing, ever more complex world of business (Boal, 2004; Gatewood, Field, & Barrick, 2011). Although the field of industrialorganizational (IO) psychology initially made substantial contributions to the study of intelligence and its use in applied settings (e.g., Hunter, 1980; Schmidt & Hunter, 1981), we have done relatively little in recent times about studying the nature of the intelligence construct and its measurement. Instead, we have focused predominately on using intelligence to predict performance outcomes and examine racial subgroup differences on intelligence test scores. Although the field of IO psychology continues to approach intelligence at a surface level, other fields (e.g., clinical psychology, developmental and educational research, and neuropsychology) have continued to study this construct with greater depth and have consequently made more substantial progress in understanding this critical and complex construct. The purpose of this article is to note this lack of progress in IO psychology and to challenge our field to mount new research initiatives on this critical construct.

AB  - The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the literature on team resilience to gain insight into current thinking regarding its definition and conceptualisation, and to identify how researchers have operationalised and measured this concept. We conducted a systematic scoping review using the 5-phase approach proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. A total of seven databases were searched, followed by a citation search of eligible papers via Google Scholar. Of the 275 articles identified via the search process, 27 papers were deemed eligible for review. Several key findings regarding the literature on team resilience were observed: (i) definitions varied in terms of content (e.g. input or process), breadth (e.g. unidimensional versus multidimensional), and quality (e.g. essential and necessary attributes of key components); (ii) there was a predominance of single-level conceptualisations of team resilience; and (iii) there has been a reliance on cross-sectional research designs in empirical studies, which is incongruent with the dynamic nature of this concept. Key recommendations from this scoping review focus on definitional, theoretical, and methodological issues.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the nature of the emotion recognition deficit in Huntington's disease (HD). There are conflicting reports of disproportionate impairments for some emotions in some modalities in HD.
   A systematic review and narrative synthesis was conducted for studies investigating emotion recognition in HD. Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Pubmed were searched from 1993 to 2010, and citations and reference lists were searched. 1724 citations were identified. Sixteen studies were included. In manifest HD evidence of impaired recognition of facial expressions of anger was found consistently, although recognition of all negative emotions (facial and vocal) tended to be impaired. In premanifest HD impairments were inconsistent, but are seen in all facial expressions of negative emotion. Inconsistency may represent the variability inherent in HD although may also be due to between-study differences in methodology.
   Current evidence supports the conclusion that recognition of all negative emotions tends to be impaired in HD, particularly in the facial domain. Future work should focus on using more ecologically-valid tests, and testing inter-modality differences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Visual perspective during autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval influences how people remember the emotional aspects of memories. Prior research in emotion regulation has also shown that shifting from an own eyes to an observer-like perspective is an efficient way of regulating the affect elicited by emotional AMs. However, the impact of shifting visual perspective is also dependent on the nature of the emotion associated with the event. The current review synthesizes behavioral and functional neuroimaging findings from the event memory and emotion regulation literature that examine how adopting particular visual perspectives and actively shifting across them during retrieval alters emotional experience, by primarily focusing on emotional intensity. We review current theories explaining why shifts in perspectives may or may not change the emotional characteristics of memories, then propose a new theory, suggesting that the own eyes and observer-like perspectives are two different retrieval orientations supported by differential neural activations that lead episodic details to be reconstructed in specific ways.

AB  - This paper aims to synthesize research relating to youth responses to school shootings between 2014 and 2017. The main questions it addresses are how such events impact young people psychologically, and what risk or protective factors may contribute to different trajectories of recovery?
   Recent research suggests that most young people exposed to school shootings demonstrate resilience, exhibiting no long-term dysfunction. However, a minority will experience severe and chronic symptoms. The likelihood of experiencing clinically significant reactions is influenced by pre-trauma functioning as well as peri-traumatic and post-traumatic factors. These include proximity to the trauma, peri-traumatic dissociation, post-traumatic emotional regulation difficulties, social support, and flexibility of coping styles.
   Research that separates the distinguishing features of young people with differing recovery styles is vital to tailor intervention. But methodological and design issues associated with such research necessitates caution in drawing conclusions. Variation in definitions and measures and the self-report nature of many of the studies are potential sources of bias. Greater uniformity across designs would enhance confidence and allow for improved evidence-based intervention.

AB  - A central issue in evolutionary quantitative genetics is to understand how genetic variation for quantitative traits is maintained in natural populations. Estimates of genetic variation and of genetic correlations and pleiotropy among multiple traits, inbreeding depression, mutation rates for fitness and quantitative traits and of the strength and nature of selection are all required to evaluate theoretical models of the maintenance of genetic variation. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that a substantial fraction of segregating variation for fitness-related traits in Drosophila is due to rare deleterious alleles maintained by mutation-selection balance, with a smaller but significant fraction attributable to intermediate frequency alleles maintained by alleles with antagonistic pleiotropic effects, and late-age-specific effects. However, the nature of segregating variation for traits under stabilizing selection is less clear and requires more detailed knowledge of the loci, mutation rates, allelic effects and frequencies of molecular polymorphisms affecting variation in suites of pleiotropically connected traits. Recent studies in D. melanogaster have revealed unexpectedly complex genetic architectures of many quantitative traits, with large numbers of pleiotropic genes and alleles with sex-, environment-and genetic background-specific effects. Future genome wide association analyses of many quantitative traits on a common panel of fully sequenced Drosophila strains will provide much needed empirical data on the molecular genetic basis of quantitative traits.

AB  - Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to represent the mental states of oneself and others, is an essential social skill disrupted across many psychiatric conditions. The transdiagnostic nature of ToM impairment means it is plausible that ToM impairment is related to alexithymia (difficulties identifying and describing one's own emotions), as alexithymia is seen across psychiatric conditions. Whilst many studies have examined links between alexithymia and ToM, results are mixed. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to provide a taxonomy of ToM tests and assess their relationship with alexithymia. Tests are grouped according to whether they assess propensity to engage spontaneously in ToM or accuracy of ToM inferences, with tests further subdivided into those that do, and do not, require emotion recognition. A review of 63 suitable studies suggests that alexithymia is often associated with reduced ToM, and inaccurate ToM when tasks require emotion recognition. This latter finding appears due to impaired emotion recognition, rather than ToM impairment per se. Further directions and considerations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Dramatic changes take place in the neural physiology and emotional behavior of the human infant during the first 2 years of life. Evidence suggests that certain variations in the infant's early social environment, such as disturbances in mother-infant interaction that are associated with maternal depression, influence the development of biological systems related to the expression and regulation of emotion, particularly those systems involved in frontal lobe, autonomic, and adrenocortical functioning. In this essay, we provide an overview of the links between maternal depression and disruptions in early social and emotional development, and we highlight parallels between disturbances in biological systems found in depressed adults and those found in infants of mothers experiencing depression. We then discuss the possibility of sensitive periods for the enduring influences of maternal depression on the emotional development of these children and for increased risk for affective disorder. Finally, we point to directions for further research on the nature of the intergenerational transmission of emotional disturbance.

AB  - In this short review we discuss the notion of lepton numbers. The strong evidence in favor of neutrino oscillations obtained recently in the super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment and in solar neutrino experiments imply that the law of conservation of family lepton numbers L-e, L-mu and L-tau is strongly violated. We consider the flavor neutrinos v(e), v(mu), and v(tau) and we discuss the evolution of these states in space time in the case of nonconservation of family lepton numbers due to the mixing of light neutrinos. We discuss and compare different flavor neutrino discovery experiments. We stress that experiments on the search for v(mu) --> v(tau) and v(e) --> v(tau) oscillations demonstrated that the flavor neutrino v(tau) is a new type of neutrino, different from v(e) and v(mu). In the case of neutrino mixing, the lepton number (only one) is connected with the nature of massive neutrinos. Such a conserved lepton number exists if massive neutrinos are Dirac particles. We review possibilities to check in future experiments whether the conserved lepton number exists.

AB  - Growing research has highlighted that the first few years of psychotic illnesses constitute a "critical period" in which (i) the majority of the functional deterioration that accompanies these illnesses occurs, and (ii) individuals are most responsive to both pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for psychosis and its deleterious sequelae. Clinical interest in intervening earlier in psychotic episodes, and what early intervention might mean for a person's symptom reduction and social functioning, has emerged within a decades-long history of social science research on the concept of recovery. In this article, we describe the intersection between that long-standing interest in recovery and the more recent attention to first-episode psychosis to explore conundrums that may arise as clinicians engage with their clients following a first episode of psychosis. We suggest ways of addressing these situations by highlighting several complementary or alternative approaches to traditional psychiatric treatment and conclude with a call to rethink ways of doing research on recovery in first-episode psychosis.

Methods: The literature review was performed in the MEDLINE, SciELO, and PsycINFO databases. To evaluate the quality of the studies included in the review, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used. Results: Thirty-one studies were included, and the majority found an association between exposure to toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (58.3 and 54.5% of the included papers, respectively), but not major depressive disorder. We found no significant difference in mean quality scores between studies that corroborated and contradicted the association hypothesis for either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. All included papers were considered at least satisfactory according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (total scores X 6 out of 9). Conclusion: Although there was no association between exposure to toxoplasmosis and major depressive disorder, the results indicate an association with both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, despite their heterogeneity. Further studies should be performed with more specific variables so that the nature of these relationships can be elucidated.

AB  - Chronic diseases commonly entail disability and are highly comorbid with mental health problems, particularly depression. Prevalence of depression across different disabling conditions affecting adult patients, as well as risk factors for depression in these patient groups are reviewed in the current work, with a particular focus on the literature published in the past 5 years. The prevalence of depression in disabling conditions is higher than in the general population and is associated with different factors. Examples of disease-specific factors include neurological implications of stoke, diabetic related conditions (e.g. amputation), limitations imposed by vision loss caused by age-related eye diseases, fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis, and pain in cancer. Common factors identified across different conditions include pre-morbid depression, history of mental health problems, poor social support, disease-related disability, multi-morbidity, and less adaptive coping strategies. We also reviewed studies suggesting a potential bidirectional relationship between depression and chronic disease, particularly for stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and potential factors mediating that relationship. Current findings suggested that long-term depression might be associated with an increased risk of subsequent physical health problems, although the nature of that relationship and its underlying mechanisms are still unclear.

AB  - The literature on personality traits and defense mechanisms suggests individual differences in two self-favoring tendencies, which we label "egoistic bias" and "moralistic bias." The two biases are self-deceptive in nature and can be traced to two fundamental values, agency and communion, that impel two corresponding motives, nPower and nApproval. The two sequences of values, motives, and biases form two personality constellations, Alpha and Gamma. Associated with Alpha is an egoistic bias, a self-deceptive tendency to exaggerate one's social and intellectual status. This tendency leads to unrealistically positive self-perceptions on such traits as dominance, fearlessness, emotional stability, intellect, and creativity. Self-perceptions of high Alpha scorers have a narcissistic, "superhero" quality. Associated with Gamma is a moralistic bias, a self-deceptive tendency to deny socially deviant impulses and to claim sanctimonious "saint-like" attributes. This tendency is played out in overly positive self-perceptions on such traits as agreeableness, dutifulness, and restraint. The Alpha-Gamma conception provides an integrative framework for a number of central issues in personality psychology.

AB  - This review examines the U.S. federal response to the crisis in child mental health in relation to its efforts to address the crisis in public education. By presenting side-by-side federal responses to these two seemingly unrelated crises, this review highlights the co-occurring nature of the problems. The interconnectedness of these crises explains in part why the federal initiatives that have dealt with these problems separately, in isolation, have been minimal in their effectiveness. It is concluded, therefore, that federal efforts in improving children's mental health and academic performance should be integrated to achieve optimal outcomes. From a national policy perspective, we recommend that children's social-emotional development be incorporated into reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act. This policy enhancement could effectuate (a) a broader accountability system for both academic performance and socialemotional development, and (b) a greater system of care for child mental health with schools as the focal point.

AB  - Over the past few decades, there has been increasing interest in the study of social impairment in schizophrenia. However, the concept of social functioning has been poorly defined in the literature. This article highlights the global and multi-factorial nature of social functioning and reviews the theoretical determinants of social dysfunction in schizophrenia. Emphasis is placed on outlining the social cognitive deficits that may occur. The study of social cognition appears particularly promising in elucidating our understanding of the development of social impairment in schizophrenia and has the potential to improve current psychosocial interventions. However, continued advances depend upon the existence of reliable and well-validated measures of social functioning and social cognition. A selection of measures are reviewed in this article in an attempt to highlight the importance of assessing multiple aspects of social functioning in schizophrenia and to assist researchers in the selection of appropriate measures. Future efforts should be directed towards the continued validation of social functioning and social cognitive measures and their adaptation for use in at-risk and early psychosis populations.

AB  - Purpose of Review The complex nature of narcolepsy symptoms, along with the use of stimulants and anticataplectic medications, poses diagnostic difficulties in terms of underlying neuropsychiatric comorbidities. This study reviews recent evidence for the association between narcolepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders. We also critically analyze studies that have addressed the neuropsychiatric correlates of patients with narcolepsy, with a discussion of the possible pathophysiological mechanisms linking narcolepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent Findings Neuropsychiatric manifestations are common among patients with narcolepsy as narcolepsy and some neuropsychiatric disorders share common clinical features. This may create challenges in making the correct diagnosis, and hence result in a delay in starting appropriate treatment. Comorbid neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients with narcolepsy include depression, anxiety, psychosis, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and cognitive impairment. Although hypocretin deficiency has been proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying both narcolepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders, further research is necessary to identify the exact mechanisms. Narcolepsy patients often manifest comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, which makes the diagnosis difficult. Therefore, it is essential to address neuropsychiatric symptoms in the clinical care of patients with narcolepsy.

AB  - Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) resulting from aneurysmal bleeding may exhibit serious neuropsychiatric sequelae, often more disabling from the perspective of rehabilitation than any neurological impairment. This notwithstanding, little is known about their nature and mechanisms. Affective symptoms and personality change remain the more frequently reported psychiatric complications but most studies have not used standard diagnostic categories. Neuropsychological deficits are better documented, but there is still no consensus regarding prevalence, and studies are hampered by methodological weakness. 'Off-the-shelf instruments seem to detect less cognitive impairment than ad-hoc psychometry. Few studies have made use of modern imaging techniques. Certain types of surgery, for example trapping, give rise to high rates of amnestic impairment. It is not yet fully determined whether pre-operative vasospasm, high blood pressure on admission, neurological grade, site of aneurysm, laterality, presence of haematoma and hydrocephalus also predict bad neuropsychological outcome. Further evaluation of the predictive power of the variables predicting bad neurobehavioural outcome is urgently needed so that thay can be made to influence pre-operative neurosurgical decisions.

TI  - Social exclusion and mental health
AB  - Background The concept of social exclusion is now widely used in discussions about the nature of disadvantage, and there are ongoing initiatives to promote social inclusion among those with mental health problems. Aims To conduct a conceptual and methodological review of social exclusion, focusing initially on the origins and definitions of the concept and then on approaches to its measurement, both in general and in relation to mental health. Method We used two main strategies. First, we utilised expertise within the study team to identify major texts and reviews on social exclusion and related topics. Second, we searched major bibliographic databases for literature on social exclusion and mental health. We adopted a non-quantitative approach to synthesising the findings. Results There is no single accepted definition of social exclusion. However, most emphasise lack of participation in social activities as the core characteristic. There are a number of approaches to measuring social exclusion, including use of indicator lists and dimensions. In the mental health literature, social exclusion is poorly defined and measured. Conclusions If social exclusion is a useful concept for understanding the social experiences of those with mental health problems, there is an urgent need for more conceptual and methodological work.

AB  - The health of migrant children is a pressing issue. While most African migration takes place within Africa, a significant number of African migrants travel to outside of the continent. This article reports findings from a scoping review on the health of African immigrant children from sub-Saharan Africa now living outside of Africa. A systematic search for studies published between 2000 and 2019 resulted in only 20 studies reporting on the health of children up to 18 years of age migrating from sub-Saharan Africa. Data from these articles were thematically analyzed, highlighting concerns related to the children's nutrition status (n = 8), mental health (n = 7), and physical health (n = 5). Study participants were primarily from Somali and Ethiopia, and most studies were conducted in Australia or Israel. The review highlights several gaps related to the scope, range, and nature of evidence on the health of African immigrant children living outside of Africa. In particular, most focus on children's nutritional and mental health, but pay little attention to other health concerns this specific population may encounter or to the benefits associated with effective responses.

Pediatric central nervous system (CNS) diseases create both short- and long-term impairments and disabilities and are therefore one of the leading causes for emotional, financial, and social burden to patients, their families, and their social network. The significant pediatric morbidity and mortality rates caused by CNS diseases call for equally significant efforts toward a better understanding of the etiology and nature of these disorders. Recent studies show the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in various aspects of central nervous system development and neuropsychiatric diseases. This review focuses on the role of miRNAs in different pediatric neurological conditions. We emphasize the importance of microRNA-based research in combating pediatric neurological disorders. We believe this approach will result in novel therapies to secure normal development and prevent disabilities in the pediatric population.

AB  - In the field of psychology, the first studies in experimental aesthetics were conducted approximately 140 years ago. Since then, research has mainly concentrated on aesthetic responses to visual art. Both the aesthetic experience of music and, especially, its development have received rather limited attention. Moreover, until now, very little attention has been paid to the investigation of the aesthetic experience of music using neuroscientific methods. Aesthetic experiences are multidimensional and include inter alia sensory, perceptual, affective, and cognitive components. Aesthetic processes are usually experienced as pleasing and rewarding and are, thus, important and valuable experiences for many people. Because of their multidimensional nature, these processes employ several brain areas. In the present review, we examine important psychological and neural mechanisms that are believed to contribute to the development of aesthetic experiences of music. We also discuss relevant research findings. With the present review, we wish to provoke further discussion and possible future investigations as we consider the investigation of aesthetic experiences to be important both scientifically and with respect to potential clinical applications.

AB  - Executive dysfunction can be present from the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is characterized by deficits in internal control of attention, set shifting, planning, inhibitory control, dual task performance, and on a range of decision-making and social cognition tasks. Treatment with dopaminergic medication has variable effects on executive deficits, improving some, leaving some unchanged, and worsening others. In this review, we start by defining the specific nature of executive dysfunction in PD and describe suitable neuropsychological tests. We then discuss how executive deficits relate to pathology in specific territories of the basal ganglia, consider the impact of dopaminergic treatment on executive function (EF) in this context, and review the changes in EFs with disease progression. In later sections, we summarize correlates of executive dysfunction in PD with motor performance (e.g., postural instability, freezing of gait) and a variety of psychiatric (e.g., depression, apathy) and other clinical symptoms, and finally discuss the implications of these for the patients' daily life.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in late life, will become even more prevalent by midcentury, constituting a major global health concern with huge implications for individuals and society. Despite scientific breakthroughs during the past decades that have expanded our knowledge on the cellular and molecular bases of AD, therapies that effectively halt disease progression are still lacking, and focused efforts are needed to address this public health challenge. Because AD is classically recognized as a disease of memory, studies have mainly focused on investigating memory-associated brain defects. However, compelling evidence has indicated that additional brain regions, not classically linked to memory, are also affected in the course of disease. In this review, we outline the current understanding of key pathophysiological mechanisms in AD and their clinical manifestation. We also highlight how considering the complex nature of AD pathogenesis, and exploring repurposed drug approaches can pave the road toward the development of novel therapeutics for AD.

AB  - Stress is an integral part of modern life. Although there is a large body of literature regarding the harmful effects of chronic stress on different aspects of human life, acute stress is the most common form of stress, resulting from the demands and pressures of the recent past and the anticipated demands and pressures of the near future. In spite of its pervasive nature, less attention has been paid to the impact of acute stress on sensory processing than to the consequences of chronic stress, particularly concerning auditory processing. In this systematic review, the impact of experimental acute stress on the auditory processing of healthy adults was investigated. The results revealed the adverse effects of acute physical and psychological stresses on auditory processing. According to the open field of research on stress and the auditory system and the high possibility of experiencing different types of acute stresses in various life environments, including testing places, it seems that more investigations are needed to identify and manage different types of acute stresses in both clinical and research situations.

AB  - Visuoperceptive deficits are frequently reported in severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) and are considered as pervasive and persistent in time. While this topic of investigation has previously driven researchers' interest, far fewer studies have focused on visuoperception in SAUD since the '90s, leaving open central questions regarding the origin and implications of these deficits. To renew research in the field and provide a solid background to work upon, this paper reviews the neural correlates of visuoperception in SAUD, based on data from neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. Results reveal structural and functional changes within the visual system but also in the connections between occipital and frontal areas. We highlight the lack of integration of these findings in the dominant models of vision which stress the dynamic nature of the visual system and consider the presence of both bottom-up and top-down cerebral mechanisms. Visuoperceptive changes are also discussed in the framework of long-lasting debates regarding the influence of demographic and alcohol-related factors, together stressing the presence of inter-individual differences. Capitalizing on this review, we provide guidelines to inform future research, and ultimately improve clinical care.

AB  - Antidepressants are the mainstay of drug treatment for moderate or severe postpartum depression. Knowledge of predictors of response could help optimize treatment and reduce the adverse consequences of postpartum depression. The purpose of this systematic review was to ascertain predictors of response or remission to antidepressant treatment in women with postpartum depression. The electronic databases of MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Evidence-based Medicine Reviews were searched through December 2019. The search was limited to studies published in the English language. Reference lists of articles that met the inclusion criteria were also searched. We identified some predictors of response and remission that could potentially assist in the optimization of drug treatment of postpartum depression; however, caution is needed to apply these findings in clinical practice due to the heterogeneous nature of postpartum depression. The results of our review highlight the urgent need to identify predictors of response, non-response, or remission to antidepressants in women with postpartum depression.

AB  - Objective Early stress events severely impact brain and behaviour. From a neurobiological point of view early stress influences neuroanatomical structures and is associated with a dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The objective of this article is to review the epigenetic alterations implicated in brain adaptation to early stress events. Method A review of empirical research of epigenetic alterations associated to early stress events was performed. Results Neuroanatomic and epigenetic alterations have been observed after early stress events. Epigenetics alterations include DNA methylation, histones modifications and microRNA (miRNA) expression. The most studied is largely the former, affecting genes involved in neuroendocrine, neurotransmission and neuroplasticity regulation after early stress exposition. It includes glucocorticoid receptor, FK506-binding protein 5, arginine vasopressin, oestrogen receptor alpha, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine transporter and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Conclusion Epigenetic regulation is critical in the interplay between nature and nurture. Alterations in the DNA methylation as well as histones modifications and miRNA expression patterns could explain abnormal behaviours secondary to early stress events.

AB  - The current era is characterized by rapid changes, multiple transitions, an emphasis on communication skills, and the frequent need to adapt to new social frameworks. Consequently, in recent years, there has been a rise in awareness regarding the consequences of shyness, a phenomenon that dictates various aspects of a person's life, for example, career choices and forming relationships. Research in this field indicates the necessity of supporting shy individuals from an early age in order to assist them expand the scope of their social experiences and realize their personal potential. This review sums up the theory and the research of support for shy pupils in the school framework. There are two parts to the article. The first reviews the nature of shyness, including its impact on the lives of children, adolescents, and adults, and risk and protective factors. The second part focuses on support of shy pupils in educational frameworks, including teachers' outlooks on the subject, supportive strategies, and a proposal for how to present the subject to teachers. The last part describes directions for further research.

AB  - Objective The aims of this systematic literature review were to identify and synthesise all relevant information about targeted parents' characteristics and experiences from their own perspective. Method The academic databases Web of Science, PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE-ELSEVIER, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and conference abstracts were systematically searched from their inception until May 2018. The systematic review followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocol (PRISMA-P) and was registered in PROSPERO (ID = CRD42017062533). Results Nine relevant articles were included after conducting inclusion criteria and quality assessment. Data were collated and analysed using guidance on the conduct of narrative synthesis in systematic reviews. Conclusion Targeted parents report consistent stories about the nature of the alienation tactics used by alienating parents across the included studies. Targeted parents expressed dissatisfaction with legal and mental health system services available to them. Further, despite feeling despair, frustration, and isolation, targeted parents appear to be resilient and seek out positive coping strategies. This review showed that research on targeted parents from their own perspective is sparse, and more studies are needed.

Methods: A selective sample of the cardiovascular reactivity literature was reviewed, from 1932 to present. Results: In the earliest model, cardiovascular reactivity was regarded as a marker of disease risk; however, in later models, reactivity came to be viewed as a causal influence in the development of hypertension. As the models evolved, the underlying assumptions changed. Thus, the risk marker model assumed that cardiovascular responses to stress were a stable, generalized characteristic of the individual, and therefore the eliciting stimuli were arbitrary. The later models, however, assume that the nature of the eliciting stimulus is a determinant of the cardiovascular response, We describe the increasing complexity of the four models, and contrast their underlying assumptions and the implications of these assumptions. Conclusion: We provide an overview of study designs and variables that should be incorporated into studies seeking to understand the ways in which cardiovascular responses to stress may influence the development of hypertension.

AB  - Despite gaps in research, this review argues for distinguishing family maltreatment from family violence, a differentiation between minimal or moderate abuse and serious endangerment, physical injury, or sexual violation. Most acts now defined as violent or abusive are moderate, and stressful life circumstances contribute to their development. Research suggests that abuse may develop through multiple pathways. The consequences of abuse appear to he general, but more commonalities may be found by examining more subtle and complex effects. Many interventions have attempted to prevent or treat family violence and its consequences, and several show promise. More systematic research is needed, but several changes in intervention seem warranted now. For instance, (a) mental health professionals should not be required to report maltreatment while a family is engaged in therapy; (b) the social service system needs to rediscover its roots in supporting families under stress, including in cases of moderate maltreatment; and (c) swift and decisive legal intervention is needed in cases of serious family violence.

AB  - This chapter examines connections between research in music, neurology, and psychology during the late-nineteenth century. Researchers in all three disciplines investigated how music is processed by the brain. Psychologists and comparative musicologists, such as Carl Stumpf, thought in terms of multiple levels of sensory processing and mental representation. Early thinking about music processing can be linked to the start of Gestalt psychology. Neurologists such as August Knoblauch also discussed multiple levels of music processing, basing speculation on ideas about language processing. Knoblauch and others attempted to localize music function in the brain. Other neurologists, such as John Hughlings Jackson, discussed a dissociation between music as an emotional system and language as an intellectual system. Richard Wallaschek seems to have been the only one from the late-nineteenth century to synthesize ideas from musicology, psychology, and neurology. He used ideas from psychology to explain music processing and audience reactions and also used case studies from neurology to support arguments about the nature of music. Understanding the history of this research sheds light on the development of all three disciplines-musicology, neurology, and psychology.

AB  - Obesity and mood disorders are highly prevalent and co-morbid. Epidemiological studies have highlighted the public health relevance of this association, insofar as both conditions and its co-occurrence are associated with a staggering illness-associated burden. Accumulating evidence indicates that obesity and mood disorders are intrinsically linked and share a series of clinical, neurobiological, genetic and environmental factors. The relationship of these conditions has been described as convergent and bidirectional; and some authors have attempted to describe a specific subtype of mood disorders characterized by a higher incidence of obesity and metabolic problems. However, the nature of this association remains poorly understood. There are significant inconsistencies in the studies evaluating metabolic and mood disorders; and, as a result, several questions persist about the validity and the generalizability of the findings. An important limitation in this area of research is the noteworthy phenotypic and pathophysiological heterogeneity of metabolic and mood disorders. Although clinically useful, categorical classifications in both conditions have limited heuristic value and its use hinders a more comprehensive understanding of the association between metabolic and mood disorders. A recent trend in psychiatry is to move toward a domain specific approach, wherein psychopathology constructs are agnostic to DSM-defined diagnostic categories and, instead, there is an effort to categorize domains based on pathogenic substrates, as proposed by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC). Moreover, the substrates subserving psychopathology seems to be unspecific and extend into other medical illnesses that share in common brain consequences, which includes metabolic disorders. Overall, accumulating evidence indicates that there is a consistent association of multiple abnormalities in neuropsychological constructs, as well as correspondent brain abnormalities, with broad-based metabolic dysfunction, suggesting, therefore, that the existence of a "metabolic-mood syndrome" is possible. Nonetheless, empirical evidence is necessary to support and develop this concept. Future research should focus on dimensional constructs and employ integrative, multidisciplinary and multimodal approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This document is a practical guide to the management of major depression for adults over the age of 18 and represents the consensus of experts in the field regarding current scientific knowledge and rational clinical practice. This guideline strives to be as free as possible of bias toward any theoretical posture, and it aims to represent a practical approach to treatment. Studies were identified through an extensive review of the literature using MEDLARS for the period 1971-1991. The key words used were ''affective disorder,'' ''major depression,'' ''depressive disorder,'' ''seasonal affective disorder,'' ''melancholia,'' ''unipolar depression,'' ''endogenous depression,'' ''dysthymic disorder,'' ''postpartum depression,'' ''pseudodementia,'' ''antidepressant drugs,'' ''tricyclic antidepressive agents,'' ''monoamine oxidase inhibitors,'' 'lithium,'' and ''electroconvulsive therapy.'' Major review articles and standard psychiatric texts were consulted. Review articles and relevant prospective randomized clinical trials were reviewed in their entirety; other studies were selected for review on the basis of their relevance to the particular issues discussed in this guideline. Definitive standards are difficult to achieve, except in narrow circumstances where multiple replicated studies and wide clinical opinion dictate certain forms of treatment. In other areas much is left to the clinical judgment and expertise of the clinician. The recommendations delineated in this guideline are in some instances based on data distilled from randomized prospective clinical trials, while in other areas they are based on individual case reports along with the collective experience and judgment of well-regarded senior psychiatrists. In order that the reader may identify the type of evidence supporting the major recommendations in this practice guide, each is keyed to one or more references and each reference is followed by a letter code in brackets that indicates the nature of the supporting evidence. The codes are defined at the beginning of the reference section, which appears at the end of this document. Minor recommendations not keyed to references may be assumed to be based on expert opinion. This guideline contains a table providing relevant information pertaining to the antidepressant medications described in the body of the document.

AB  - Background: Community gardening is defined by its shared nature; gardeners work collectively to manage a garden for shared benefit. Although communal gardening activities, and recognition of their perceived benefits have a long history, it is in recent years that interest has developed in assessing the potential of the approach to address many of the threats to health and wellbeing faced by global populations. Community gardening may address chronic and non-communicable disease through the provision of opportunities for physical activity, improved nutrition and reduced stress. Participation in the gardening activities may improve wellbeing through increased social contact, culturally valued activities and mitigation of food poverty. The benefits of community gardening are argued to extend beyond the participants themselves through more coherent and cohesive communities, improved physical environments and the sharing of the products of the labour. While there are many claims made and an emerging body of research, no previous systematic review has sought to identify and synthesise the evidence in a global context.
   Methods: The objectives of the mixed method systematic review are to understand the health and wellbeing impacts of active participation in community gardening. Both quantitative and qualitative evidence will be sought using a broad and diverse search strategy to address the four review questions:
   1) does active involvement in community gardening lead to improved health or wellbeing;
   2) if so, how does active involvement in community gardening affect health and wellbeing;
   3) are there different impacts for different population groups (for instance according to age, socio-economic status or sex); and
   4) do different types of community gardening (for example producing vegetables or a flower garden) or in different contexts have different types of impacts?
   A theoretical framework, informed by an initial theory of change model, will illustrate the outcomes of participation and any mechanisms of action (i.e. how such impacts are achieved). The synthesis will be sensitive to factors which may affect the impacts, such as the context of the activities, the demographics of participants, and the implementation and specifics of the community gardening interventions.

AB  - Background: Bipolar disorder phenomenologically is a biphasic disorder of energy availability; increased in mania and decreased in depression. In consort, there is accumulating evidence indicating increased mitochondrial respiration and ATP production in bipolar mania which contrasts with decreased mitochondrial function in patients in the euthymic or depressive phase of the illness. Consequently, the central thesis of this paper is that bipolar disorder is due to a phasic dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenergetics. The elements responsible for this dysregulation may thus represent critical treatment targets for mood disorders, and are the subject of this paper.
   Discussion: There are many potential mediators of mitochondrial function which collectively are implicated in bipolar disorder. Levels of oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines and intracellular calcium ions are all higher in bipolar mania than in the euthymic and depressive phases of the illness. Increased levels of calcium ions can partly account for increased oxidative phosphorylation via well documented pathways such as the modulation of the F-1-F-0 elements of ATP synthase. Likewise, increased levels of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to the upregulation of AMPK, SIRT-1, SIRT-3 and NADI(+) which directly stimulate oxidative phosphorylation. Uric acid and melatonin are also differentially elevated in bipolar mania and both molecules stimulate the production of ATP. The pro-apoptotic, neurotoxic and mitotoxic effects of elevated glutamate, dopamine and GSK-3 in bipolar mania may be counterbalanced by higher basal levels and activity of p53, Bcl-2, PI3K and Akt in an environment of elevated uric acid and decreased BDNF.
   Summary: Details of these pathways are discussed as an explanatory model for the existence of increased ATP generation in mania. We also offer a model explaining the biphasic nature of mitochondrial respiration in bipolar disorder and the transition between mania and depression based on increasing levels of TNF alpha, ROS, NO, AMPK and SIRT-1 together with the antagonistic relationship between p53 and NF-kappa B.

AB  - Background: Guilt feelings have received considerable attention in past psychological theory and research. Several studies have been conducted that represent a range of views and propose various implications of guilt in children and adolescents. Variations in theoretical definitions of guilt, emphasizing a lack of measurement convergence, make it difficult to derive a comprehensive definition of the construct in childhood and adolescence. Research shows substantial variability in instruments used to measure guilt in children and adolescents.
   Purpose: The aim is to discuss existing contributions, illustrating the empirical validity of the available instruments used to measure guilt and identifying the nature of their theoretical backgrounds among children and adolescents.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the following databases: PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed (all years up to February 19, 2020). Search terms were compiled into three concepts for all databases: "measure," "guilt," and "childhood/adolescence." In addition, a search was conducted to detect the gray literature.
   Results: After removing the duplicates, a total of 1,408 records were screened, resulting in the identification of 166 full-text articles to be further scrutinized. Upon closer examination, there was consensus that 148 of those studies met the study inclusion criteria or were not retrieved. Twenty-five studies were included in the quality assessment. The data were organized on three main categories: (1) interpersonal or prosocial guilt; (2) intrapunitive guilt or that referring to an excessive sense of responsibility; (3) not specifying a theoretical construct. A great heterogeneity in psychometric evaluations and substantial variability in guilt construct emerged. The construct most represented and supported by valid instruments was interpersonal or prosocial guilt. Analysis of the gray literature showed that some instruments were not immediately available to the clinical and scientific communities.
   Conclusions: The studies analyzed and selected for qualitative review employed various instruments to measure guilt. Results confirmed what is widely documented in the literature about substantial variability in instruments used to measure guilt. We argue the need to develop measures that assess currently overlooked dimensions of guilt and to provide further additional information about the psychometric proprieties of the available developed instruments.

AB  - Background: Receiving a child's autism diagnosis can be stressful; as such, parent resolution contributes to the wellbeing and development of healthy parent-child relationships. In other significant childhood diagnoses (e.g., cerebral palsy, diabetes), the degree to which parents adjust to (a) their child's diagnosis and (b) their changes in expectations concerning their child's development and capacity (referred to as resolution to diagnosis), has been associated with improved outcomes including facilitating parent-child relationships and improved parental wellbeing. Given potential benefits to parent and child, and the heterogenous nature of autism, examining the unique factors associated with resolution to diagnosis is important. In this systematic review we identified factors that support or inhibit parental resolution to their child receiving a diagnosis of autism.Methods: We completed a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines of peer-reviewed studies from 2017 to 2022, that investigated parental resolution or acceptance of an autism diagnosis. Papers including "acceptance " needed to encompass both accepting the diagnosis and the implications regarding the child's abilities. We searched six databases (Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ProQuest), with additional papers located following review of reference lists.Results: Fourteen papers with 592 participants that investigated parental resolution or acceptance of an autism diagnosis, were included. We identified six common factors that facilitate or inhibit parental resolution and acceptance of an autism diagnosis including: symptom severity; religion, belief, and culture; knowledge and uncertainty; negative emotions (i.e., denial, shame, guilt); positive emotions; and support. Greater resolution was associated with improved "attunement and insightfulness " in the parent-child relationship.Limitation: The review was limited by the small number of studies meeting inclusion criteria. Second, the quality of included studies was mixed, with over half of the studies being qualitative and only one randomized control trial (RCT) identified.Conclusion: Parental resolution can have an impact on parent's perception of their child's capabilities and impact the parent-child relationship. We identified six categories that aid in inhibiting or promoting resolution to diagnosis. Despite taking a broad approach on the definition of resolution, the low number of studies identified in the review indicates a need for more research in this area.Systematic review registration http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/,PROSPERO [ID: CRD42022336283].

AB  - The scale of the Deepwater Horizon disaster was and is unprecedented: geographic extent, pollutant amount, countermeasure scope, and of most relevance to this Research Topic issue, range of ecotypes affected. These ecotypes include coastal/nearshore, continental shelf, deep benthic, and open-ocean domains, the last of which is the subject of this synthesis. The open-ocean ecotype comprises similar to 90% of the volume of the Gulf of Mexico. The exact percentage of this ecotype contaminated with toxins is unknown due to its three-dimensional nature and dynamics, but estimates suggest that the footprint encompassed most of its eastern half. Further, interactions between the water column and the deep benthos may be persistent, making this synthesis one of time (a decade) rather than event conclusion. Here we examine key elements of the open-ocean ecosystem, with emphasis on vulnerability and resilience. Of paramount importance relative to the Gulf nearshore and shelf ecotypes, pre-disaster baseline data were lacking for most of the fauna. In such cases, inferences were drawn from post-disaster assessments. Both phytoplankton and mesozooplankton vulnerabilities were quite high, but resilience appeared equally so. The phytoplankton situation was a bit more complex in that toxin-imposed reductions may have been offset by nutrient injection via high freshwater discharge in 2010. Intermediate trophic levels exhibited population-level depressions, ostensibly due to high vulnerability and low resilience. Apex predator impacts were variable. Certain large epipelagic fishes may have avoided the highest concentrations of hydrocarbons/dispersant, and thus larval abundances returned to pre-disaster levels of variability and abundance within a few years after a steep initial decline. Oceanic cetaceans, particularly shallow-diving stenellid dolphins, did not appear to avoid oiled waters and exhibited strong declines in the northern Gulf. Given that population declines of many open-ocean taxa appear to be ongoing a decade later, we conclude that this largest of Gulf ecosystem components, like its deep-benthic counterpart, is as fragile as it is voluminous. This is particularly concerning given the rapid, and likely irreversible, shift to deeper waters by the US and Mexican oil industries in concert with the higher likelihood of accidents with increasing platform depth.

AB  - Background: Comorbidity between mental and physical disorder conditions is the rule rather than the exception. It is estimated that 25% of adult population have mental health condition and 68% of them suffer from comorbid medical condition. Readmission rates in psychiatric patients are high and we still lack understanding potential predictors of recidivism. Physical comorbidity could be one of important risk factors for psychiatric readmission. The aim of the present study was to review the impact of physical comorbidity variables on readmission after discharge from psychiatric or general inpatient care among patients with co-occurring psychiatric and medical conditions.
   Methods: A comprehensive database search from January 1990 to June 2014 was performed in the following bibliographic databases: Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, ProQuest Health Management, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. An integrative research review was conducted on 23 observational studies.
   Results: Six studies documented physical comorbidity variables only at admission/discharge and 17 also at readmission. The main body of studies supported the hypothesis that patients with mental disorders are at increased risk of readmission if they had co-occurring medical condition. The impact of physical comorbidity variables on psychiatric readmission was most frequently studied in in patients with affective and substance use disorders (SUD). Most common physical comorbidity variables with higher probability for psychiatric readmission were associated with certain category of psychiatric diagnoses. Chronic lung conditions, hepatitis C virus infection, hypertension and number of medical diagnoses were associated with increased risk of readmission in SUD; Charlson Comorbidity Index, somatic complaints, physical health problems with serious mental illnesses (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, personality disorders); not specified medical illness, somatic complaints, number of medical diagnoses, hyperthyroidism with affective disorders (depression, bipolar disorder). Co-occurring physical and mental disorders can worsen patient's course of illness leading to hospital readmission also due to non-psychiatric reasons.
   Conclusions: The association between physical comorbidity and psychiatric readmission is still poorly understood phenomenon. Nevertheless, that physical comorbid conditions are more common among readmitted patients than single admission patients, their association with readmission can vary according to the nature of mental disorders, characteristics of study population, applied concept of comorbidity, and study protocol.

AB  - Background: Trauma is highly prevalent, and women are twice as likely as men to develop posttraumatic stress dis-order following a traumatic exposure. Consequently, many women entering the perinatal period have trauma histories. In the perinatal period, a trauma history can negatively impact treatment engagement and adversely affect the experience of pregnancy, postpartum, and parenting. A trauma-informed care approach can mitigate these effects. Objective: This review aims to summarize literature that can aid psychiatrists in (1) identifying signs and symptoms of trauma in perinatal women, (2) integrating elements of trauma-informed care into perinatal mental health care, and (3) offering interventions that can minimize adverse outcomes for perinatal women and their children. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted with keywords including trauma, pregnancy, perinatal, posttraumatic stress disorder, postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder, and trauma informed care. Results: Perinatal care, given its somewhat invasive nature, has the potential to traumatize or cause retraumatization. Trauma-related disorders are common and can present or worsen in the perinatal period. Trauma can manifest in multiple forms in this population, including exacerbation of preexisting posttraumatic stress disorder, new onset acute stress disorder in the perinatal period, or postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder secondary to traumatic childbirth. Unaddressed trauma can adversely affect the experience of pregnancy, postpartum, and parenting. Psychiatrists caring for women in the perinatal period are in an ideal position to screen for trauma and offer appropriate intervention. A trauma-informed approach to obstetric care can help clinical teams respond to the unique trauma-related challenges that can arise during obstetric care. Trauma-informed care, with its emphasis on estab-lishing a culture of safety, transparency, trustworthiness, collaboration, and mutuality, can empower health care providers and systems with powerful tools to respond to trauma and its myriad effects in a strengths-based manner. By applying a trauma-informed lens, psychiatrists can help their obstetric colleagues provide patient-centered compas-sionate care and treatment.Conclusions: Applying a trauma-informed approach to evaluation and treatment of perinatal populations could decrease the toll trauma has on affected women and their children.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of perinatal depression is high and its adverse effects on mothers and infants are extensive. Several studies have explored the relationship between perinatal depression and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), but little is known about the nature and magnitude of this effect. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the HRQoL of mothers with perinatal depression and compare the HRQoL of depressed mothers with that of non-depressed mothers.
   Methods: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the VIP Database, and the Wan Fang Database were searched. The retrieval time was from the establishment of the database to July 2020. A series of meta-analyses were run for each outcome pertaining to HRQoL sub-measures. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on country income category and time period.
   Results: Of 7,945 studies identified, 12 articles were included in the meta-analysis, providing HRQoL data for 4,392 mothers. Compared with non-depressed mothers, mothers with perinatal depression reported significantly poor scores across all the quality-of-life domains. Mixed-effects analysis showed that there was no difference in the HRQoL scores of mothers with antepartum and postpartum depression. Mothers with perinatal depression in higher-income countries reported higher disability on role-physical (p = 0.02) and social functioning domains (p = 0.001) than those from lower-income countries.
   Limitations: Due to insufficient data, no regression analysis was performed. The inability to accurately determine the difference in HRQoL between antepartum and postpartum depression was because of the restriction of the included studies. Moreover, most of the included studies were conducted in middle-income countries and may have an impact on the applicability of the results. Subgroup analyses are observational and not based on random comparisons. The results of subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution.
   Conclusion: HRQoL is compromised in mothers with perinatal depression. Continuous efforts are required to improve the HRQoL of perinatal depressed mothers.

TI  - Setting health research priorities using the CHNRI method: VII. A review of the first 50 applications of the CHNRI method
KW  - RESEARCH INVESTMENTS
AB  - Background Several recent reviews of the methods used to set research priorities have identified the CHNRI method (acronym derived from the "Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative") as an approach that clearly became popular and widely used over the past decade. In this paper we review the first 50 examples of application of the CHNRI method, published between 2007 and 2016, and summarize the most important messages that emerged from those experiences.
   Methods We conducted a literature review to identify the first 50 examples of application of the CHNRI method in chronological order. We searched Google Scholar, PubMed and so-called grey literature.
   Results Initially, between 2007 and 2011, the CHNRI method was mainly used for setting research priorities to address global child health issues, although the first cases of application outside this field (eg, mental health, disabilities and zoonoses) were also recorded. Since 2012 the CHNRI method was used more widely, expanding into the topics such as adolescent health, dementia, national health policy and education. The majority of the exercises were focused on issues that were only relevant to low-and middle-income countries, and national-level applications are on the rise. The first CHNRI-based articles adhered to the five recommended priority-setting criteria, but by 2016 more than two-thirds of all conducted exercises departed from recommendations, modifying the CHNRI method to suit each particular exercise. This was done not only by changing the number of criteria used, but also by introducing some entirely new criteria (eg, "low cost", "sustainability", "acceptability", "feasibility", "relevance" and others).
   Conclusions The popularity of the CHNRI method in setting health research priorities can be attributed to several key conceptual advances that have addressed common concerns. The method is systematic in nature, offering an acceptable framework for handling many research questions. It is also transparent and replicable, because it clearly defines the context and priority-setting criteria. It is democratic, as it relies on "crowd-sourcing". It is inclusive, fostering "ownership" of the results by ensuring that various groups invest in the process. It is very flexible and adjustable to many different contexts and needs. Finally, it is simple and relatively inexpensive to conduct, which we believe is one of the main reasons for its uptake by many groups globally, particularly those in low-and middle-income countries.

AB  - Traditionally, the basal ganglia have been viewed as motor structures. It is only in the past 20 years that it has been recognized that these structures also may have a role in cognition and emotion. This revision of opinion has been based on several strands of evidence: anatomical, physiological, clinical, and functional imaging. Clinical studies have highlighted the range of cognitive deficits and behavioral and psychiatric disturbances that can occur in patients with motor disorders of the basal ganglia such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy [1-4]. Conversely, functional imaging has shown the involvement of the striatum in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression [5-9]. The emergence of important anatomical information about the intricate connectivity of the striatum with the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system, areas of the brain respectively concerned with cognition and regulation of motivation and emotion, has been a key factor in this revision. Also influential has been empirical data on the fundamental role played by dopamine, a major neurotransmitter in the nigrostriatal system, in regulation of responses to reward [10] and the contribution of the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems respectively in modulation of higher aspects of cognitive function and emotion.
   This article starts with an outline of the basic anatomy of the basal ganglia. It then provides an overview of the structure and function of the striato-frontal circuits and describes the current pathophysiological models of movement disorders based on striato-frontal dysfunction. Consideration of evidence primarily from animal studies showing the context-dependent nature of neuronal activity in the striatum also reveals its fundamental link with cognition and motivation. It is proposed that processing of information in a temporally coupled fashion may allow for integration of information across the parallel and spatially segregated motor, associative, and limbic fronto-striatal circuits. Finally, the article reviews the range of neuro-transmitters found in the basal ganglia, with a major focus on dopamine and its modulatory influence on reward and learning, and the respective involvement of the nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopamine systems in motor control and cognition.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presented unprecedented challenges to the provision of inpatient psychiatric care. The nature of the physical plant, programmatic constraints, and the patient population required a rapid and agile approach to problem-solving under conditions of uncertainty and stress. Flexibility in decision-making, excellent communication, an effective working relationship with infection prevention and control experts, and attention to staff morale and support were important elements of successful provision of care to our inpatients. We present our experience, lessons learned, and recommendations should a resurgence of the pandemic or a similar crisis occur.

While a data base from both animal and human clinical research supports the hypothesis of an important cerebellar role in motor adaptation, motor learning and timing, the evidence for the implication of the cerebellum in psychopathology and non-motor cognitive functions is incomplete and does not allow unequivocal conclusions. Methodological shortcomings and the lack of theoretical models on the nature of the cerebellar contribution to cognition limit the interpretation of the empirical studies available so far.

While performance is typically scored by counting the total number of responses, the ordering of responses can be used to estimate how individuals or groups organize semantic concepts within a category. I provide an overview of this methodology, using Alzheimer's disease as a case study for how the approach can help advance theoretical questions about the nature of semantic representation. However, many open questions surrounding the validity and reliability of this approach remain unresolved.

AB  - According to mainstream views of emotion perception, facial expressions are powerful signals conveying specific emotional states. This approach, which endorsed the use of stereotypical-posed faces as stimuli, has typically ignored the role of context in emotion perception. We argue that this methodological tradition is flawed. Real-life facial expressions are often highly ambiguous, heavily relying on contextual information. We review recent work suggesting that context is an inherent part of real-life emotion perception, often leading to radical categorical changes. Contextual effects are not an obscurity at the fringe of facial emotion perception, rather, they are part of emotion perception itself.

AB  - Microplastic research has experienced almost exponential growth in publications and proceeded faster than ever throughout the last years. This increase comes with a downside in terms of missing standardizations and definitions especially concerning experiments. Furthermore, incomparability and lacking transferability of fragmentation studies onto the marine environment still hinder more realistic extrapolations and accurate numerical models. This review of -fers a first approach to tackle this problem by converting studies into comparable dimensions by rating their experi-mental settings and comparing them to in-situ values, thus, assisting future research with an unbiased and fast tool to assess the applicability of studies for their calculations. For this purpose, the main influencing factors for the envi-ronmental fragmentation of plastics were identified, ranked in terms of their impact, and, subsequently, applied to 49 setups of peer-reviewed studies. The average transferability into nature of the considered laboratory studies is 41%. Unconsidered implementation of proper mechanical wear by water and sediment movement into the test setups of around 80% of all reviewed studies explains this value. However, other parameters like UV radiation implementation, also pose an obstacle in about 50% of the laboratory studies. Nevertheless, even the reviewed in-situ fragmentation studies revealed problems in transferability in some of the weathering components caused by the fixation of the sam-ples. This review indicates that the current database on plastic fragmentation is most likely not reliable enough for ro-bust extrapolations or numerical models. A set of recommendations for test settings is proposed to improve upcoming experiments' quality and comparability.

AB  - Purpose: Since the description of his original patient Auguste D. with cognitive disability, Alois Alzheimer persisted in his clinical investigations to understand this complex disease. Although more than a century later the underlying cellular dysfunctions that can initiate and determine the course of this neurodegenerative disease remain evasive, significant strides continue to elucidate the complex nature of Alzheimer dementia and define potential effective strategies for its prevention and treatment.
   Methods and results: In this article, we examine the cellular mechanisms that define Alzheimer disease. They are diverse in nature and involve pathways of oxidative stress that extend well beyond the pathological hallmarks of beta-amyloid aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles. Oxidative stress precipitates both nuclear DNA degradation and membrane phosphatidylserine exposure in neuronal and vascular cells to promote loss of cellular integrity, microglial phagocytosis, and thrombotic destruction. Critical in the ability to foster cell survival during oxidative stress is the modulation of the metabotropic glutamate system, cell cycle regulation in post-mitotic neurons, and control of GSK-3beta activity and presenilin integrity. These cellular pathways ultimately converge upon more central cellular mechanisms that involve maintenance of mitochondrial membrane permeability through Bcl-2 family members, trophic factors, and mitochondrial energy reserves.
   Conclusions: By targeting critical elements that determine neuronal and vascular survival during Alzheimer disease, successful development of clinical applications can emerge for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - The breakdown of self-incompatibility has occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and has profound impacts on the genetic structure of populations. Recent advances in understanding of the molecular basis of self-incompatibility have provided insights into the mechanisms of its loss in natural populations, especially in the tomato family, the Solanaceae. In the Solanaceae, the gene that controls self-incompatibility in the style codes for a ribonuclease that causes the degradation of RNA in pollen tubes bearing an allele at the S-locus that matches either of the two alleles held by the maternal plant, The pollen component of the S-locus has yet to be identified. Loss of self-incompatibility can be attributed to three types of causes: duplication of the S-locus, mutations that cause loss of S-RNase activity, and mutations that do not cause loss of S-RNase activity. Duplication of the S-locus has been well studied in radiation-induced mutants but may be a relatively rare cause of the breakdown of self-incompatibility in nature. Point mutations within the S-locus that disrupt the production of S-RNase have been documented in natural populations. There are also a number of mutants in which S-RNase production is unimpaired, yet self-incompatibility is disrupted. The identity and function of these mutations is not well understood. Careful work on a handful of model organisms will enable population. biologists to better understand the breakdown of self-incompatibility in nature.

AB  - Introduction: Nowadays, gambling disorder (GD) is a worldwide health issue and there is a growing need to both improve our understanding of this disorder and to tailor specific interventions for its treatment. Moreover, theoretical models and preliminary empirical results suggest that difficulty in regulating emotional states might be involved in GD. However, literature describing clinical and theoretical aspects of emotional dysregulation among pathological gamblers (PGs) shows a lack of systematic description. Objectives: We aimed to provide, within an exhaustive theoretical framework of emotion regulation (ER) processing, empirical evidence supporting a conceptual model of GD as an ER affliction. Methods: We commented on empirical evidence on the relationship between ER and GD in the light of two main conceptual models of emotion (dys) regulation. Results: The results suggest there are actual deficits of ER processing among PGs, manifesting themselves through different ways and in different steps of the ER timeline. In addition, dysregulation of positive emotions may play a central role in GD. From a clinical point of view, we pointed out that deficits in ER might be multiple in nature and an assessment for GD should be accurate to identify the specific components accounting for the development and maintenance of the disorder. It should also orientate the clinician in selecting therapeutic objectives. Conclusions: The nature of emotional states that are difficult to regulate might account for the GD severity and indicate the subtype of PGs the patient belongs to. Treatment programs should be tailored on the specificity of PGs.

AB  - Collaborative risk assessment and management have been recommended in health policy for over a decade. We consider the nature and need for collaborative risk assessment and management between patients and clinicians in secure and forensic mental health settings in the context of shared decision making and personalised care in the UK. We examine the extent to which policy and recent initiatives have influenced the embedding of such practice in services through consideration of the evidence provided by research and the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation framework, and conclude that there is a need for further improvement.

AB  - Both parapsychologists and skeptics have interests in investigating the nature of belief in the paranormal, albeit with somewhat different objectives in mind. Despite substantial variation across studies in the definition of the scope of paranormal belief, some degree of order can be imposed on the empirical literature by taking due account of the multidimensionality of paranormal belief. In this light, correlates of paranormal belief are surveyed in the domains of demographic variables, other beliefs and activities, cognitive variables, and personality. Particular emphasis is given to the need for a theory of the psychodynamic functions served by paranormal belief.

AB  - Intrusive thoughts and images, often of a violent, horrific, or blasphemous nature are the hallmark of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). OCD patients frequently also often have reductions in normal serotonergic (5-HT) function. This paper proposes a model of 5-HT function involving the routine filtering and suppression of violent or libidinal impulses. This model accounts for OCD as an instance of failed inhibition. The model also appears to resemble Freud's model of ego-id interactions at least in part, suggesting that it may be possible to psychobiologically substantiate a Freudian metaphor.

AB  - We discuss the relationship between sleep, dreams, and memory, proposing that the content of dreams reflects aspects of memory consolidation taking place during the different stages of sleep. Although we acknowledge the likely involvement of various neuromodulators in these phenomena, we focus on the hormone cortisol, which is known to exert influence on many of the brain systems involved in memory. The concentration of cortisol escalates over the course of the night's sleep, in ways that we propose can help explain the changing nature of dreams across the sleep cycle.

AB  - Hormesis is described as a biological phenomenon showing bidirectional (biphasic) responses to chemical or other stressors: stimulation at low doses and inhibition at high doses or vice-versa. The label applies to either radiation or chemical hormesis. This review addresses certain critical but persisting quantitative questions about chemical hormesis. For example, what is its actual generalizability in nature? Is hormesis generalizable enough to figure in risk analysis and regulatory efforts within human or ecological toxicant exposures? No evidence exists to show that chemical hormesis is a universally distributed biological phenomenon within some law, rule or principle (100% frequency) nor is there a reliable and consistent body of evidence that leads to identifying some significant and reproducible value for frequency of occurrence below the universality standard, i.e., <100% frequency. Lack of reliable and/or consistent evidence arises from diverse limits to study methods, i.e., methods were post-hoc evaluations of published data gathered for other purposes and using ad-hoc characterization approaches, rather than doing new studies. The literature selected for generalizability analyses has not been systematically pre-evaluated as a scientifically reliable representation of hormesis frequency in nature. Furthermore, database evaluations have used certain criteria not validated for this specific purpose, so that metric and what was measured are objects of scrutiny and ambiguity. Finally, simultaneous estimates of frequency of non-hormetic dose-response relationships, required for reliable determinations of hormesis frequency, were not done in these analyses. Chemical hormesis frequency estimates vary with conditions for characterization. For all these reasons, chemical hormesis still has limited use in health policy and regulatory thinking.

AB  - There are well-established risks for parents with severe mental illness (i.e. psychotic and bipolar disorders), both for their children and themselves. Interventions to help parents fulfil their role should therefore be a public health objective, but their implementation needs to be underpinned by research evidence. This systematic review determines what is known about the nature and effectiveness of interventions for parents with severe mental illness.
   We conducted a narrative synthesis of controlled and uncontrolled studies reporting interventions for this patient group after the post-natal period (i.e. after the child has turned 1 year old).
   Eighteen publications reported data from 15 studies. All but two studies were rated as low quality studies. Interventions included home visiting programmes, complex community programmes, residential treatments, and online interventions. Interventions targeted diverse areas, with parenting skills and understanding the impact of mental illness on parenting most frequently addressed. Both parent and child-related outcomes improved, but children were only assessed via observers and follow-up times were short.
   Interventions were diverse with respect to their nature and effectiveness. Future interventions should combine different intervention strategies to target multiple areas in a flexible manner. The addition of positively focussed and resource-oriented components should be investigated. Trials should include direct assessments of both parents and children, outcomes that are relevant from a public health perspective, and establish the long-term effects ideally until children have reached 18 years of age.

AB  - The aim of this review is to summarize the recent literature regarding abnormalities in sensory functioning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including evidence regarding the neurobiological basis of these symptoms, their clinical correlates, and their treatment. Abnormalities in responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in individuals with ASD. The underlying neurobiology of these symptoms is unclear, but several theories have been proposed linking possible etiologies of sensory dysfunction with known abnormalities in brain structure and function that are associated with ASD. In addition to the distress that sensory symptoms can cause patients and caregivers, these phenomena have been correlated with several other problematic symptoms and behaviors associated with ASD, including restrictive and repetitive behavior, self-injurious behavior, anxiety, inattention, and gastrointestinal complaints. It is unclear whether these correlations are causative in nature or whether they are due to shared underlying pathophysiology. The best-known treatments for sensory symptoms in ASD involve a program of occupational therapy that is specifically tailored to the needs of the individual and that may include sensory integration therapy, a sensory diet, and environmental modifications. While some empirical evidence supports these treatments, more research is needed to evaluate their efficacy, and other means of alleviating these symptoms, including possible psychopharmacological interventions, need to be explored. Additional research into the sensory symptoms associated with ASD has the potential to shed more light on the nature and pathophysiology of these disorders and to open new avenues of effective treatments.

AB  - Within recent years, researchers have proposed the independence of attention and consciousness on both empirical and conceptual grounds. However, the elusive nature of these constructs complicates progress in the investigation of their interaction. We present a framework within which we conceptualize attention and consciousness in computational terms. Here, the concepts are considered as large-scale, functionally and structurally different processes, embedded in a biologically inspired architecture, spanning the full arc from stimulus to response. Our architecture assumes a general independence of attention and consciousness, but supposes strong interactions. Furthermore, it addresses the developmental aspect, stressing that these functions have to gradually develop through learning.

AB  - Speech, by its very nature, is a time-based phenomenon. Speech sounds are temporally distributed with the presentation of one sound roughly conditioned by the fading of the previous one. In this review, three classes of models are discussed with respect to the sequential nature of speech. It is argued that the three resulting conceptions of time are linked to the type of segmentation process proposed by these models to deal with speech continuity. In the first one, lexical activation is viewed as perfectly synchronized with the temporal deployment of speech. This type of model corresponds to the traditional left-to-right (proactive) account of lexical processing. Because serious segmentation problems exist for such an approach (e.g,, car and card are embedded in cardinal), the second type of model treats word recognition as the result of a mechanism that sometimes delays commitment on word identity beyond word offset, Lexical activation, instead of shadowing the unfolding of time, lags behind it until an unambiguous decision can be made. The temporarily unprocessed information is stored in a memory buffer. In the third approach, a prosodic cue (lexical stress) contributes actively to speech. segmentation and lexical processing. Every stressed syllable encountered in the signal is postulated as a word onset and thus constitutes the starting point of lexical activation, However, with non-initial-stressed words, retroactive procedures going ''back in time'' must be used, Finally, the use of time (including proactive, delayed, and retroactive procedures) is discussed in light of cross-linguistic phonological differences.

AB  - The prevalence of both obesity and neurodevelopmental disorders has increased substantially over the last several decades. Early environmental factors, including maternal nutrition and metabolic state during gestation, influence offspring neurodevelopment. Both human and preclinical models demonstrate a link between poor maternal nutrition, altered metabolic state, and risk of behavioral abnormalities in offspring. This review aims to highlight evidence from the current literature connecting maternal nutrition and the associated metabolic changes with neural and behavioral outcomes in the offspring, as well as identify possible mechanisms underlying these neurodevelopmental outcomes. Owing to the highly correlated nature of poor nutrition and obesity in humans, preclinical animal models are important in distinguishing the unique effects of maternal nutrition and metabolic state on offspring brain development. We use a translational lens to highlight results from preclinical animal models of maternal obesogenic diet related to alterations in behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. Specifically, we aim to highlight results that resemble behavioral phenotypes described in the diagnostic criteria of neurodevelopmental conditions in humans. Finally, we examine the proinflammatory nature of maternal obesity and consumption of a high-fat diet as a mechanism for neurodevelopmental alterations that may alter offspring behavior later in life. It is important that future studies examine potential therapeutic interventions and prevention strategies to interrupt the transgenerational transmission of the disease. Given the tremendous risk to the next generation, changes need to be made to ensure that all pregnant people have access to nutritious food and are informed about the optimal diet for their developing child.

AB  - Non-human primates are marked by well-developed prosocial and cooperative tendencies as reflected in the way they support each other in fights, hunt together, share food and console victims of aggression. The proximate motivation behind such behaviour is not to be confused with the ultimate reasons for its evolution. Even if a behaviour is ultimately self-serving, the motivation behind it may be genuinely unselfish. A sharp distinction needs to be drawn, therefore, between (i) altruistic and cooperative behaviour with knowable benefits to the actor, which may lead actors aware of these benefits to seek them by acting cooperatively or altruistically and (ii) altruistic behaviour that offers the actor no knowable rewards. The latter is the case if return benefits occur too unpredictably, too distantly in time or are of an indirect nature, such as increased inclusive fitness. The second category of behaviour can be explained only by assuming an altruistic impulse, which-as in humans-may be born from empathy with the recipient's need, pain or distress. Empathy, a proximate mechanism for prosocial behaviour that makes one individual share another's emotional state, is biased the way one would predict from evolutionary theories of cooperation (i.e. by kinship, social closeness and reciprocation). There is increasing evidence in non-human primates (and other mammals) for this proximate mechanism as well as for the unselfish, spontaneous nature of the resulting prosocial tendencies. This paper further reviews observational and experimental evidence for the reciprocity mechanisms that underlie cooperation among non-relatives, for inequity aversion as a constraint on cooperation and on the way defection is dealt with.

AB  - Pesticides are known for their high persistence and pervasiveness in the environment, and along with products of their biotransformation, they may remain in and interact with the environment and living organisms in multiple ways, according to their nature and chemical structure, dose and targets. In this review, the classifications of pesticides based on their nature, use, physical state, pathophysiological effects, and sources are discussed. The effects of these xenobiotics on the environment, their biotransformation in terms of bioaccumulation are highlighted with special focus on the molecular mechanisms deciphered to date. Basing on targeted organisms, most pesticides are classified as herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. Herbicides are known as growth regulators, seedling growth inhibitors, photosynthesis inhibitors, inhibitors of amino acid and lipid biosynthesis, cell membrane disrupters, and pigment biosynthesis inhibitors, whereas fungicides include inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis, protein biosynthesis, and mitochondrial respiration. Insecticides mainly affect nerves and muscle, growth and development, and energy production. Studying the impact of pesticides and other related chemicals is of great interest to animal and human health risk assessment processes since potentially everyone can be exposed to these compounds which may cause many diseases, including metabolic syndrome, malnutrition, atherosclerosis, inflammation, pathogen invasion, nerve injury, and susceptibility to infectious diseases. Future studies should be directed to investigate influence of long term effects of low pesticide doses and to minimize or eliminate influence of pesticides on non-target living organisms, produce more specific pesticides and using modern technologies to decrease contamination of food and other goods by pesticides.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the role of shared decision making (SDM) as one component of recovery-oriented care.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is conceptual and reviews the literature relevant to recovery-oriented care, person-centered recovery planning (PCRP), and SDM.
   Findings - To the degree to which SDM offers tools for sharing useful information about treatment options with service users and family members or other loved ones, it can be considered a valuable addition to the recovery-oriented armamentarium. It is important to emphasize, though, that recovery-oriented practice has a broader focus on the person's overall life in the community and is not limited to formal treatments or other professionally delivered interventions. Within the more holistic context of recovery, SDM regarding such interventions is only one tool among many, which needs to be integrated within an overall PCRP process. More emphasis is given within the recovery-oriented care to activating and equipping persons for exercising self-care and for pursuing a life they have reason to value, and the nature of the relationships required to promote such processes will be identified. In describing the nature of these relationships, it will become evident that decision making is only one of many processes that need to be shared between persons in recovery and those who accept responsibility for promoting and supporting that person's recovery.
   Originality/value - By viewing SDM within the context of recovery, this paper provides a framework that can assist in the implementation of SDM in routine mental health care.

AB  - Healthcare professionals find the care of parents following an involuntary pregnancy loss stressful and challenging. They also feel unprepared to support bereaved parents. The challenging nature of this support may have a personal impact on health professionals and the care provided to parents. The aim of this meta-ethnography is to synthesise nurses' and midwives' experiences of caring for parents following an involuntary pregnancy loss. A meta-ethnography of ten studies from five countries was carried out. GRADE CERQual was assessed to show the degree of confidence in the review findings. An overarching metaphor, caring in darkness, accompanied by five major themes provided interpretive explanations about the experiences of nurses and midwives in caring for involuntary pregnancy losses: (1) Forces that turn off the light, (2) strength to go into darkness, (3) avoiding stumbling, (4) groping in darkness, and (5) wounded after dealing with darkness. Nursing staff dealt with organizational difficulties, which encouraged task-focused care and avoidance of encounters and emotional connection with parents. However, nurses and midwives might go beyond in their care when they had competencies, support, and a strong value base, despite the personal cost involved.

AB  - Recently, novel lines of research have developed to study the influence of identity processes in sport-related behaviors. Yet, whereas emotions in sport are the result of a complex psychosocial process, little attention has been paid to examining the mechanisms that underlie how group membership influences athletes' emotional experiences. The present narrative review aims at complementing the comprehensive review produced by Rees et al. (2015) on social identity in sport by reporting specific work on identity-based emotions in sport. To that end, we firstly overview the different terminology currently used in the field of emotions in groups to clarify the distinct nature of emotions that result from an individual's social identity. Secondly, we discuss key concepts of social identity to better understand the mechanisms underlying identity based emotions. Thirdly, we address existing knowledge on identity-based emotions in sport. We close the present narrative review by suggesting future research perspectives based on existing meta-theories of social identity. Evidence from the social psychology literature is discussed alongside existing works from the sport literature to propose a crucial theoretical approach to better understand emotions in sport.

This systematic review synthesises findings across a range of substances to address questions regarding the time course of anhedonia, how anhedonia relates to other symptoms of substance dependence and whether it is similarly prevalent across all addictive drugs.
   Method: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE, yielding 32 studies that used self-report measures of anhedonia among participants with a history of a substance abuse, dependence or long-term daily use of addictive substances.
   Results: Findings from these studies indicate that anhedonia (1) is elevated in samples dependent on a range of substances; (2) typically appears as a consequence of substance abuse or dependence, and diminishes with abstinence; and (3) predicts increased drug cravings and the likelihood of relapse in those attempting abstinence.
   Conclusions: The common experience of anhedonia in substance-dependent populations, and its relationship to relapse, emphasises the importance of developing therapeutic interventions that specifically target anhedonia in the treatment of all substance use disorders.

AB  - Absence of visible physical symptoms and limited capacity to express trauma directly, pose significant challenges in assessment of its exact nature of trauma and its correlates in child sexual abuse. There are numerous assessment tools however, deciding upon the appropriateness is often challenging in Asian socio-cultural and health care set up. A review would provide a ready reference to the practioner regarding the exact clinically utility of the tools and also would guide them in the direction of culture specific modifications. Computerized databases namely Medline, PsycINFO, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, and Social Sciences Citation Index were used. 52 scales were obtained and analysed in terms of scale characteristics, reference to theory and DSM, and cultural competency. Despite of a wide variety of methods, and newer instruments, many of the traditionally used techniques of child's internal thinking and emotional assessment appear outdated while reviewing the recent theories of CSA related psychological trauma. An integrated format, incroporating child-parent-clinicain rating, with multiple domain speciafic items and verbal and non-verbal tasks, is the current need in the Asian region.

AB  - The hallmark feature of hoarding disorder (HD) is difficulty discarding possessions resulting in the accumulation of large amounts of clutter. Although hoarding symptoms have been noted for decades, HD did not constitute a formal diagnosis until the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). Research on psychological models of HD has revealed a substantial amount about the nature of hoarding problems and how they can be treated, as described in this review. The first section of this article reviews the factors implicated in the cognitive-behavioral model of HD, including dysfunctional beliefs about possessions, excessive emotional attachments to objects, and problematic patterns of behavioral avoidance, as well as skill deficits and information processing problems. Next, the components of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy for HD, which are derived from this model, are presented. Evidence for the efficacy of this treatment (and each of its components) are then reviewed. Finally, factors that may interfere with treatment, as well as directions for future research, are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on a six-year doctoral research, the author carries out a historical, epistemological and paradigmatic assessment of the controversial concept of the death instinct. The author analyses this notion's speculative nature; its relation with the second principle of thermodynamics; the feasibility of a return to an inorganic state; the death drive's metaphorical and isomorphic uses, as well as its theoretical and doctrinaire approaches; its relationship with repetition compulsion and masochism; the influence of Freud 's scientific background on its formulation; and its context-dependent meaning. Although this paper stems mainly from the theoretical aspects of the study, it also offers some clinical thoughts on the basis of a clinical vignette. The author stresses the underlying healing aspects of repetition in the analytic situation. Next, he presents concise comments on his empirical research on the current professional usage of the death drive in the Spanish psychoanalytical community. This research covered more than 27% of Spanish psychoanalysts (IPA) and psychotherapists (EFPP). The essay's conclusions point to the ambiguous character of the death drive concept and its literal unacceptability and the absence of consistent arguments for its acceptance.

AB  - Purpose of review To evaluate and summarize recent research investigating psychological, social and environmental risk factors for development of psychopathology in childhood, while controlling for biological (genetic) influences by using a matched sibling, twin or adoptee design. Recent findings Nineteen studies were included, of which eleven were longitudinal and eight were cohort studies. Included studies used adequate designs and statistical methods, controlled for unmeasured confounders and, in many cases, for other measured risk factors. None of the studies used the framework for environmental factors presented in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The outcome variable psychopathology was rarely assessed using a diagnostic standard. The findings were sorted in five themes based on included exposures: 'Social support, social rejection and perceived identity,' 'Early symptoms of psychopathology,' 'Antibiotic exposure,' 'Factors in the family' and 'Nature versus nurture'. Using twin/sibling/adoptee designs, a number of unique predictors of psychopathology were found, even when controlling for familial confounders and other specified risk factors. Future studies of psychopathology development should benefit from longitudinal, genetically sensitive designs and from use of diagnostic standards for psychopathology outcome, and should also incorporate ICF for classification of risk factors.

AB  - Machine learning methods hold promise for personalized care in psychiatry, demonstrating the potential to tailor treatment decisions and stratify patients into clinically meaningful taxonomies. Subsequently, publication counts applying machine learning methods have risen, with different data modalities, mathematically distinct models, and samples of varying size being used to train and test models with the promise of clinical translation. Consequently, and in part due to the preliminary nature of such works, many studies have reported largely varying degrees of accuracy, raising concerns over systematic overestimation and methodological inconsistencies. Furthermore, a lack of procedural evaluation guidelines for non-expert medical professionals and funding bodies leaves many in the field with no means to systematically evaluate the claims, maturity, and clinical readiness of a project. Given the potential of machine learning methods to transform patient care, albeit, contingent on the rigor of employed methods and their dissemination, we deem it necessary to provide a review of current methods, recommendations, and future directions for applied machine learning in psychiatry. In this review we will cover issues of best practice for model training and evaluation, sources of systematic error and overestimation, model explainability vs. trust, the clinical implementation of AI systems, and finally, future directions for our field.

AB  - After questioning the practical significance of evidence that parenting influences brain development - while highlighting the scientific importance of such work for understanding how family experience shapes human development - this paper reviews evidence suggesting that brain structure and function are 'chiselled' by parenting. Although the generalisability of most findings is limited due to a disproportionate, but understandable focus on clinical samples (e.g., maltreated children with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) and causal inferences are difficult to draw because of the observational nature of most of the evidence, it is noteworthy that some work with community samples and very new experimental work (e.g., parent training) suggests that tentative conclusions regarding effects of parenting on the developing brain may well be substantiated in future research. Such efforts should focus on parenting in the normal range, experimental manipulations of parenting, differential susceptibility to parenting effects and pathway models linking parenting to brain development and, thereby, to behavioural development. Research on parenting and children's brain development may be regarded as at 'the end of the beginning'.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is widely accepted as being critical for neural and synaptic plasticity throughout the nervous system. Recent work has shown that BDNF in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) circuit, originating in ventral tegmental area DA neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens, is crucial in the development of depressive-like behaviors following exposure to chronic social defeat stress in mice. Whereas BDNF modulates DA signaling in encoding responses to acute defeat stress, BDNF signaling alone appears to be responsible for the behavioral effects after chronic social defeat stress. Very different patterns are seen with another widely used chronic stress paradigm in mice, chronic mild stress (also known as chronic variable or unpredictable stress), where DA signaling, but not BDNF signaling, is primarily responsible for the behavioral effects observed. This review discusses the molecular, cellular, and circuit basis of this dramatic discrepancy, which appears to involve the nature of the stress, its severity and duration, and its effects on distinct cell types within the ventral tegmental area-to-nucleus accumbens mesolimbic circuit.

AB  - The role of attention bias in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders has been studied extensively over decades. Attention bias reflects maladaptation in cognitive processing, as perceived threatening stimuli receive prioritized processing even when they are task-irrelevant or factually unthreatening. Recently, there has been some interest in the role of a-priori expectancies in attention bias toward threat. The current review article will present recent studies as examples that emphasize the need for more comprehensive research about the interactive effects of various factors that affect the relationship between expectancies and attention bias toward threatening stimuli in anxiety. The current review article suggests a holistic view, which advocates for more integrative research, as a dynamic network could underlie changes in attention bias. The study of the interaction between such factors, with a focus on expectancy, can lead to more ecological and clinically important results, and thus to more informed and fine-tuned treatments that are based on manipulation of expectancies. Such methods, in turn, can also help in shedding light on the research of attention bias, in a mutual relationship between research and therapy.

AB  - Disruptions of bioenergetic signaling and neurogenesis are hallmarks of depression physiology and are often the product of dysregulation of the inflammatory, stress-response, and metabolic systems. These systems are extensively interrelated at the physiological level, yet the bulk of the literature to date addresses pathophysiological mechanisms in isolation. A more integrated understanding of the etiology, progression, and treatment response profiles of depression is possible through wider consideration of relevant preclinical and clinical studies that examine the result of disruptions in these systems. Here, we review recent data demonstrating the critical effects of bioenergetic disruption on neuroplasticity and the development and progression of depressive illness. We further highlight the interactive and dynamic nature of the inflammatory and stress response systems and how disruption of these systems influences bioenergetic signaling pathways critical to treatment outcomes. In so doing, we underscore the pressing need to reconsider the implications of treatment resistance and present a framework for developing novel, personalized treatment approaches for depression.

AB  - The pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders arises in association with the misfolding and accumulation of a wide variety of proteins. Much emphasis has been placed on understanding the nature of these protein accumulations, including their composition, the process by which they are formed and the physiological impact they impose at cellular and, ultimately, organismal levels. Alpha-synuclein (ASYN) is the major component of protein inclusions known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are the typical pathological hallmarks in disorders referred to as synucleinopathies. In addition, mutations or multiplications in the gene encoding for ASYN have also been shown to cause familial cases of PD, the most common synucleinopathy. Although the precise function of ASYN remains unclear, it appears to be involved in a vast array of cellular processes. Here, we review, in depth, a spectrum of cellular and molecular mechanisms that have been implicated in synucleinopathies. Importantly, detailed understanding of the biology/pathobiology of ASYN may enable the development of novel avenues for diagnosis and/or therapeutic intervention in synucleinopathies.

AB  - Smaller hippocampal volume is associated with increased risk for PTSD following trauma, but the hippocampal functions involved remain unknown. We propose a conceptual model that identifies broad impairment in hippocampus-dependent associative learning as a vulnerability factor for PTSD. Associative learning of foreground cues and background context is required to form an integrated representation of an event. People with poor associative learning may have difficulty remembering who or what was present during a trauma, where the trauma occurred, or the sequence of events, which may contribute to PTSD symptoms. We argue that associative learning difficulties in PTSD exist for cues and context, regardless of the emotional nature of the information. This contrasts with PTSD models that focus exclusively on threat-processing or contextual-processing. In a meta-analysis, people with PTSD exhibited poor associative learning of multiple information types compared to those without PTSD. Differences were of medium effect size and similar magnitude for neutral and negative/trauma-related stimuli. We provide evidence for associative learning difficulties as a neurocognitive pathway that may contribute to PTSD.

AB  - Attachment style, which has been theorized to be rooted in childhood bonding experiences, influences adult cognitive, emotional and interpersonal functioning. Despite its relationship with early experiences, research indicates that the continuity of attachment style across childhood and adulthood is only partial, being a malleable tendency that is shaped throughout development, with an increasing influence of genetics, as it occurs in other cognitive and behavioral phenotypes. Genetic research indicates that up to 45% of the variability in anxious and 39% in avoidant adult attachment style could be explained by genetic causes, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. A narrative review is conducted analyzing the existing literature regarding the implication of candidate genes related to oxytocin, dopaminergic pathways, serotonergic pathways and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in adult attachment, with both vulnerability and differential susceptibility approaches, yielding mixed results. We highlight the lack of genome-wide studies and the scarcity of epigenetic investigation. Based on the existing data, we conclude that the genetics of adult attachment is an area that requires further research to clarify its etiological role and that it should be preferably approached as an interaction between nature and nurture.

AB  - Serotonin (5-HT) is an ancient molecule directing behavioural responses to environmental stimuli. The social environment is the most powerful environmental factor. It is well recognized that 5-HT plays a key role in shaping social responses, and that the serotonergic system itself is highly responsive to social influences. This review aims to provide an overview of a selection of representative papers that significantly contribute to a coherent view on the role of serotonin in reciprocal social interactions. The studies here reviewed, selected using the pubmed search terms "social behaviour" and "serotonin", describe the effects of serotonergic gene variation and pharmacological manipulations in humans, monkeys, and rodents, and involve parental attachment and caregiving, social play, aggressiveness, cooperation, and sexual behaviour. We conclude that serotonin is positively correlated with sensitivity to social factors and modulates social behaviour in a 'for-better-and-for-worse' manner, depending on the nature of social factors. Simultaneously, these behavioural responses influence the serotonergic system, leading to highly complex bidirectional serotonin x environment interaction. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - When we perceive our environment, we rapidly integrate large amounts of incoming stimulus information into categories that help to guide our understanding of the world. Some stimuli are more relevant for our well-being and survival than others, for example stimuli that signal a threat or an opportunity for growth and expansion. In this review we examine the special role of such oemotionalo stimuli in perception and categorisation. To this end, we first discuss some fundamental aspects of perception, with an emphasis on the cognitive process of categorisation. We then tackle the questions: oWhat is an emotional stimulus?o and oWhat is an emotion category?o Afterwards, we illustrate, with a review of key findings from the empirical literature, (i) how stimuli are categorised as emotional, and (ii) how the perceptual processing of emotional stimuli is prioritised to allow for a rapid preparation of adaptive responses. To conclude, we discuss how research on the perception of emotional stimuli can contribute to current debates in psychology, namely (i) about the role of bottom-up vs. top-down factors in emotional processing and experience, and (ii) about the nature of the relationship between cognition and emotion.

We performed a systematic review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews checklist, from January 2000 to July 2021. The terms "plaque, " "saliva, " and "mouth " were associated with the search term "oral diseases " and used in combination with the Boolean operator "AND "/ "OR ". We included experimental or clinical studies and excluded conferences, abstracts, reviews, and editorials. A total of 27 articles were selected. Evidence for the impact of the oral microbiome on the pathophysiological and immunoinflammatory mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease is accumulating. The impact of the oral microbiome on the development of AD opens the door to complementary therapies such as phototherapy and/or the use of prebiotic compounds and probiotic strains for global or targeted modulation of the oral microbiome in order to have a favourable influence on the evolution of this pathology in the future.

AB  - Purpose of review There is a remarkable overlap between eating disorders and sexual problems, both in terms of sexual dysfunctions and risky sexual behaviors. This systematic review of the recent literature aimed at clarifying the nature of this relationship in terms of psychopathological meaning. Recent findings Body image disturbance, and particularly body dissatisfaction and embodiment disorder, emerged as shared psychopathological dimensions between eating disorder symptoms and sexual dysfunctions. Interpersonal difficulties, a disturbed intimacy and insecure attachment style, but not a history of sexual abuse per se, resulted to play a pivotal role in the interconnection between eating disorder psychopathology and sexual dysfunctions. On the other hand, several studies confirmed the association between eating disorder symptoms and risky sexual behaviors, which has been explained in terms of several common psychopathological dimensions, including impulsivity and addiction. Sexuality is deeply interconnected with eating disorder psychopathology, and it should be considered a fundamental aspect in managing these disorders. An accurate assessment of sexual function might allow to characterize etiological information (e.g., sexual abuse) and maintaining factors (embodiment disorder and emotion dysregulation). Accordingly, the recovery of a good sexuality should be considered a crucial signal of recovery.

AB  - Just as lifestyle medicine is the necessary foundation for true health care reform, lifestyle medicine competencies should be the foundation for health education. Although lifestyle medicine education may benefit a health professional at any stage in their education or career, evidence-based undergraduate lifestyle medicine education for future health professionals shifts the perspective of health and health care delivery. Educating health preprofessionals in associate, bachelor's, master's, and other preprofessional healthcare training programs is of paramount importance due to the interdisciplinary nature of lifestyle medicine. To accomplish this, American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) members can work collaboratively through committees, projects, and working groups-becoming leadership champions of change. An ACLM Pre-Professional Member Interest Group (LMPP) was created in 2018. LMPP has been working to build a national collaborative effort to amass, create, and distribute resources for educators in this pre-professional arena. Educating college students planning to become professionals outside the medical sphere, for example, lawyers, business people, artists, and engineers, will also benefit the field by introducing the power of nutrition, exercise, sleep, social connection, and stress resiliency during this formative state of career development. Pre-professional educational programs provide learners the opportunity to personally experience the power of lifestyle medicine.

AB  - Residual symptoms of variable intensity often persist following pharmaco/or psychotherapeutic interventions for treatment of major depression (MD). In several studies, such persistent symptoms have been clearly shown to be associated with a higher risk of relapse, chronicity and functional impairment, but their true nature is still controversial. Several authors consider that these symptoms belong to the range of depression proper and thus indicate that the current episode has been inadequately treated, a hypothesis reinforced by their frequent similarity with the symptoms preceding the full-blown picture of MD. However, in the current state of research, their connection with certain personality traits or comorbid disorders-notably anxiety disorders-cannot be completely ruled out. This article reviews the main data from the literature concerning residual symptoms and their treatment, as well as the issues related to their psychopathological meaning. In practice, once the state of a patient has been stabilized in partial remission of the depressive syndrome, the clinician should revise the current therapeutic strategy and seek to find how to return as fully as possible to the previous euthymic state.

AB  - Introduction: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder that is heterogeneous in its nature, and often presents with other psychiatric comorbidities. As a result, empirical research on effective pharmacotherapy for PTSD has produced complex findings. This article reviews the existing research literature on pharmacological treatments for PTSD. identifies the most effective treatments. and,where possible examines their mechanism of action with respect to the neurobiology of PTSD. Methods: We examined reports of clinical trials of psychotropic agents carried out with PTSD patients and published in peer-reviewed journals. as well as reports from presentations at scientific meetings between 1966 and 2001. Results: Numerous medications are effective in treating, PTSD. These include tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors. and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Considering reported overall efficacy and side effects profiles, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors emerge as the preferred first line treatment for PTSD. Mood stabilizers, atypical neuroleptics, adrenergic agents, and newer antidepressants also show promise, but require further controlled trials to clarify their place in the pharmacopoeia for PTSD. Discussion: There is clear evidence for effective pharmacotherapy of PTSD. Future improvements in the treatment of this disorder await further clinical trials and neurobiological research.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic illness effects one in ten adolescents worldwide. Adolescence involves a desire for autonomy from parental control and the necessity to transition care from parent to child. This review investigates the transition to adolescent self-management of chronic illness treatment behaviors in the context of parent-adolescent relationships.
   Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science was conducted from earliest database records to early June 2017. Articles were included if they focused on adolescents, addressed illness self-management, discussed the parent-adolescent relationship, and were published in English. Articles were excluded if the chronic illness was a mental health condition, included children younger than 10 years of age, or lacked peer review.
   Results: Nine studies met inclusion criteria. Outcomes included challenges to adolescent self-management, nature of the parent-adolescent relationship, illness representation, perceptions of adolescent self-efficacy in compliance, medical decision making, laboratory measures, and adolescent self-management competence. Across diagnoses, parents who were available to monitor, be a resource, collaborate with their adolescent, and engage in ongoing dialogue were key in the successful transition to autonomous illness management.
   Conclusions: There is a paucity of research addressing the experiences of adolescents in becoming experts in their own care.

AB  - A wealth of evidence has implicated inflammation in the development of depression. Yet, the heterogeneous nature of depression has impeded efforts to understand, prevent, and treat the disease. The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize the connections between inflammation and established core features of depression that exhibit more homogeneity than the syndrome itself: exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward processing, decreased cognitive control, and somatic syndrome. For each core feature, we first provide a brief overview of its relevance to depression and neurobiological underpinnings, and then review evidence investigating a potential role of inflammation. We focus primarily on findings from experimental paradigms of exogenously-induced inflammation. We conclude that inflammation likely plays a role in exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward reactivity, and somatic symptoms. There is less evidence supporting an effect of inflammation on cognitive control as assessed by standard neuropsychological measures. Finally, we discuss implications for future research and recommendationsfor how to test the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of heterogeneous psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Rodent research suggests that pregnancy, motherhood and attendant offspring care affect changes in neural function and behaviors that are not directly maternal in nature, but involve cognition, affect, and responses to stress. Thus, female rats having had one pregnancy and bout of rearing (primiparous), or multiple pregnancies and bouts of rearing (multiparous), generally show greater resilience to stress, decreased anxiety, and better memory abilities than female rats that have never experienced motherhood (virgin or nulliparous). Moreover, some studies show that these neural changes remain long after the last pregnancy, persisting even into old age. In the current review, we will begin by discussing these behavioral and neural changes in rodents and provide some information concerning their possible mechanisms. Then we will review data from studies examining anxiety and cognition in postpartum human mothers. While this data is less conclusive than that from non-human animals, it appears that reproductive experience may confer some beneficial changes to human mothers in terms of lowering the anxiety/stress response and enhancing certain aspects of memory.

AB  - A total of 64 children, aged 7 and 10, watched a clown performing three sketches rated as very funny by the children. Two experimental conditions were created by asking half of the participants to suppress their laughter. Facial expressions were videotaped and analysed with FACS. For both ages, the results show a significant shorter duration (but not a lower frequency) of episodes of laughter and Duchenne smiles, and greater frequency of facial control movements in the suppression compared to the free expression group. The detailed results on individual facial action units used to control amusement expressions suggest hypotheses on the nature of the underlying processes. The participants' explicit knowledge of their control strategies was assessed through standardised interviews. Although behavioural control strategies were reported equally frequently by the two age groups, 10-year-olds verbalised more mental control strategies than 7-year-olds. This theoretically expected difference was not related to the actual ability to control facial expression. This result challenges the commonly held assumption that explicit knowledge of control strategies results in a greater ability to execute such control in ongoing social interactions.

AB  - Phytochemicals having multiple properties which are used to cure various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, angiogenesis, aging, inflammatory, cardiovascular and arthritic disease, etc., Extensive use of phytochemicals and their derivatives leads to unavailability or scarcity of products in nature. Despite this episode, the nanotechnology resolves the setback of handling phytochemicals by increasing their bioavailability, longlost acting, target-specific and less or no toxicity. Here, we focused on the 24 known phytochemicals and preparation of NPs without discriminating the polymers and metals in NPs. All the phytochemicals did not fully satisfy the toxicological hazards, physical-pharmaceutical challenges, bioethical and health issues research. Hence these NPs and their NP incorporated phytochemicals need to be characterized in a way to give direct usage to the common man. Commercialization of NP formulations in pharmaceuticals needs statutory regulation norms for complete satisfaction and safety for endusers. As of now, many NP mediated pharmaceutical products are available in the market with full-fledged but still many unrevea led about their fate in the environment. In this review, the characterization of nanoparticles, the transparent benefit of nanoparticles (NPs), and their current application in various fields has been discussed.

AB  - Australia's rural communities rely heavily on public-sector provided community mental health services and these services face major recruitment and retention challenges, with many long-term unfilled positions and high staff turnover. This paper aims, by undertaking a comprehensive literature review of Australian peer-reviewed studies, to identify the impacting factors on retention among community mental health clinicians working in rural Australia. Thirteen studies were found and thematic analysis identified three key main categories (1) the nature of the work; (2) the multidisciplinary team; and (3) the attractors and detractors of working rurally. This literature identifies that community mental health workers have demanding and stressful roles and carry heavy workloads. Clinicians working in rural positions experience additional challenges arising from extra work demands and workplace stresses. The impacts of the interdisciplinary generic casework approach and rurality within community mental health have not yet been well investigated. The studies exploring impacting factors on retention have, so far, mostly focused on work and professional considerations with less research conducted exploring personal and community factors. Future retention focused studies are needed that are multidisciplinary, rural focused and take a multifactor approach.

AB  - Background: Evidence-based best practices for incorporation into an optimal multilevel intervention for suicide prevention should be identifiable in the literature. Aims: To identify effective interventions for the prevention of suicidal behavior. Methods: Review of systematic reviews found in the Pubmed, Cochrane, and DARE databases. Steps include risk-of-bias assessment, data extraction, summarization of best practices, and identification of synergistic potentials of such practices in multilevel approaches. Results: Six relevant systematic reviews were found. Best practices identified as effective were as follows: training general practitioners (GPs) to recognize and treat depression and suicidality, improving accessibility of care for at-risk people, and restricting access to means of suicide. Although no outcomes were reported for multilevel interventions or for synergistic effects of multiple interventions applied together, indirect support was found for possible synergies in particular combinations of interventions within multilevel strategies. Conclusions: A number of evidence-based best practices for the prevention of suicide and suicide attempts were identified. Research is needed on the nature and extent of potential synergistic effects of various preventive activities within multilevel interventions.

AB  - Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is highly recurrent. Most patients with MDD are treated in the Primary Care (PC) setting. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify risk factors associated with relapse of MDD in PC. Method: A systematic review of PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect, from 1978 to 2019, following PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Results: Eight studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria and 12 risk factors associated with relapse of MDD were found. Patients who showed a higher frequency of relapse were: 1) those with higher scores in neuroticism, disability, current MDD episode severity, and childhood abuse; 2) lower scores on extraversion, self-esteem, emotional role, physical functioning; 3) history of MDD relapse; 4) comorbidity; and 5) poorer adherence to antidepressant medication (ADM). In terms of treatment, ADM combined with cognitive behavioural therapy and psychoeducation was reported to produce fewer relapses, as was mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients with a higher score in childhood abuse. Conclusions: Despite the very varied nature of the studies, different risk factors associated with relapse were identified. However, more research is needed on this important problem, with randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Executive dysfunctions are a frequently described non-motor symptom in patients with Parkinsonos disease (PD). However, the nature, extent, variability, and determinants of executive dysfunctions in PD are still poorly understood. To improve the characterization of executive dysfunctions in PD, we conducted a meta-analysis of the studies administering the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) to patients with PD and healthy controls. We included k = 161 studies, which allowed us to precisely estimate the size of PD-related WCST deficits and to run powerful tests for potential moderators of these deficits. We found robust WCST deficits in PD, which were medium-to-large in size. These deficits were most pronounced in patients tested after withdrawal from dopaminergic medication and in samples characterized by severe motor impairment and long disease duration. Substantial WCST impairment was also detected in non-demented, non-depressed, and never-medicated patients with PD as well as after conservatively correcting for publication bias. Based on these findings, impaired WCST performance can be considered as a major hallmark of executive dysfunction in PD.

AB  - The tenacity of eating disorders found among women abused and neglected in childhood becomes comprehensible when they are understood as desperate attempts to regulate overwhelming affective states, and to construct a coherent sense of self and system of meaning when internal structures are lacking. In this article we use conceptualizations of complex posttraumatic stress disorder to make sense of the troubling and sometimes paradoxic facets of disturbed eating behaviors in the traumatized patients: their symbolic and metaphoric meanings; their intensity, repetitiveness, and tenacity; their dissociative qualities; their use as agents of self-soothing as well as self-harm; their resistance to traditional treatments; and the particular nature of accompanying symptoms and syndromes, including self-mutilation, borderline pathology, suicidality, depression, substance abuse, and sexual acting out or avoidance. Treatment of the traumatized eating disorder patient is multifaceted, complicated, and often demanding. It may involve individual treatment, group therapy, family interventions, and/or pharmacotherapy. As survivors connect past traumas with current symptoms and reenactment phenomena within a safe interpersonal context, they gain an increased capacity to relinquish their symptoms of eating disorder and to modulate disruptive internal states in a manner that soothes rather than intensifies past wounds.

AB  - It is well known that stressful experiences may affect learning and memory processes. Less clear is the exact nature of these stress effects on memory: both enhancing and impairing effects have been reported. These opposite effects may be explained if the different time courses of stress hormone, in particular catecholamine and glucocorticoid, actions are taken into account. Integrating two popular models, we argue here that rapid catecholamine and non-genomic glucocorticoid actions interact in the basolateral amygdala to shift the organism into a 'memory formation mode' that facilitates the consolidation of stressful experiences into long-term memory. The undisturbed consolidation of these experiences is then promoted by genomic glucocorticoid actions that induce a 'memory storage mode', which suppresses competing cognitive processes and thus reduces interference by unrelated material. Highlighting some current trends in the field, we further argue that stress affects learning and memory processes beyond the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus and that stress may pre-program subsequent memory performance when it is experienced during critical periods of brain development.

AB  - Partly due to the failure of anthropology to productively engage the fields of psychology and neuroscience, investigations in cultural neuroscience have occurred largely without the active involvement of anthropologists or anthropological theory. Dramatic advances in the tools and findings of social neuroscience have emerged in parallel with significant advances in anthropology that connect social and political-economic processes with fine-grained descriptions of individual experience and behavior. We describe four domains of inquiry that follow from these recent developments, and provide suggestions for intersections between anthropological tools - such as social theory, ethnography, and quantitative modeling of cultural models - and cultural neuroscience. These domains are: the sociocultural construction of emotion, status and dominance, the embodiment of social information, and the dual social and biological nature of ritual. Anthropology can help locate unique or interesting populations and phenomena for cultural neuroscience research. Anthropological tools can also help "drill down" to investigate key socialization processes accountable for cross-group differences. Furthermore, anthropological research points at meaningful underlying complexity in assumed relationships between social forces and biological outcomes. Finally, ethnographic knowledge of cultural content can aid with the development of ecologically relevant stimuli for use in experimental protocols.

AB  - The etiology of many brain diseases remains allusive to date after intensive investigation of genomic background and symptomatology from the day of birth. Emerging evidences indicate that a third factor, epigenetics prior to the birth, can exert profound influence on the development and functioning of the brain and over many neurodevelopmental syndromes. This chapter reviews how aversive environmental exposure to parents might predispose or increase vulnerability of offspring to neurodevelopmental deficit through alteration of epigenetics. These epigenetic altering environmental factors will be discussed in the category of addictive agents, nutrition or diet, prescriptive medicine, environmental pollutant, and stress. Epigenetic alterations induced by these aversive environmental factors cover all aspects of epigenetics including DNA methylation, histone modification, noncoding RNA, and chromatin modification. Next, the mechanisms how these environmental inputs influence epigenetics will be discussed. Finally, how environmentally altered epigenetic marks affect neurodevelopment is exemplified by the alcohol-induced fetal alcohol syndrome. It is hoped that a thorough understanding of the nature of prenatal epigenetic inputs will enable researchers with a clear vision to better unravel neurodevelopmental deficit, late-onset neuropsychiatric diseases, or idiosyncratic mental disorders.

AB  - Data accumulated in the last decade indicate that nitric oxide (NO) participates in the regulation of neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Due to its physicochemical properties, NO is an ideal mediator of nonsynaptic interactions. The importance of monoaminergic systems in the function of the brain is clearly shown by the number of severe neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g. depression, Parkinson's disease) caused by the impairment of monoaminergic neurotransmission. Because of their neuroanatomical characteristic, monoaminergic systems participate mainly in nonsynaptic interactions. Since NO is a potential nonsynaptic modulator, it may have an important role in the regulation of monoaminergic systems. The aim of the present review is to survey the literature on the effect of NO on dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. The potential mechanisms of action are summarized. Since there is no agreement in the literature on the nature of the effect of NO exerted on monoaminergic neurotransmission, and there are contradictory data concerning the mechanisms involved, the possible reasons for this unusual inconsistency are also discussed.

   The overview focuses on publications relating to the history of social psychiatry and the mental health movement, respectively.
   Recent findings
   The selected works show fundamental developments within psychiatry, which can be conceived in the broadest sense as sociomedical in nature. Main emphases are the criticism of large institutions, reform movements and antipsychiatric movements, the search for alternative therapeutic methods, and the question of the resocialization of the mentally ill. Furthermore, it is important to demonstrate the influences of other scientific disciplines.
   Summary
   Although social psychiatric approaches can be discerned as early as in the 19th century, the focus of the works lies on the development of social psychiatry in the 20th century. Only from the 1950s onwards did social psychiatry establish itself as an integral part of psychiatric practice and later of research. Accordingly, the main focus of the studies is on the development after the Second World War, not least because processes that began at that time have not yet been concluded. Happily, a trend is apparent in this respect: the one-sided view of physicians and their actions is being increasingly complemented by further professional groups and is consequently broadened by important dimensions.

AB  - This article outlines a framework of creativity based on functional neuroanatomy. Recent advances in the field of cognitive neuroscience have identified distinct brain circuits that are involved in specific higher brain functions. To date, these findings have not been applied to research on creativity. It is proposed that there are four basic types of creative insights, each mediated by a distinctive neural circuit. By definition, creative insights occur in consciousness. Given the view that the working memory buffer of the prefrontal cortex holds the content of consciousness, each of the four distinctive neural loops terminates there. When creativity is the result of deliberate control, as opposed to spontaneous generation, the prefrontal cortex also instigates the creative process. Both processing modes, deliberate and spontaneous, can guide neural computation in structures that contribute emotional content and in structures that provide cognitive analysis, yielding the four basic types of creativity. Supportive evidence from psychological, cognitive, and neuroscientific studies is presented and integrated in this article. The new theoretical framework systematizes the interaction between knowledge and creative thinking, and how the nature of this relationship changes as a function of domain and age. Implications for the arts and sciences are briefly discussed.

AB  - Humans often face binary cognitive-control dilemmas, with the choice between persistence and flexibility being a crucial one. Tackling these dilemmas requires metacontrol, i.e.. the control of the current cognitive control policy. As predicted from functional, psychometric, neuroscientific, and modeling approaches, interindividual variability in metacontrol biases towards persistence or flexibility could be demonstrated in metacontrol-sensitive tasks. These biases covary systematically with genetic predispositions regarding mesofrontal and nigrostriatal dopaminergic functioning and the individualistic or collectivistic nature of the cultural background. However, there is also evidence for mood- and meditation-induced intraindividual variability (with negative mood and focused-attention meditation being associated with a bias towards persistence, and positive mood and open-monitoring meditation being associated with a bias towards flexibility), suggesting that genetic and cultural factors do not determine metacontrol settings entirely. We suggest a theoretical framework that explains how genetic predisposition and cultural learning can lead to the implementation of metacontrol defaults, which however can be shifted towards persistence or flexibility by situational factors.

AB  - This article proposes to reconceptualize attachment theory as a culture-sensitive framework. First the seminal contribution of John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth are recognized in proposing a new paradigm for understanding children's development, synthesizing the interdisciplinary knowledge of relationship formation present during the 1950s (Bowlby) and developing a fieldwork approach in combination with quasi-experimental procedures in the laboratory (Ainsworth). It is argued that students of attachment theory have expanded the framework with respect to the intergenerational transmission and the organizational nature of attachment, relations with psychopathology and clinical applications, and its psychophysiological foundation. It is further argued that attachment theorists were not responsive to developments in evolutionary sciences and cultural/anthropological approaches of parenting and child development. From an evolutionary perspective, contextual variability is crucial to meet the purpose of adaptation. It is demonstrated that the assumptions of monotropy, the conception of stranger anxiety, as well as the definition of attachment in mainstream attachment research are in line with the conception of psychological autonomy, adaptive for Western middle-class, but deviate from the cultural values of many non-Western and mainly rural ecosocial environments. In the concluding paragraph, a strategy is proposed for an empirical research program that would contribute to the cultural foundation of attachment.

AB  - Introduction: Childhood maltreatment (CM) has been associated with an increased risk of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behaviors. However, the exact nature of the association between CM and NSSI is currently unclear. The present review aimed to systematically investigate the association between CM and NSSI in adolescence and early adulthood.
   Methods: A systematic search of four major electronic databases covering both medical and social science research (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and PsycINFO) was conducted.
   Results: Overall, 20 cross-sectional studies including a total of 22,517 individuals, 3 longitudinal follow-up studies including 1,728 individuals, and 3 retrospective studies including 62,089 individuals were selected. It appears that CM is a significant risk factor for both NSSI and suicide attempts. The increased vulnerability to NSSI seems to be related to experiences of CM, particularly sexual abuse. Gender differences were also found. Generally, when compared to males, females who experienced CM seem to be more vulnerable to presenting with NSSI and suicidal behaviors.
   Conclusion: There is a positive association between CM and NSSI. The importance of early detection and risk reduction of self-injurious behavior for adolescents is discussed.

The purpose of this review is to describe the characteristics of the disease in adults, depict comorbidities that accompany it, and expand the scope over methods of diagnosis and treatment of these ages. Methods: A search was conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE database for relevant key words ADHD', attention deficit', hyperactivity' and adult'. Secondary search parameters were comorbid', prevalence', epidemiology', therapy' and drug therapy'. Search was limited to English' and Humans'. Results: Over the years, the persistent nature of the disorder has been clarified, elucidating prevalence rate, gender differences and subtype shifts among adult ADHD population. Nevertheless, even today, there is only limited awareness of the existence of the disorder across one's lifespan, its consequences and the appropriate treatment. Conclusions: Our results emphasise the growing awareness of adult psychosocial impairments due to ADHD symptoms and comorbidities, as well as the need for further collaboration among practitioners and mental health-care professionals to better identify the condition and allow for effective treatment.

AB  - There has been a dramatic rise in gene x environment studies of human behavior over the past decade that have moved the field beyond simple nature versus nurture debates. These studies offer promise in accounting for more variability in behavioral and biological phenotypes than studies that focus on genetic or experiential factors alone. They also provide clues into mechanisms of modifying genetic risk or resilience in neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, it is rare that these studies consider how these interactions change over the course of development. In this paper, we describe research that focuses on the impact of a polymorphism in a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, known to be involved in learning and development. Specifically we present findings that assess the effects of genotypic and environmental loadings on neuroanatomic and behavioral phenotypes across development. The findings illustrate the use of a genetic mouse model that mimics the human polymorphism, to constrain the interpretation of gene-environment interactions across development in humans.

AB  - The problem of self-disclosure is explored in relation to currently shifting paradigms of the nature of the analytic relation and analytic interaction. Relational and intersubjective perspectives emphasize the role of self-disclosure as not merely allowable, but as an essential facilitating aspect of the analytic dialogue, in keeping with the role of the analyst as a contributing partner in the process. At the opposite extreme, advocates of classical anonymity stress the importance of neutrality and abstinence. The paper seeks to chart a course between unconstrained self-disclosure and absolute anonymity, both of which foster misalliances. Self-disclosure is seen as at times contributory to the analytic process, and at times deleterious. The decision whether to self-disclose, what to disclose, and when and how, should be guided by the analyst's perspective on neutrality, conceived as a mental stance in which the analyst assesses and decides what, at any given point, seems to contribute to the analytic process and the patient's therapeutic benefit. The major risk in self-disclosure is the tendency to draw the analytic interaction into the real relation between analyst and patient, thus diminishing or distorting the therapeutic alliance, mitigating transference expression, and compromising therapeutic effectiveness.

AB  - Advances in the understanding and management of bipolar disorder (BD) have been slow to emerge. Despite notable recent developments in neurosciences, our conceptualization of the nature of this mental disorder has not meaningfully progressed. One of the key reasons for this scenario is the continuing lack of a comprehensive disease model. Within the increasing complexity of modern research methods, there is a clear need for an overarching theoretical framework, in which findings are assimilated and predictions are generated. In this review and hypothesis article, we propose such a framework, one in which dysregulated energy expenditure is a primary, sufficient cause for BD. Our proposed model is centered on the disruption of the molecular and cellular network regulating energy production and expenditure, as well its potential secondary adaptations and compensatory mechanisms. We also focus on the putative longitudinal progression of this pathological process, considering its most likely periods for onset, such as critical periods that challenges energy homeostasis (e.g. neurodevelopment, social isolation), and the resulting short and long-term phenotypical manifestations.

AB  - The aim of the present review is to discuss how housing conditions affect behavioral performance in laboratory rodents from an ethological view. Commonly used laboratory rodents such as rats and mice, are originally captured animals that largely retain species-typical natural behaviors, while have fully adapted to a laboratory setting after long-term domestication. Laboratory settings including caging and artificial group housing are a considerable ethological factor influencing rodents' behaviors in commonly employed behavioral test paradigms, including emotional and defensive behaviors, learning and memory, and attention-related behaviors. Particularly, isolation rearing, single-housed in a cage, is referred to a deprivation of social relationships with cagemates, has a substantial impact on behavioral performance in laboratory rodents. In this review, we will fully examine the importance of caging related ethological factors, e.g., social relationships and its deprivation, which are essential for unraveling the nature of housing effect in laboratory rodents. These discussions regarding the housing conditions will provide valuable information for appropriately conducting behavioral studies and interpreting data of rodents' behaviors in neuroscience.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that the composition of the resident bacteria within the gastrointestinal tract can influence the brain and behavior, particularly with respect to cognitive function. Cognitive function encompasses the life-long process of learning, both long- and short-term processes. Cognition was originally thought to be exclusively regulated by the central nervous system, with long-term potentiation and neurogenesis contributing to the creation and storage of memories, but now other systems, including, for example, the immune system and the intestinal microbiome may also be involved. Cognitive impairment has been identified in numerous disease states, both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal in nature, many of which have also been characterized as having a role for dysbiosis in disease pathogenesis. This includes, but is not limited to, inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, type 1 diabetes, obesity, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. The role of cognition and the microbiome will be discussed in this chapter for all these diseases, as well as evidence for a role in maintaining overall human health and well being. Finally, evidence for a role for probiotics in beneficially modulating the microbiota and leading to improved cognition will be discussed.

AB  - Introduction. - Deficits in social cognition and interpersonal difficulties are key features in borderline personality disorder. Social cognition refers to the function of perceiving and adequately dealing with social signals, leading to the establishment and maintenance of healthy and positive social relationships. Evidence suggests that oxytocin (OT) may improve social cognition and human social behavior. Recently, several studies have highlighted the beneficial effects of oxytocin in several psychiatric conditions involving social cognition deficits such as schizophrenia, autism or social phobia. However, despite growing interest, the effects of oxytocin in patients with borderline personality disorder are far from being clearly demonstrated.
   Objective. - The objective of this work was to review and discuss studies investigating the interest of oxytocin in alleviating social cognition deficits in patients with borderline personality disorder (recognition of emotion, trust and cooperation, affective and cognitive empathy, emotional expression and social problem-solving).
   Method. - A systematic review of the literature was conducted up to September 31, 2016 on the Pubmed, Science direct, Medline and Scopus databases using "borderline personality disorder" and "oxytocin" as keywords. To be included, studies were to include patients with borderline personality disorder; to investigate social cognition and to investigate the effect of oxytocin on social cognition in patients with TPB.
   Results. - The initial search yielded 52 articles. Among them, 11 studies were selected according to the PRISMA criteria. The effect of oxytocin on social cognition in patients with borderline personality disorder was mainly investigated in relation to recognition of emotions and trust and cooperation. We did not find any studies investigating the effect of oxytocin on affective and cognitive empathy, emotional expression or social problem-solving abilities. In patients with borderline personality disorder, oxytocin had a beneficial impact on recognition and discrimination of emotions and on hypervigilance towards social threats. However, oxytocin could hinder trust and cooperation.
   Conclusions. - These data lead us to consider oxytocin as a treatment for emotion recognition deficit and hypervigilance towards social threats in borderline personality disorder. A beneficial effect of oxytocin of this nature may be obtained only in patients without deficits in trust and cooperation because of a risk of aggravating relational instability. There was no current evidence for the interest of oxytocin in enhancing affective and cognitive empathy in borderline personality disorder. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical interest of combining oxytocin with psychotherapeutic approaches such as dialectical behavioral therapy or mentalisation-based treatment. (C) 2017

AB  - Introduction: Father-infant interactions are important for optimal offspring outcomes. Moreover, paternal perinatal psychopathology is associated with psychological and developmental disturbances in the offspring, and this risk may increase when both parents are unwell. While, the father-offspring relationship is a plausible mechanism of risk transmission, there is presently no "gold standard" tool for assessing the father-offspring relationship. Therefore, we systematically searched and reviewed the application and performance of tools used to assess the father-offspring relationship from pregnancy to 24-months postnatal.
   Methods: Four electronic databases (including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care Database, and CINAHL) were searched. Selected articles included evidence of father-offspring relationship assessment in relation to parental perinatal psychopathology and/or offspring outcomes. Data was extracted and synthesized according to the following: (i) evidence supporting the performance of tools in terms of their psychometric properties when applied in the context of fathers, (ii) tool specific characteristics, and (iii) study specific methodological aspects in which the tool was embedded.
   Results: Of the 30,500 records eligible for screening, 38 unique tools used to assess the father-offspring relationship were identified, from 61 studies. Ten tools were employed in the context of paternal psychopathology, three in the context of maternal psychopathology, and seven in the context of both maternal and paternal psychopathology, while nine tools were applied in the context of offspring outcomes only. The remaining nine tools were used in the context of both parental psychopathology (i.e., paternal, and/or maternal psychopathology) and offspring outcomes. Evidence supporting the psychometric robustness of the extracted observational, self-report and interview-based tools was generally limited. Most tools were originally developed in maternal samples-with few tools demonstrating evidence of content validation specific to fathers. Furthermore, various elements influencing tool performance were recognized-including variation in tool characteristics (e.g., relationship dimensions assessed, assessment mode, and scoring formats) and study specific methodological aspects, (e.g., setting and study design, sample characteristics, timing and nature of parental psychopathology, and offspring outcomes).
   Conclusion: Given the strengths and limitations of each mode of assessment, future studies may benefit from a multimethod approach to assessing the father-offspring relationship, which may provide a more accurate assessment than one method alone.

AB  - BackgroundHomelessness is a growing concern as it affects a large number of people worldwide. Individuals and families experiencing homelessness are vulnerable in terms of health and underutilise health services. Despite being a global problem, not much is known about the range and breath of literature exploring health problems and health care service utilisation among homeless adults in Africa.ObjectivesTo identify the nature and scope of existing evidence on physical and mental health, and health service utilisation among homeless adults in Africa. The review aimed to examine how research is conducted, identify gaps, guide future research, and make recommendations for development and implementation of policies and practices.MethodsA search of articles and reports involving six databases: Scopus, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, African Journal Online, and Google Scholar was conducted from June 2018 to February 2019. Studies published between 1980 and 2019 that examined the health problems and health service utilisation among homeless adults in Africa were considered. Manual search in reference lists and grey literature was also done to add reports. Data was extracted manually using a charting developed. A descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis were performed.ResultsOf 761 records found, 14 satisfied the pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three themes emerged from the studies: Physical health problems, mental health problems; and healthcare services utilisation. Of the 14 included studies, nine studied and reported physical health problems such as sexually transmitted infections, injuries and disabilities, respiratory and cardiac diseases. Five studies explored mental health problems such as psychotic disorders, mood disorders, self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Only five studies investigated utilisation of different types of health care services among homeless people.ConclusionsEvidence shows that homeless adults suffered from a range of physical and mental health problems, and underutilisation of health care services. However, there is lack of information on the complex interrelationship between homelessness and health, as well as differences in prevalence of health problems among the various sub-groups of homeless. There is also lack of information regarding utilisation other important healthcare services such as mental health services, alcohol and drugs services, and accident and emergency service, and future researches should address that. Also, attention should be given to intervention models for complex and effective physical and psychiatric care as well as social support to address the homeless people's health vulnerabilities.

AB  - Objective: To review both the functions and dysfunction of the executive system (ES) focusing on the extent of executive function (EF) deficits in most psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents and the possibility of such deficits acting as markers for pharmacological management. Method: A literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, Psychinfo, CINAHL, PsychArticles and PubMed with the following keywords: executive function or dysfunction, pediatric or children or adolescents, psychopharmacology, psychotropic medications, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Due to the limited amount of specific information obtained for some childhood disorders, the search was broadened to include relevant adult literature where information was extrapolated. Results: Abundant literature was found on the nature of the ES and the executive dysfunctions in most psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, but not so much on the use of medication. EF deficits were found to be more consistent in disorders such as ADHD, ASD and FASD than in the other disorders but were not specific enough for use as clinical markers for those disorders. For children with ADHD and ASD there was adequate information on the use of psychotropic medications and impact on some EF domains but information on the impact of medication on EF in the other disorders in children and adolescents was fairly limited. Medications acting on the dopaminergic system also showed positive effects on EF deficits and are commonly used in the treatment of EF disorders such as ADHD, ASD and FASD. Conclusion: Existing literature indicates that EF deficits underlie most psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. However, there are so many executive functions linked to so many activities and circuits in the brain that it is hard to quantify them in a particular disorder for use as specific markers for that disorder. The ES uses dopamine as its main neurotransmitter and this has implications for clinical management. Dopamine agonists (e.g. stimulants) and antagonists (e.g. neuroleptics) are medications that have direct impact on the ES and are commonly used to treat EF disorders in children and adolescents while serotonergic medications e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not been very successful in treating such disorders. Identifying EF deficits early could be useful in guiding management including the use of medication in those disorders.

AB  - Background: Indicated primary prevention in young people at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) is a promising avenue for improving outcomes of one of the most severe mental disorders but their effectiveness has recently been questioned. Methods: Umbrella review. A multi-step independent literature search of Web of Science until January 11, 2019, identified interventional meta-analyses in CHR-P individuals. The individual randomised controlled trials that were analysed by the meta-analyses were extracted. A review of ongoing trials and a simulation of living meta-analysis complemented the analysis. Results: Seven meta-analyses investigating preventive treatments in CHR-P individuals were included. None of them produced pooled effect sizes across psychological, pharmacological, or other types of interventions. The outcomes analysed encompassed risk of psychosis onset, the acceptability of treatments, the severity of attenuated positive/negative psychotic symptoms, depression, symptom-related distress, social functioning, general functioning, and quality of life. These meta-analyses were based on 20 randomised controlled trials: the vast majority defined the prevention of psychosis onset as their primary outcome of interest and only powered to large effect sizes. There was no evidence to favour any preventive intervention over any other (or control condition) for improving any of these clinical outcomes. Caution is required when making clinical recommendations for the prevention of psychosis in individuals at risk. Discussion: Prevention of psychosis from a CHR-P state has been, and should remain, the primary outcome of interventional research, refined and complemented by other clinically meaningful outcomes. Stagnation of knowledge should promote innovative and collaborative research efforts, in line with the progressive and incremental nature of medical knowledge. Advancements will most likely be associated with the development of new experimental therapeutics that are ongoing along with the ability to deconstruct the high heterogeneity within CHR-P populations. This would require the estimation of treatment-specific effect sizes through living individual participant data meta-analyses, controlling risk enrichment during recruitment, statistical power, and embedding precision medicine within youth mental health services that can accommodate sequential prognosis and advanced trial designs. Conclusions: The evidence-based challenges and proposed solutions addressed by this umbrella review can inform the next generation of research into preventive treatments for psychosis.

AB  - Continuous interactions between physiological body-brain rhythms influence how individuals act, perceive, and evaluate their environment. Despite increasing interest, the intricate interface between breathing, cardiac, neural rhythms, and cognitive function remains poorly understood. By evaluating current theoretical and empirical implications, we derive an integrative framework of a 'body-brain dynamic system' that combines a hidden hierarchical structure with dynamical state transitions. We propose that body-brain signals can interchangeably drive state- and task-specific coupling mechanisms which influence cognitive functions. The dynamical nature of this framework parallels the intrinsic variability of human behavior, and ultimately aims at better understanding how individuals act in and adapt to a dynamically changing environment.

AB  - Recent findings from cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology may help explain why recovered memories of trauma are sometimes illusory. In particular, the notion of defective source monitoring has been used to explain a wide range of recently established memory distortions and illusions. Conversely, the results of a number of studies may potentially be relevant to forgetting and recovery of accurate memories, including studies demonstrating reduced hippocampal volume in survivors of sexual abuse, and recovery from functional and organic retrograde amnesia. Other recent findings of interest include the possibility that state-dependent memory could be induced by stress-related hormones, new pharmacological models of dissociative states, and evidence for 'repression' in patients with right parietal brain damage.

They describe how racism has both ideological and structural components and perpetuates itself recursively at the macro- (e.g., group, institution) and microlevels (e.g., interpersonal). As one consequence of its embedded, cyclical nature, efforts to treat client problems that involve issues of race and racism will necessarily entail piercing distortions in reality, encouraging self-moral development and eliciting risk-taking behaviors. To take part in transforming current structures of racism, counseling psychologists are urged to extend these strategies beyond the therapeutic milieu. Implications for practice, training, and research are presented.

TI  - Henri Wallon's theory of early child development: The role of emotions
AB  - The present paper gives an account of part of the stage theory of early child development of the French theorist Henri Wallon (1879-1962). Unlike his contemporary Jean Piaget, Wallon concentrated his efforts upon a description of the child's emotional development and the role emotions play in establishing the bond between child and caregiver. The description of Wallon's stage theory is preceded by biographical information and a presentation of his methodological views. It is argued that Wallon's theory is unique in its focus, exerted influence upon theorists such as Lev Vygotsky, and is basically compatible with modern insights about the nature of child development and the growth of intersubjectivity.

AB  - Theories of episodic memory have proposed that individual memory traces are linked together by a representation of context that drifts slowly over time. Recent data challenge the notion that contextual drift is always slow and passive. In particular, changes in one's external environment or internal model induce discontinuities in memory that are reflected in sudden changes in neural activity, suggesting that context can shift abruptly. Furthermore, context change effects are sensitive to top-down goals, suggesting that contextual drift may be an active process. These findings call for revising models of the role of context in memory, in order to account for abrupt contextual shifts and the controllable nature of context change.

Of particular recent interest has been the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), activated to restore protein homeostasis (proteostasis) upon mitochondrial protein misfolding. Several axes of the UPRmt have been described, creating some confusion as to the nature of the different responses. While distinct molecularly, these different axes are likely mutually beneficial and activated in parallel. This review aims at describing and distinguishing the different mammalian MSR/UPRmt axes to define key processes and members and to examine the involvement of protein misfolding.

The lack of motivation is increasingly recognized to be a very important impediment to positive management in schizophrenic pathology. In this mini-review, we described the current understanding of the nature and causes of the specific motivational deficits in schizophrenia in order to find better management strategies for this heterogeneous disorder. All the data and theories presented here clearly demonstrate that amotivation is a fundamental aspect of the negative symptomatology in schizophrenia and could represent a useful factor in understanding and improving the mechanisms and further management of schizophrenia.

It is therefore timely to review the current state of knowledge of the genetics of bipolar disorder. Family, twin and adoption studies are all consistent in confirming the strongly heritable nature of this condition. As segregation analyses have been unable to determine the mode of transmission of bipolar disorder, ongoing linkage analyses using DNA markers will be crucial in determining whether this condition is due to a single major gene, a small number of genes, or multifactorial polygenic inheritance.

It begins with a brief discussion regarding the nature of adolescent depression and then critically evaluates the available evidence regarding the efficacy and tolerability of psychotropic intervention as it has, to date, been reported. As the available evidence suggests that tricyclic antidepressants have failed to show efficacy, yet demonstrate significant problems with tolerability and safety, the remainder of the article describes how clinicians should prescribe antidepressants using the serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Areas covered include assessment, treatment initiation, dosing, outcome evaluation, adverse events, and combinations. The review concludes with a discussion of long-term therapy with antidepressant medications.

AB  - Abundant evidence links personality with emotion via coping. Alternatively, personality can be viewed as an emergent property of responses to the experience of emotion. Dispositions to control, approach, escape, and avoid one's emotional experience underlie diverse traits, including positive and negative urgency, trait emotional approach and avoidance, alexithymia, and emotional expressiveness. In this review, we consider the neurobiological underpinnings of these dispositions and the nature (e.g., stability) and adaptiveness of the associated traits. Important future directions for research in this area include the roles of development, intraindividual variability and flexibility, and the intensity and structure of emotional experience.

AB  - A central, unresolved problem in affective neuroscience is understanding how emotions are represented in nervous system activity. After prior localization approaches largely failed, researchers began applying multivariate statistical tools to reconceptualize how emotion constructs might be embedded in large-scale brain networks. Findings from pattern analyses of neuroimaging data show that affective dimensions and emotion categories are uniquely represented in the activity of distributed neural systems that span cortical and subcortical regions. Results from multiple-category decoding studies are incompatible with theories postulating that specific emotions emerge from the neural coding of valence and arousal. This 'new look' into emotion representation promises to improve and reformulate neurobiological models of affect.

AB  - I discuss the relation between future mental time travel (FMTT) and episodic and semantic memory. I then examine the nature of the "self" assumed to be projected or imagined in the future and types of subjective temporalities. Based on this discussion, I argue that a person absent episodic memory could imagine a personal future as the result of (a) the fact that semantic memory, as well as episodic memory, can be self-referential, (b) the finding that semantic memory can enable certain forms of FMTT, and (c) the ability to position semantic self-knowledge within the temporal parameters associated with semantic memory.

AB  - Extensive genetic, biochemical, and histological evidence has implicated the amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and several mechanisms have been suggested, such as metal binding, reactive oxygen species production, and membrane pore formation. However, recent evidence argues for an additional role for signaling mediated by the amyloid precursor protein, APP, in part via the caspase cleavage of APP at aspartate 664. Here we review the effects and implications of this cleavage event, and propose a model of Alzheimer's disease that focuses on the critical nature of this cleavage and its downstream effects.

AB  - Studies have established a clear relationship between subjective sleep problems and the continuum of suicidality in adolescents. These studies are primarily cross-sectional in nature and conducted with epidemiological and depressed clinical samples. More recent studies focus on prospective data. Herein, we provide an update on current studies on the sleep-suicide association among youth. To further the critical mission of youth suicide prevention, future directions include more nuanced study of sleep employing a sleep health framework, longitudinal studies employing both objective and subjective sleep measures, fine-grained temporal associations between these constructs and their fluctuations over time, as well as enhanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying these associations.

AB  - Disparities and inequities in mental health and mental health care have been a persistent and unremitting issue despite concerted efforts on multiple fronts to address the problem. The enduring nature of these differences compels us to evaluate factors that led to our present state, new evidence, and novel strategies to reduce and eliminate mental health disparities and inequities. Discrimination, implicit bias, and the social determinants of mental health all serve to perpetuate mental health inequities. Providers may need to expand their roles as advocates for social change, champions for inclusion, and adjuncts to policymakers in order to reduce (and ultimately eliminate) mental health inequities in the future.

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a multidimensional syndrome that is not rooted in a single diathesis. Each of its features (affective instability, impulsivity, unstable relationships, and cognitive defects) reflects different diatheses. BPD differs from other Axis II disorders in its high level of symptoms, but is not a variant of an Axis I disorder and is difficult to describe through dimensional traits. This review suggests that BPD needs to be diagnosed with a narrower set of criteria that cover all of its domains. In the long run, the disorder will need to be redefined on the basis of its etiology and pathogenesis.

TI  - THE COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL CORRELATES OF COLOR DEFICIENCY IN CHILDREN - A LITERATURE-REVIEW AND ANALYSIS
AB  - Although color deficiency is a prevalent problem in childhood, little is known about the cognitive and social-emotional variables linked to this visual deficit. A review of the literature revealed just seven empirical articles designed to explore the psychological functioning of color-deficient children, with the results yielding contradictory findings. An analysis of the literature indicated that the equivocal nature of past research may be due to an inadequate rationale explaining what outcome variables should be tied to color deficiency. This weakness can be remedied, and as a means toward that end, specific investigative recommendations are made to provide a more valid theoretical link between color deficiency and selected cognitive and social-emotional variables.

AB  - Psychologists often interpret mixed emotional experiences, defined as experiencing more than one emotion over a given period of time, as indicative of greater emotional complexity and more adaptive functioning. In the present paper, we briefly review studies that have examined these experiences across adulthood. We describe how mixed emotions have been defined in the life-span literature, and how the various studies examining age differences in this phenomenon have yielded discrepant results. We then discuss future research directions that could clarify the nature of mixed emotions and their utility in adulthood, including the assessment of situational context, understanding when mixed emotions are adaptive in daily life, and determining how cognitive functioning is involved in these experiences.

AB  - Pulled Over: How Police Stops Define Race and Citizenship, by Charles R. Epp, Steven Maynard-Mood, and Donald Haider-Markel, is an important piece of law and society scholarship that isolates investigatory police stops as an institutional practice with profound consequences for racial inequality. Pulled Over also speaks to scholarship on race and ethnicity by addressing an ongoing tension between a focus on the socially constructed nature of racial categories and their stratifying significance. Pulled Over offers an important model for future studies by incorporating social constructionist insights into how race is measured, empirically documenting institutionally produced racial inequalities, and linking these inequalities to the evolving meaning of race itself.

AB  - Soil salinity is a major threat to agricultural sustainability and a global food security. Until now, most research has concentrated around stomatal limitation to photosynthesis, while non-stomatal limitations receiving much less attention. This work summarizes the current knowledge of impact of salinity on chloroplast metabolism and operation and finding viable solutions to minimize it. The major topics covered are: (1) the key targets of the photosynthetic apparatus under salt stress; (2) a tolerance of PSII to salt stress and its repair; (3) salinity effects on biochemistry of CO2 fixation and its regulation; (4) ionic requirements for optimal operation of chloroplasts; and (5) ion transport systems in chloroplasts that optimize chloroplast performance under hostile saline conditions. We show that enhancing plant capacity for protection by modifying PSI cyclic electron transport, redistribution of electron transport between photosystems, thylakoid membrane composition and photosynthetic antioxidant enzymes activity may be a promising way to improve tolerance to salt stress under real-field condition. It is concluded that revealing the molecular nature of chloroplast ion transporters and understanding the modes of their operation will ensure the future sustainability of the world agriculture and the prospects of biological phytoremediation of salinized land via using salt-tolerant crop germplasm.

AB  - Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a severe, chronic, and highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that affects between 1.5% and 3% of people worldwide. Despite its severity, high prevalence, and clear societal cost, current OCD therapies are only partially effective. In order to ultimately develop improved treatments for this severe mental illness, we need further research to gain an improved understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies obsessions and compulsions. Though studies in OCD patients can provide some insight into the disease process, studies in humans are inherently limited in their ability to dissect pathologic processes because of their non- invasive nature. The recent development of strategies for genetic and circuit-specific manipulation in rodent models finally allows us to identify the molecular, cellular, and circuit events that lead to abnormal repetitive behaviors and affect dysregulation relevant to OCD. This review will highlight recent studies in mouse model systems that have used transgenic and optogenetic tools in combination with classic pharmacology and behavioral techniques to advance our understanding of these pathologic processes.

AB  - Social dominance, personality ratings, and frequency, duration, and timing of social behaviors were measured pre- and postsurgically in 6 groups of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), each consisting of I sham-operated control and I monkey each with a selective amygdala, hippocampal, or orbital frontal cortex lesion. Unlike previous reports, none of the operated groups showed changes in social dominance postsurgery, although changes in other measures varied by lesion site. Although sham-operated monkeys displayed heightened avoidant, anxious, and aggressive behaviors, those with hippocampal lesions also showed increased exploration and excitability, along with reduced responses to affiliative signals. Amygdala lesions yielded several personality changes that precluded positive social interactions (increased exploration and excitability, decreased affiliation and popularity) and altered responses to threatening social signals. By contrast, monkeys with orbital frontal lesions were involved in more aggressive interactions and responded differently to both affiliative and threatening signals. Although several findings differ from earlier nonhuman primate studies, they are largely in agreement with human data and emphasize the context-specific nature of social behavior studies. Interpretation of results in relation to cognitive processes mediated by each structure is discussed.

AB  - Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) studies have shown that serotonin plays a role in learning and memory processes. In this study, we performed a pooled analysis of nine ATD studies in order to examine the nature of the memory-impairing effects of ATD and mediating factors, such as gender, age and vulnerability for disease in which disturbed serotonin was hypothesized to play a role. All studies that were used in this pooled analysis assessed declarative episodic memory using a verbal learning task paradigm. Immediate recall, delayed recall, and delayed recognition scores were examined. A total of 211 participants were included in the analysis. The analysis revealed that ATD impaired not only delayed recall, but also immediate recall. The ATD-induced impairments were larger in females than in males. Furthermore, ATD did not interact with any other serotonergic vulnerability and age. This suggests that the only factor that actually has the properties of a serotonergic vulnerability factor for declarative memory performance is female gender. The findings provide further support for a critical role of serotonin in declarative episodic memory. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article describes an emerging non-invasive neuromodulatory technology, called low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU). This technology is potentially paradigm shifting as it can deliver non-invasive and reversible deep brain neuromodulation through acoustic sonication, at millimeter precision. Low intensity focused ultrasound's spatial precision, yet non-invasive nature sets it apart from current technologies, such as transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation and deep brain stimulation. Additionally, its reversible effects allow for the causal study of deep brain regions implicated in psychiatric illness. Studies to date have demonstrated that LIFU can safely modulate human brain activity at cortical and subcortical levels. Due to its novelty, most researchers and clinicians are not aware of the potential applications and promise of this technique, underscoring the need for foundational papers to introduce the community to LIFU. This mini-review and synthesis of recent advances examines several key papers on LIFU administered to humans, describes the population under study, parameters used, and relevant findings that may guide future research. We conclude with a concise overview of some of the more pressing questions to date, considerations when interpreting new data from an emerging field, and highlight the opportunities and challenges in this exciting new area of study.

AB  - The most common visual defect to follow a lesion of the retrochiasmal pathways is homonymous hernianopia (HH), whereby, in each eye, patients are blind to the contralesional visual field. From a behavioral perspective, in addition to exhibiting a severe deficit in their contralesional visual field, hemianopic patients can also present implicit residual capacities, now usually referred to collectively as blindsight. It was recently demonstrated that HH patients can also suffer from a subtle deficit in their ipsilesional visual field, called sightblindness (the reverse case of blindsight). Furthermore, the nature of the visual deficit in the contralesional and ipsilesional visual fields, as well as the pattern of functional reorganization in the occipital lobe of HH patients after stroke, all appear to depend on the lesion side. In addition to their contralesional and ipsilesional visual deficits, and to their residual capacities, HH patients can also experience visual hallucinations in their blind field, the physiopathological mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. Herein we review blindsight in terms of its better-known aspects as well as its less-studied clinical signs such as sightblindness, hemispheric specialization and visual hallucinations. We also discuss the implications of recent experimental findings for rehabilitation of visual field defects in hemianopic patients.

AB  - Current events within the military and professional sports have resulted in an increased recognition of the long-term and debilitating consequences of traumatic brain injury. Mild traumatic brain injury accounts for the majority of head injuries, and posttraumatic headache is the most common adverse effect. It is estimated that between 30% to 90% of traumatic brain injuries result in posttraumatic headache, and for a significant number of people this headache disorder can continue for up to and over a year post injury. Often, the most severe and chronic posttraumatic headache has a migraine-like phenotype and is difficult to resolve. In this review we discuss the preclinical findings from animal models of posttraumatic headache. We also describe potential mechanisms by which traumatic brain injury leads to chronic posttraumatic headache, including neuroinflammatory mediators and migraine-associated neuropeptides. There are surprisingly few preclinical studies that have investigated overlapping mechanisms between posttraumatic headache and migraine, especially considering the prevalence and debilitating nature of posttraumatic headache. Given this context, posttraumatic headache is a field with many emerging opportunities for growth. The frequency of posttraumatic headache in the general and military population is rising, and further preclinical research is required to understand, ameliorate, and treat this disabling disorder.

AB  - Suicide behaviour rates vary significantly between countries due to a range of cultural, behavioural and health-related factors. Gender and age-related factors also appear to be impor tant key determinants of vulnerability to suicide ideation and suicide completion. The homeless population is par ticularly at risk, due to multiple complex issues that relate to social exclusion, alcohol, drug, mental health and nutritional issues. Studying homeless people is problematic due to access, the transitory nature of their contact with statutary services, problems of self-repor t and recall in people -some of whom have mental health and cognitive issues. There is an increasing interest from practitioners and academic researchers in spiritual factors that appear to modulate the responses of an individual to the internal and external threats that underlie the motivation to end his or her life. Effective approaches to suicide prevention and crisis management require a good understanding of the interplay between this complex set of biological, psychological and social domains. These will be explored in the final section of this review. This paper, therefore, aims to provide a non-systematic review of the existing literature published in academic journals and relvant 'grey literature' and focuses on themes in the literature that will hopefully inform both policy and practice.

AB  - Human anxiety and vestibular disorders have long been known to co-occur. Paralleling human clinical and non-clinical data, mounting genetic, pharmacological and behavioral evidence confirms that animal anxiety interplays and co-exists with vestibular/balance deficits. However, relatively few animal models have addressed the nature of this relationship. This paper examines side-by-side human psychiatric and otovestibular phenotypes with animal experimentation data, and outlines future directions of translational research in this field. Discussed here are recently developed specific animal models targeting this interplay, other traditional animal tests sensitive to altered anxiety and vestibular domains, and the existing problems with translation of animal data into human phenotypes. The role of hearing deficits and their contribution to anxiety and vestibular phenotypes are also outlined. Overall, the overlap between anxiety and balance disorders emerges as an important phenomenon in both animal and clinical studies, and may contribute markedly to the complexity of behavioral and physiological phenotypes. Animal experimental models that focus on the interplay between anxiety and vestibular disorders are needed to improve our understanding of this important biomedical problem.

AB  - The past several years have seen a virtual explosion of research in the area of religion, spirituality, coping, and health. Despite this inundation, most studies have remained at the descriptive level of analysis. It has only been within the past few years that more complex associations, pathways (i.e., mediation), and possible models concerning the influence of religion and/or spirituality on health have been investigated. One psychosocial model of adjustment that holds promise as a potential "scaffold" for the organization and understanding of these vast data on spirituality is the transactional model of stress and coping originally put forth by Lazarus and Folkman (1984). The present paper uses the basic tenets (e.g., dynamic process) and structural components (e.g., coping behaviour) of the transactional model as a framework for the integration of the growing empirical literature on spirituality, coping, and health. The resultant application of the model in a spiritual context was reviewed by four spiritual care workers and/or chaplains from different religious backgrounds. These multifaith chaplains critiqued the "fit" of this model in relation to their understanding of health and coping from their faith perspective and offered suggestions on modifications to the model that would create a better fit.

AB  - There is disagreement in the literature about the exact nature of the phenomenon of empathy. There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views, applying in varying degrees across species. An adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism can integrate these views. Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups. This view ban advance our evolutionary understanding of empathy beyond inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism and can explain different levels of empathy across individuals, species, stages of development, and situations.

AB  - This paper offers a 25-year scoping review of psychoanalytic journal articles on premature birth from 1997 to 2021. Given the prevalence of prematurity and its impact on infant development and parenting, this is an area which requires engagement and research. 28 papers were found in psychoanalytic journals. This review summarizes the extent, range and nature of this research, identifying trends in theorizing about premature infancy and gaps in the literature. The overall lack of articles on the topic of prematurity is highlighted and possible reasons for this are suggested. These include the practical challenges as well as the intensity of emotional pain inherent in working with prematurity. The findings highlight the trauma experienced by both premature infants and their parents. Prematurity may also place the parent-infant relationship at risk. The therapeutic imperative of interacting with the infant as a person is strongly emphasised. Research suggests working in the NICU is emotionally evocative. However, a case is made for the critical role that psychoanalytic practitioners can play in supporting those impacted by premature infancy. The need for exposure to this topic is highlighted. Gaps in the literature appear in relation to sibling experience, experiences of fathers of premature infants, and the intersubjective processes occurring between premature infants and their parents.

AB  - Purpose: A variety of neuropsychological symptoms, including executive dysfunction, are common consequences of a stroke. However, as demonstrated in literature reviews, there are still several unclear issues in this area. This article, therefore, provides description of specific components of executive dysfunction in stroke patients together with principles of their diagnosis.
   Views: Cerebral stroke is one of the most common causes of disability, with a devastating impact on the daily functioning of patients. Some of its common consequences are cognitive and behavioural disorders. Comorbid symptoms include premorbid personality changes and emotional disorders. A relatively new diagnostic category of post-stroke symptoms is the dysexecutive syndrome. It involves a variety of symptoms, such as ineffective performance, perseveration, rigidity of thought or impaired planning and predicting the consequences of one's actions. The dysexecutive syndrome is not a homogenous syndrome, and many researchers postulate its division into subunits, depending on the predominant symptoms.
   Conclusions: Executive dysfunction after stroke is an important clinical and social problem. Impaired performance of complex tasks or deficits within planning or reasoning have a marked effect on patients' social and professional functioning. The theoretical notion of dysexecutive syndrome may allow to better understand the scope and nature of patients' problems and implementation of more effective forms of neuropsychological rehabilitation.

This synergy highlights the importance of considering the way in which we approach the genotype-phenotype relationship. In particular, the nosologic divide of psychiatric illness, although clinically relevant, is not directly translatable in animal models. For instance, mice will never fully recapitulate the broad criteria for many psychiatric disorders; additionally, mice will never have guilty ruminations, suicidal thoughts, or rapid speech. Instead, animal models have been and continue to provide a means to explore dimensions of psychiatric disorders to identify neural circuits and mechanisms underlying disease-relevant phenotypes. The genetic investigation of psychiatric illness can yield the greatest insights if efforts continue to identify and use biologically valid phenotypes across species. This review discusses the progress to date and the future efforts that will enhance translation between human and animal studies, including the identification of intermediate phenotypes that can be studied across species and the importance of refined modeling of human disease-associated genetic variation in mice and other animal models.

AB  - Nuclear depletion, abnormal modification, and cytoplasmic aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are linked to a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases called TDP-43 proteinopathies, which include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Although our understanding of the physiological function of TDP-43 is rapidly advancing, the molecular mechanisms associated with its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are important players in TDP-43 pathology. However, while neurons derived from autopsied ALS and FTLD patients revealed TDP-43 deposits in the ER and displayed UPR activation, data originated from in vitro and in vivo TDP-43 models produced contradictory results. In this review, we will explore the complex interplay between TDP-43 pathology, ER stress, and the UPR by breaking down the evidence available in the literature and addressing the reasons behind these discrepancies. We also highlight underexplored areas and key unanswered questions in the field. A better synchronization and integration of methodologies, models, and mechanistic pathways will be crucial to discover the true nature of the TDP-43 and ER stress relationship and, ultimately, to uncover the full therapeutic potential of the UPR.

AB  - From the first days of life, children frequently encounter pain. Given the highly subjective nature of pain and the powerful modulating influence that one's cognitions, emotions, and behaviours can have on how pain is experienced, pain is a fascinating field for psychological inquiry. One particularly important aspect of pain phenomenology is memory for pain. Pain memory is a critical cognitive requirement for children to selfreport on their pain and invariably shapes how they cope with pain in the future. How individuals remember pain from childhood can set the stage for future pain and health behaviours well into adulthood, and may underlie the development of chronic pain. Importantly, pain memories are malleable, particularly in childhood, and can be harnessed in psychological interventions to reframe memories to be more accurate or positive to improve pain experiences. This article provides a narrative review of the literature on children's memory for pain to build upon previous reviews on this topic. In light of advances in neuroimaging techniques and research in pediatric pain, we summarise relevant literature on the neurobiology of pain memories to stimulate future interdisciplinary research in this area. Finally, additional directions for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: For children and adolescents, the adverse effects from antipsychotic medicines exaggerate the already considerable burden of having a serious mental illness. Many of these young people face a future not only limited by stigmatizing psychiatric illness but also a life restricted and shortened by physical ill-health, particularly cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. This review focuses on bridging the current gap between available evidence and practice guidelines and policies.
   Method: Following an extensive literature search, key papers focusing on the evidence of the nature and occurrence of metabolic morbidity in children and adolescents following the use of antipsychotic medication were included.
   Results: There is growing evidence to suggest that some of the key antecedents of metabolic syndrome occur soon after diagnosis and initiation of antipsychotic medication, and they accumulate over time.
   Conclusion: While guidelines and policies around the monitoring of metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents with mental illness receiving antipsychotic medication are limited, an opportunity lies in altering the trajectory towards cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes by early recognition and intervention to reduce cardiometabolic risk rather than waiting until disease end-points are reached later in life.

AB  - Most neurological diseases have a multifactorial nature and the number of molecular mechanisms discovered as underpinning these diseases is continuously evolving. The old concept of developing selective agents for a single target does not fit with the medical need of most neurological diseases. The development of designed multiple ligands holds great promises and appears as the next step in drug development for the treatment of these multifactorial diseases. Dopamine and its five receptor subtypes are intimately involved in numerous neurological disorders. Dopamine receptor ligands display a high degree of cross interactions with many other targets including G-protein coupled receptors, transporters, enzymes and ion channels. For brain disorders like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and depression the dopaminergic system, being intertwined with many other signaling systems, plays a key role in pathogenesis and therapy. The concept of designed multiple ligands and polypharmacology, which perfectly meets the therapeutic needs for these brain disorders, is herein discussed as a general ligand-based concept while focusing on dopaminergic agents and receptor subtypes in particular.

This topic sheds light upon understanding the role vulnerability plays in building authentic relationships. The article explores the concept in depth touching every nook and crannies of elements that impact relationships. There has been some work done in this field thus far and understanding those existing literature has guided towards the existing gaps which can be bridged with further research, manifesting novel perspectives. Much evaluation and assessment were conducted on myriad facets, viz. self-disclosure, conflict resolution, response effect, models/theories of self and relationships, spousal support, societal influence, and intimacy After selective mining and analyses of available data, it has been observed that there is a limited understanding of vulnerability as a whole concept, albeit being relevant in bits and pieces in its components. Nevertheless, it is observed that there is a dearth of detailed research in understanding the nature of vulnerability and interrelated concerns. As vulnerability creates an opportunity in creating emotional freedom and intimacy between couples, the article is followed by a concluding discussion highlighting its impact and effect on relationships.

AB  - Background: For health systems and maternity services to respond effectively to forced displacement, an understanding of the lived experiences of women seeking protection during childbearing is required. This study aim was to systematically review existing literature on the perinatal experiences of forced migrant women.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review including MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science and PsychINFO databases and manual search of references. Included studies were quality-assessed and analysed using inductive thematic synthesis.
   Findings: In total 39 studies were included, involving 624 forced migrant women in 12 countries. Three inductive themes were: (1) "The nature of being a forced migrant," describing multiple liminalities experienced by women; (2) support during the perinatal period, showing women's (re)negotiation of shifting kinship and support networks; and (3) interactions with maternity services, revealing variations in maternity care experiences.
   Conclusion: Findings highlight the systemic power structures forced migrant women must (re)negotiate during the perinatal period and the supportive and empowering role maternity services can play through provision of woman-centred care. Further research is needed to understand the lived perinatal experiences of forced migrant in low-income and transit country contexts.

AB  - With the steadily increasing number of publications in the field of stress research it has become evident that the conventional usage of the stress concept bears considerable problems. The use of the term 'stress' to conditions ranging from even the mildest challenging stimulation to severely aversive conditions, is in our view inappropriate. Review of the literature reveals that the physiological 'stress' response to appetitive, rewarding stimuli that are often not considered to be stressors can be as large as the response to negative stimuli. Analysis of the physiological response during exercise supports the view that the magnitude of the neuroendocrine response reflects the metabolic and physiological demands required for behavioural activity. We propose that the term 'stress' should be restricted to conditions where an environmental demand exceeds the natural regulatory capacity of an organism, in particular situations that include unpredictability and uncontrollability. Physiologically, stress seems to be characterized by either the absence of an anticipatory response (unpredictable) or a reduced recovery (uncontrollable) of the neuroendocrine reaction. The consequences of this restricted definition for stress research and the interpretation of results in terms of the adaptive and/or maladaptive nature of the response are discussed.

AB  - Uncertainty about future events may lead to worry, anxiety, even inability to function. The highly related concept-intolerance of uncertainty (IU)-emerged in the early 1990s, which is further developed into a transdiagnostic risk factor in multiple forms of anxiety disorders. Interests in uncertainty and intolerance of uncertainty have rapidly increased in recent years; little is known about the construct and phenomenology of uncertainty and IU and the association between them. In an attempt to reveal the nature of two concepts, we reviewed broad literature surrounding uncertainty and intolerance of uncertainty (IU). We followed the process in which the whole IU theory developed and extended, including two aspects: (1) from uncertainty to intolerance of uncertainty and (2) definition of uncertainty and intolerance of uncertainty, and further concluded uncertainty fuels to negative emotions, biased expectancy, and inflexible response. Secondly, this paper summarized the experimental research concerning uncertainty and IU, consisted of three parts: (1) uncertainty-based research, (2) measurements of IU, and (3) domain-specific IU. Lastly, we pointed out what remains unknown and needed to be investigated in future research. This result provides a comprehensive overview in this domain, enhancing our understanding of uncertainty and IU and contributing to further theoretical and empirical explorations.

AB  - Attachment has a fundamental role in the development of empathy, which helps people interact with others and prevents aggressive behaviors. It is believed that having a secure attachment can promote empathy. However, there is no clear evidence about the relationship between insecure attachment styles and empathy. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to clarify the relation between different types of attachment and empathy from late children to adults (9-47 years). It was conducted using 14 studies (11542 participants) for the secure attachment, 7 studies (3115 participants) for the avoidant, and 8 studies (3479 participants) for the anxious-ambivalent. Results indicated that secure attachment was positively correlated with em-pathy, avoidant attachment was negatively correlated, and anxious-ambivalent attachment had an inconclusive relationship. Whereas the results obtained for the secure and avoidant attachment with empathy are consistent with literature, the inconsistencies in anxious-ambivalent style may be due to a duality of feel-ings experienced by these individuals, who go from high levels of empathy (to be accepted) to low levels of empathy (to avoid distressing emotions). We suggest broadening the limit in age, include the multidirectional nature of empathy, as well as the effect of gender and different sorts of affiliations (parents, couples) for future studies.

AB  - The ability to imagine and simulate events that may happen in the future has been studied in several related but independent research areas (e.g., episodic future thinking, mind-wandering, prospective memory), with a newly emerging field of involuntary future thinking focusing primarily on the spontaneous occurrence of such thoughts. In this article, we review evidence from these diverse fields to address important questions about why do people think about the future, what are the typical and most frequent contents of such thoughts, and how do these thoughts occur (are they spontaneous or constructed deliberately). Results of the literature review provide support for the pragmatic theory of prospection, by showing that when people engage in prospective thought naturally, without being explicitly instructed to do so, they predominantly think about their upcoming tasks and planned activities instead of simulating plausible but novel hypothetical scenarios. Moreover, prospective thoughts are more often spontaneous than deliberate and effortful, and their occurrence seems to increase the likelihood of planned activities being completed in the future. The findings are discussed in the context of a new "pragmatic dual process account" of future thinking, and new avenues for future research on prospection are outlined.

AB  - Firefighters, along with other tactical personnel, are at a high risk of work-related physical injury above that of the private sector. The aim of this critical narrative review was to identify, critically appraise and synthesise key findings from recent literature investigating firefighting musculoskeletal injuries to inform injury reduction programs. The methodological approach (search terms, databases, etc.) was registered with PROSPERO and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Study quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist with scores graded according to the Kennelly grading system. Levels of evidence were ranked according to the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. Of the 8231 studies identified, 17 met the criteria for inclusion. The methodological quality of the studies was 'fair' with a level of evidence of III-2. Reported injury rates ranged from 9% to 74% with the lower extremities and back the leading aggregated bodily sites of injury. Sprains and strains were the leading nature of musculoskeletal injury, often caused by slips, trips and falls, although muscle bending, lifting and squatting or muscle stressing were also prevalent. This review may inform injury reduction strategies and given that injuries reported in firefighters are similar to those of other tactical populations, safety processes to mitigate injuries may be of benefit across the tactical spectrum.

   Adolescence is a period of dynamic change in both sleep and emotional systems, with related increases in problems controlling emotion and behavior. Youth with anxiety enter adolescence with pre-existing vulnerabilities in systems of sleep and emotion that may place them at heightened risk. This review summarizes recent research on sleep and anxiety during the transition to adolescence, and highlights emerging themes.
   Recent findings
   Prospective studies support that sleep predicts anxiety symptoms in early adolescence. Notably, robust evidence for subjective sleep problems in anxious youth is not well corroborated by objective assessments. Longitudinal designs and methodology that carefully examine dimensions of anxiety and sleep may clarify inconsistencies. Preliminary evidence suggests that late childhood to early adolescence may be a sensitive period for escalating problems with sleep and anxiety. Recent advances in the neuroscience of sleep can further refine integrative mechanistic models of developmental psychopathology - the role of sleep in emotional learning and memory is provided as an example.
   Summary
   Sleep problems are common and prospectively predict escalating anxiety symptoms. Precision is needed regarding the nature of sleep disruption, and how and when sleep affects various aspects of developmental trajectories. This precision, along with advances in the neuroscience of sleep, may lead to developmentally informed translational interventions.

AB  - (1) Introduction: Around a million people are reported to die by suicide every year, and due to the stigma associated with the nature of the death, this figure is usually assumed to be an underestimate. Machine learning and artificial intelligence such as natural language processing has the potential to become a major technique for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of people. (2) Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Global Health databases were searched for studies that reported use of NLP for suicide ideation or self-harm. (3) Result: The preliminary search of 5 databases generated 387 results. Removal of duplicates resulted in 158 potentially suitable studies. Twenty papers were finally included in this review. (4) Discussion: Studies show that combining structured and unstructured data in NLP data modelling yielded more accurate results than utilizing either alone. Additionally, to reduce suicides, people with mental problems must be continuously and passively monitored. (5) Conclusions: The use of AI&ML opens new avenues for considerably guiding risk prediction and advancing suicide prevention frameworks. The review's analysis of the included research revealed that the use of NLP may result in low-cost and effective alternatives to existing resource-intensive methods of suicide prevention.

AB  - Fatigue can be a significant problem for commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers. The lifestyle of a long-haul CMV driver may include long and irregular work hours, inconsistent sleep schedules, poor eating and exercise habits, and mental and physical stress, all contributors to fatigue. Shiftwork is associated with lacking, restricted, and poor-quality sleep and variations in circadian rhythms, all shown to negatively affect driving performance through impaired in judgment and coordination, longer reaction times, and cognitive impairment. Overweight and obesity may be as high as 90% in CMV drivers, and are associated with prevalent comorbidities, including obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. As cognitive and motor processing declines with fatigue, driver performance decreases, and the risk of errors, near crashes, and crashes increases. Tools and assessments to determine and quantify the nature, severity, and impact of fatigue and sleep disorders across a variety of environments and populations have been developed and should be critically examined before being employed with CMV drivers. Strategies to mitigate fatigue in CMV operations include addressing the numerous personal, health, and work factors contributing to fatigue and sleepiness. Further research is needed across these areas to better understand implications for roadway safety.

AB  - Day-to-day life is inundated with attempts to control emotions and a wealth of research has examined what strategies people use and how effective these strategies are. However, until more recently, research has often neglected more basic questions such as whether and how people choose to regulate their emotions (i.e. emotion regulation choice). In an effort to identify what we know and what we need to know, we systematically reviewed studies that examined potential determinants of whether and how people choose to regulate their emotions. Eighteen determinants were identified across 219 studies and were categorised as being affective, cognitive, motivational, individual or social-cultural in nature. Where there were sufficient primary studies, meta-analysis was used to quantify the size of the associations between potential determinants and measures of whether and how people choose to regulate their emotions. Based on the findings, we propose that people's decisions about whether and how to regulate their emotions are determined by factors relating to the individual doing the regulating, the emotion that is being regulated, and both the immediate situation and the broader social context in which the regulation is taking place.

AB  - It has been extensively studied in several mouse models how chronic, in particular chronic psychosocial, stressors facilitate the (re)activity of the innate immune system and, consequently, drive stress-associated pathologies. Here we first summarize the resulting concept and underlying mechanisms, proposing that social stress-induced bone marrow myelopoiesis, priming, emigration and activation of newly formed myeloid cells and accumulation of these cells in the spleen, gut, brain and fracture hematoma promote septic shock, colitis, anxiety and disturbed fracture healing, respectively. We further propose and discuss the hypothesis that it is not the social character of a particular stressor that promotes splenic invasion and subsequent full activation of stress-induced myeloid cells, but rather the occurrence of bite wounds as a result of direct physical interaction. Finally, we discuss the hypothesis that it is the combination of chronic stress, regardless of whether social or non-social in nature, and any kind of planned (i.e. surgery) or unplanned (i.e. bite wounds, injury) physical trauma that drives splenic invasion and subsequent full activation of stress-induced myeloid cells.

AB  - The level of violence in American society has become an important political and public health concern. Violence encompasses a wide range of behaviors that involve the exertion of physical or psychological force in order to injure or abuse. It is a complex behavior and, like all behaviors, it occurs in the context of culture. The causes of violence and the various ways in which it becomes manifest are influenced by the prevailing attitudes of society and society's perspective on the aims and legitimacy of particular forms of violence. The article addresses the various theories of aggression and violence, diagnostic issues related to victimization by violence, and therapeutic concerns in treating both victims and perpetrators of violence. Biologic, psychological, and sociocultural perspectives on violence may contribute to conceptual distinctions such as nonhostile aggression versus hostile destructiveness. Violence affects the same racial and cultural groups most likely to have limited access to medical care or who are more resistant to using mental health services. The therapeutic approach to these problems is influenced by the nature of the trauma and the wishes of the patient requiring the commitment and expertise of care providers. Those who act violently need clinicians willing to explore the meaning of the violent act and to respond with understanding rather than with a judgmental attitude.

AB  - Objectives: This review sought to determine what is currently known about the focus, form, and efficacy of web-based interventions that aim to support the well-being of workers and enable them to manage their work-related stress. Method: A scoping review of the literature as this relates to web-based interventions for the management of work-related stress and supporting the psychological well-being of workers was conducted. Results: Forty-eight web-based interventions were identified and reviewed, the majority of which (n = 37) were "individual"-focused and utilized cognitive-behavioral techniques, relaxation exercises, mindfulness, or cognitive behavior therapy. Most interventions identified were provided via a website (n = 34) and were atheoretical in nature. Conclusions: There is some low-to-moderate quality evidence that "individual "-focused interventions are effective for supporting employee well-being and managing their work-related stress. There are few web-based interventions that target "organizational" or "individual/organization" interface factors, and there is limited support for their efficacy. A clear gap appears to exist between work-stress theory and its application in the design and development of web-based interventions for the management of work-related stress.

AB  - It has been proposed that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with automatic information processing biases resulting in hypersensitivity to signals of social threat such as negative facial expressions. However, the nature and extent of automatic processes in SAD on the behavioral and neural level is not entirely clear yet. The present review summarizes neuroscientific findings on automatic processing of facial threat but also other disorder-related stimuli such as emotional prosody or negative words in SAD. We review initial evidence for automatic activation of the amygdala, insula, and sensory cortices as well as for automatic early electrophysiological components. However, findings vary depending on tasks, stimuli, and neuroscientific methods. Only few studies set out to examine automatic neural processes directly and systematic attempts are as yet lacking. We suggest that future studies should: (1) use different stimulus modalities, (2) examine different emotional expressions, (3) compare findings in SAD with other anxiety disorders, (4) use more sophisticated experimental designs to investigate features of automaticity systematically, and (5) combine different neuroscientific methods (such as functional neuroimaging and electrophysiology). Finally, the understanding of neural automatic processes could also provide hints for therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Objectives. Despite its proven efficacy and safety, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has a negative image and attracts widespread public criticism. In contrast, perceptions of patients who have received ECT appear to be more favourable. This review intended to encapsulate the evidence on knowledge and views concerning ECT among its recipients. Methods. Extensive electronic and manual searches were conducted to identify all relevant studies on the subject. Results. Seventy-five reports were found suitable. The evidence from these studies suggested that patients undergoing ECT were usually poorly informed about it. This was attributable to factors such as unsatisfactory pre-treatment explanations or post-ECT memory impairment. About one-third undergoing ECT reported feeling coerced to have the treatment. Fear of ECT and distressing side effects were also present in a majority. Despite these problems, a vast majority of patients perceived ECT to be helpful and had positive views regarding the treatment. Simultaneously, a sizeable proportion was quite critical, although little was known about the extent and nature of such disapproval. Conclusions. Overall, the weight of the evidence supports the notion that patients undergoing ECT are well-disposed towards it. However, much needs to be done to improve the practice of ECT and to enhance patients' satisfaction with the experience of treatment.

AB  - Parenting practices are among the strongest predictors of juvenile delinquency identified in the criminological literature and have been intimately connected to adult offending. The prior research connecting early parenting experiences with crime, however, has not systematically assessed the long-term effect of parenting style on adult criminal offending, or the processes linking the parenting and crime, by race. In this study, we explore the extent to which experiences associated with minority status influence the nature of the relationship between parenting style and adult criminal offending as well as the mediating processes of adult social bonds and emotional self-concepts involved. Using two waves of a contemporary longitudinal sample of youth, the results show that parenting styles lacking in demandingness show significant and positive effects on adult criminal offending among the Black sample, but parenting styles exert little long-term effects on criminal offending among the White sample. Furthermore, negative emotionality, namely anger, significantly mediates the relationship between uninvolved parenting and adult criminality among the Black and White samples, but depression is also a mediator for the Whites. In this sample, adult social bonds do not mediate the relationship between parenting during childhood and adult criminality.

AB  - A central phrase in the new "GeneTalk" is "X is a gene for Y," in which X is a particular gene on the human genome and Y is a complex human disorder or trait. This article begins by sketching the historical origins of this phrase and the concept of the gene-phenotype relationship that underlies it. Five criteria are then proposed to evaluate the appropriateness of the "X is a gene for Y" concept: 1) strength of association, 2) specificity of relationship, 3) noncontingency of effect, 4) causal proximity of X to Y, and 5) the degree to which X is the appropriate level of explanation for Y. Evidence from psychiatric genetics is then reviewed that address each of these criteria. The concept of " a gene for..." is best understood as deriving from preformationist developmental theory in which genes - like preformationist anlagen - "code for" traits in a simple, direct, and powerful way. However, the genetic contribution to psychiatric disorders fails to meet any of the five criteria for the concept of "X is a gene for Y." The impact of individual genes on risk for psychiatric illness is small, often nonspecific, and embedded in complex causal pathways. The phrase " a gene for..." and the preformationist concept of gene action that underlies it are inappropriate for psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving cognitive, motor, and psychiatrically -relevant symptoms resulting from repetitive head impacts. Psychiatric phenotypes of CTE, including depression and suicidality, present particular challenges for CTE research, given that the diagnosis requires postmortem neuropathological examination. The pathognomonic lesion of CTE is the perivascular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) protein at the depths of cortical sulci. These lesions are found in the earliest disease stages, and with advancing pathological severity, ptau deposition occurs in widespread brain regions in a four-stage scheme of severity. We review the psychiatric phenotypes of individuals neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE, and suggest that earlier CTE stages hold particular interest for psychiatric CTE research. In the early CTE stages, there is ptau pathology in frontal cortex and axonal loss in the frontal white matter, followed by progressive ptau neurofibrillary degeneration in the amygdala and hippocampus. Neuropathological changes in the frontal and medial temporal lobes may underlie psychiatric phenotypes. Additional insight into the association between CTE pathology and psychiatric sequelae may come from advancements in in vivo methods of CTE detection. Further epidemiological, clinical, and postmortem studies are needed to validate the nature of psychiatric sequelae in CTE.

AB  - Human neuro psychiatric conditions associated with abnormally exaggerated or misdirected fear (anxiety disorders and phobias) still represent a large unmet medical need because the biological mechanisms underlying these diseases are not well understood. Animal models have been proposed to facilitate this research. Here I review the literature with a focus on zebrafish, an upcoming laboratory organism in behavioral brain research. I argue that abnormal human fear responses are likely the result of the malfunction of neurobiological mechanisms (brain areas, circuits and/or molecular mechanisms) that originally evolved to support avoidance of predators or other harm in nature. I also argue that the understanding of the normal as well as pathological functioning of such mechanisms may be best achieved if one utilizes naturalistic experimental approaches. In case of laboratory model organisms, this may entail presenting stimuli associated with predators and measuring species-specific antipredatory responses. Although zebrafish is a relatively new subject of such inquiry, I review the recently rapidly increasing number of zebrafish studies in this area, and conclude that zebrafish is a promising research tool for the analysis of the neurobiology and genetics of vertebrate fear responses.

AB  - Individuals with psychosis are often feared. In fact, they are themselves likely to be victims of violence; however, the main aim of this review is to provide an overview of the evidence on relations between psychosis and violence to others. The terms psychosis and violence were used in a literature search limited to the Cochrane Library and PubMed, a manual search of 8 journals, and a follow-up of additional references in the articles found. The overview draws on new empirical data and major reviews. Almost all Sound epidemiologic data on psychosis and violence dates from 1990. There is consistency on a small but significant relation between schizophrenia and violent acts. Since then there has also been movement toward understanding the nature of associations and progress on strategies for managing individuals who have psychosis and are violent. Public fears about individuals with psychotic illnesses are largely unfounded, although there Would be benefit in greater attention to the safety of those in their close social circle. The task for the next 10 years must be the development and application of knowledge to improve specific treatments-that is, interventions that go beyond holding and caring to bring about substantial change.

AB  - Nowadays, the accumulation of toxic heavy metals in soil and water streams is considered a serious environmental problem that causes various harmful effects on plants and animals. Phytoremediation is an effective, green, and economical bioremediation approach by which the harmful heavy metals in the contaminated ecosystem can be detoxified and accumulated in the plant. Hyperaccumulators exude molecules called transporters that carry and translocate the heavy metals present in the soil to different plant parts. The hyper accumulator plant genes can confine higher concentrations of toxic heavy metals in their tissues. The efficiency of phytoremediation relies on various parameters such as soil properties (pH and soil type), organic matters in soil, heavy metal type, nature of rhizosphere, characteristics of rhizosphere microflora, etc. The present review comprehensively discusses the toxicity effect of heavy metals on the environment and different phytoremediation mechanisms for the transport and accumulation of heavy metals from polluted soil. This review gave comprehensive insights into plants tolerance for the higher heavy metal concentration their responses for heavy metal accumulation and the different mechanisms involved for heavy metal tolerance. The current status and the characteristic features that need to be improved in the phytoremediation process are also reviewed in detail.

AB  - Teachers are facing various job demands with psychosocial aspects being fundamental due to the nature of the occupation. Although teachers' work is associated with different psychosocial health risks, little is known on how to identify and tackle those.
   Thus, a systematic literature search as per the PRISMA statement was conducted via MEDLINE (PubMed), PSYNDEX (PubPsych), and ScienceDirect. Two reviewers independently screened 2261 titles and abstracts and 169 full-texts. According to the inclusion criteria established a priori, articles from peer-reviewed journals (English or German) on psychosocial risk management in teachers were incorporated.
   Despite a comprehensive and sensitive search, only four publications could be identified, outlining a process to implement risk management and different assessment tools. Taken together, data presented in the articles were scarce.
   Recommendations for process steps and the assessment of psychosocial risks can be derived from the findings. To implement effective psychosocial risk management in the teaching profession, further research is needed, though. Effective and practicable approaches, which are accepted by the target group, should be further developed and investigated. Relevant causes of occupational strain in the teaching profession must be identified and assessed reliably. Low-threshold interventions should be implemented, and the outcome must be evaluated afterward. (C) 2020 Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB  - Spatial skills are an important component of success in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. A majority of what we know about spatial skills today is a result of more than 100 years of research focused on understanding and identifying the kinds of skills that make up this skill set. Over the last two decades, the field has recognized that, unlike the spatial skills measured by psychometric tests developed by psychology researchers, the spatial problems faced by STEM experts vary widely and are multifaceted. Thus, many psychological researchers have embraced an interdisciplinary approach to studying spatial thinking with the aim of understanding the nature of this skill set as it occurs within STEM disciplines. In a parallel effort, discipline-based education researchers specializing in STEM domains have focused much of their research on understanding how to bolster students' skills in completing domain-specific spatial tasks. In this paper, we discuss four lessons learned from these two programs of research to enhance the field's understanding of spatial thinking in STEM domains. We demonstrate each contribution by aligning findings from research on three distinct STEM disciplines: structural geology, surgery, and organic chemistry. Lastly, we discuss the potential implications of these contributions to STEM education.

AB  - Patients with gastroparesis often present a challenge to the treating physician. Postprandial symptoms with nausea and vomiting may not only lead to nutritional and metabolic consequences, but also cause significant disruptions to social activities that often center around food. While the definition of gastroparesis focuses on impaired gastric emptying, treatment options that affect gastric function are limited and often disappointing. The female predominance, the mostly idiopathic nature of the illness with a common history of abuse, and coexisting anxiety or depression show parallels with other functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. These parallels provided the rationale for some initial studies investigating alternative therapies that target the brain rather than the stomach.. is emerging shift in medical therapy comes at a time when clinical studies suggest that gastric electrical stimulation may exert its effects by modulating visceral sensory processing rather than altering gastric motility. Physiologic and detailed anatomic investigations also support a more complex picture with different disease mechanisms, ranging from impaired accommodation to apparent visceral hypersensitivity or decreased interstitial cells of Cajal to inflammatory infiltration of myenteric ganglia. Delayed gastric emptying remains the endophenotype defining gastroparesis. However, our treatment options go beyond prokinetics and may allow us to improve the quality of life of affected individuals.

From a total of 2,308 articles, data were extracted from 537 publications from 35 countries on all three health domains.ResultsThe combined stressors brought forth by the pandemic have exerted a heavy burden on the mental health of mothers and the development of young children, partly mediated by its impact on parental practices.ConclusionsDespite remaining gaps, we have identified sufficient evidence pointing to an urgent need for more concerted global research efforts and rapid policy responses to timely address severe and pervasive negative impacts to the mental health of mothers and children at a key developmental stage.

AB  - ObjectivePregnant and postpartum women are vulnerable to psychological problems with a high estimated prevalence. To date, there is no meta-analysis that specifically assesses the effectiveness of art-based interventions to improve mental health in pregnant and postpartum women. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of art-based interventions when delivered to pregnant and postpartum women. MethodsSystematic literature searches were conducted from the inception to 6 March 2022 in seven English databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register, CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting art-based interventions targeting the improvement of women's mental health in pregnancy and postpartum were included. Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied to assess evidence quality. ResultsTwenty-one randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2,815 participants were eligible for data analysis. A pooled analysis demonstrated that art-based interventions significantly reduced anxiety (SMD = -0.75, 95% CI = -1.10 to -0.40) and depression symptoms (MD = -0.79, 95% CI = -1.30 to -0.28). However, art-based interventions did not alleviate stress symptoms as expected in our findings. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that intervention implementation time, intervention duration and music selected by the participants vs. not could have influence on the efficacy of art-based intervention for anxiety. ConclusionIn perinatal mental health, art-based interventions may be effective in alleviating anxiety and depression. In the future, we still need to conduct high-quality RCTs to validate our findings and enrich clinical application of art-based interventions.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence suggests that community-based interventions may be effective for anxiety and depression. This study aimed to describe studies of community interventions delivered to adults and/or young people, either in person or online, evaluated in randomised controlled trials and provide an indication as to their effectiveness, acceptability, quality of data and where possible, mechanisms of action. We included interventions delivered at and/or by museums, art galleries, libraries, gardens, music groups/choirs and sports clubs. Method: We developed and followed a preregistered protocol: PROSPERO CRD42020204471. Randomised controlled trials in adults and young people were identified in an extensive search with no date/time, language, document type and publication status limitations. Studies were selected according to predetermined eligibility criteria and data independently extracted and then assessed using Risk of Bias 1. The studies were deemed too heterogeneous for meta-analysis and were therefore reported using a narrative synthesis. Results: Our analysis included 31 studies, with 2898 participants. Community interventions most studied in randomised controlled trials were community music (12 studies, 1432 participants), community exercise (14 studies, 955 participants) and community gardens/gardening (6 studies, 335 participants). The majority of studies were from high-income countries - many were in specific populations (such as those with physical health problems) and were generally of low quality. Dropout rates across the included studies were low (1 participant on average per 100 participants). The inadequate description of interventions limited identification of potential mechanisms of action. Discussion: The uncertainty of the evidence allows only a weak recommendation in support of community interventions for anxiety and depression. The results suggest community engagement is a promising area for wide-reaching interventions to be implemented and evaluated, but more high-quality trials are needed, especially in young people and under-represented communities.

AB  - Being a family carer is associated with increased risk of experiencing depressive symptoms. Despite many decades of research investigating the association between coping strategies and depressive symptoms in carers results across studies remain contradictory. The objective of this study was to systematically review evidence on the association between depressive symptoms and coping strategies in carers of dependent people aged 18 and over and investigate potential sources of heterogeneity of findings. The study design was a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Pubmed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LILACS up to April 2021. We performed meta-analyses following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and several subgroup analyses to investigate whether cause of caring dependency, study design, and controlling for several biases influenced results. Fifty-nine studies met our inclusion criteria. We found a robust and statistically significant association between greater use of dysfunctional coping and higher depressive symptoms. Greater use of emotion-focussed coping was associated with fewer depressive symptoms only in studies controlling for confounding bias. Use of problem-focussed coping was related to fewer depressive symptoms in carers of frail older people. The combined use of both problem-focussed and emotion-focussed coping was associated with lower symptoms of depression. Our review concludes that the broad domain of dysfunctional coping is consistently associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms in carers. After controlling for confounders, emotion-focussed coping and several of its individual strategies were consistently associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Whilst problem-focussed coping and some of its individual strategies are also associated with lower depressive symptoms, these strategies may not be as helpful in all caregiving groups.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder of unknown pathological origin that is associated with psychological distress and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We investigated the effects of stress-management for adults with IBS on typical symptoms, HRQoL and mental health. With predefined criteria (patients: adults with IBS; intervention: stress-management; control: care as usual or waitlist; outcome: patient-relevant; study-type: controlled trials), we registered the study with PROSPERO (168030) and searched the main medical databases. Two researchers independently reviewed the publications and assessed the risk of bias using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklist. We performed meta-analysis with homogeneous trials of acceptable quality. After screening 6656 publications, ten suitable randomized trials of acceptable (n = 5) or low methodological quality (n = 5) involving 587 patients were identified. Our meta-analysis showed no effect of stress-management on IBS severity 1-2 months after the intervention (Hedges' g = -0.23, 95%-CI = -0.84 to -0.38, I-2 = 86.1%), and after 3-12 months (Hedges' g = -0.77, 95%-CI = -1.77 to -0.23, I-2 = 93.3%). One trial found a short-term reduction of symptoms, and one trial found symptom relief in the long-term (at 6 months). One of two studies that examined HRQoL found an improvement (after 2 months). One of two studies that examined depression and anxiety found a reduction of these symptoms (after 3 weeks). Stress-management may be beneficial for patients with IBS regarding the short-term reduction of bowel and mental health symptoms, whereas long-term benefits are unclear. Good quality RCTs with more than 6 months follow-up are needed.

AB  - BackgroundQuality of care and access to effective interventions have been widely criticised as limited for people diagnosed with 'personality disorder' or who have comparable needs (described in some recent papers as "Complex Emotional Needs" (CEN). It is important to identify effective interventions and the optimal context and mode of delivery for people with CEN. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions delivered in community and outpatient settings in treating symptoms associated with 'personality disorder', and the moderating effects of treatment-related variables.MethodsWe systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, HMIC, ASSIA for articles published in English, from inception to November 23, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials examining interventions provided in community or outpatient settings for CEN. The primary outcome was 'personality disorder' symptoms, while secondary outcomes included anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and global psychiatric symptoms. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted for each outcome, and meta-regression analysis was performed to assess the moderating effects of treatment characteristics. The quality of the studies and the degree of publication bias was assessed.ResultsWe included 54 trials (n = 3716 participants) in the meta-analysis. We found a large effect size (g = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.56 to 1.01, p < 0.0001) favoring interventions for 'borderline personality disorder' (BPD) symptoms over Treatment as Usual or Waitlist (TAU/WL), and the efficacy was maintained at follow-up (g = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.37 to 1.65, p = 0.002). Interventions effectively reduced anxiety symptoms (g = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.95, p = 0.002), depressive symptoms (g = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.83, p < 0.0001), and global psychiatric symptoms (g = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.66, p < 0.0001) compared to TAU/WL. The intervention types were equally effective in treating all symptom categories assessed. Treatment duration and treatment intensity did not moderate the effectiveness of the interventions for any outcome.ConclusionsPeople with a 'personality disorder' diagnosis benefited from psychological and psychosocial interventions delivered in community or outpatient settings, with all therapeutic approaches showing similar effectiveness. Mental health services should provide people with CEN with specialised treatments in accordance with the availability and the patients' preferences.

AB  - Objective: Psychological factors (e.g., depression, anxiety) are known to contribute to the development and maintenance of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Less is known, however, about the role of positive psychological well-being (PPWB) in IBS. Accordingly, we completed a systematic review of the literature examining relationships between PPWB and clinical characteristics in IBS. Method: A systematic review using search terms related to PPWB and IBS from inception through July 28, 2022, was completed. Quality was assessed with the NIH Quality Assessment Tool. A narrative synthesis of findings, rather than meta-analysis, was completed due to study heterogeneity.Results: 22 articles with a total of 4285 participants with IBS met inclusion criteria. Individuals with IBS had lower levels of PPWB (e.g., resilience, positive affect, self-efficacy, emotion regulation) compared to healthy populations, which in turn was associated with reduced physical and mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Limited exploration of potential biological mechanisms underlying these relationships has been described. Conclusions: PPWB is diminished in individuals with IBS compared to other populations, and greater PPWB is linked to superior physical, psychological, and HRQoL outcomes. Interventions to increase PPWB may have the potential to improve IBS-related outcomes. Registration: Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42022304767.

AB  - BackgroundClimate change represents a serious threat to human health, including mental health, due to both the traumatizing effects of extreme climate events and the psychological effect of worry about climate change. Objectives: This scoping review aims to search the literature for original research investigating mental health and climate-related negative emotions in young people. Findings will help to understand the current landscape, gaps in the literature, and provide recommendations for future youth mental health research and practice. MethodsA scoping review of the literature examining negative emotions associated with climate change in young people was undertaken. Studies published prior to March 2022 were included if they examined mental ill-health (e.g., symptoms of depression or anxiety) or negative emotions (e.g., distress, worry, concern) associated with the threat of climate change. ResultsOf 3939 articles screened, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Together, studies show that young people are worried about climate change. Negative emotions about climate change were correlated with symptoms of mental ill-health. Studies also explored coping strategies young people use to manage their distress caused by climate change. DiscussionThe limited literature in this area indicates a key gap in youth mental health research. While available evidence suggests that young people are concerned about climate change, more research is needed on the relationship between climate-related negative emotions and mental ill-health. Clinicians should assess for and address climate-related negative emotions in young people. Mental health leaders are urged to advocate for actions to mitigate the mental health impact of climate change.

KW  - PREGNANCY
AB  - The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic has led to several mandatory prevention regulations, changes in healthcare services, unprecedented unemployment rates, financial stress, and emotional worries. Given the increasing cases of COVID-19, coupled with the drastic physical and psychological changes within postpartum mothers during the postpartum period, this paper aims to present an overview of the postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The postpartum period is characterized by drastic physical changes and substantial demands on parental role adjustment, and it places enormous stress on the mothers and makes them vulnerable to mental health problems. A literature search was conducted in four electronic databases (ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, and SAGE) with different combinations of keywords were used. As the result, 25 articles that involved 10,515 postpartum women from 14 countries were extracted. Results have recorded PPD prevalence ranged from 6.4% to 56.9% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited social support, social isolation, fear of COVID-19 exposure, or infection for themselves, newborns, have worsening PPD symptoms among postpartum women. In brief, early detection, appropriate and timely intervention is needed to prevent and identify PPD among postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background Implementation of interventions to treat child and adolescent mental health problems in schools could help fill the mental health care gap in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Most of the evidence available come from systematic reviews on mental health prevention and promotion, and there is less evidence on treatment strategies that can be effectively delivered in schools. The aim of this review was to identify what school-based interventions have been tested to treat children and adolescents in LMICs, and how effective they are.Methods We conducted a systematic review including seven electronic databases. The search was carried out in October 2022. We included randomised or non-randomised studies that evaluated school-based interventions for children or adolescents aged 6-18 years living in LMICs and who had, or were at risk of developing, one or more mental health problems.Results We found 39 studies with 43 different pairwise comparisons, treatment for attention-deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD), anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Conduct disorder (CD). Pooled SMD were statistically significant and showed that, overall, interventions were superior to comparators for PTSD (SMD = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.37-0.86), not statistically significant for anxiety (SMD = 0.11; 95% CI = -0.13 to 0.36), ADHD (SMD = 0.36; 95% CI = -0.15 to 0.87), and for depression (SMD = 0.80; 95% CI = -0.47 to 2.07). For CD the sample size was very small, so the results are imprecise.Conclusion A significant effect was found if we add up all interventions compared to control, suggesting that, overall, interventions delivered in the school environment are effective in reducing mental health problems among children and adolescents.

The review focused on peer-reviewed academic literature published from March 2020 to November 2021.Results: One hundred sixty-seven articles were included in the review. Most publications came from lower-middle-income countries such as Iran, Pakistan, and Egypt. Most of the literature was specific to Stress/Distress (n = 94), followed by anxiety (n = 93), depression (n = 66), burnout (n = 27), insomnia (n = 20), and fear/phobia (n = 12).Conclusion: Fear, phobia, and insomnia have all been examined extensively worldwide, yet they were among the Eastern Mediterranean region's least explored outcomes. In addition, most underdeveloped countries have a low rate of publication.

AB  - Survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) are at risk for serious health consequences, and providing effective psychosocial interventions to support these individuals is a major global health challenge. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this field do not allow for clear conclusions about the efficacy of these interventions, owing to a narrow focus on specific subpopulations or intervention formats. This protocol presents a systematic review and meta-analysis, which will provide a comprehensive overview of the empirical evidence of various psychosocial interventions for survivors of IPV and investigate their efficacy in improving safety-related, mental health and psychosocial outcomes both overall and within homogeneous subgroups (trial registration: https://osf.io/4gp95). We will systematically search the literature databases PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL. Randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in increasing the safety or mental health of IPV survivors compared with a control group will be eligible. We will extract relevant data from eligible studies and assess study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. We will qualitatively summarise the results and we will calculate weighted effect sizes under random effect model assumption for the primary outcomes IPV, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. We will perform subgroup analyses to investigate the moderating effects of theoretical basis, delivery mode, intensity and setting of psychosocial interventions. The resultant overview of the current body of evidence for psychosocial interventions for IPV survivors is intended to inform future research and practice.

AB  - Mental health disorders during the post-partum period are a common morbidity, but parental leave might help alleviate symptoms by preventing or reducing stress. We aim to summarise available evidence on the effect of different types of parental leave on mental health outcomes among parents. For this systematic review, we searched Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus from database inception to Aug 29, 2022, for peer-reviewed, quantitative studies written in English. We included studies if the exposure was postnatal parental leave; a relevant comparison group was present (eg, paid vs unpaid leave); and if indicators related to general mental health, including depression, anxiety, stress, and suicide, for either parent were evaluated or recorded at any time after childbirth. The Review is registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021227499). Of the 3441 records screened, 45 studies were narratively synthesised. Studies were done in high-income countries, and they examined generosity by any parental leave (n=5), benefit amount (n=13), and leave duration (n=31). 38 studies were of medium or high quality. Improved mental health was generally observed among women (referred to as mothers in this Review) with more generous parental leave policies (ie, leave duration and paid vs unpaid leave). For example, increased duration of leave was generally associated with reduced risk of poor maternal mental health, including depressive symptoms, psychological distress and burnout, and lower mental health-care uptake. However, the association between fathers' leave and paternal mental health outcomes was less conclusive as was the indirect effect of parental leave use on partners' mental health.

AB  - Background: Refugees and asylum seekers often experience traumatic events resulting in a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Undiagnosed PTSD can have detrimental effects on resettlement outcomes. Immigration medical exams provide an opportunity to screen for mental health conditions in refugee and asylum seeker populations and provide links to timely mental health care.Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools for PTSD in refugee and asylum seeker populations.Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and CINAHL up to 29 September 2022. We included cohort-selection or cross-sectional study designs that assessed PTSD screening tools in refugee or asylum seeker populations of all ages. All reference standards were eligible for inclusion, with a clinical interview considered the gold standard. We selected studies and extracted diagnostic test accuracy data in duplicate. Risk of bias and applicability concerns were addressed using QUADAS-2. We meta-analyzed findings using a bivariate random-effects model. We partnered with a patient representative and a clinical psychiatrist to inform review development and conduct.Results: Our review includes 28 studies (4,373 participants) capturing 16 different screening tools. Nine of the 16 tools were developed specifically for refugee populations. Most studies assessed PTSD in adult populations, but three included studies focused on detecting PTSD in children. Nine studies looked at the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) with diagnostic cut-off points ranging from 1.17 to 2.5. Meta-analyses revealed a summary point sensitivity of 86.6% (95%CI 0.791; 0.917) and specificity of 78.9% (95%CI 0.639; 0.888) for these studies. After evaluation, we found it appropriate to pool other screening tools (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, the Impact of Event Scale, and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale) with the HTQ. The area under the curve for this model was 79.4%, with a pooled sensitivity of 86.2% (95%CI 0.759; 0.925) and a specificity of 72.2% (95% CI 0.616; 0.808).Conclusions: Our review identified several screening tools that perform well among refugees and asylum seekers, but no single tool was identified as being superior. The Refugee Health Screener holds promise as a practical instrument for use in immigration medical examinations because it supports the identification of PTSD, depression, and anxiety across diverse populations. Future research should consider tool characteristics beyond sensitivity and specificity to facilitate implementation in immigration medical exams.Registration: Open Science Framework: 10.17605/OSF.IO/PHNJV

AB  - IntroductionDespite the emerging body of literature on mother-to-infant bonding and the associated variables, there are various definitions of bonding construct. Also, there is a lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework of antecedents and consequences of bonding that would guide empirical work.ObjectiveAim of the study was to provide a systematic review and synthesis of concept analysis studies on maternal-foetal, mother-infant, or father-infant bonding.MethodA systematic search was performed in PubMed, EBSCOHost (including PsycINFO), ProQuest, and CINAHL. In addition, a hand search was conducted. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they conducted concept analyses on mother or father to foetus/infant bonding. A qualitative meta-synthesis was applied to synthesise the findings.ResultsEight papers on concept analyses were eligible for inclusion. In meta-synthesis, six aspects of parent-to-(unborn) child bonding emerged, including direction, domain, process, timing, endurance, and parental gender. Defining attributes are (i) a close relationship, (ii) filled with positive parental affection, (iii) manifested during pregnancy as monitoring foetal development and behaviour and after childbirth in proximity and interaction. Antecedents, affecting factors, and consequences of the parent-child bonding have been summarised.ConclusionParent-infant bonding refers to an emotional, behavioural, cognitive, and neurobiological tie of the parent to the (unborn) child, as a process from intention to have a child throughout infancy. This is a parental-driven process which can continue to evolve throughout child's and parent's life, characterised as enduring, committed, and engaged. Based on meta-synthesis, a conceptual structure of parent-infant bonding has been provided, which needs further empirical testing.

AB  - An overview of systematic reviews with meta-analysis was developed to summarize evidence on the effectiveness of prenatal yoga-based interventions on pain, psychological symptoms, and quality of life during pregnancy. CINAHL (via EBSCOhost), Embase, PubMed, SPORTDiscus (via EBSCOhost), and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 15 December 2022. The intervention of interest was any prenatal yoga-based intervention. Pain, psychological symptoms, and quality of life were considered as outcome measures. The methodological quality of systematic reviews was judged using AMSTAR 2. The primary study overlap among systematic reviews was evaluated, building a citation matrix and calculating the corrected covered area (CCA). A total of ten systematic reviews, including fifteen meta-analyses of interest and comprising 32 distinct primary clinical trials, were included. Meta-analyses on pain and quality of life were not found. Most meta-analyses (93%) showed that prenatal yoga-based interventions are more effective than control interventions in reducing anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. However, the overall methodological quality of systematic reviews was judged as critically low, and primary study overlap among systematic reviews was very high (CCA = 16%). Altogether, prenatal yoga-based interventions could improve the mental health of pregnant women, although due to the important methodological flaws that were detected, future systematic reviews should improve their methodological quality before drawing firm conclusions on this topic.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had imposed considerable risk on public health, and had generated unprecedented levels of panic. There are increasing concerns over the possible negative impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children/adolescents. This review was conducted to describe the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adolescents. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and the WHO Global Health database on COVID-19. The 2020 updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline and an adapted Joanna Briggs aetiology review methodology were followed in conducting this review. A total of 21 studies from 8 different countries located on 4 continents (Asia, Europe, North America & South America), reporting on sample size of 56,368 met the inclusion criteria. Using the JBI critical appraisal tool for studies reporting on prevalence data, the quality of most of the studies was assessed to be moderate. Prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was estimated to range from 7.2% to 78%; of anxiety, from 15% to 78%, depression, from 7.2% to 43.7% and stress, at 17.3%. Correlates for COVID -19 related mental health outcomes were identified as female gender and social isolation among others. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of children and adolescents. It is recommended that governments and health agencies prioritize mental health, especially for children and adolescents to prevent long-term effects on them.

AB  - Objective Emergency service workers (i.e., police, fire, ambulance, rescue personnel) are exposed to stressful events that can adversely impact their mental health and well-being. This systematic review investigated (1) what well-being initiatives and interventions have been implemented with Australian and New Zealand emergency service workers, (2) how they have been evaluated, and (3) whether they were effective. Methods A systematic literature search identified 19 peer-reviewed studies eligible for inclusion. Results Eleven studies examined secondary interventions, seven examined primary interventions and only one study examined a tertiary intervention. Most studies measured mental health outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety). However, some studies used evaluation measures that were not directly related to mental health or well-being (e.g., satisfaction, changes to attitudes). Interventions including physical activity, manager mental health training, social support, psychological debriefing, mindfulness, and an ambulance chaplaincy initiative were found to lead to improvements in mental health and well-being in Australian and New Zealand emergency service workers. Only two ongoing and self-sustaining mental health initiatives were reported. Conclusions Further research is required into primary interventions and organisational-level initiatives to enable a preventative approach to mitigate daily stress and enhance the mental and physical well-being of emergency workers.

Quality of included studies was assessed using Downs and Black checklist. The quality of evidence supporting the associations of lifestyle and mood with long-term cortisol levels was assessed as being of moderate-to-poor quality. Observational studies (n = 25) indicated positive associations for BMI/body weight (ESr, pooled effect size correlation = 0.15, p<.001), physical activity (ESr=0.16, p<.001), perceived stress (ESr=0.114, p = .02), and depression (ESr = 0.133, p = .02), but not stressors (ESr = 0.06, p = .29), anxiety (ESr = 0.08, p = .14), or specific features of stress (ESr = 0.25, p = .10). There was insufficient evidence to reliably estimate associations between long-term cortisol levels and sleep, smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption, and PTSD. Findings from interventional studies (n = 27) were mixed and did not always support the relationships found in observational studies. The findings of this review were limited by the quality of the evidence. Current evidence for associations between mood and lifestyle factors with long-term levels of cortisol is mixed. For many factors, there was considerable uncertainty regarding the size of association with long-term cortisol due to a paucity of evidence. Future research should aim to (1) follow more consistent sampling protocols between studies and (2) clearly describe the hypothesised mechanisms through which interventions would affect cortisol levels.

AB  - Introduction It is well known that the intestinal bacteria substantially affect physiological processes in many body organs. Especially, through a bidirectional communication called as gut-microbiota-brain axis, the gut microbiota deeply influences development and function of the nervous system. Hippocampus, as a part of medial temporal lobe, is known to be involved in cognition, emotion, and anxiety. Growing evidence indicates that the hippocampus is a target of the gut microbiota. We used a broad search linking the hippocampus with the gut microbiota and probiotics.Methods All experimental studies and clinical trials published until end of 2021 were reviewed. Influence of the gut microbiota on the behavioral, electrophysiological, biochemical and histological aspects of the hippocampus were evaluated in this review.Results The effect of disrupted gut microbiota and probiotic supplements on the microbiota-hippocampus link is also considered. Studies show that a healthy gut microbiota is necessary for normal hippocampus dependent learning and memory and synaptic plasticity. The known current mechanisms are production and modulation of neurotrophins, neurotransmitters and receptors, regulation of intracellular molecular processes, normalizing the inflammatory/anti-inflammatory and oxidative/antioxidant factors, and histological stability of the hippocampus. Activity of the hippocampal neuronal circuits as well as behavioral functions of the hippocampus positively respond to different mixtures of probiotic bacteria.Discussion Growing evidence from animal researches indicate a close association between the hippocampus with the gut microbiota and probiotic bacteria as well. However, human studies and clinical trials verifying such a link are scant. Since the most of papers on this topic have been published over the past 3 years, intensive future research awaits.

AB  - IntroductionIrritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia share similar pathophysiologic mechanisms including sensitization of peripheral and central pain pathways, autonomic dysfunction and are often co-diagnosed. Co-diagnosed patients experience increased symptom severity, mental health comorbidities, and decreased quality of life. The role of mind-body interventions, which have significant effects on central pain syndromes and autonomic dysregulation, have not been well-described in co-diagnosed patients. The aim of this state-of-the art narrative review is to explore the relationship between irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia, and to evaluate the current evidence and mechanism of action of mind-body therapies in these two conditions. MethodsThe PubMed database was searched without date restrictions for articles published in English using the following keywords: fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, mind-body interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness based stress reduction, and yoga. ResultsMind-body interventions resulted in improved patient-reported outcomes, and are effective for irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia individually. Specifically, cognitive behavioral therapy and yoga trials showed decreased symptom severity, improved mental health, sleep and quality of life for both conditions individually, while yoga trials demonstrated similar benefits with improvements in both physical outcomes (gastrointestinal symptoms, pain/tenderness scores, insomnia, and physical functioning), mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety, and catastrophizing), and quality of life, possibly due to alterations in autonomic activity. ConclusionMind-body interventions especially CBT and yoga improve patient-reported outcomes in both irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia individually. However, limited available data in co-diagnosed patients warrant high quality trials to better tailor programs to patient needs.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted people's lives, neurobiological health, and general well-being throughout the world. South Asian countries have experienced high frequencies of psychiatric concerns that have worsened during the pandemic. This review aimed to determine the aggregated prevalence of common mental health problems (e.g., depression, fear, anxiety, stress, insomnia, and suicidal tendencies) and their associated factors among community populations in South Asian countries. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was undertaken using multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Global Health, Google Scholar and ResearchGate to retrieve articles. Overall, 22 articles were included. The prevalence of concerns ranged widely with respect to estimates of symptoms of depression (10.2-85.9%), fear (38.5-88.8%), anxiety (8.1-62.5%), stress (10.56-91.77%), and insomnia (13.32-53.45%). In addition, the prevalence of suicidal ideation was estimated to range between 5% and 8%. Factors associated with mental health concerns included socio-demographic, behavioral and health-related measures, and COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors. The findings suggest poor mental health among general populations in South Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, identifying individuals with mental health concerns and implementing interventions including mental health counseling appear warranted among these populations.

AB  - Background: Mobile phone addiction brings many adverse effects to teenagers, such as physical health problems, emotional problems, and academic failure, and studies have found that social support is an important influencing factor. Therefore, considering institutional, cultural and economic differences, we aimed to investigate the association between mobile phone addiction and social support among mainland Chinese teenagers, and explored the moderators affecting the relation. Methods: Based on the PRISMA method, a meta-analysis was applied to quantitatively synthesize relevant findings to obtain reliable estimates of effect sizes and conduct moderator analyses. Results: In total, 92 studies involving 59,716 participants and 92 effect sizes were identified by a systematic literature search. A significant low degree of negative correlation was found between mobile phone addiction and social support (r = -0.174, 95%CI = -0.213 to -0.134, p < 0.001, I-2 = 96.1%). Moreover, the present meta-analysis observed significant moderating effects of participants' gender, and region on the association between social support and mobile phone addiction. Conclusion: This study suggests that the mobile phone addiction level of teenagers could be reduced by increasing social support, and actions to improve their social support levels should be proposed based on their gender and regional differences.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this work was to review evidence on the association between psychological rumination and distress in those diagnosed with cancer.Methods: Six databases were searched for studies exploring rumination alongside overall assessments of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, or stress.Results: Sixteen studies were identified. Rumination was associated with distress cross-sectionally and longitudinally. However, once baseline depression was controlled for, the association was no longer seen. The emotional valence of ruminative thoughts and the style in which they were processed, rather than their topic, was associated with distress. Brooding and intrusive rumination were associated with increased distress, deliberate rumination had no association, and reflection/instrumentality had mixed findings.Conclusions: This review highlights that it is not necessarily the topic of content, but the style and valence of rumination that is important when considering its association with distress. The style of rumination should be the target of clinical intervention, including brooding and intrusion.

AB  - The psychological flexibility model can be seen as a basis for an integrated and progressive psychological approach to chronic pain management. Some researchers suggest that psychological flexibility and inflexibility represent distinct processes and constructs. This meta-analysis is the first to provide a summary estimate of the overall effect size for the relationship between psychological (in)flexibility and common outcomes among chronic pain patients. The research protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/), registration number CRD42021285705. Four databases were searched (PsycINFO; PubMed; Web of Science, CINAHL) along with reference lists. Thirty-six cross-sectional studies were included (7,779 participants). Meta-analyses (random effects model) indicated a significant medium negative association between psychological flexibility and pain intensity or functional impairment. The present study also indicated a significant small to medium association between psychological inflexibility and pain intensity, a nearly large association between psychological inflexibility and functional impairment as well as the quality of life, and a large association between psychological inflexibility and anxiety/depression. Due to the limited number of included studies, the relationship between risk behavior and psychological inflexibility may not be significant. Types of countries and instruments measuring psychological inflexibility may explain part of the heterogeneity. These findings may carry significant implications for chronic pain patients regarding the potential relationship between psychological inflexibility or flexibility and these outcomes. It may consequently form the basis for more robust testing of causal and manipulable relationships.

AB  - The worldwide pandemic has exposed healthcare professionals to a high risk of infection, exacerbating the situation of uncertainty caused by COVID-19. The objective of this review was to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental professionals and their patients. A literature review was conducted using Medline-Pubmed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, excluding systematic reviews, narratives, meta-analyses, case reports, book chapters, short communications, and congress papers. A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the selected studies. The search retrieved 3879 articles, and 123 of these were selected for the review (7 longitudinal and 116 cross-sectional studies). Elevated anxiety levels were observed in dental professionals, especially in younger and female professionals. Except for orthodontic treatments, patients reported a high level of fear that reduced their demand for dentist treatment to emergency cases alone. The results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has had psychological and emotional consequences for dental professionals and their patients. Further research is necessary to evaluate the persistence of this problem over time.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, many athletes from several sporting disciplines were infected with the SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the current scientific evidence on the psychological sequelae and mental health of elite athletes who have been infected by the virus. The review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement; three databases were searched: PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus. The initial search resulted in 2420 studies; after duplicate removal and screening by title and abstract, 41 articles were screened by full-text. A total of four eligible articles were included in the review. All included articles measured depression and anxiety in athletes who had suffered from COVID-19, while in three papers levels of stress were measured. Overall, the only two questionnaires used in more than one study were the DASS-21 and the APSQ. In our systematic review, we highlighted that mental and psychological health in elite athletes has the same importance as physical health. This statement suggests that these examinations should be introduced and performed during the competitive sports' medical examinations conducted at the start of the sporting season, which currently consists only of the examination of physical parameters. Due to lack of studies on the topic, the results of our review show that mental health in athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an issue that requires more investigation, considering the evidence of clinical consequences. The importance of post-infection psychological sequelae is significant in assessing possible repercussions on the athletes' sporting performance.

AB  - This study aimed to systematically review the evidence for an association between adversity experienced in childhood (< 17 years old), and the diagnosis of psychiatric disorder in adulthood. Electronic databases (Scopus, Medline (for Ovid), EMBASE, and PsychINFO) were searched for peer-reviewed, longitudinal cohort studies examining child or adolescent exposure to adversity, and adult-diagnosed depression, anxiety, psychotic disor-der, eating disorders, substance abuse disorder, illness anxiety disorder, somatoform disorder, or personality disorder. A total of 39 manuscripts were retained. Results revealed a significant association between the following childhood exposures and adult mental disorder (1.24 < Odds ratios < 2.09): bullying (victimhood, and frequency); emotional abuse; neglect; physical abuse; parental loss; and general maltreatment (unspecified and/ or multiple adversity exposure). There were opposing results for being a victim and perpetrator of bullying, and the result for sexual abuse was not statistically significant. There was some evidence of a dose-response rela-tionship with those exposed to multiple forms of maltreatment having more two and a half times odds of developing a mental disorder (Odds ratio = 2.59). The result for sexual abuse is likely an artefact of the pro-spective assessment of this adversity. In summary, there was strong evidence of an association between child-hood adversity and later mental illness, and this supports previously reported meta-analyses. The evidence suggests that childhood and adolescence is an important time for risk for later mental illness, and an important period in which to focus intervention strategies for those known to have been exposed to adversity, particularly multiple adversities.

KW  - MENTAL-HEALTH
AB  - Background:The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the physical and mental health of the general population worldwide, with healthcare workers at particular risk. The pandemic's effect on healthcare workers' mental well-being has been characterized by depression, anxiety, work-related stress, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Hence, protecting the mental well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs) is a considerable priority. This review aimed to determine risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes and protective or coping measures to mitigate the harmful effects of the COVID-19 crisis among HCWs in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We performed a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Embase for relevant materials. We obtained all articles published between March 2020 and April 2022 relevant to the subject of review and met pre-defined eligibility criteria. We selected 23 articles for initial screening and included 12 in the final review. Result: A total of 5,323 participants in twelve studies, predominantly from Ethiopia (eight studies), one from Uganda, Cameroon, Mali, and Togo, fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Investigators found 16.3-71.9% of HCWs with depressive symptoms, 21.9-73.5% with anxiety symptoms, 15.5-63.7% experienced work-related stress symptoms, 12.4-77% experienced sleep disturbances, and 51.6-56.8% reported PTSD symptoms. Healthcare workers, working in emergency, intensive care units, pharmacies, and laboratories were at higher risk of adverse mental health impacts. HCWs had deep fear, anxious and stressed with the high transmission rate of the virus, high death rates, and lived in fear of infecting themselves and families. Other sources of fear and work-related stress were the lack of PPEs, availability of treatment and vaccines to protect themselves against the virus. HCWs faced stigma, abuse, financial problems, and lack of support from employers and communities. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD in HCWs in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic has been high. Several organizational, community, and work-related challenges and interventions were identified, including improvement of workplace infrastructures, adoption of correct and shared infection control measures, provision of PPEs, social support, and implementation of resilience training programs. Setting up permanent multidisciplinary mental health teams at regional and national levels to deal with mental health and providing psychological support to HCWs, supported with long-term surveillance, are recommended.

AB  - Background There has been an increase in the number of orphans around the world as a result of natural or man-made causes. Orphans are likely to face a number of challenges throughout their lives that go unrecognized. Considering these challenges, much focus needs to be given to manage their mental health issues. Purpose The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of various psychosocial interventions in managing post-traumatic stress symptoms, emotional and behavioural problems, and depression among orphans. Method Electronic searches on seven databases was done to identify studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions among orphans. The effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to reduce post-traumatic stress symptoms, emotional and behavioural problems, and depression was analyzed in seventeen studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Result The overall intervention effect size of post-traumatic stress symptoms was found to be high with high heterogeneity, while low effect size for emotional and behavioural problems, and depression with substantial heterogeneity. Publication bias and exploratory moderating effects of study design and intervention type were also analyzed. Conclusion Psychosocial interventions were more effective in reducing post-traumatic stress symptoms when compared to emotional and behavioural problems and depression.

AB  - Background: The high volume and pace of research has posed challenges to researchers, policymakers and practitioners wanting to understand the overall impact of the pandemic on children and young people's mental health. We aimed to search for and review the evidence from epidemiological studies to answer the question: how has mental health changed in the general population of children and young people? Methods: Four databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsychINFO) were searched in October 2021, with searches updated in February 2022. We aimed to identify studies of children or adolescents with a mean age of 18 years or younger at baseline, that reported change on a validated mental health measure from prepandemic to during the pandemic. Abstracts and full texts were double-screened against inclusion criteria and quality assessed using a risk of bias tool. Studies were narratively synthesised, and meta-analyses were performed where studies were sufficiently similar. Results: 6917 records were identified, and 51 studies included in the review. Only four studies had a rating of high quality. Studies were highly diverse in terms of design, setting, timing in relation to the pandemic, population, length of follow-up and choice of measure. Methodological heterogeneity limited the potential to conduct meta-analyses across studies. Whilst the evidence suggested a slight deterioration on some measures, overall, the findings were mixed, with no clear pattern emerging. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for a more harmonised approach to research in this field. Despite the sometimes-inconsistent results of our included studies, the evidence supports existing concerns about the impact of Covid-19 on children's mental health and on services for this group, given that even small changes can have a significant impact on provision at population level. Children and young people must be prioritised in pandemic recovery, and explicitly considered in planning for any future pandemic response.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To summarize the most relevant data from a systematic review on the impact of COVID-19 on children and adolescents, particularly analyzing its psychiatric effects. METHODS This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included experimental studies (randomized-individually or pooled-and non-randomized controlled trials), observational studies with a group for internal comparison (cohort studies-prospective and retrospective-and case-control) and qualitative studies in the period from 2021 to 2022. RESULTS The search identified 325 articles; we removed 125 duplicates. We selected 200 manuscripts, chosen by title and selected abstracts. We excluded 50 records after screening titles and abstracts, as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. We retrieved 150 records selected for a full reading. We excluded 90 text articles and we selected 25 records for the (n) final. Limitations: Due to the short period of data collection, from 2021 to 2022, there is a possibility of lack of relevant studies related to the mental health care of children and adolescents. In addition, there is the possibility of publication bias, such as only significant findings being published. CONCLUSION The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adolescents is of great concern to child and youth psychiatry. Situations such as fear, anxiety, panic, depression, sleep and appetite disorders, as well as impairment in social interactions caused by psychic stress, are punctual markers of pain and psychic suffering, which have increasing impacts on the mental health panorama of children and adolescents globally, particularly in vulnerable and socially at-risk populations.

AB  - Objective:Exercise has beneficial effects on mood and anxiety symptoms. However, the impact of aquatic exercise on mood and anxiety symptoms has not been clearly confirmed. Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize and systematically analyze evidence available on boosting mental health through aquatic exercise. Method:A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted under the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, PsycINFO, Medline, SPORTDiscus, Education Source, and Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) were searched in May 2022. The research included the influence of aquatic exercises on mood and anxiety symptoms. After assessing trial quality and completing data extraction, a meta-analysis was carried out through R software. The results were presented as a standardized mean difference (SMD) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Results:A total of 18 original trials were included. People who received aquatic exercise intervention had a statistically significant reduction in mental disorder symptoms compared with before. The results were aquatic exercise [SMD = -0.77, 95% CI (-1.08, -0.47), I-2 = 77%, P < 0.01], swimming [SMD = -0.51, 95% CI (-1.14, 0.12), I-2 = 78%, P < 0.01], aquatic aerobics [SMD = -0.92, 95% CI (-1.32, -0.53), I-2 = 78%, P < 0.01], moderate intensity [SMD = -0.75, 95% CI (-1.07, -0.43), I-2 = 67%, P < 0.01], and low intensity [SMD = -1.07, 95% CI (-1.08, -0.47), I-2 = 85%, P < 0.01]. Conclusion:Aquatic exercise could statistically significantly improve mental health. Light aquatic aerobics probably has a better effect on mood and anxiety symptoms. However, given the number and quality of included research, verifying the aforementioned conclusions requires a larger sample of high-quality studies.

AB  - Purpose- The purpose of this study is to explore mental health difficulties, including risk and protective factors, which may impact on symptom severity after exposure to crisis situations (war, terrorism and/or natural disasters), among first responders from uniformed services. Design/methodology/approach- Peer-reviewed journal articles published in English between January 2012 and March 2022 were searched in ProQuest, Wiley, Google Scholar and PubMed databases. In total, 12 articles were obtained from an original screening of 94,058 articles. Full article texts were screened for content and quality by two reviewers, with high agreeability. Findings- Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression were the most common diagnoses. Risk factors identified were pre-deployment factors of overweight, low cognitive ability and social support, existing emotional difficulties, negative childhood experiences and stressful life events; during crisis situations factors of higher frequency and subjective severity of combat, increased rates of combat stress reaction, high levels of concerns for life and family, more stressful mission position, threat of death/severe injury and high rate of killing the enemy; and post-deployment factors, such as low social support and physical health, lack of coping mechanisms and use of avoidance strategies and social stigma. Protective factors increasing resilience and lessening symptom severity were reported as pre-deployment cognitive ability, high social support, stable physical health, effective coping, post-traumatic growth and high levels of perceived adequacy in pre-deployment preparation and training. In addition to main findings, data about author(s), publication type, population, age, type of crisis and evaluation measures were extracted. Key findings and related theories, gaps in literature and recommendations are discussed. Originality/value- As yet, however, research into the factors that could serve as risk and/or protective factors are not clearly indicated in terms of post-crisis recovery. As per the authors' knowledge, this study is an initial approach to considering this area.

AB  - The prevalence of emotional disorders has increased in recent times. Emotional Reasoning (ER), which is a transdiagnostic process, occurs when feelings, rather than objective evidence, are used as a source of information to make judgements about the valence of a situation. Differences in ER may explain the existence and maintenance of emotional disorders. The objective is to systematically review the role of ER in the occurrence and severity of emotional disorders. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched through: PubMed, Psyclnfo, Scopus and The Cochrane Library. Search terms were "Emotional Reasoning", "ex-consequentia reasoning", "Affect-as-information"; and "emotional disorders", "anxiety", "depression", "depressive". Nine articles were included. An association was demonstrated between ER and a greater degree of anxious symptomatological severity. In depressive symptomatology, no significant differences were found. One study reported the effect of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy on ER bias, finding no changes after the intervention. Finally, another study evaluated the efficacy of computerised experiential training in reducing ER bias, showing significant differences. There are few studies on ER and its evolution in research has not been uniform over time. Encouragingly, though, research to date suggests that ER is a transdiagnostic process involved in several anxiety disorders. More investigation is needed to dilucidate whether ER also underlies the onset and maintenance of depressive disorders.

AB  - BackgroundAny infectious disease outbreak may lead to a negative detrimental psychological impact on individuals and the community at large, however; there was no systematic review nor meta-analysis that examined the relationship between the psychological/mental health impact of SARS and COVID-19 outbreak in Asia.Methods and designA systematic search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases from 1/1/2000 to 1/6/2020. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analyzed the psychological impact on confirmed/suspected cases, healthcare workers and the general public during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemics. Primary outcomes included prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, aggression, sleeping problems and psychological symptoms.ResultTwenty-three eligible studies (N = 27,325) were included. Random effect model was used to analyze the data using STATA. Of these studies, 11 were related to the SARS outbreak and 12 related to COVID-19 outbreaks. The overall prevalence rate of anxiety during SARS and COVID-19 was 37.8% (95% CI: 21.1-54.5, P < 0.001, I2 = 96.9%) and 34.8% (95% CI: 29.1-40.4), respectively. For depression, the overall prevalence rate during SARS and COVID-19 was 30.9% (95% CI: 18.6-43.1, P < 0.001, I2 = 97.3%) and 32.4% (95% CI: 19.8-45.0, P < 0.001, I2 = 99.8%), respectively. The overall prevalence rate of stress was 9.4% (95% CI: -0.4 -19.2, P = 0.015, I2 = 83.3%) and 54.1% (95% CI: 35.7-72.6, P < 0.001, I2 = 98.8%) during SARS and COVID-19, respectively. The overall prevalence of PTSD was 15.1% (95% CI: 8.2-22.0, P < 0.001) during SARS epidemic, calculated by random-effects model (P < 0.05), with significant between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 93.5%).ConclusionThe SARS and COVID-19 epidemics have brought about high levels of psychological distress to individuals. Psychological interventions and contingent digital mental health platform should be promptly established nationwide for continuous surveillance of the increasing prevalence of negative psychological symptoms. Health policymakers and mental health experts should jointly collaborate to provide timely, contingent mental health treatment and psychological support to those in need to reduce the global disease burden.Systematic review registrationCRD42020182787, identifier PROSPER.

AB  - Tornadoes are one of the most prevalent natural hazards in the United States, yet they have been underrepresented in the disaster mental health comprehensive literature. In the current study, we systematically reviewed available scientific evidence within published research journals on tornadoes and mental health from 1994 to 2021. The electronic search strategy identified 384 potentially relevant articles. Of the 384 articles, 29 articles met the inclusion criteria, representing 27,534 participants. Four broad areas were identified: (i) Mental health impacts of tornadoes; (ii) Risk factors; (iii) Protective factors; and (iv) Mental health interventions. Overall, results showed adverse mental health symptoms (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety) in both adult and pediatric populations. A number of risk factors were found to contribute to negative mental health, including demographics, tornado exposure, post-tornado stressors, and prior exposure to trauma. Protective factors found to contribute to positive outcomes included having access to physical, social, and psychological resources. Together, these findings can serve as an important resource for future mental health services in communities experiencing tornadoes.

AB  - Background: Positive emotions help children and adolescents develop good personalities and interpersonal relationships. Evidence shows that participation in physical activity is associated with positive emotions in young people. However, there is still a lack of studies on the effects of physical activity on positive emotions in children and adolescents. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effects of physical activity on positive emotions in children and adolescents. Methods: Online databases (Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and APA PsycInfo) were searched from inception to August 2022. Result: A total of 24 articles were eventually included representing 3907 participants from 14 different countries. Overall, the effect of physical activity interventions on positive emotions was significant. The studies revealed that positive emotions were statistically better in the physical activity participation group than in the control group without physical activity (SMD = 0.62, 95% CI: (0.24, 1.01), (p < 0.01). Based on subgroup analyses, we found that participation in aerobic exercise for 30-60 min in adolescents aged >= 12 years had a more significant intervention effect on positive emotions. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the moods of children and adolescents who participate in physical activity significantly improved compared with the moods of those who do not participate in physical activity. The age, exercise type, and exercise duration of adolescents are important factors influencing the positive emotions resulting from physical activity interventions.

AB  - Background: Telework has dramatically increased due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the health impacts related to telework have become major concerns. Some studies have shown that telework has both positive and negative impacts. However, during the pandemic, the influence of COVID-19 is too strong to estimate the health effects of telework. Therefore, this scoping review investigated a comprehensive overview of those impacts based on studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched keywords related to telework in five databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, and Ichu-Shi Web. We included articles written in English and Japanese and published from January 2009 to December 2020. One author extracted data, and four authors were paired into two groups. All authors independently conducted the first and second screening and checked the results in pairs. Any disagreements were resolved by reaching a consensus among all authors. All screening and strategies were performed with the consent of all authors. Results: Twenty-nine quantitative studies published in 12 countries were extracted. The outcomes included 10 studies on physical and lifestyle outcomes, 25 studies on stress and mental health outcomes, and 13 studies on quality-of-life and wellbeing outcomes. Telework increased sitting time in one study, and two studies showed improvement in behavior, such as reducing smoking or drinking due to telework. While six studies reported subjective stress levels improved by telework, the results for depression, anxiety, and other disorders varied across those studies, and the social or individual factors further complicated the situation. Conclusion: Telework is potentially associated with a shift to healthier lifestyles but also the potential for inverse correlation to extend sedentary time. Mental stress indicators depend on the social and individual situations, and very few intervention studies on teleworking existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our review identified a lack of intervention and comparative research on health problems with telework and revealed a need to conduct research with clear comparisons in post-COVID-19 studies.

AB  - Background: Evidence exists reporting a high mental health burden among migrants globally. However, there is no global estimate of mental ill-health among African migrants despite their adverse pre-migration environ-ments. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarise the current scholarship regarding the prevalence of anxiety, depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the global African migrant population.Methods: We searched six databases (Medline (EBSCOHost), PsycINFO (EBSCOHost), Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) from 1st January 2000 to 31st August 2021. We screened retrieved articles using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools. Random-effects meta-analyses were employed using DerSimonian and Laird estimator based on inverse variance weights. The I2 statistic was used to measure heterogeneity.Results: Our search retrieved 1091 articles, of which 46 were included representing a total of 28,367 African migrants. The weighted mean age of African migrants was 32.98 years, and nearly half were male (n= 12852, 45.31%). Among the included studies, almost nine out of ten (n=41, 89.1%) were cross-sectional studies. The pooled prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD was 34.60%;95%CI (26.30-43.00), 33.20%;95%CI (27.70-38.37) and 37.9%;95%CI (23.5-52.4) respectively. Significant heterogeneity (I2 >98%) existed in the prevalence estimates for anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Sub-group analyses indicate a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety and depression but PTSD for studies conducted in Africa than outside Africa. Similarly, higher prevalence rates for anxiety, depression, and PTSD were seen in studies that used a screening tool than in those that used a diagnostic tool, although a significant difference was observed for depression only. Conclusion: Despite significant heterogeneity among included studies, our systematic review and meta-analysis show a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among African migrants. Our findings underscore the need to develop and implement serious, culturally appropriate mental health interventions that address post -migration stressors that increase their risk of mental ill-health and successful integration into host communities

KW  - ANXIETY
AB  - IMPORTANCE Adolescents and young people have been historically understudied populations, and previous studies indicate that during epidemics, these populations, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), are at high risk of developing mental disturbances.
   OBJECTIVE To identify the existing evidence regarding the association of mental health with outbreaks of the influenza A (H1N1), Zika, Ebola, and SARS-CoV-2 virus in exposed youth and adolescents in LMICs.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Across 6 databases (Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science), the mental health outcomes of adolescents and youth (aged 10-24 years) associated with 4 major pandemic outbreaks from January 2009 to January 2021 in LMICs were reviewed. A group of 3 authors at each stage carried out the screening, selection, and quality assessment using Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. The social determinants of adolescent well-being framework was used as a guide to organizing the review.
   FINDINGS A total of 57 studies fulfilled the search criteria, 55 related to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and 2 covered the H1N1 influenza epidemics. There were no studies associated with Zika or Ebola outbreaks that met screening criteria. The studies reported high rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms among adolescents, including posttraumatic stress disorder, general stress, and health-related anxiety. Potential risk factors associated with poor mental health outcomes included female sex; home residence in areas with strict lockdown limitations on social and physical movement; reduced physical activity; poor parental, family, or social support; previous exposure to COVID-19 infection; or being part of an already vulnerable group (eg, previous psychiatric conditions, childhood trauma, or HIV infection).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this systematic scoping review suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic and H1N1 epidemic were associated with adverse mental health among adolescents and youth from LMICs. Vulnerable youth and adolescents may be at higher risk of developing mental health-related complications, requiring more responsive interventions and further research. Geographically localized disease outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika, and H1N1 influenza are highly understudied and warrant future investigation.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and its social restrictions have affected mental health globally. This systematic review aims to analyze the psychological responses of the general population and its related sociodemographic risk factors, excluding the most vulnerable groups (e.g., healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients and survivors, pregnant women, people with chronic diseases or preexisting psychiatric disorders). A reproducible search from June 2020 to February 2021 was conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar, following the PRISMA guidelines. Papers that (1) considered the most at-risk populations, (2) did not report sociodemographic data, and (3) did not use validated scales were excluded from our analysis. Non-English papers and review articles were also excluded. Of 1116 papers identified, 25 were included for this review (n = 162,465). The main risk factors associated with the emergence of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder were: female gender, younger and later age, high level of education, Latino origin, free marital status, living quarantine in a house with no outdoor, negative coping strategies, close proximity to positive cases, high concern about contracting COVID-19 and living in a most affected area. High income, physical activity, resilience, family support, and a high level of knowledge about COVID-19, seems to be protective factors against the onset of psychological symptoms. In a general population, COVID-19 restrictions are linked to risk factors for psychological disorders caused by gender and sociodemographic conditions. In this regard governments should pay more attention to the public's mental health and its risk and protective factors.

AB  - There has been a notable increase in social media and Internet use over recent decades, not only for social interaction or entertainment, but also for working and meeting tools, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. A relationship between this usage and the development of mental illness is frequently hypothesized, but a few studies have empirical findings. This study is a systematic review of the relationship between social media use and depression or anxiety. Our Medline search yielded 1,747 papers. Our study found a strong and often bidirectional relationship between social media use and depression or anxiety. This relationship was frequently related to problematic social media use. No definite linear relationship was found between time spent using social media and depressive or anxious symptoms, but usually, the longer the time spent in that activity, the worse the outcomes. Factors related to problematic social media use were often different for men and women. Other variables may also play a role, such as nighttime-specific use, emotional involvement, and whether the individual behaves as an active or passive user. Evidence from this review provides a solid base for recommending cautious use of social media. Intense use and unhealthy habits, evidenced by addiction symptoms, may be problematic in less resilient individuals.

AB  - This systematic review investigates the current state of the literature on the association between social communication (SC) skills and mental health outcomes in children and young adults. We ran searches using terms describing SC and mental health in the following databases: PubMed, the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, APA PsychInfo, the Education Resource Information Center (ERIC) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We included studies that both measured SC before age 21 years and assessed a mental health component, such as behavior/conduct problems, anxiety, depression, or emotional problems, before age 30. Only peer-reviewed articles published in or after 2000 were retained. In total, 27 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Overall, the methodological quality was good. A longitudinal design was used in 12 studies, seven of which sourced data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Most studies investigated the broad concept of pragmatic language and its influence on internalizing, externalizing, and peer-relationship problems. The analyzed publications included population-based studies and studies investigating special populations with existing mental health problems or at increased risk of developing them. The population-based cross-sectional studies showed significantly higher rates of SC problems in children with mental health problems while those with a longitudinal design found earlier onset and more persistent mental health problems in children who had the most severe SC difficulties. Studies with special populations confirmed more SC problems as compared to typically developing children and worse mental health outcomes in children with additional SC difficulties. The available literature thus shows consistently significant, mostly moderate associations between SC skills and mental health outcomes. SC difficulties earlier in life can predict mental health problems and impact their trajectories.

AB  - Introduction Informal caregivers of people with a mental illness are at increased risk of developing depression, anxiety, and stress, so preventive interventions are needed. Method The review was reported in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018094454). The PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched in June 2019. The Cochrane Risk of Bias and Jadad scale scores were used to assess study quality. Inclusion criteria were: RCTs of informal caregiver interventions regardless of the care receiver's mental illness and intervention modality. Interventions should be compared to a waitlist, treatment as usual or active control, taught in real-time by a mental health professional, include an outcome measure on psychological distress, and published in a peer-reviewed journal article in English. RCTs were excluded if the intervention was given in dyads (caregiver + care receiver), limited to the provision of respite care where the patient sample included a mix of both physical and psychological illnesses, unpublished, not peer-reviewed, study protocols, or dissertations. Results A total of 2,148 studies were identified; of these, 44 RCT studies met the inclusion criteria, and 31 had sufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis including subgroup analysis (N = 1,899). The systematic review showed that thirty-one out of the 44 RCTs had an effect of the intervention on decreasing psychological distress. The results of the meta-analysis, which included informal caregiver interventions, compared to waitlist, treatment as usual, or active control, regardless of care-receiver mental illness or intervention modality showed a small effect of -0.32 (95% CI -0.53 to -0.11). The heterogeneity of the included studies was high (I-2 = 78). The subgroup analysis included manualized interventions lasting at least 8 weeks and the subgroup analysis that included an active control showed a small effect and low heterogeneity. Lack of active control and long-term follow-up is a limitation of most of the studies. Conclusion The evidence supports that several interventions improve the mental health of caregivers. Manualized interventions & GE; 8 weeks with active participation are most effective. Future RCTs should improve methodology, and research should investigate which intervention modality is most effective for what kind of caregiver. Future research should clearly specify what the included intervention components are, use longer follow-up times, and conduct mediational analyses to better understand what mechanisms create the effect of an intervention.

AB  - If the negative emotions experienced in life become trauma, they affect daily life. Neuro-feedback technology has recently been introduced as a treatment, but many different neuro-feedback protocols and methods exits. This study conducted a meta-analysis of neuro-feedback training for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms to evaluate the effects of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neuro-feedback training. A search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Science Direct, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted from January 2011 to December 2021. The studies' quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and publication bias was assessed by Egger's regression test. Seven studies that met the inclusion criteria were used for the systematic review and meta-analysis. EEG was more effective than fMRI for PTSD symptoms, and the effect on PTSD symptoms was higher than on anxiety and depression. There was no difference in the effectiveness of the training sessions. Our findings showed that EEG-based neuro-feedback training was more helpful for training PTSD symptoms. Additionally, the methods were also shown to be valid for evaluating clinical PTSD diagnoses. Further research is needed to establish a gold standard protocol for the EEG-based neuro-feedback training (EEG-NFT) method for PTSD symptoms.

AB  - With the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as a threat to mental health, the demand for online interventions that can replace face-to-face approaches for the prevention of mental health problems is increasing. Although several previous reviews on online interventions have targeted adolescents with symptoms of or those diagnosed with mental illness, there is still a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of online preventive interventions for general and at-risk adolescents. Therefore, this review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of online interventions on the prevention of an increase in the scores of stress, anxiety, and depression in general and at-risk adolescents. A search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL. Altogether, 19 studies were included, and 16 studies were used for the meta-analysis. Our results showed that cognitive behavioral therapy and family-based interventions were most commonly used. Twelve and seven studies conducted universal and selective preventive interventions, respectively. The meta-analysis showed that online interventions significantly prevent an increase in depression score but not in stress and anxiety scores. Evidence regarding the prevention of increases in stress and anxiety scores is limited, suggesting the need for further randomized controlled trials on online interventions for stress and anxiety in adolescents.

AB  - Background: Despite its ubiquity, it is often not clear what organizations and services mean by well-being. Visual impairment (VI) has been associated with poorer well-being and well-being has become a key outcome for support and services for adults living with VI. A shared understanding of what well-being means is therefore essential to enable assessment of well-being and cross-service provision of well-being support.Objectives: To provide an overview of the ways in which well-being has been conceptualized in research relating to adults living with VI.Eligibility criteria: Articles were included in the review if the article discussed well-being in the context of adults living with VI, was available in English and as a full text.Data sources: A systematic search using search terms relating to VI and well-being was conducted in EBSCOHost (Medline, CINHL) and Ovid (Embase Classic, Embase, Emcare 1995, Health + Psychosocial, HMIC Health Management Info, APA, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, PsycTests).Charting: A team of three reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full-texts articles and extracted data. Ambiguous articles were referred to the research group and discussed.Results: Of 10,662 articles identified in the search, 249 were included in the review. These referred to 38 types of well-being. The most common types were general well-being (n = 101; 40.6%) emotional well-being (n = 86, 34.5%) and psychological well-being (n = 66, 26.5%). Most articles (n = 150; 60.2%) referred to one type only, with a maximum of 9 listed in one article. A large number of articles did not clearly define well-being. A wide range of indicators of well-being related to the domains of hedonia, mood, positive and negative affect, quality of life, mental health, eudaimonia, self/identity, health, psychological reactions to disability and health problems, functioning, social functioning and environment, were extracted, many of which were used just once.Conclusions: There remains a lack of consensus on how well-being is conceptualized and assessed in the context of adult VI. A standardized multi-domain approach derived with input from adults with VI and practitioners working with them is required to enable comparison of findings and cross-organizational provision of support.

AB  - Background Specific programs are often implemented for specific child mental health problems, while many children suffer from comorbid problems. Ideally, programs reduce a wider range of mental health problems. The present study tested whether parenting programs for children's conduct problems, and which individual and clusters of program elements, have additional effects on children's emotional problems. Methods We updated the search of a previous systematic review in 11 databases (e.g., PsycINFO and MEDLINE) and included studies published until July 2020 with keywords relating to 'parenting', 'program', and 'child behavioral problems'. Also, we searched for recent trials in four trial registries and contacted protocol authors. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a parenting program for children aged 2-10 years which was based on social learning theory and included a measure of children's emotional problems postintervention. Results We identified 69 eligible trials (159 effect sizes; 6,240 families). Robust variance estimation showed that parenting programs had small significant parent-reported additional effects on emotional problems immediately postintervention (Cohen's d = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.21, -0.07), but these effects faded over time. Teachers and children did not report significant effects. Additional effects on emotional problems were larger in samples with clinical baseline levels of such problems. No individual program elements predicted larger additional effects. Of the clusters of elements, combining behavior management and relationship enhancement elements was most likely to yield the strongest additional effects. Conclusions The additional effects on emotional problems of parenting programs designed to reduce conduct problems are limited, but some clusters of elements predict larger effects. Our findings may contribute to realistic expectations of the benefits of parenting programs for children's conduct problems and inform the development of programs with wider benefits across mental health problems.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental disorder, which is strongly associated with insomnia, yet their epidemiological overlap is poorly understood. To determine the convergent quantitative magnitude of their relationship, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, PubPsych, and PsycINFO were searched to identify studies that either reported the correlation or frequency of insomnia symptoms in PTSD and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), or both. Out of 3714 records, 75 studies met selection criteria and aggregate effect size (ES) estimates were generated for the correlations (K=44, comprising 57,618 subjects) and frequencies (K=33, comprising 573,665 subjects with PTSD/PTSS) of insomnia symptoms in PTSD/PTSS. A medium-size significant correlation was found [ES: 0.52 (CI: 0.47-0.57)] with moderating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and military service as causes of trauma. The prevalence of insomnia in PTSD/PTSS was 63% [CI: 45%-78%] and was moderated by the cause of trauma as well as the PTSD/PTSS assessment scale. The findings from this meta -analysis highlight the importance of screening and managing insomnia in PTSD patients.

AB  - BackgroundThe impact of emotion regulation (ER) interventions on mental health and wellbeing has been extensively documented in the literature, although only recently have digital technologies been incorporated in intervention design. The aim of this review is to explore available published literature relating to the efficacy, barriers and facilitators of digital technologies in enhancing emotion/mood regulation skills. MethodsA review of the literature was performed to explore the effectiveness of digital technology in enhancing ER skills. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 31st August 2020. In addition, the first 10 pages of Google Scholar were examined for relevant articles. The following MeSH term and key words were used to identify relevant articles: "emotion regulation OR mood regulation" AND "intervention OR treatment OR program$ OR therap$" AND "digital technologies OR web-based OR mobile application OR App." Reference lists of retrieved papers were hand searched to identify additional publications. Findings were summarized narratively. ResultsTitles and abstracts were reviewed by one reviewer in two phases, and confirmed by a second reviewer; discrepancies were resolved through discussion. First, the retrieved titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify relevant studies. Full texts of retrieved studies were then read to determine eligibility. The search resulted in 209 studies of which 191 citations were identified as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. After reviewing the title and abstract of the 191 papers, 33 studies were identified as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. Following full-text review, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicated the potential effectiveness of online, text-messaging, and smartphone interventions for enhancing ER skills. ConclusionThere is encouraging evidence that digital technologies may be beneficial for enhancing ER skills and providing personalized care remotely. Digital technologies, particularly the use of smartphones, were instrumental in facilitating assessments and delivering online self-help interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Continued research is required to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of digital technologies in ER skills and carefully consider risks/benefits while determining how emerging technologies might support the scale-up of ER skills and mental health treatment.

AB  - Background: Worldwide, stress and burnout continue to be a problem among teachers, leading to anxiety and depression. Burnout may adversely affect teachers' health and is a risk factor for poor physical and mental well-being. Determining the prevalence and correlates of stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression among teachers is essential for addressing this public health concern. Objective: To determine the extent of the current literature on the prevalence and correlates of stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression among teachers. Method: This scoping review was performed using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Relevant search terms were used to determine the prevalence and correlates of teachers' stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression. Articles were identified using MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Data Base), APA PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Scopus Elsevier and ERIC (Education Resources Information Center). The articles were extracted, reviewed, collated, and thematically analyzed, and the results were summarized and reported. Results: When only clinically meaningful (moderate to severe) psychological conditions among teachers were considered, the prevalence of burnout ranged from 25.12% to 74%, stress ranged from 8.3% to 87.1%, anxiety ranged from 38% to 41.2% and depression ranged from 4% to 77%. The correlates of stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression identified in this review include socio-demographic factors such as sex, age, marital status, and school (organizational) and work-related factors including the years of teaching, class size, job satisfaction, and the subject taught. Conclusion: Teaching is challenging and yet one of the most rewarding professions, but several factors correlate with stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression among teachers. Highlighting these factors is the first step in recognizing the magnitude of the issues encountered by those in the teaching profession. Implementation of a school-based awareness and intervention program is crucial to resolve the early signs of teacher stress and burnout to avoid future deterioration.

AB  - (1) Introduction: Mental health (MH) and physical activity (PA) share a bi-directional relationship, but most studies report MH as the outcome. With diminishing pandemic-related MH, this review examines the impact of diminished MH on PA. (2) Methods: This narrative literature review included 19 empirical studies published since the COVID-19 pandemic. Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for English language articles in peer-reviewed journals using equivalent index terms: "anxiety", "depression", "stress", "mental health", "exercise", "activity", "COVID-19", "coronavirus", and "2019 pandemic". The search reviewed 187 articles with double-rater reliability using Covidence. A total of 19 articles met the inclusion criteria. (3) Results: MH themes that impacted PA were depression and/or anxiety (n = 17), one of which identified inadequate coping and excessive pandemic stress (n = 2). In addition, women are more likely to suffer diminished MH and reduced PA throughout the pandemic. (4) Conclusion: Current research suggests that individuals with pre-pandemic MH episodes are correlated with more effective coping skills and fewer adverse effects from COVID-19 than expected. As we emerge from this pandemic, equipping all individuals, especially women, with positive coping strategies may accelerate a seamless return to PA.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affects the mental health of the general popu-lation, especially cancer patients. Cancer patients due to lower immunity encountered an increasing risk of severe CO-VID-19 infection. This mechanism results in high stress, anxiety, depression and social isolation that increases the risk of develop mental disorders. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science from 1st December 2019 to 1st December 2020 based on PRISMA guidelines. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: From 553 studies, 14 articles were included in the review. Stress, anxiety, depression, and mental distress were more common psychological problems in cancer patients during the pandemic in the UK, USA, China, Poland, Malaysia, India, Turkey, and Italy. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, the most important predictors of developing mental health problems in cancer patients were female gender, social distancing, cancer stage, overall perceived health, delays in care, and other health problems. Because of the relationship between mental health and strong immune system, countries must take steps to help the mental health of cancer patients during the pandemic.

Muslims who memorized Quran have a higher quality of life (QoL) and lower anxiety and stress. Hence, this systematic review was conducted to evaluate the studies that assessed the effect of listening to, reciting, or memorizing the Quran on physical and mental health.Methods: This review was performed on articles published from the inception and April 2021. Databases including ProQuest, PubMed and Web of Science were searched on 19 April 2021. Keywords such as "Quran", "al- Quran," "al- Kareem," "Holy Quran," "memori," "Tahfiz," "Huffaz," "listening" and "reciting" were used for databases searching. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Only 20 articles were included in data synthesis out of a total of 230.Results: The findings revealed that listening to, reciting or memorizing the Quran had a favorable effect on depression, anxiety, physiologic parameters, quality of life, quality of sleep and intelligence quotient.Conclusion: The current evidence suggests that, listening to, reciting or memorizing the Quran may be useful as an intervention to improve physical and mental health.

AB  - Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can play important roles in maintaining mental health and resistance to stress, and omega-3 PUFAs supplementation can display beneficial effects on both the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders. Although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, accumulated evidence indicates that omega-3 PUFAs can exhibit pleiotropic effects on the neural structure and function. Thus, they play fundamental roles in brain activities involved in the mood regulation. Since depressive symptoms have been assumed to be of central origin, this review aims to summarize the recently published studies to identify the potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying the anti-depressant effects of omega-3 PUFAs. These include that of (1) anti-neuroinflammatory; (2) hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; (3) anti-oxidative stress; (4) anti-neurodegeneration; (5) neuroplasticity and synaptic plasticity; and (6) modulation of neurotransmitter systems. Despite many lines of evidence have hinted that these mechanisms may co-exist and work in concert to produce anti-depressive effects, the potentially multiple sites of action of omega-3 PUFAs need to be fully established. We also discussed the limitations of current studies and suggest future directions for preclinical and translational research in this field.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic can have a serious impact on children and adolescents' mental health. We focused on studies exploring its traumatic effects on young people in the first 18 months after that the pandemic was declared, distinguishing them also according to the type of informants (self-report and other-report instruments). Objective We applied a meta-analytic approach to examine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and psychological distress among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering the moderating role of kind of disorder and/or symptom, type of instrument, and continent. Method We used PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus databases to identify articles on the COVID-19 pandemic, applying the following filters: participants until 20 years of age, peer-review, English as publication language. Inclusion required investigating the occurrence of disorders and/or symptoms during the first 18 months of the pandemic. The search identified 26 publications. Results The meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of psychological disorders and/or symptoms for children and adolescents, who were not affected by mental health disturbances before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, was .20, 95% CI [.16, .23]. Moreover, we found a moderating role of type of instrument: occurrence was higher for self-report compared to other-report instruments. Conclusions The study presented an analysis of the psychological consequences for children and adolescents of the exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic, soliciting further research to identify factors underlying resilience. Notwithstanding limitations such as the small number of eligible articles and the fact that we did not examine the role of further characteristics of the studies (such as participants' age or design), this meta-analysis is a first step for future research documenting the impact of such an unexpected and devastating disaster like the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objective For the general working population, robust evidence exists for associations between psychosocial work exposures and mental health. As this relationship is less clear for young workers, this systematic review aims at providing an overview of the evidence concerning psychosocial work factors affecting mental health of young workers. Methods The electronic databases used were PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO and were last searched in October 2021. The eligible outcomes included depression-, stress-, burnout- and anxiety-related complaints, and fatigue, excluding clinical diagnoses and suicide-related outcomes. Only studies with workers aged 35 years or younger were included, which reported at least one association between a psychosocial work factor as exposure and a mental health complaint as outcome. Studies had to be in English, German or Dutch. Risk of bias was assessed using an instrument from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Data synthesis was conducted using GRADE. Results In total 17 studies were included in this systematic review, including data from 35,600 young workers in total. Across these studies 86 exposure-outcome associations were reported. Nine exposure-outcome associations could be synthesised. The application of the GRADE framework led to one "low" assessment for the association between psychosocial job quality and mental health. The certainty of evidence for the other eight associations in the synthesis was very low. Conclusions The current systematic review disclosed a high degree of uncertainty of the evidence due to conceptually fuzzy outcomes and exposures as well as large heterogeneity between studies.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic-related perceived risk of infection, illness fears, acute stress, emotional anxiety, exhaustion, and fatigue, psychological trauma and depressive symptoms, and sustained psychological distress can cause smartphone addiction risk and lead to technology-related cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders, thus impacting psychological well-being. Behavioral addiction of smartphone userscan result in anxiety symptom severity, psychiatric symptoms, and depressive stress. We carried out a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest throughout June 2022, with search terms including "smartphone addiction+COVID-19"+"stress," "anxiety," "depression," "psychological distress," "screen time," and "fear." As we analyzed only articles published between 2020 and 2022, 288 papers met the eligibility criteria. By excluding sources with similar titles, having unclear findings or unsupported by replication, or displaying inconsistent content, we selected 64, mainly empirical, sources. We used layout algorithms (VOSviewer) and bibliometric mapping (Dimensions) as data visualization tools. Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), a systematic review and literature review software (Distiller SR), Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) were employed as methodological quality assessment tools. As limitations, we analyzed only articles published between 2020 and 2022 in scholarly outlets indexed in the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases. The scope of our study also does not advance the inspection of sources covering vulnerable individuals suffering from certain diseases or specific generations. Subsequent analyses should develop on smartphone use and addiction among children and adolescents. Future research should thus investigate problematic smartphone use and addiction across generations Z and Alpha. Attention should be directed to their personality traits and psychopathological symptoms.

AB  - Mental health difficulties are prevalent in autistic people with ~14%-50% having experienced depression and ~40%-80% having experienced anxiety disorders. Identifying interventions that improve autistic people's mental health is a top priority. However, at present, there is no high-quality network meta-analysis of benefits and harms of different interventions. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, other databases, and trial registers until 17 October 2020. We included randomised controlled trials reporting anxiety or depression in a suitable format. We calculated effect estimates and 95% credible intervals using Bayesian network meta-analysis. Our search identified 13,794 reports, of which 71 randomised controlled trials (3630 participants) were eligible for inclusion. All trials had high risk of bias. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 24 months. Evidence indicates uncertainty about the effects of different interventions, with more high-quality evidence needed. Available evidence suggests that some forms of cognitive behavioural therapy may decrease anxiety and depression scores in autistic children and adults; mindfulness therapy may decrease anxiety and depression scores in autistic adults with previous mental health conditions; and behavioural interventions may provide some benefit for depression in autistic children. We recommend that autistic people are given access to mental health interventions available to non-autistic people, following principles of person-centred care. PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42019136093 Lay Abstract Nearly three out of four autistic people experience mental health problems such as stress, anxiety or depression. The research already done does not guide us on how best to prevent or treat mental health problems for autistic people. Our aim was to look at the benefits and harms of different interventions on mental health outcomes in autistic people. We searched all the published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) about interventions for mental health conditions in autistic people until 17 October 2020. We also searched for RCTs that were not published in peer-reviewed journals. These were obtained from registers of clinical trials online. We then combined the information from all these trials using advanced statistical methods to analyse how good the interventions are. Seventy-one studies (3630 participants) provided information for this research. The studies reported how participants were responding to the intervention for only a short period of time. The trials did not report which interventions worked for people with intellectual disability. In people without intellectual disability, some forms of cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness therapy may be helpful. However, further research is necessary. Many trials used medications to target core features of autism rather than targeting mental health conditions, but these medications did not help autistic people. Until we have more evidence, treatment of mental health conditions in autistic people should follow the evidence available for non-autistic people. We plan to widely disseminate the findings to healthcare professionals through medical journals and conferences and contact other groups representing autistic people.

AB  - Background Environmental noise is a pervasive pollutant that is one of the greatest environmental threats to mental, physiological and psychological well-being and has a significant global health burden associated with it. Many epidemiological studies indicate long-term relationship of noise pollution with wide range of metabolic, cardio-vascular and respiratory disorders and diseases. Objective The goal of this study was to thoroughly analyse available literature on public health implications and various underlying biological mechanisms associated with ambient noise exposure, taking into account both objective and subjective measures of noise exposure. Methods A search of literature for review on environmental noise and associated cardiovascular, mental health and metabolic implications on human health was done using Web of Science, Google Scholar and PubMed databases. Discussion Experimental studies indicate that noise exposure leads to endocrine effects, increased incidence of diabetes, impairment of cognitive performance, sleep disturbance and annoyance. Epidemiological evidence indicates that high levels of noise, particularly at night, may cause arterial hypertension and endothelial dysfunction due to higher level of stress hormones and oxidative stress. An increased incidence of cardio-vascular diseases like myocardial infarction, heart rate, ischemic heart disease, stroke and heart failure is associated with noise-induced mental stress. Furthermore, psychological and mental health issues like anxiety and depression are also related with exposure to noise pollution. Conclusion This article summarises a comprehensive and systematic knowledge established in recent noise research with the spotlight on cardiovascular, metabolic and mental health disorders of environmental noise, providing unique understanding into underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Do mindfulness-based programmes improve the cognitive skills, behaviour and mental health of children and adolescents? An updated meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
KW  - Child & adolescent psychiatry
KW  - DEPRESSION
AB  - Question Mindfulness-based programmes (MBPs) are an increasingly popular approach to improving mental health in young people. Our previous meta-analysis suggested that MBPs show promising effectiveness, but highlighted a lack of high-quality, adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This updated meta-analysis assesses the-state-of the-art of MBPs for young people in light of new studies. It explores MBP's effectiveness in active vs passive controls; selective versus universal interventions; and studies that included follow-up. Study selection and analysis We searched for published and unpublished RCTs of MBPs with young people (<19 years) in PubMed Central, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, EThOS, EBSCO and Google Scholar. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, and standardised mean differences (Cohen's d) were calculated. Findings Sixty-six RCTs, involving 20 138 participants (9552 receiving an MBP and 10 586 controls), were identified. Compared with passive controls, MBPs were effective in improving anxiety/stress, attention, executive functioning, and negative and social behaviour (d from 0.12 to 0.35). Compared against active controls, MBPs were more effective in reducing anxiety/stress and improving mindfulness (d=0.11 and 0.24, respectively). In studies with a follow-up, there were no significant positive effects of MBPs. No consistent pattern favoured MBPs as a universal versus selective intervention. Conclusions The enthusiasm for MBPs in youth has arguably run ahead of the evidence. While MBPs show promising results for some outcomes, in general, the evidence is of low quality and inconclusive. We discuss a conceptual model and the theory-driven innovation required to realise the potential of MBPs in supporting youth mental health.

(2) Methods: Searches were conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, EbscoHost Academic Search Ultimate, and PsycArticles, using a combination of "Covid-19 AND 'Randomized Controlled Trial' AND students", as well as a combination of the following search terms: "internet", "online", "treat_", "psycholog_", "intervention", "program_", "stress_", "depress_", "anxiety", "university", "college", "freshm_", "sophomore_", and "undergraduat_". The population, intervention, control, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) framework was used (P (population): university students during the COVID-19 pandemic; I (intervention): internet-based intervention programs for reducing stress, anxiety, and depression; C (control): no intervention, usual care, or on a waiting list; O (outcomes): stress, anxiety, and depression indicators; S (study design): meta-analysis including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs)). A meta-analysis was performed on the 10 retrieved studies published between 2021 and 2022. Only RCTs were analyzed. (3) Results: All 10 analyzed papers revealed a trend in the effectiveness of internet-based intervention for reducing stress, anxiety, and depression in university students during COVID-19. Significant effects from the included RCTs with interventions for reducing stress and depression were established. (4) Conclusions: Psychological internet-based interventions may help to reduce depression and stress among university students; however, more research is needed to determine their effectiveness in reducing anxiety.

AB  - The present meta-analysis investigated the overall and differential efficacy of digital cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) vs. third-generation CBTs deployed to pregnant women in reducing sub-clinical depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms while fostering sleep quality and quality of life. A PRISMA-guided systematic search was used, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the above-mentioned interventions. Data were pooled using either the mean difference (MD) or standardized MD (SMD). Sub-group analyses were carried out when appropriate. The primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, as well as sleep quality and quality of life. The interventions' acceptability was evaluated through the odds ratio (OR) of drop-out rates. Seven RCTs were included, comprising 1873 pregnant women. The results showed the interventions' efficacy in terms of reducing depression symptoms (SMD = -0.36, CI = 0.61, -0.11, k = 9) at the endpoint, although it was not maintained at follow-up during the postpartum period. The interventions' efficacy in terms of reducing anxiety symptoms (SMD = 1.96, CI = -2.72, -1.21, k = 3) at the endpoint was also significant, while having no effect on sleep quality. The interventions were well accepted (OR = 1.68; 95% CI = 0.84, 3.35; k = 7). Although no sound conclusions can be drawn concerning the joint or differential efficacy of the considered interventions, this study was useful in highlighting the need to develop evidence-based digital prevention programs for pregnant women with sub-clinical symptoms.

AB  - Introduction The negative impacts of mental health disorders on the well-being of women and their infants are clear. However, less is known about the relationship between returning to work after giving birth and mental health. Previous reviews examined the relationship between maternity leave and mental health, but we defined return to work as the process of returning to part-time or full-time work after giving birth and caring for infant. This systematic review aims to: (1) describe operational definitions for return to work and (2) describe the evidence on the relationship between return to work and maternal mental health. Methods We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed studies. Articles were selected if they were published within the past 20 years, examined at least one mental health condition (e.g., depression, anxiety), and included a study sample of U.S. working mothers. Results We identified 20 articles published between 2001 and 2020. We found conflicting evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional data demonstrating that return to work was associated with improvements and negative consequences to mental health. Work-related predictors of mental health included: access to paid maternity leave, work-family conflict, total workload, job flexibility, and coworker support. Discussion This review provides evidence that return to work and mental health are related, though the study samples have limited generalizability to all U.S. working mothers. More research is needed to understand the direction of this relationship throughout the perinatal period and how return to work affects other mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, stress).

AB  - Fibromyalgia is one of the most common causes of widespread chronic pain. It has a huge impact on the quality of life, namely because it appears earlier in life than most of the chronic pain conditions. Furthermore, emotional-cognitive distress factors, such as depression and anxiety, are a common feature in patients with fibromyalgia. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia remain mostly unknown. Among non-pharmacological treatments, cognitive-behavioral therapy has been used during the last decade, namely with the enrolment of patients in programs of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and in mindfulness-based interventions (MBI). We critically analyzed the literature to search for scientific evidence for the use of MBI in fibromyalgia. The studies were evaluated as to several outcomes of fibromyalgia improvement along with aspects of the study design which are currently considered relevant for research in mindfulness. We conclude that despite the sparsity of well-structured longitudinal studies, there are some promising results showing that the MBI are effective in reducing the negative aspects of the disease. Future design of studies using MBI in fibromyalgia management should be critically discussed. The importance of active controls, evaluation of sustained effects along with investigation of the subserving neurobiological mechanisms and detailed reports of possible adverse effects should be considered.

AB  - Background: Youth are increasingly aware of the negative effects of climate change on the planet and human health, but this knowledge can often come with significant affective responses, such as psychological distress, anger, or despair. Experiencing major "negative " emotions, like worry, guilt, and hopelessness in anticipation of climate change has been identified with the term eco-anxiety. Emerging literature focuses on adults' experience; however, little is known about the ways in which children and youth experience eco-anxiety. Objectives: The aim of this review was to: (1) identify the available evidence on the topic of eco-anxiety in children, (2) clarify the mental health consequences brought by the awareness of climate change in this population, and (3) identify knowledge gaps in the literature and considerations for future research. Methods: Given that the research on the topic of eco-anxiety in children is limited, that there are very few randomized controlled trials, and that the goal is not to analyze individual studies in-depth, a scoping review was used. Keywords pertaining to the themes of eco-anxiety, climate change and children (aged < 18 years) were used as search terms in five databases. Journal articles using qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as gray literature were examined by two independent reviewers. A descriptive-analytical method was used to chart the data that emerged from the literature. Eighteen articles were considered in the final analysis. Results: Evidence confirms that children experience affective responses and eco-anxiety in reaction to then awareness of climate change. Mental health outcomes include depression, anxiety, and extreme emotions like sadness, anger, and fear. Youth from vulnerable communities, like indigenous communities, or those who have strong ties to the land are often identified as being emotionally impacted by climate change. The literature analyzed also describes how children and youth are coping with eco-anxiety, including maladaptive (e.g., denial) and adaptive responses (such as constructive hope, used as a positive coping mechanism). Preliminary considerations for parents, teachers and educators, mental health care providers, school systems, adults and people of power include adding age-appropriate climate education to the school curriculum, considering youth's emotions, and promoting healthy coping through empowerment. Important gaps exist in the definition of eco-anxiety in youth, as various characterizations of this emerging concept are found across articles.

AB  - Background Healthcare workers are leading the way in treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the high levels of psychological stress, this group is more likely to experience psychological issues. These psychological problems in healthcare providers include depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to find out how common these problems were in the face of COVID-19. Methods On 20 February 2022, systematic searches were conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, EMBASE, Science Direct, Web of Science and ProQuest databases. Two authors selected articles based on search keywords. As a last step, articles about the prevalence of psychological problems among healthcare workers in the face of COVID-19 were looked at and analysed for five different outcomes. Results The initial search yielded 18,609 articles. After reviewing the titles, abstracts and full texts of the articles, 44 were chosen for the final analysis and 29 were subjected to a meta-analysis. Insomnia, anxiety, depression, PTSD and stress are among the psychological issues faced by healthcare workers. Furthermore, the highest pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD and stress was 36% (95% confidence interval (CI) 24-50%), 47% (95% CI 22-74%), 49% (95% CI 28-70%), 37% (95% CI 19-59%) and 27% (95% CI 6-69%). Conclusions In this meta-analysis, insomnia was found to be the most common mental health problem, followed by anxiety, PTSD, depression and stress in healthcare workers in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, the pooled prevalence of these mental health problems was higher among physicians, nurses and older staff in the subgroup analysis. As a result, health policymakers and managers of the health care system should think about effective interventions to promote mental health, paying particular attention to these two groups.

AB  - This review discussed the effects of the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the psychological wellbeing of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) focusing specifically on depressive symptoms, anxiety levels, sleep, and quality of life (QoL). Together with motor symptoms, psychological symptoms are common and disabling conditions in the clinical course of PD becoming a relevant topic as a result of the lockdown measure due to alter their everyday life. We searched on PubMed online electronic databases for English articles published between January 2020 and 31 December 2021. Twenty-eight relevant studies were found and included in the review. Heterogeneous data emerged from the topics analyzed. Overall, data from depression studies showed significant depressive symptoms if the patient was analyzed longitudinally or vs. a control group consisting in healthy subjects, while these differences become minimal when the control group is a family member. Differently, in most of the studies reviewed there is no evidence of a statistically significant impact on anxiety disorders, nor on the quality of sleep. Conversely, PD patients showed a statistically significant negative impact of QoL compared with control groups or other neurological conditions. Although these findings must be interpreted carefully in the light of the studies' limitations, both in methodology and design, collectively our review showed that COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health of people with PD, due to disruption of healthcare services, loss of usual activities and supports and reduction in physical activity.

AB  - Mental health disorders can be exacerbated during periods of hormonal fluctuation (e.g. pregnancy, menopause), and the risk factors for sensitivity to these fluctuations are similar to those of mental disorders (e.g. trauma). However, the extent to which hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle impact symptoms of preexisting mental disorders remains unclear. Prospective methodology is considered the gold standard for measuring symptoms across the menstrual cycle. Thus, the aim of the review was to address this knowledge gap by summarising all available studies prospectively measuring symptoms of mental disorders across the menstrual cycle. A systematic review with narrative synthesis was conducted; meta-analysis was precluded due to methodological heterogeneity of included studies. Electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PyschINFO and CINAHL were systematically searched from inception. Risk of bias for individual studies was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The search identified 629 studies from which 35 met inclusion criteria. There was clear evidence of symptom exacerbation during the perimenstrual phase for psychotic disorders, panic disorder, eating disorders, depression and borderline personality disorder. Less consistent evidence was found for anxiety, and a different pattern of symptom exacerbation was observed in bipolar disorder. Sample size and methodology varied considerably amongst studies. Overall, there was mixed evidence for perimenstrual exacerbation across mental disorders, which could be partly explained by methodological limitations of the studies. However, hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle may exacerbate psychiatric symptoms in a subgroup of individuals who are hormone sensitive.

AB  - Background Pandemics and natural disasters are immensely stressful events for frontline healthcare workers, as they provide patient care to a population undergoing the impacts of the disaster while experiencing such impacts to their personal lives themselves. With increased stressors to an already demanding job, frontline healthcare workers are at a higher risk of adverse effects to their mental health. The current COVID-19 pandemic has already shown to have had significant impact on the mental health of healthcare workers with increased rates of burnout, anxiety and depression. There is already literature showing the utility of individual programs at improving mental health, however, interventions at the organizational level are not well explored. This scoping review aims to provide an overview and determine the utility of a systematic review of the current body of literature assessing the effectiveness of mental health interventions at the organizational level for healthcare workers during or after a public health emergency. Methods Electronic databases such as Medline on OVID, CENTRAL, PsycINFO on OVID and Embase on OVID were searched. A targeted search of the grey literature was conducted to identify any non-indexed studies. The population, concept and context approach was used to develop the eligibility criteria. Articles were included if (1) they assessed the impact of interventions to improve wellbeing or reduce the distress on healthcare personnel, first responders or military actively providing medical care; (2) provided quantitative or qualitative data with clearly defined outcomes that focused on established mental health indicators or qualitative descriptions on distress and wellbeing, validated scales and workplace indicators; (3) focused on organizational level interventions that occurred in a public health crisis. Results The literature search resulted in 4007 citations and 115 potentially relevant full-text papers. All except 5 were excluded. There were four review articles and one experimental study. There were no other unpublished reports that warranted inclusion. Conclusions There is a distinct lack of research examining organizational interventions addressing mental resilience and well-being in healthcare workers in disaster settings. A systematic review in this area would be low yield. There is a clear need for further research in this area.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the existing evidence on the mental health outcomes of adult irregular immigrants (IMs) to Europe. Database (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO) searches were conducted according to PRISMA. The risk of bias was assessed using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. The database searches yielded 2982 results. Eight cross-sectional studies from Western Europe were included, with 1201 participants. The prevalence of mental disorders varied between studies: depression from 8 to 86%; anxiety from 3.1 to 81%; and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from 3.4 to 57.6%. The studies had methodological flaws; in particular a risk of unrepresentative samples. There was methodological heterogeneity, therefore pooling of data, and direct comparisons were not possible. The majority of studies found higher rates of depression, anxiety and PTSD than previous estimates for the general population, and higher rates of depression and anxiety than previous estimates for other migrant groups.

AB  - Background: Reiki is an energy healing technique or biofield therapy in which an attuned therapist places their hands on or near the client's body and sends energy to the client to activate the body's ability to heal itself and restore balance. It was developed in Japan at the end of the 19th century by Mikao Usui of Kyoto. Given the enormous international socioeconomic burden of mental health, inexpensive, safe, and evidenced-based treatments would be welcomed. Reiki is safe, inexpensive, and preliminary research suggests it may assist in treating a wide variety of illnesses. Given that Reiki is a biofield therapy, growing in use, and not yet accepted by the dominant biomedical paradigm, it is important to establish its effectiveness over placebo. This study aimed to examine Reiki's effectiveness over placebo in treating symptoms of mental health and to explore parameters for its effectiveness. Method: A systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials (RPCTs) examining Reiki's effectiveness in treating symptoms of mental health in adults was conducted through a systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and ProQuest. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's Revised ROB 2 assessment tool. This was followed by a grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE) assessment. Results: The evidence to date suggests that Reiki consistently demonstrates a greater therapeutic effect over placebo for some symptoms of mental health. The GRADE level of evidence is high for clinically relevant levels of stress and depression, moderate to high for clinically relevant levels of anxiety, low to moderate for normal levels of stress, and low to moderate for burnout, and low for normal levels of depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The results suggest that, Reiki may be more effective in treating some areas of mental health, than placebo, particularly if symptoms are clinically relevant. To date, there are a small number of studies in each area, therefore findings are inconclusive and, more RCTs controlling for placebo in Reiki research are needed. Most included studies were also assessed as having a risk of bias of some concern. Incorporating Reiki as a complementary treatment to mainstream psychotherapy for depression, stress, and anxiety may be appropriate.

AB  - Chronic exposure to stressors and potentially psychologically traumatic events contributes to the high prevalence of mental health disorders in correctional workers (CWs) and other public safety personnel (PSP). Digital mental health interventions are an accessible and scalable method of improving and maintaining the mental health of this population. The current review explores the benefits of digital mental health interventions for PSP-with a focus on CWs-and how these innovations can address the limitations in in-person mental health care. A systematic literature search of five databases (Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar) was conducted until March 2022. The search yielded 16 publications that focused on digital mental health interventions or care available to CWs and other PSP. The benefits of digital innovations were summarized into five categories which discussed (1) their ability to enhance accessibility and reduce stigma; (2) the provision of evidence-based and structured psychotherapy programs; (3) variability in the degree of therapist engagement; (4) the integration of proactive interventions; and (5) enhancing engagement by acknowledging unique experiences and interpersonal relationships. Although digital mental health technologies for CWs are still in their infancy, there is strong evidence to support their effectiveness in ameliorating symptoms of mental distress. Future research should consider how ethnicity, gender, culture, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status can be integrated into these therapies and how the interplay between different stakeholders and organizations can impact the effectiveness of online therapies and programs.

Methods This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021251666). We conducted our search in the following four databases: Medline (PubMed and OVID), EMBASE, PsycInfo and Web of Science. The last search was performed on the 17th of March of 2021. Quantitative studies that focused on carers aged 25 years or less and compared the mental health status of carers and non-carers were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and performed the quality assessment using the Risk of Bias tool in Non-Randomised Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E). Results We identified a total of ten eligible articles. Mental health outcomes included depression, anxiety and other mental or emotional problems. Nine out of the ten studies showed that being a young carer was consistently associated with poor mental health. However, the overall quality of evidence was low, and longitudinal data were limited to three articles. The primary sources of bias were confounding and outcome measurement. Conclusion Young carers experience poorer mental health outcomes than their non-caring peers. However, we identified an overall lack of quantitative evidence of high methodological rigour. To establish if young caring leads to poor mental health, future research should focus on addressing the identified methodological limitations and understanding the mechanisms explaining these associations. Addressing these gaps can better inform the allocation of appropriate support and resources to optimise the mental health of young carers.

AB  - Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic raised significant concerns related to the management of care for people with dementia, but few studies have examined the mental health of older adults with dementia and their caregivers during the pandemic, when compared to other populations. This systematic review thus aims to compare and discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with dementia and on their caregivers' mental health. Methods: A search was performed in the PubMed/Medline and ISI databases according to the PRISMA methodology. We included studies published in 2020 and 2021 with the following combinations of keywords: "COVID-19 and mental health and elderly, " "COVID-19 and mental health and dementia; " "COVID-19 and dementia and caregivers, " "pandemic and mental health and elderly, " and "pandemic and anxiety. " Results: Twenty-two studies were included. Technology has proven to be an essential ally during the pandemic, since all 22 studies performed remote data collection. Nearly all the studies emphasized that social isolation and withdrawal can lead to the emergence or increase of neuropsychiatric symptoms and motor difficulties. However, the findings were mixed concerning the pandemic's impact on the cognition of people with dementia. Caregivers also suffered from the pandemic's impact, experiencing an increase in the burden of care and symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Few studies suggested measures to alleviate the difficulties of people with dementia and their caregivers. There are reports of the benefits of technology in communication and treatment through teleconsultations, however, not everyone has access to such technology, making it difficult to disseminate this tool to the target population. Conclusions: The studies generally showed that social isolation can increase motor deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregivers' burden and anxiety. New avenues for care and intervention are thus needed for older adults with cognitive deficits and their caregivers to avoid the intensification of physical and psychological suffering. Technological initiatives and support should consider people with cognitive impairment and different levels of technology literacy.Systematic Review Registration.

AB  - Organizational justice refers to employees' perceptions of the fairness of decision-making rules and policies in the workplace. Lack of justice is suggested to be a significant psychosocial risk factor that affects employees' attitudes and health. The aim of this narrative review was to compile the evidence available about the effects of organizational justice on health. To this end, a literature search was carried out using the Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases. The final sample consisted of 103 articles that studied the effects of justice on mental health (40 results), job stress (26), sickness absence (15), physical health (14), absenteeism/presenteeism (3), safety at work (3), and health of third parties (2). The results show that perceptions of workplace justice predict employees' mental health, stress-related health problems, and lower levels of sickness absence were relatively compelling. Future studies should focus on less-researched outcomes and on how these associations are modified by other variables for a better understanding of how justice affects health, with a view to being able to carry out preventive measures more efficiently.

Methods: A systematic search using 5 English (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, EBSCO, and the Cochrane Library) and 4 Chinese (CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and CBM) databases were initiated to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effect of traditional Chinese fitness exercises on negative emotions and sleep disorders among college students. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to determine the pooled effect of the intervention. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality and the data were analyzed with Review Manager 5.4. Results: A total of 12 RCTs were included, including 1,052 subjects. The results showed a potential beneficial effect of traditional Chinese fitness exercises on reducing depression [SMD = -0.93, 95 %CI (-1.76, -0. 10)], anxiety [SMD = -0.74, 95%CI (-0.93, -0.54)], and the sleep disorders [SMD = -2.77, 95%CI (-4.57, -0.97)] symptoms, and these effects were better than in the control group. Conclusion: The findings of this review suggested the traditional Chinese fitness exercises could improve both the negative moods and sleep disorders compared with that of healthy students, the effect on college students with mild to moderate psychological symptoms was obviously improved. The SCL-90 scale is better than the SDS scale in evaluating the improvement effect of traditional Chinese fitness exercises on depression. It was the best intervention program on negative emotions and sleep disorders among college students, with the intervention lasting 5 sessions per week for 30-60 min/session for over 12 weeks.

AB  - Background: Pathological anxiety is responsible for major functional impairments and resistance to conventional treatments in anxiety disorders (ADs), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Focal neuromodulation therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are being developed to treat those disorders. Methods: We performed a dimensional systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of the efficacy of TMS, tDCS and DBS in reducing anxiety symptoms across ADs, PTSD and MDD. Reports were identified through systematic searches in PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Cochrane library (inception to November 2020), followed by review according to the PRISMA guidelines. Controlled clinical trials examining the effectiveness of brain stimulation techniques on generic anxiety symptoms in patients with ADs, PTSD or MDD were selected. Results: Nineteen studies (RCTs) met inclusion criteria, which included 589 participants. Overall, focal brain activity modulation interventions were associated with greater reduction of anxiety levels than controls [SMD: -0.56 (95% CI, -0.93 to-0.20, I-2 = 77%]. Subgroup analyses revealed positive effects for TMS across disorders, and of focal neuromodulation in generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD. Rates of clinical responses and remission were higher in the active conditions. However, the risk of bias was high in most studies. Conclusions: There is moderate quality evidence for the efficacy of neuromodulation in treating pathological anxiety.

AB  - Emotional disorders are the most common mental disorders globally. Psychological treatments have been found to be useful for a significant number of cases, but up to 40% of patients do not respond to psychotherapy as expected. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods might enhance psychotherapy by providing therapists and patients with real- or close to real-time recommendations according to the patient's response to treatment. The goal of this investigation is to systematically review the evidence on the use of AI-based methods to enhance outcomes in psychological interventions in real-time or close to real-time. The search included studies indexed in the electronic databases Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The terms used for the electronic search included variations of the words "psychotherapy", "artificial intelligence", and "emotional disorders". From the 85 full texts assessed, only 10 studies met our eligibility criteria. In these, the most frequently used AI technique was conversational AI agents, which are chatbots based on software that can be accessed online with a computer or a smartphone. Overall, the reviewed investigations indicated significant positive consequences of using AI to enhance psychotherapy and reduce clinical symptomatology. Additionally, most studies reported high satisfaction, engagement, and retention rates when implementing AI to enhance psychotherapy in real- or close to real-time. Despite the potential of AI to make interventions more flexible and tailored to patients' needs, more methodologically robust studies are needed.

AB  - As a result of their children's cancer, parents are at risk of experiencing psychological distress. Parental stress will affect their roles in providing emotional support for their children. This systematic review aimed to identify the psychological distress of parents having children with cancer. EBSCO, PubMed, Science Direct, and Research Gate were applied to conduct electronic searches. The terms "parents," "children," "cancer," and "psychological distress" were combined using the Boolean expressions "OR" and "AND." The inclusion criteria were non-experimental studies published in English within the last 10 years (2010-2020). Risk of bias assessment was conducted for each included study using the Joanna Bridge Institute critical appraisal tools to build transparency of findings. A total of 12 articles were included in the study to determine the prevalence of psychological distress among parents and the symptoms and factors that influence it. The high category of parental distress reached 17.6%, while the very high category reached 5.8%. Thus, it needed more concern. Suicidal ideation, insomnia, and poor health were all connected to psychological distress, with the age of children and parents, the number of children, occupation, education level, depressive history, and time of diagnosis all being predictive factors.

AB  - Background: The fast spread of COVID-19 can cause some psychological disorders for men. One of the psychological disorders is paternal postpartum depression (PPD). The aim of the present research was to review studies that have investigated paternal postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: For this narrative review, databases such as Google Scholar, Scientific Information Databases (SID), Magiran, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for the full texts of published studies in the Persian and English languages in the period of 2019 to 2021. Finally, 3 articles were selected and reviewed in this study. Results: The results of this review study were classified into 3 main categories such as (1) The psychological status of men during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) The effect of paternal PPD on children's development and family psychological status during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) The role of healthcare providers in the management of paternal PPD. The findings of the studies showed that paternal PPD increases the rate of child maltreatment, maternal depression, and domestic violence. The promotion of the interpersonal skills of healthcare providers with fathers suffering from depression or psychological problems is the determinant factor of successful results. Conclusions: The results showed that paternal PPD has a wide range of consequences in this pandemic. Therefore, it would be recommended that healthcare staff have close contact with families and screen fathers for paternal PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to exacerbate mental health problems during the prenatal period and increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes. This review assessed the published literature related to the impacts of prenatal mental health issues on birth outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This scoping review was conducted using PROSPERO, Cochrane Library, OVID Medline, Ovid EMBASE, OVID PsycInfo, EBSCO CINAHL, and SCOPUS. The search was conducted using controlled vocabulary and keywords representing the concepts "COVID19", "mental health" and "birth outcomes". The main inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed published articles from late 2019 to the end of July 2021. Results and Discussion: After removing duplicates, 642 articles were identified, of which two full texts were included for analysis. Both articles highlighted that pregnant women have experienced increasing prenatal mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic and, further, increased the risk of developing adverse births. This scoping review highlighted that there is a lack of research on the impact of prenatal mental health issues on birth outcomes during the pandemic. Conclusion: Given the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the burdens of prenatal mental health issues and adverse birth outcomes, there is an urgent need to conduct further research.

AB  - Objective: Men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV are more likely to suffer from mental health problems. They should be given adequate attention to treat and improve their mental health disorders. This meta-analysis aimed to assess whether psychosocial interventions reliably improve psychological well-being among MSM living with HIV.
   Method: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched for psychosocial intervention randomized controlled trials evaluating mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety, self-efficacy). The effect size was pooled using the random-effects model, and continuous outcomes were reported using standardized mean difference (SMD) values .
   Results: A total of 12 studies including 1782 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Psychosocial interventions in contrast to control groups significantly reduced depression (SMD, - 0.28; 95% CI - 0.52 - - 0.03) at the follow-up assessment and improved quality of life (SMD 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.63) after treatment. Psychosocial interventions also had a significant effect on measures of self-efficacy (SMD 2.22, 95% CI 0.24-4.20), and this effect was sustained until long-term follow-up (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.02-1.08). Subgroup analyses revealed that improvements in depression were more significant when participants possessed higher education and treatment providers used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
   Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that psychosocial interventions benefit the mental health of MSM living with HIV. It is necessary to conduct more research to explore characteristics that may affect treatment outcomes in the future.

AB  - Background Adolescent depression and anxiety are among the leading contributors to health burden worldwide. 'Relaxation Techniques (RTs)' are a "set of strategies to improve physiological response to stress" and are frequently cited as an active ingredient of trans-diagnostic, psychosocial interventions for scaling-up care for preventing and treating these conditions in adolescents. However, there is a little evidence on the effectiveness of 'relaxation techniques' for this age group. Aim As a part of the Wellcome Trust's Active Ingredients commission, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of RTs to reduce the symptoms of distress, anxiety and depression in young people, aged 14 to 24 years old, globally. Methods We searched 10 academic databases to include 65 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of relaxation-based interventions for young people with the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Primary outcomes were reduction in symptoms of distress, anxiety and/or depression. We employed the Cochrane risk of bias tool and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) guidelines to assess certainty of outcomes pertaining to anxiety, depression and distress. Standardized mean difference was estimated using effect size. Results The analysis of 65 RCTs with 8009 young people showed that RTs were highly effective in treating anxiety (pooled effect size of (Standardized Mean Difference-SMD) - 0.54 (95% CI - 0.69 to - 0.40); moderately effective in reducing distress (SMD = - 0.48, 95% CI - 0.71 to - 0.24) and had only a weak effect on improving depression in young people (SMD = - 0.28 (95% CI - 0.40% to - 0.15). Face-to-face delivered relaxation techniques yielded higher effect size (SMD = - 0.47, 95% CI - 0.64 to - 0.30) compared to online delivery (SMD = - 0.22, 95% CI - 0.48 to 0.04) for anxiety. Conclusion Most of the included studies were from High Income Countries (HICs) and had a high risk of bias. Further high-quality studies with low risk of bias, especially from low resource settings are needed to evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of RTs as an active ingredient of psychological interventions to reduce the symptoms of distress, anxiety and depression in young people.

AB  - BackgroundWhile mental health problems constitute a worldwide concern contributing to the global rates of morbidity and mortality, conventional mental healthcare services do not meet the current needs. Text messages (TM) represent a live model that incorporates technology into health services, spanning a large number of health conditions and playing different roles that may support the current healthcare system. ObjectiveTo examine the TM services in the field of mental health, regarding their effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and economic evaluation in different contexts of mental health diagnoses and during critical times, when provided to individuals with mental health symptoms/disorders. MethodsThis rapid review was conducted through an online search in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Medline databases. The review targeted the review studies which examined online or mobile addiction and mental health services, utilizing TM services. The search was run from the inception up to September 30, 2021. ResultsSixty review articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All reviews were published over the last decade. The results showed that people of a young age were fairly represented, and most reviews were run over substance use disorders (SUD), including Alcohol. Most reviews examined the effectiveness outcomes of the texting service, while to a lesser extent the acceptability and feasibility, among others. Texting services were reported as effective in psychotic disorders and SUD. However, the results related to depression and anxiety were mixed. Most reviews reported a considerably high risk of bias among their included studies. High satisfaction and acceptability of the texting services were reported for patients with various mental health conditions, including those with severe mental illness. ConclusionsThis rapid review highlighted the applications, usability, benefits, and satisfaction with the TM in the field of mental health. For a higher quality of evidence, future studies should consider TM interventions in the contexts with mixed results or a dearth of literature, and during critical times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Policy- and decision-makers, therefore, need to further support text-based services with guided investments in interventions that were evidenced to be accepted, economic and feasible.

AB  - Animal models are essential for the discovery of mechanisms and treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, complex mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety are difficult to fully recapitulate in these models. Borrowing from the field of psychiatric genetics, we reiterate the framework of 'endophenotypes' - biological or behavioral markers with cellular, molecular or genetic underpinnings - to reduce complex disorders into measurable behaviors that can be compared across organisms. Zebrafish are popular disease models due to the conserved genetic, physiological and anatomical pathways between zebrafish and humans. Adult zebrafish, which display more sophisticated behaviors and cognition, have long been used to model psychiatric disorders. However, larvae (up to 1 month old) are more numerous and also optically transparent, and hence are particularly suited for high-throughput screening and brain-wide neural circuit imaging. A number of behavioral assays have been developed to quantify neuropsychiatric phenomena in larval zebrafish. Here, we will review these assays and the current knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms of their behavioral readouts. We will also discuss the existing evidence linking larval zebrafish behavior to specific human behavioral traits and how the endophenotype framework can be applied. Importantly, many of the endophenotypes we review do not solely define a diseased state but could manifest as a spectrum across the general population. As such, we make the case for larval zebrafish as a promising model for extending our understanding of population mental health, and for identifying novel therapeutics and interventions with broad impact.

AB  - According to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of "substance", and they cannot have causal interactions. However, in neuroscience, the two-way interaction between the brain and peripheral organs is an emerging field of research. Several lines of evidence highlight the importance of such interactions. For example, the peripheral metabolic systems are overwhelmingly regulated by the mind (brain), and anxiety and depression greatly affect the functioning of these systems. Also, psychological stress can cause a variety of physical symptoms, such as bone loss. Moreover, the gut microbiota appears to play a key role in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Mechanistically, as the command center of the body, the brain can regulate our internal organs and glands through the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine system, although it is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control. The autonomic nervous system itself can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The sympathetic division functions a bit like the accelerator pedal on a car, and the parasympathetic division functions as the brake. The high center of the autonomic nervous system and the neuroendocrine system is the hypothalamus, which contains several subnuclei that control several basic physiological functions, such as the digestion of food and regulation of body temperature. Also, numerous peripheral signals contribute to the regulation of brain functions. Gastrointestinal (GI) hormones, insulin, and leptin are transported into the brain, where they regulate innate behaviors such as feeding, and they are also involved in emotional and cognitive functions. The brain can recognize peripheral inflammatory cytokines and induce a transient syndrome called sick behavior (SB), characterized by fatigue, reduced physical and social activity, and cognitive impairment. In summary, knowledge of the biological basis of the interactions between the central nervous system and peripheral organs will promote the full understanding of how our body works and the rational treatment of disorders. Thus, we summarize current development in our understanding of five types of central-peripheral interactions, including neural control of adipose tissues, energy expenditure, bone metabolism, feeding involving the brain-gut axis and gut microbiota. These interactions are essential for maintaining vital bodily functions, which result in homeostasis, i.e., a natural balance in the body's systems.

AB  - Background Informal primary caregivers provide crucial supports to loved ones experiencing serious mental illnesses with profound outcomes for the caregivers themselves. A comprehensive understanding of how different serious mental illnesses change the caregiving experience may provide important insight into the ways in which caregivers can be better supported in their role. The aim of this review was to synthesize the comparative literature examining caregiver burden and psychological functioning (anxiety, depression, distress, and psychological wellbeing) between caregivers of people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder. Methods Studies were included if they compared caregivers across both diagnostic groups and used measures assessing either caregiver burden or psychological functioning of caregivers. Databases searched up until 11th of January 2022 included: Medline COMPLETE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL. Reference list scans and grey literature searches across government, organisational and dissertation databases were also conducted. Results Twenty-eight studies comprising 6166 caregivers were included. Fourteen studies suggested that caregiving burden was comparable across both groups. The effects of caring on caregiver mental health and stress were comparable across both groups. However, methodological limitations were noted, including a reliance on cross-sectional studies, multiple and sometimes competing definitions of caregiving burden, variable sample sizes, and variation in measures used. Conclusion and implications The experience of providing care is multidimensional and complex. Symptoms and functional difficulties experienced by people being cared for may affect caregivers more so than diagnosis. Caregivers play a vital role in helping people with serious mental illness. Supporting caregivers by reducing their burden and improving their psychological functioning may help them to continue to provide support, and cope with, the challenges of providing care.

AB  - Background Given the increasing acceptability and legalization of cannabis in some jurisdictions, clinicians need to improve their understanding of the effect of cannabis use on mood disorders. Objective The purpose of this task force report is to examine the association between cannabis use and incidence, presentation, course and treatment of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, and the treatment of comorbid cannabis use disorder. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, searching PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to October 2020 focusing on cannabis use and bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, and treatment of comorbid cannabis use disorder. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the quality of evidence and clinical considerations were integrated to generate Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments recommendations. Results Of 12,691 publications, 56 met the criteria: 23 on bipolar disorder, 21 on major depressive disorder, 11 on both diagnoses and 1 on treatment of comorbid cannabis use disorder and major depressive disorder. Of 2,479,640 participants, 12,502 were comparison participants, 73,891 had bipolar disorder and 408,223 major depressive disorder without cannabis use. Of those with cannabis use, 2,761 had bipolar disorder and 5,044 major depressive disorder. The lifetime prevalence of cannabis use was 52%-71% and 6%-50% in bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, respectively. Cannabis use was associated with worsening course and symptoms of both mood disorders, with more consistent associations in bipolar disorder than major depressive disorder: increased severity of depressive, manic and psychotic symptoms in bipolar disorder and depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder. Cannabis use was associated with increased suicidality and decreased functioning in both bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Treatment of comorbid cannabis use disorder and major depressive disorder did not show significant results. Conclusion The data indicate that cannabis use is associated with worsened course and functioning of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Future studies should include more accurate determinations of type, amount and frequency of cannabis use and select comparison groups which allow to control for underlying common factors.

AB  - Depression is the major cause of disability globally. Apart from lowered mood and accompanying symptoms, it leads to cognitive impairment that altogether predicts disadvantaged social functioning. Reduced cognitive function in depression appears a bit neglected in the field of clinical and molecular psychiatry, while it is estimated to occur in two-thirds of depressed patients and persist in at least one third of remitted patients. This problem, therefore, requires elucidation at the biomolecular and system levels and calls for improvement in therapeutic approach. In this review study, we address the above-mentioned issues by discussing putative mechanisms of cognitive decline in depression: (1) increased oxidative stress and (2) inflammation, (3) disturbed hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenals axis, and (4) reduced monoamines functionality. Moreover, we acknowledge additional underpinnings of cognitive impairment in depressed elderly: (5) vascular-originated brain ischemia and (6) amyloid-beta plaque accumulation. Additionally, by reviewing molecular, pre-clinical and clinical evidence, we propose gut microbiota-targeted strategies as potential adjuvant therapeutics. The study provides a consolidated source of knowledge regarding mechanisms of cognitive impairment in depression and may path the way toward improved treatment options.

AB  - Background: Although anxiety is highly represented in the medically ill and its occurrence has relevant clinical implications, it often remains undetected and not properly treated. This systematic review aimed to report on anxiety, either symptom or disorder, in patients who suffer from a medical illness. Methods: English-language papers reporting on anxiety in medically ill adults were evaluated. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from inception to June 2021. Search term was "anxiety " combined using the Boolean "AND " operator with "medically ill/chronic illness/illness/disorder/disease. " Risk of bias was assessed via the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools-Checklist for Prevalence Studies. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Results: Of 100,848 citations reviewed, 329 studies met inclusion criteria. Moderate or severe anxious symptoms were common among patients with cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, endocrine, musculoskeletal system or connective tissue, dermatological diseases, cancer, AIDS and COVID-19 infections. The most common anxiety disorder was generalized anxiety disorder, observed among patients with cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous system, dermatologic diseases, cancer, primary aldosteronism, amenorrhea, and COVID-19 infection. Panic disorder was described for cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatology diseases. Social anxiety was found for cardiovascular, respiratory, rheumatoid diseases. Specific phobias were relatively common in irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, end-stage renal disease. Conclusion: Anxiety is a major challenge in medical settings. Recognition and proper assessment of anxiety in patients who suffer from a medical illness is necessary for an appropriate management. Future reviews are warranted in order also to clarify the causal and temporal relationship between anxiety and organic illness.

AB  - Background Terrorist attacks have strong psychological effects on rescue workers, and there is a demand for effective and targeted interventions. Aims The present systematic review aims to examine the mental health outcomes of exposed emergency service personnel over time, and to identify risk and resilience factors. Method A literature search was carried out on PubMed and PubPsych until 27 August 2021. Only studies with a real reported incident were included. The evaluation of the study quality was based on the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies, and the synthesis used the 'Guidance on the Conduct of Narrative Synthesis in Systematic Reviews'. Results Thirty-three articles including 159 621 individuals were identified, relating to five different incidents with a post-event time frame ranging from 2 weeks to 13 years. The post-traumatic stress disorder prevalence rates were between 1.3 and 16.5%, major depression rates were between 1.3 and 25.8%, and rates for specific anxiety disorders were between 0.7 and 14%. The highest prevalence rates were found after the World Trade Center attacks. Reported risk factors were gender, no emergency service training, peritraumatic dissociation, spatial proximity to the event and social isolation. Conclusions The inconsistency of the prevalence rates may be attributable to the different severities of the incidents. Identified risk factors could be used to optimise training for emergency personnel before and after catastrophic events. Voluntary repetitive screening of rescue workers for mental health symptoms is recommended.

AB  - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection adds a significant burden to women in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), often leading to severe detrimental impact, not only on themselves, but also on their families and communities. Given that more than half of all people living with HIV globally are females (53%), this review seeks to understand the psychological and social impact of HIV infection on Women Living with HIV (WLHIV) and their families in LMICs in Asia, and the interrelationships between one impact and another. A systematic review was conducted to find literature using the following databases: Medline, PsycINFO, CINAL, Emcare, Scopus and ProQuest. Research articles included in this review were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: conducted in LMICs in Asia, published in English language between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2021, had full text available, involved WLHIV (married and unmarried) and explored the psychological and social impacts of HIV on these women and their families. Critical appraisal tools developed by Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) were used to assess the methodological quality of the studies, and thematic narrative synthesis was used to analyse the findings. A total of 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. The review showed that HIV has a range of negative psychological consequences on WLHIV, such as stress, fear, worry, anxiety and depression, as well as social impacts on the women and their families, including stigma, discrimination and family separation. The findings indicate the need for targeted interventions-specific to WLHIV-that address the psychological challenges, stigma and discrimination these women and their families face. These interventions should also incorporate education and sustainable support structures for WLHIV and their families.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on mental health in the general population, but no systematic synthesis of evidence of this effect has been undertaken for the Mexican population. Relevant studies were identified through the systematic search in five databases until December, 2021. The selection of studies and the evaluation of their methodological quality were performed in pairs. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for study quality appraisal. The protocol of this systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (protocol ID: CRD42021278868). This review included 15 studies, which ranged from 252 to 9361 participants, with a total of 26,799 participants. The findings show that COVID-19 has an impact on the Mexican population's mental health and is particularly associated with anxiety, depression, stress and distress. Females and younger age are risk factors for development mental health symptoms. Mitigating the negative effects of COVID-19 on mental health should be a public health priority in Mexico.

AB  - The outbreak and spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 2019 was a public health emergency of global concern. As an important health behavior, physical activity (PA) and its impact on mental health have been increasingly explored during the epidemic period. The keywords and references were searched on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and CNKI since the inception of an electronic bibliographic database until October 2021. A total of 2979 articles were identified, of which 23 were eligible for inclusion to examine the relationship between PA and mental health during the COVID-19 epidemic. Residents with regular PA, high-intensity PA, and PA duration of 30-60 min or more per day were associated with a lower risk of anxiety, depression, and negative emotions. In contrast, residents with no exercise and physical inactivity were more likely to have anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and lower subjective well-being. In addition, the dose-response curve between PA and negative emotions indicated a U-shaped relationship, and there were urban-rural differences in the relationship between emotional status and the levels of PA in adolescents. The findings have significant implications for addressing mental health issues during the current pandemic and future pandemics. Future studies adopting an experimental study design, conducting objective PA measures, and focusing on the vulnerable subpopulations are warranted to further explore the association of PA on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) infection interferes with the health-related quality of life (HRQOL), including physical, social, mental, emotional and financial domains of individuals. The goal of this scoping review is to outline the most frequent mental issues encountered by TB patients and evaluate the effects of mental health on TB treatment outcomes. Our findings identify research gaps that could help bridge the overall treatment outcomes in the near future. Method: A systematic stepwise approach was adopted to search online resource databases like PubMed, Web of science, and gray literature to retrieve published scientific articles for the review. Titles and abstracts of selected studies were examined for their possible eligibility. The studies matching our eligibility criteria were taken into account for this scoping review. Results: One hundred and ninety three articles were retrieved out of which 26 met the final inclusion criteria. We found that studies adopting interventional approaches reported good mental wellbeing outcomes and better medical compliance as compared with studies that just investigated the subjects. The data represented 15 countries including three low-income countries (LICs), four low-middle-income-countries (LMICs), seven upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), and one high-income country (HIC). Conclusion: Depression, anxiety, and poor social support, and stigma affect the wellbeing of individuals across the globe irrespective of age, race, demographic characteristics, geographical location, and social status.

AB  - During the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, playing video games has been much more than just a pastime. Studies suggested that video games for many individuals have helped to cope with such difficult life experience. However, other research indicates that gaming may have had harmful effects. Within this context, this systematic review aimed to describe the literature on the effects of video games during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis on stress, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and gaming disorder (GD), examining the study characteristics and outcomes. A systematic search of the literature was made following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. It was preregistered in the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (INPLASY)-INPLASY202180053. The search databases were PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Medline. The search string was: [("video game*") OR ("computer game*") OR ("gaming")] AND [("COVID-19")]. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Four research explored the effects of playing video games during the COVID-19 pandemic on stress, anxiety, and depression. Four studies investigated loneliness, while 18 research investigated game disorder. Video games, especially augmented reality and online multiplayer ones, mitigated stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness among adolescents and young adults during stay-at-home restrictions. However, in the case of at-risk individuals (i.e., particularly male youths), playing video games had detrimental effects.

AB  - Contemporarily, depression has become a common psychiatric disorder that influences people's life quality and mental state. This study presents a systematic review analysis of depression based on a hierarchical structure approach. This research provides a rich theoretical foundation for understanding the hot spots, evolutionary trends, and future related research directions and offers further guidance for practice. This investigation contributes to knowledge by combining robust methodological software for analysis, including Citespace, Ucinet, and Pajek. This paper employed the bibliometric methodology to analyze 5,000 research articles concerning depression. This current research also employed the BibExcel software to bibliometrically measure the keywords of the selected articles and further conducted a co-word matrix analysis. Additionally, Pajek software was used to conduct a co-word network analysis to obtain a co-word network diagram of depression. Further, Ucinet software was utilized to calculate K-core values, degree centrality, and mediated centrality to better present the research hotspots, sort out the current status and reveal the research characteristics in the field of depression with valuable information and support for subsequent research. This research indicates that major depressive disorder, anxiety, and mental health had a high occurrence among adolescents and the aged. This present study provides policy recommendations for the government, non-governmental organizations and other philanthropic agencies to help furnish resources for treating and controlling depression orders.

AB  - COVID-19 has imposed a very substantial direct threat to the physical health of those infected, although the corollary impact on mental health may be even more burdensome. Here we focus on assessing the mental health impact of COVID-19 and of other epidemics in the community. We searched five electronic databases until December 9, 2020, for all peer-reviewed original studies reporting any prevalence or correlates of mental disorders in the general population following novel epidemics in English, Chinese or Portuguese. We synthesised prevalence estimates from probability samples during COVID-19 and past epidemics. The meta-analytical effect size was the prevalence of relevant outcomes, estimated via random-effects model. I-2 statistics, Doi plots and the LFK index were used to examine heterogeneity and publication bias. This study is pre-registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020179105. We identified 255 eligible studies from 50 countries on: COVID-19 (n = 247 studies), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; n = 5), Ebola virus disease (n = 2), and 1918 influenza (n = 1). During COVID-19, we estimated the point prevalence for probable anxiety (20.7%, 95% CI 12.9-29.7), probable depression (18.1%, 13.0-23.9), and psychological distress (13.0%, 0-34.1). Correlates for poorer mental health include female sex, lower income, pre-existing medical conditions, perceived risk of infection, exhibiting COVID-19-like symptoms, social media use, financial stress, and loneliness. Public trust in authorities, availability of accurate information, adoption of preventive measures and social support were associated with less morbidity. The mental health consequences of COVID-19 and other epidemics could be comparable to major disasters and armed conflicts. The considerable heterogeneity in our analysis indicates that more random samples are needed. Health-care professionals should be vigilant of the psychological toll of epidemics, including among those who have not been infected.

Design/methodology/approach A systematic search was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Academic education and health databases including ERIC, Education Database, APA PsycInfo, APA PsycArticles, Psychology Database, and PubMed were used. Characteristics and outcomes of educational interventions developed in school settings and education potential for mental health promotion were examined. Findings Universal school-based mental health educational programs positively affect preadolescents and adolescents. The study review provided further insight into educational programs' characteristics and identified two primary curricula foci: mental health education and development of resiliency traits and skills. Originality/value Research on mental health promotion using a pedagogical approach is rare as most studies focus on mental health symptomatology and psychotherapy techniques training.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted mental health care delivery to digital platforms, videoconferencing, and other mobile communications. However, existing reviews of digital health interventions are narrow in scope and focus on a limited number of mental health conditions.
   Objective: To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive systematic meta-review of the literature to assess the state of digital health interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE for secondary literature published between 2010 and 2021 on the use, efficacy, and appropriateness of digital health interventions for the delivery of mental health care.
   Results: Of the 3022 records identified, 466 proceeded to full-text review and 304 met the criteria for inclusion in this study. A majority (52%) of research involved the treatment of substance use disorders, 29% focused on mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders, and >5% for each remaining mental health conditions. Synchronous and asynchronous communication, computerized therapy, and cognitive training appear to be effective but require further examination in understudied mental health conditions. Similarly, virtual reality, mobile apps, social media platforms, and web-based forums are novel technologies that have the potential to improve mental health but require higher quality evidence.
   Conclusions: Digital health interventions offer promise in the treatment of mental health conditions. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health interventions provide a safer alternative to face-to-face treatment. However, further research on the applications of digital interventions in understudied mental health conditions is needed. Additionally, evidence is needed on the effectiveness and appropriateness of digital health tools for patients who are marginalized and may lack access to digital health interventions.

AB  - Background: Web-based interventions have proven to be effective not only in clinical populations but also in the occupational setting. Recent studies conducted in the work environment have focused on the effectiveness of these interventions. However, the role of employees' acceptability of web-based interventions and programs has not yet enjoyed a similar level of attention.
   Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to conduct the first comprehensive study on employees' level of acceptability of web-based mental health interventions based on direct and indirect measures, outline the utility of different types of web-based interventions for work-related mental health issues, and build a research base in the field.
   Methods: The search was conducted between October 2018 and July 2019 and allowed for any study design. The studies used either qualitative or quantitative data sources. The web-based interventions were generally aimed at supporting employees with their mental health issues. The study characteristics were outlined in a table as well as graded based on their quality using a traffic light schema. The level of acceptability was individually rated using commonly applied methods, including percentile quartiles ranging from low to very high.
   Results: A total of 1303 studies were identified through multiple database searches and additional resources, from which 28 (2%) were rated as eligible for the synthesis. The results of employees' acceptability levels were mixed, and the studies were very heterogeneous in design, intervention characteristics, and population. Approximately 79% (22/28) of the studies outlined acceptability measures from high to very high, and 54% (15/28) of the studies reported acceptability levels from low to moderate (overlap when studies reported both quantitative and qualitative results). Qualitative studies also provided insights into barriers and preferences, including simple and tailored application tools as well as the preference for nonstigmatized language. However, there were multiple flaws in the methodology of the studies, such as the blinding of participants and personnel.
   Conclusions: The results outline the need for further research with more homogeneous acceptability studies to draw a final conclusion. However, the underlying results show that there is a tendency toward general acceptability of web-based interventions in the workplace, with findings of general applicability to the use of web-based mental health interventions.

AB  - People with pre-pandemic health conditions are more vulnerable and more likely to suffer greater psychosocial impact due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures. Thus, the objective of this work was to systematically review the impact of the early stages COVID-19 pandemic on people with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. The search was performed between 23 January and 2 September 2021 in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. A total of 4167 published results were identified; however, only 49 were included in this review. Results show that there was considerable heterogeneity among studies, which resulted in a low consensus. However, it seems that the impact of the first stage of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric disorders was two-fold: (1) an overall effect, in which people suffering from psychiatric disorders in general experienced more psychological distress and anxiety when compared to people who had no psychiatric diagnosis, and (2) a condition-specific effect, namely in people suffering from eating disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. Moreover, the current work highlights that there were also some external factors that were related to worsening symptoms. For instance, unemployment or experiencing work and financial difficulties can be a trigger for greater distress during the pandemic for people with mood disorders, and being alone and in social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic may actually increase substance use and relapse rates. Further studies are needed to prospectively investigate the long-term effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic on people with (pre)-existing psychiatric conditions and on the onset or deterioration of psychiatric-related symptoms in a larger number of participants, as well as exploring the long-term effects of the current pandemic on mental health.

AB  - A systematic overview of mental and physical disorders of informal caregivers based on population-based studies with good methodological quality is lacking. Therefore, our aim was to systematically summarize mortality, incidence, and prevalence estimates of chronic diseases in informal caregivers compared to non-caregivers. Following PRISMA recommendations, we searched major healthcare databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE and Web of Science) systematically for relevant studies published in the last 10 years (without language restrictions) (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020200314). We included only observational cross-sectional and cohort studies with low risk of bias (risk scores 0-2 out of max 8) that reported the prevalence, incidence, odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), mean- or sum-scores for health-related outcomes in informal caregivers and non-caregivers. For a thorough methodological quality assessment, we used a validated checklist. The synthesis of the results was conducted by grouping outcomes. We included 22 studies, which came predominately from the USA and Europe. Informal caregivers had a significantly lower mortality than non-caregivers. Regarding chronic morbidity outcomes, the results from a large longitudinal German health-insurance evaluation showed increased and statistically significant incidences of severe stress, adjustment disorders, depression, diseases of the spine and pain conditions among informal caregivers compared to non-caregivers. In cross-sectional evaluations, informal caregiving seemed to be associated with a higher occurrence of depression and of anxiety (ranging from 4 to 51% and 2 to 38%, respectively), pain, hypertension, diabetes and reduced quality of life. Results from our systematic review suggest that informal caregiving may be associated with several mental and physical disorders. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution, as the cross-sectional studies cannot determine temporal relationships. The lower mortality rates compared to non-caregivers may be due to a healthy-carer bias in longitudinal observational studies; however, these and other potential benefits of informal caregiving deserve further attention by researchers.

AB  - Background Exposure to armed conflict has been associated with negative mental health consequences. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder among migrants exposed to armed conflict.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched online databases (Cochrane Library, Embase, LILACS, PsycInfo [via Ovid], PubMed, and Web of Science Core Collection) for relevant observational studies published between Jan 1, 1994, and June 28, 2021. We included studies that used standardised psychiatric interviews to assess generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder among migrants (refugees or internally displaced persons; aged >= 18 years) with pre-migration exposure to armed conflict. We excluded studies in which exposure to armed conflict could not be ascertained, studies that included a clinical population or people with chronic diseases that can trigger the onset of mental disease, and studies published before 1994. We used a random effects model to estimate each mental health disorder's pooled prevalence and random effects metaregression to assess sources of heterogeneity. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias for each study using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020209251.
   Findings Of the 13 935 studies identified, 34 met our inclusion criteria; these studies accounted for 15 549 migrants. We estimated a prevalence of current post-traumatic stress disorder of 31% (95% CI 23-40); prevalence of current major depressive disorder of 25% (17-34); and prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder of 14% (5-35). Younger age was associated with a higher prevalence of current post-traumatic stress disorder (odds ratio 0.95 [95% CI 0.90-0.99]), lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder (0.88 [0.83-0.92]), and current generalised anxiety disorder (0.87 [0.78-0.97]). A longer time since displacement was associated with a lower lifetime prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (0.88 [0.81-0.95]) and major depressive disorder (0.81 [0.77-0.86]). Migrating to a middle-income (8.09 [3.06-21.40]) or low-income (39.29 [11.96-129.70]) country was associated with increased prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder.
   Interpretation Migrants who are exposed to armed conflict are at high risk of mental health disorders. The mental health-care needs of migrants should be assessed soon after resettlement, and adequate care should be provided, with particular attention paid to young adults.

AB  - Resilience is learnable and broadly described as an individual's adaptive coping ability, its potential value for stress reduction must be explored. With a global coronavirus pandemic, innovative ways to deliver resilience training amidst heightened mental health concerns must be urgently examined. This systematic review aimed to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of digital training for building resilience and reducing anxiety, depressive and stress symptoms and (2) to identify essential features for designing future digital training. A three-step search was conducted in eight electronic databases, trial registries and grey literature to locate eligible studies. Randomised controlled trials examining the effects of digital training aimed at enhancing resilience were included. Data analysis was conducted using the Stata version 17. Twenty-two randomised controlled trials involving 2876 participants were included. Meta-analysis revealed that digital training significantly enhanced the participants' resilience with moderate to large effect (g = 0.54-1.09) at post-intervention and follow-up. Subgroup analyses suggested that training delivered via the Internet with a flexible programme schedule was more effective than its counterparts. This review supports the use of digital training in improving resilience. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials with large sample size are needed.

AB  - Bullying victimization is a form of psychological stress that is associated with poor outcomes in the areas of mental health and learning. Although the emotional maladjustment and memory impairment following interpersonal stress are well documented, the mechanisms of complex cerebral dysfunctions have neither been outlined nor studied in depth in the context of childhood bullying victimization. As a contribution to the cross-disciplinary field of developmental psychology and neuroscience, we review the neuropathophysiology of early life stress, as well as general psychological stress to synthesize the data and clarify the versatile dynamics within neuronal networks linked to bullying victimization. The stress-induced neuropsychological cascade and associated cerebral networks with a focus on cognitive and emotional convergence are described. The main findings are that stress-evoked neuroendocrine reactivity relates to neuromodulation and limbic dysregulation that hinder emotion processing and executive functioning such as semantic cognition, cognitive flexibility, and learning. Developmental aspects and interacting neural mechanisms linked to distressed cognitive and emotional processing are pinpointed and potential theory-of-mind nuances in targets of bullying are presented. The results show that childhood stress psychopathology is associated with a complex interplay where the major role belongs to, but is not limited to, the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, insula, striatum, and prefrontal cortex. This interplay contributes to the sensitivity toward facial expressions, poor cognitive reasoning, and distress that affect behavioral modulation and emotion regulation. We integrate the data on major brain dynamics in stress neuroactivity that can be associated with childhood psychopathology to help inform future studies that are focused on the treatment and prevention of psychiatric disorders and learning problems in bullied children and adolescents.

AB  - In this systematic review, we sought to understand the effects of laughter-inducing interventions on blood pressure and heart rate variability. For this purpose, we identified 32 relevant records through database searching. The results suggest that laughter is associated with a decrease in blood pressure in pre-post measurements. However, this association varies according to the type of intervention delivered and the characteristics of participants. In controlled between-groups comparisons, the effect of laughter-inducing interventions on blood pressure was found to be non-significant, which can be due to the small number of studies available and its high level of heterogeneity. In studies involving heart rate variability, the most consistent findings point to an association between laughter and decreases in both frequency (LF/HF) and time-domain (SDNN) indicators. Longitudinal studies suggest that laughter frequency is associated with improved cardiovascular health. Several studies presented sub-optimal levels of quality, and more research is necessary to examine the impact of individual and intervention-related factors in the effectiveness of laughter-inducing interventions in cardiovascular health.

AB  - Objectives The WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) has been widely used in low and middle-income countries. We reviewed literature describing interventions and training programmes beyond the mhGAP-IG, in primary healthcare (PHC) and community-based healthcare (CBH). Design We searched studies excluded from our updated mhGAP-IG systematic review, and included in other relevant systematic reviews, for evidence and experience of initiatives integrating mental health into PHC and CBH. Our 24 November 2020 mhGAP-IG search encompassed MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, 3ie and Google Scholar. Although heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis, we descriptively summarised the evidence-base. Results Out of 1827 results, we identified 208 relevant records. They described randomised controlled trials of mental health interventions (98 studies, n=55 523 participants), non-randomised studies measuring clinical outcomes (22 studies, n=7405), training outcomes (36 studies, n=12 280) and implementation outcomes (21 studies, n=1090), plus descriptive accounts (18 studies, n=2526), baseline surveys and exploratory studies (6 studies, n=17 093) and commentaries (7 studies). Most (40%) were conducted in the African region, region of the Americas (16%), and South-East Asia (13%). Randomised and non-randomised studies reported improved symptoms, substance use, functioning, parenting and child outcomes. Non-randomised studies reported improved clinical knowledge, confidence and skills following training. Conclusions The literature beyond the mhGAP-IG is extensive and shares common findings. Future priorities are less-studied regions, interventions for severe mental illness, exploring ways that mhGAP-IG and alternative approaches complement each other in different contexts and scaling-up mental health integration.

AB  - The pandemic caused a change in the way of providing healthcare services, limiting direct access to doctors, suspending planned treatments and medical consultations, but despite the risks and restrictions, the medical rescue system as a key element of health care for the society continues to function. The system provides medical assistance to patients in the most severe condition, both with a negative result for SARS-CoV-2, as well as with a positive or undiagnosed result. It is a review aimed at analyzing the most important psychological aspects of the work of emergency medical care system personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar search were used to analyze the problem. The following keywords were used to search for information sources: paramedic, work, emergency medical care system, emergency department, ambulance service, COVID-19, pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus. The articles were selected in terms of the psychological aspects of the work of the emergency medical care system personnel during the pandemic in 2020-2021. The psychosocial problems that come to the fore during a pandemic include increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, emotional exhaustion, vicarious traumatization, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In the context of the increased risk of psychological problems due to pandemic, it is necessary to provide psychological support to the medical staff, both in terms of for the entire team and Med Pr.

AB  - Background: Anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep disturbance are reported following whiplash injury. However, the prevalence of these condition varies among studies. In this review, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and sleep disturbance will be referred as psychiatric outcomes. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed and Embase (from database inception until March 20, 2021) to identify studies reporting on the relative frequency of these psychiatric outcomes. Three independent investigators screened titles, abstracts and full-texts. Studies including patients with whiplash injury and where the number of patients with whiplash and anxiety, depression, PTSD, or sleep disturbances could be extrapolated, were included. Furthermore, to be included, studies had to defined psychiatric outcomes in accordance with diagnostic criteria [i.e., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)] or by use of a validated instrument with cut-off scores for assessing psychiatric symptoms. Quality rating was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) on the included studies. A protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021232037). Results: The literature search identified 5,068 citations, of which five articles were eligible for inclusion. The relative frequency of depressive symptoms following whiplash injury was 32.8% at 6 months, and 34.0% at 6-12 months. The relative frequency of PTSD symptoms after whiplash injury was 9.0-22.3% at 3 months, 15.8% at 6 months and 14.6-17.1% at 12 months. No studies evaluating the relative frequency of anxiety and sleep disturbances were eligible for inclusion. Discussion and Conclusion: Our results suggest that there are persistent psychiatric outcomes following whiplash trauma. However, we found considerable heterogeneity among the studies. Thus, we have focused on the most notable limitations of the included studies: 1) small sample sizes, 2) differences in enrollment criteria, 3) lack of control groups, 4) considerable variation in the method used for outcome assessment, 5) directionality of association is difficult to determine and 6) incomplete assessment of compensation factors. We highlight these methodological limitations and outline recommendations for future research. Since psychiatric outcomes are potentially modifiable, future studies should optimize and address the identified methodological limitations so psychiatric sequelae following whiplash injury may be prevented.

AB  - Background Despite Auditory Verbal Hallucinations (AVHs) having been long associated with mental illness, they represent a common experience also in the non-clinical population, yet do not exhibit distress or need for care. Shame and guilt are emotions related to one's perception of oneself and one's responsibility. As such, they direct our attention to aspects of AVHs that are under-researched and elusive, particularly about the status of voices as others, their social implications and the constitution and conceptualisation of the self. Objectives This paper aims to provide a systematic review of studies that investigated the relationship between auditory hallucinations, shame, and guilt in people without relevant signs of psychiatric issues. Methods We searched studies reporting information about voices characteristics, the relationship between voices and hearers, hearer's reactions, and beliefs, paying peculiar attention to shame and guilt issues. Included papers were evaluated for risk of bias. Results Eleven studies that explored the relationship between AVHs, shame and guilt, were extracted. Phenomenological, pragmatic, as well as neuropsychological features of hearing voices in non-clinical populations, allowed us to note a dynamic relationship and the constellation of subjective experiences that can occur. The role of guilt was characterized by few studies and mixed results, while shame was mainly common. Conclusions Due to the high heterogeneity detected and the scarce sources available, further studies should focus on both the aetiology and the bidirectional relationship between hearing voices, shame, and guilt in non-clinical people. This can be helpful in therapies for non-clinical populations who are distressed by their voices (e.g., psychotherapy), and for whom shame, and guilt may contribute to negative consequences such as isolation, anxiety or future depression. Moreover, it might favour the development and implication of different treatments considering emotion regulation, distress tolerance and interpersonal sensitivity on the clinical populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND Sleep problems are particularly prevalent in people with depression or anxiety disorder. Although mindfulness has been suggested as an important component in alleviating insomnia, no comprehensive review and meta-analysis has been conducted to evaluate the effects of different mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) programs on sleep among people with depression or anxiety disorder. AIM To compare the effects of different MBI programs on sleep among people with depression or anxiety disorder. METHODS Related publications in Embase, Medline, PubMed and PsycINFO databases were systematically searched from January 2010 to June 2020 for randomised controlled trials. Data were synthesized using a random-effects or a fixed-effects model to analyse the effects of various MBI programs on sleep problems among people with depression or anxiety disorder. The fixed-effects model was used when heterogeneity was negligible, and the random-effects model was used when heterogeneity was significant to calculate the standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS We identified 397 articles, of which 10 randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 541 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. Studies of internet mindfulness meditation intervention (IMMI), mindfulness meditation (MM), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based touch therapy (MBTT) met the inclusion criteria. The greatest effect sizes are reported in favour of MBTT, with SMDs of -1.138 (95%CI: -1.937 to -0.340; P = 0.005), followed by -1.003 (95%CI: -1.645 to -0.360; P = 0.002) for MBCT. SMDs of -0.618 (95%CI: -0.980 to -0.257; P = 0.001) and -0.551 (95%CI: -0.842 to -0.260; P < 0.0001) were reported for IMMI and MBSR in the pooling trials, respectively. Significant effects on sleep problem improvement are shown in all reviewed MBI programs, except MM, for which the effect size was shown to be non-significant. CONCLUSION All MBI programs (MBTT, MBCT, IMMI and MBSR), except MM, are effective options to improve sleep problems among people with depression or anxiety disorder.

AB  - Background: Emerging evidence suggests a possible association between artificial light at night (LAN) exposure and physiological and behavioral changes, with implications on mood and mental health. Due to the increased amount of individuals' LAN exposure, concerns have been raised regarding harmful impact of light pollution on mental health at the population level.Aim: To perform a systematic review of observational studies to investigate if light at night, assessed both indoor and outdoor, may be associated with an increased risk of mental diseases in humans. Methods: We reviewed the epidemiological evidence on the association between LAN exposure, assessed either via sat-ellite photometry or via measurements of bedroom brightness, and mental disorders. We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases up to April 1, 2022. Studies were included if they assessed the link be-tween indoor or outdoor artificial light at night and one or more mental disorders in human populations.Results: Nine eligible studies were included in this review: six studies had a cross-sectional design, two had a longitu-dinal design with a median follow-up of 24 months, and one was a case-cohort study. Overall, we found moderate ev-idence of a positive association between LAN exposure and depressive symptoms and to a lesser extent other mental disorders, though the number of studies was limited and potential residual confounding such as socioeconomic factors, noise, or air pollution may have influenced the results. Conclusions: Although more robust evidence is needed, the epidemiological evidence produced so far seems to support an association between LAN and risk of depressive disorders.

AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has become a common public health issue among university students, impairing their physical and mental health. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the pooled prevalence of IBS and its associated factors among Chinese university students. Methods: Databases of PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE (via EBSCO), CINAHL (via EBSCO), Wan Fang, CNKI and Weipu (via VIP) were systematically searched from inception date to May 31, 2021. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were used to detect the potential source of heterogeneity. Key Results: A total of 22 cross-sectional studies (14 were in Chinese and 8 were in English) with 33,166 Chinese university students were included. The pooled prevalence of IBS was estimated as 11.89% (95% CI = 8.06%, 16.35%). The prevalence was 10.50% (95% CI = 6.80%, 15.87%) in Rome II criteria, 12.00% (95% CI = 8.23%, 17.17%) in Rome III criteria, and 3.66% (95% CI = 2.01%, 6.60%) in Rome IV criteria. The highest prevalence of IBS was 17.66% (95% CI = 7.37%, 36.64%) in North China, and the lowest was 3.18% (95% CI = 1.28%, 7.68%) in South China. Subgroup analyses indicated that gender, major, anxiety and depression symptoms, drinking and smoking behaviors were significantly associated with the prevalence of IBS. Meta-regression analyses suggested that region influenced prevalence estimates for IBS. Conclusions and Inferences: This meta-analysis illustrated that IBS is very common in Chinese university students. Regular screening, effective prevention, and appropriate treatments should be implemented to reduce the risk of IBS in this population. More future studies should be conducted in Northeastern and Southwestern parts of China.

AB  - Background: High prevalence of smartphone addiction among medical students may contribute to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Aim: To estimate the prevalence of smartphone addiction, and explore the influencing factors and related mental health symptoms of smartphone addiction among Asian medical students. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed (MEDLINE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE were searched for relevant literature from the inception to September 10, 2021. Using Stata software 11.0, the meta-analysis of prevalence and the influencing factors of smartphone addiction were determined with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Nineteen articles, published between 2014 and 2019, were included, producing medical student studies from seven different Asian countries. The included studies were conducted in India (n = 11) and Malaysia (n = 3), with China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nepal, and Iran each contributing one study. Among a total of 5,497 medical students, the participants included 3,214 females, of whom 2,181 were medical students with smartphone addiction. The prevalence of smartphone addiction among Asian medical students was 41.93% (95% CI [36.24%, 47.72%]). The influencing factors of smartphone addiction among medical students included gender, duration of smartphone use, smartphone function, and marital status. Ten studies (52.63%) explored related mental health symptoms of smartphone addiction among Asian medical students. Smartphone addiction was positively correlated with poor sleep quality (r = .17-.31), stress (r = .30-.40), anxiety, depression, neuroticism, and general health among Asian medical students. Conclusion: Smartphone addiction is highly prevalent among Asian medical students. Smartphone addiction may adversely affect mental health, resulting in sleep disturbance, stress, anxiety, depression, and neuroticism. It is necessary to take appropriate precautionary actions and interventions to prevent smartphone overuse among medical students.

AB  - Insomnia symptoms are frequent during peripartum and are considered risk factors for peripartum psychopathology. Assessing and treating insomnia and related conditions of sleep loss during peripartum should be a priority in the clinical practice. The aim of this paper was to conduct a systematic review on insomnia evaluation and treatment during peripartum which may be useful for clinicians. The literature review was carried out between January 2000 and May 2021 on the evaluation and treatment of insomnia during the peripartum period. The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase electronic databases were searched for literature published according to the PRISMA guidance with several combinations of search terms "insomnia" and "perinatal period" or "pregnancy" or "post partum" or "lactation" or "breastfeeding" and "evaluation" and "treatment." Based on this search, 136 articles about insomnia evaluation and 335 articles on insomnia treatment were found and we conducted at the end a narrative review. According to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 41 articles were selected for the evaluation part and 22 on the treatment part, including the most recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Evaluation of insomnia during peripartum, as for insomnia patients, may be conducted at least throughout a clinical interview, but specific rating scales are available and may be useful for assessment. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), as for insomnia patients, should be the preferred treatment choice during peripartum, and it may be useful to also improve mood, anxiety symptoms, and fatigue. Pharmacological treatment may be considered when women who present with severe forms of insomnia symptoms do not respond to nonpharmacologic therapy.

AB  - Exposure to the air pollution represents a major health risk, particulate matter is referred as harmful component of the environmental contamination. The central nervous system emerged as target to damages related to particulate matter exposure. This review presents the morphophysiological findings in the central nervous system of rodent models related to particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exposure, published between 2016 to 2021. The data were collected in the scientific databases, PubMed, Springer Link, Science Direct and Web of Science using the string [(air pollution OR particulate matter OR PM2.5 AND central nervous system OR CNS OR brain AND neurodegeneration)]. To refine the article search, inclusion and exclusion criteria where applied, resulting in 48 articles selected to compose this review. The major neurological outcomes reported in the studies were microglial activation, increase proinflammatory citokines, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, synaptic imbalance, apoptosis, morphological changes, memory and behavioral impairment and other changes (hormonal changes, body weight and gene expression). These findings indicate injuries in the central nervous system that alters the neurodevelopment, anatomy, physiology, immune response, among others, that are related to particulate matter exposure and are closely associated to human neurological outcomes. The performed studies provide evidences of the mechanism involved in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer and Parkinson) and neurological behavior impairment (e.g. Autism like, depression, anxiety).

AB  - Objective: To assess the effects of psychological, psychosocial, educational and alternative interventions on mental health outcomes of Indigenous adult populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States and the Indigenous involvement and content in each study. Methods: We systematically searched databases, key journals and gray literature, for records until June 2020. Eligible studies were in English or French and examined the impact of interventions on mental health outcomes including anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, psychological distress or stress for Indigenous adults (> 16 years). Data were extracted using a modified Cochrane Data Extraction Form and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication. Quality was evaluated using the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment form. Results: In total, 21 studies were eligible, comprising 8 randomized controlled trials, 10 single-group pre-post studies and 3 pre-post studies with comparison groups. Twenty studies had Indigenous individuals or organizations involved in some decision-making capacity, though extent of involvement varied widely. In total, 9 studies were rated moderate and 12 weak in the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment. Eight studies measuring depression, three measuring posttraumatic stress disorder, three measuring psychological distress and two measuring stress showed statistically significant improvements following the intervention. Conclusion: A wide range of interventions demonstrated mental health improvements. However, it is difficult to draw generalizable conclusions on intervention effectiveness, given heterogeneity among studies. Studies should employ a thorough assessment of the Indigenous involvement and content of their interventions for reporting and for critical consideration of the implications of their research and whether they address Indigenous determinants of mental health.

AB  - Purpose The targeted use of standardized outcome measures (SOMs) of mental health in research with older adults who are incarcerated promotes a common language that enables interdisciplinary dialogue, contributes to the identification of disparities and supports data harmonization and subsequent synthesis. This paper aims to provide researchers with rationale for using "gold-standard" measures used in research with community-dwelling older adults, reporting associated study sample psychometric indexes, and detailing alterations in the approach or measure. Design/methodology/approach The authors highlight the mental health of older adults who are incarcerated. They also discuss the benefits of SOMs in practice and research and then identify gold-standard measures of mental health used in research with community-dwelling older adults and measures used in research with older adults who are incarcerated. Finally, the authors provide several recommendations related to the use of SOMs of mental health in research with this population. Findings Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are common among older adults who are incarcerated. Researchers have used a variety of measures to capture these mental health problems, some parallel to those used with community-dwelling samples. However, a more targeted use of SOMs of mental health in research with this population will contribute to important strides in this burgeoning field. Originality/value This review offers several practical recommendations related to SOMs of mental health in research with older adults who are incarcerated to contribute to a rigorous evidence base and thus inform practice and potentially improve the health and well-being of this population.

AB  - Resilience is a key factor that reflects a teacher's ability to utilize their emotional resources and working skills to provide high-quality teaching to children. Resilience-building interventions aim to promote positive psychological functioning and well-being. However, there is lack of evidence on whether these interventions improve the well-being or mental health of teachers in early childhood education (ECE) settings. This review examined the overall effectiveness of resilience-building interventions conducted on teachers working in the ECE field. A systematic approach is used to identify relevant studies that focus on resilience-building in countering work stress among early childhood educators. Findings from this review observed a preference of group approaches and varying durations of interventions. This review highlights the challenges of the group approach which can lead to lengthy interventions and attrition amongst participants. In addition to the concerns regarding response bias from self-report questionnaires, there is also a lack of physiological measures used to evaluate effects on mental health. The large efforts by 11 studies to integrate multiple centres into their intervention and the centre-based assessment performed by four studies highlight the need for a centre-focused approach to build resilience among teachers from various ECE centres. A pilot study is conducted to evaluate the feasibility of an integrated electroencephalography-virtual reality (EEG-VR) approach in building resilience in teachers, where the frontal brain activity can be monitored during a virtual classroom task. Overall, the findings of this review propose the integration of physiological measures to monitor changes in mental health throughout the resilience-building intervention and the use of VR as a tool to design a unique virtual environment.

AB  - Objective: Depression is one of the most prevalent and disabling mental health conditions among young people worldwide. The health and economic burdens associated with depressive illness are substantial. Suicide and depression are closely intertwined, yet a diagnosis of depression itself lacks predictive specificity for suicidal behaviour. To better inform suicide prevention and early intervention strategies for young people, improved identification of modifiable intervention targets is needed. The objective of this review was to identify clinical, psychosocial and biological correlates of suicidality in young people diagnosed with a broad range of unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders. Method: Systematic searches were conducted across MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to identify studies of young people aged 15-25 years diagnosed with unipolar or bipolar depressive disorders. An assessment of suicidality was required for inclusion. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 and Synthesis Without Meta-analysis guidelines. Results: We integrated findings from 71 studies including approximately 24,670 young people with clinically diagnosed depression. We identified 26 clinical, psychosocial and biological correlates of suicidality. Depression characteristics (type and severity), psychiatric comorbidity (particularly anxiety and substance use disorders) and neurological characteristics emerged as having the most evidence for being associated with suicidal outcomes. Our ability to pool data and conduct meaningful quantitative synthesis was hampered by substantial heterogeneity across studies and incomplete reporting; thus, meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusion: Findings of this review reinforce the notion that suicidality is a complex phenomenon arising from the interplay of multiple contributing factors. Our findings question the utility of considering a diagnosis of depression as a specific risk factor for suicidality in young people. Suicidality itself is transdiagnostic; adoption of a transdiagnostic approach to investigating its aetiology and treatment is perhaps warranted. Future research investigating specific symptoms, or symptom networks, might help to further our understanding of suicidality among young people experiencing mental illness.

AB  - Purpose: Literature shows that sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals are at higher risk of developing minority stress-related mental health problems. Recently, it has been suggested that promoting self-compassion through affirmative mental health care for SGM people can be beneficial. However, no systematic analysis has been published exploring the relationship between self-compassion and mental health indicators in SGM individuals. We aim to fill this gap by synthesizing and meta-analyzing studies that focus on the relationship between self-compassion and mental health in SGM people.Methods: After registering in PROSPERO (CRD42021254774), PubMed, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Web of Knowledge were systematically searched to identify studies assessing the association between self-compassion and mental health and/or minority stress indicators in SGM individuals. All screening steps and data extraction were performed independently by the two researchers. The quality of each study was assessed with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute tool, and meta-analysis was performed on R software.Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis, corresponding to a total of 6573 nonheterosexual and/or noncisgender participants. All meta-analytic models were significant: higher levels of self-compassion were associated with less depression, anxiety, psychological distress, suicidal ideation, internalized homophobia/transphobia, and stigma, and with more well-being, outness, and social support.Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that self-compassion is significantly associated with mental health indicators in SGM people, and this relationship is especially strong with internalized homophobia/transphobia in older SGM adults, and with suicidal ideation in younger SGM individuals. Results suggest that affirmative mental health care may benefit from promoting self-compassion.

AB  - The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been affecting populations globally since the end of 2019. Previous studies have indicated that spirituality in these times of crisis serves as a source of hope and well-being that helps people get through the day. This study investigated the role of spirituality and religiosity in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. An integrative review of the scientific literature available on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and a review of the gray literature in the Information System on Gray Literature in Europe (OpenGrey) were carried out. From a total of 1,338 articles searched; 25 articles were included in this review (22 quantitative observational, 2 qualitative and one randomized controlled trial). Our findings revealed the importance of including spirituality in clinical practice for both health professionals and patients. On the one hand, spirituality can be considered a good coping strategy used by healthcare professionals to promote mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting in greater patient satisfaction with the care given. On the other hand, addressing spiritual needs of individuals leads to a reduction in stress, anxiety, depression, and an increase in resilience and hope among patients.

AB  - The mental health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersexual (LGBTQI) individuals is significantly influenced by many factors such as difficulties in coming-out, poor acceptance, isolation and discrimination as well as minority-related stress. LGBTQI individuals, in fact, show a significant higher risk of mental health conditions, substance- use disorders and suicide. In addition, mental health services access may be difficult for personal and social barriers as well as a lack of adequate and specific mental health support. This review aims to assess and describe international policies, guidelines, position statements and recommendations regarding the promotion and protection of mental health rights for LGBTQI people. The search has been focussed on peer-reviewed papers, Governmental and Mental Health Association- Guidelines and Position Statements, Health Agencies - Guidelines and Position Statements (with a specific focus on mental health), LGBTQI Alliances and Foundations Publishing (with a specific focus on mental health). In addition, relevant international initiatives, and projects in the field of LGBTQI mental health will be described.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed at investigating five dimensions of the psychological impact (post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance or profession-related burnout) of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCW) in China. Methods Studies that evaluated at least one of the five target dimensions of the psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCW in China were included. Studies with no data of our interest were excluded. Relevant Databases were searched from inception up to June 10, 2020. Preprint articles were also included. The methodological quality was assessed using the checklist recommended by AHRQ. Both the rate of prevalence and the severity of symptoms were pooled. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020197126) on July 09, 2020. Results We included 44 studies with a total of 65,706 HCW participants. Pooled prevalence rates of moderate to severe PTSS, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were 27% (95% CI 16%-38%), 17% (13-21%), 15% (13-16%), and 15% (7-23%), respectively; while the prevalence of mild to severe level of PTSS, anxiety, and depression was estimated as 31% (25-37%), 37% (32-42%) and 39% (25-52%). Due to the lack of data, no analysis of profession-related burnout was pooled. Subgroup analyses indicated higher prevalence of moderate to severe psychological impact in frontline HCW, female HCW, nurses, and HCW in Wuhan. Conclusion About a third of HCW in China showed at least one dimension of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the prevalence of moderate and severe syndromes was relatively low. Studies on profession-related burnout, long-term impact, and the post-stress growth are still needed.

AB  - Background The severity of COVID-19 remains high worldwide. Therefore, millions of individuals are likely to suffer from fear of COVID-19 and related mental health factors. Aims The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize empirical evidence to understand fear of COVID-19 and its associations with mental health-related problems during this pandemic period. Method Relevant studies were searched for on five databases (Scopus, ProQuest, EMBASE, PubMed Central, and ISI Web of Knowledge), using relevant terms (COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, depression, mental health-related factors, mental well-being and sleep problems). All studies were included for analyses irrespective of their methodological quality, and the impact of quality on pooled effect size was examined by subgroup analysis. Results The meta-analysis pooled data from 91 studies comprising 88 320 participants (mean age 38.88 years; 60.66% females) from 36 countries. The pooled estimated mean of fear of COVID-19 was 13.11 (out of 35), using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The associations between fear of COVID-19 and mental health-related factors were mostly moderate (Fisher's z = 0.56 for mental health-related factors; 0.54 for anxiety; 0.42 for stress; 0.40 for depression; 0.29 for sleep problems and -0.24 for mental well-being). Methodological quality did not affect these associations. Conclusions Fear of COVID-19 has associations with various mental health-related factors. Therefore, programmes for reducing fear of COVID-19 and improving mental health are needed.

AB  - Objective: Identify and review articles that evaluated mental health of HCW of Latin American countries (except Brazil), published during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We systematically searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, PUBMED/ Medline, Web of Science, PePSIC, and Scielo for articles published during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two independent researchers reviewed titles and abstracts and then, for eligible studies, extracted data from full texts. Outcomes included mental health variables, country where the study was conducted, period of data collection, healthcare professional categories, study design, mental health measurements and main outcomes. The quality and risk assessment was also performed. Results: Out of 248 records identified, 24 initially were assessed for eligibility. From those, 17 studies matched eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Higher scores of anxiety were reported in different studies, as well as an increased level of depression among HCW. Being a female, younger age, and closer distance of the epicenter of the outbreak increased the likelihood to develop mental health disorder. Concerns and fear related to COVID-19 have a greater impact on stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings highlight that COVID-19 pandemic had been worse for HCW from Latin America, showing the harmful effects of burnout on their health. Greater psychological distress, as well as anxiety and depression had been experienced by HCW from Latin America in their fight against COVID-19, demonstrating the importance of psychological well-being policies for them during and post- the pandemic.

AB  - Plain language summary Multiple factors shape the quality of life of women affected by gynaecological cancers in Asian countries as elsewhere. We identified 53 articles reporting on 48 studies, most conducted in high- and upper-middle income East Asian countries, with much less attention to women in lower income countries in South and Southeast Asia. Most studies used quantitative research methods to gain an understanding of the impact on women diagnosed with cervical or ovarian cancer who had completed treatment. Women's quality of life was shaped by their mental and physical health, their support needs, and the changes they experienced in sexual function and sexuality.
   Background Gynaecological cancers are among the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with profound effects on the lives of women and their families. In this critical review, we explore the impacts of these cancers on quality of life (QOL) of women in Asian countries, and highlight areas for future inquiry. Methods A systematic search of the literature was conducted in six electronic databases: Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health (CAB Direct), PsycINFO (Ovid), EBMR (Ovid), and Medline (Ovid). Screening resulted in the inclusion of 53 relevant articles reporting on 48 studies. Results Most studies were conducted in high and upper-middle income countries in East Asia and used quantitative approaches. Women had predominantly been diagnosed with cervical or ovarian cancer, and most had completed treatment. Four key interrelated domains emerged as most relevant in shaping QOL of women affected by gynaecological cancer: support, including identified needs, sources and forms; mental health, covering psychological distress associated with cancer, risk and protective factors, and coping strategies; sexual function and sexuality, focused on physiological, emotional and relational changes caused by gynaecological cancers and treatments, and the impacts of these on women's identities; and physical health, covering the physical conditions associated with gynaecological cancers and their impacts on women's daily activities. Conclusion QOL of women affected by gynaecological cancer is shaped by their mental and physical health, support, and changes in sexual function and sexuality. The limited number of studies from lower- and middle-income countries in South and Southeast Asia highlights important knowledge gaps requiring future research.

The purpose of this paper is to bring together evidence reporting on mental health mobile apps to gain an understanding of the quality of current evidence, the positive and adverse effects of apps and the mechanisms underlying such effects. Design/methodology/approach A systematic search was carried out across six databases, for any systematic reviews or meta-analyses conducted up to 2020. Review quality was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews. Findings Across a total of 24 articles, a variety of clinical outcomes were assessed. Most compelling support was shown for apps targeting anxiety symptoms; some evidence favoured the use of apps for depression symptoms. Less evidence was available for the remaining clinical symptoms such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorders and substance use. Overall, there was limited evidence pertaining to adverse effects and change mechanisms and a lack of quality reporting across a large proportion of included reviews. The included reviews demonstrate the need for further robust research before apps are recommended clinically. Originality/value This paper makes a valuable contribution to the current status of research and reviews investigating mental health mobile apps. Recommendations are made for improved adherence to review guidelines and to ensure risk of bias is minimised.

AB  - Background: Given the role digital technologies are likely to play in the future of mental health care, there is a need for a comprehensive appraisal of the current state and validity (ie, screening or diagnostic accuracy) of digital mental health assessments.
   Objective: The aim of this review is to explore the current state and validity of question-and-answer-based digital tools for diagnosing and screening psychiatric conditions in adults.
   Methods: This systematic review was based on the Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome framework and was carried out in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, ASSIA, Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were systematically searched for articles published between 2005 and 2021. A descriptive evaluation of the study characteristics and digital solutions and a quantitative appraisal of the screening or diagnostic accuracy of the included tools were conducted. Risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the revised tool for the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2.
   Results: A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria, with the most frequently evaluated conditions encompassing generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and any depressive disorder. Most of the studies used digitized versions of existing pen-and-paper questionnaires, with findings revealing poor to excellent screening or diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity=0.32-1.00, specificity=0.37-1.00, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.57-0.98) and a high risk of bias for most of the included studies.
   Conclusions: The field of digital mental health tools is in its early stages, and high-quality evidence is lacking.

AB  - Background: The use of technologies has served to reduce gaps in access to treatment, and digital health interventions show promise in the care of mental health problems. However, to understand what and how these interventions work, it is imperative to document the aspects related to their challenging implementation.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine what evidence is available for synchronous digital mental health implementation and to develop a framework, informed by a realist review, to explain what makes digital mental health interventions work for people with mental health problems.
   Methods: The SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, and Research type) framework was used to develop the following review question: What makes digital mental health interventions with a synchronous component work on people with mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, or stress, based on implementation, economic, quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies? The MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science databases were searched from January 1, 2015, to September 2020 with no language restriction. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) was used to assess the risk of bias and Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) was used to assess the confidence in cumulative evidence. Realist synthesis analysis allowed for developing a framework on the implementation of synchronous digital mental health using a grounded-theory approach with an emergent approach.
   Results: A total of 21 systematic reviews were included in the study. Among these, 90% (n=19) presented a critically low confidence level as assessed with AMSTAR-2. The realist synthesis allowed for the development of three hypotheses to identify the context and mechanisms in which these interventions achieve these outcomes: (1) these interventions reach populations otherwise unable to have access because they do not require the physical presence of the therapist nor the patient, thereby tackling geographic barriers posed by in-person therapy; (2) these interventions reach populations otherwise unable to have access because they can be successfully delivered by nonspecialists, which makes them more cost-effective to implement in health services; and (3) these interventions are acceptable and show good results in satisfaction because they require less need of disclosure and provide more privacy, comfortability, and participation, enabling the establishment of rapport with the therapist.
   Conclusions: We developed a framework with three hypotheses that explain what makes digital mental health interventions with a synchronous component work on people with mental health problems. Each hypothesis represents essential outcomes in the implementation process.

Although there have been several recent systematic reviews, study and participant numbers have been limited, and the field is rapidly evolving with the publication of more studies. We therefore conducted a systematic review of PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and CINAHL for randomised controlled trials of methylenedioxymethamphetamine and psilocybin with either inactive or active controls. Methods: Outcomes were psychiatric symptoms measured by standardised, validated and internationally recognised instruments at least 2 weeks following drug administration, Quality was independently assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Results: There were eight studies on methylenedioxymethamphetamine and six on psilocybin. Diagnoses included post-traumatic stress disorder, long-standing/treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety in adults with autism, and anxiety or depression in life-threatening disease. The most information and strongest association was for the change in methylenedioxymethamphetamine scores compared to active controls in post-traumatic stress disorder (k = 4; standardised mean difference = -0.86; 95% confidence interval = [-1.23, -0.50]; p < 0.0001). There were also small benefits for social anxiety in adults with autism. Psilocybin was superior to wait-list but not niacin (active control) in life-threatening disease anxiety or depression. It was equally as effective as escitalopram in long-standing depression for the primary study outcome and superior for most of the secondary outcomes in analyses uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Both agents were well tolerated in supervised trials. Trial quality varied with only small proportions of potential participants included in the randomised phase. Overall certainty of evidence was low or very low using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Conclusion: Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and psilocybin may show promise in highly selected populations when administered in closely supervised settings and with intensive support.

AB  - Objectives Evidence suggests that precarious employment can have detrimental effects on workers' health, including mental health. Migrant workers are discussed to be especially vulnerable to such effects. Thus, we systematically reviewed existing research on the association between precarious employment and migrant workers' mental health.
   Methods Three electronic databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO and PubMed/Medline) were searched for original articles on quantitative and qualitative studies published from January 1970 to February 2022 in English, German, Turkish and Spanish. Multiple dimensions of precarious employment were considered as exposure, with mental health problems as outcomes. Narrative synthesis and thematic analyses were performed to summarize the findings of the included studies along with risk of bias and quality assessment.
   Results The literature search resulted in 1557 original articles, 66 of which met the inclusion criteria - 43 were of high quality and 22 were of moderate quality. The most common exposure dimensions analyzed in the studies included temporariness, vulnerability, poor interpersonal relationships, disempowerment, lacking workers' rights and low income. The outcome measures included stress, depression, anxiety and poor general mental health. The prevalence of these outcomes varied between 10-75% among the included quantitative studies. All qualitative studies reported one or more dimensions of precarious employment as an underlying factor of the development of mental health problems among migrants. Of 33 quantitative studies, 23 reported evidence for an association between dimensions of precarious employment and mental health.
   Conclusion The results of this review support the hypothesis that precarious employment is associated with migrant workers' mental health.

AB  - Mental health is a key issue for populations affected by conflict. The evidence base on the mental health of internally displaced Colombians is undefined, as well as protective strategies utilised by this group. This systematic literature review aims to identify and assess the evidence base on the mental health of Colombian internally displaced persons (IDPs). Specific objectives are to examine (1) prevalence and incidence rates of common mental disorders (CMDs) amongst adult Colombian IDPs, (2) risk factors associated with CMDs amongst this group, and (3) coping strategies used by these displaced persons. A database search was conducted in May 2021. Included studies reported quantitative and/or qualitative mental health outcomes of CMDs, and/or coping strategies, among Colombian IDPs. The search yielded 34 articles. Study quality ranged from adequate to poor, with several containing serious shortcomings. PTSD prevalence ranged from 1.2%-97.3%, anxiety from 0.0%-60.0%, depression from 5.1%-100%, and problematic alcohol use from 8.0%-33.5%. Factors significantly associated with CMDs were inconsistent. Seeking social support and problem-solving strategies were the two most-commonly reported coping strategies. Associations between mental health and coping were largely unreported. As the evidence base is weak, there is a clear need for better quality research in this area.

AB  - Background Stigma is a social phenomenon known to have a negative impact on the lives of people living with HIV (PLWH). However, defining HIV-related stigma (HRS) is difficult because of the intersection it has with structural inequalities, and cultural differences, discrimination by health care providers that measure stigma among PLWH. HIV/AIDS has been characterized as a traumatic experience and PLWH may experience stigma which can cause negative mental health disorders and experiences, including emotional distress, shame, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation. A systematic review of the evidence on the mental disorders of PLWH is currently lacking. This study aimed to analyze the association between HRS and social support, alcohol use disorders and mental health disorders and experiences (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) among PLWH. Methods In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) this study searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of sciences, PsycInfo, SciELO and Cochrane library electronic databases to identify publications between January 1992 and August 2020 that discussed social support, alcohol use disorders, mental health disorders and experiences (i.e., depression and anxiety and suicidal ideation) associated with HRS. Pooled Odds Ratios (ORs) were utilized at a 95% confidence level, and as sampling methods differed between articles pooled estimates used a random effects model. Results Twenty-two studies with 9548 participants met the eligibility criteria. No association was observed between HRS and alcohol use disorders. PLWH who had higher levels of social supports were less likely to report HRS. Participants who had been diagnosed with anxiety were 1.89 times more likely to report HRS, while those diagnosed with depression were 1.61 times more. Respondents who reported suicidal ideation also were 1.83 times more likely to report HRS. Conclusions This meta-analysis supports that HRS has a detrimental association with anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, but social support protects again HRS in PLWH. Applying interventions which focus on the mental health disorders of PLWH may decrease HRS. Provision of social support by practitioners, combined with mental health treatment and assessments, and designing methods to identify stigma at different stages of illness are warranted.

AB  - Background: Brain tumors are one of the most common solid tumors in pediatric populations, with their treatments having significant neuropsychiatric impact. Objective: The objective of this study was to review the literature on neuropsychiatric sequelae after surgical resection of brain tumors in children and adolescents. Methods: Using a scoping method, we reviewed empirical articles describing pediatric patients with brain tumors who underwent partial or total resection and examined major neuropsychiatric domains postoperatively over time. Results: The initial search yielded 15,543 articles. After duplicate removal, abstract screening, and review, 44 articles were included. Cognitive deficits were the most widely studied outcomes and found to be associated with tumor location, operative variables, perioperative complications, treatment types, and psychosocial factors. Cerebellar mutism, or posterior fossa syndrome, commonly co-occurred with emotional and behavioral dysregulation after posterior fossa resections. Depression, anxiety, and somatization were frequently grouped together as "distress, " with higher rates among pediatric patients with brain tumor than among healthy peers. Problematic school behaviors, antisocial, and attention-deficit traits were increased; however, several other behaviors (e.g., risky sexual behaviors, substance use) were equal or lower when compared to peers. Posttraumatic stress disorder was highly prevalent and often interfered with social functioning. Delirium, eating disorders, and longer-term outcomes received inadequate attention. Conclusion: Identifying risk factors of neuropsychiatric sequelae and their impact after pediatric brain tumor resection is important for prognostication and the development of tailored management strategies for these children and adolescents.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. eHealth interventions provide a promising and accessible treatment alternative to face-to-face interventions.
   Objective: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in preventing and treating depression, anxiety, and insomnia during pregnancy. Secondary aims are to identify demographic and intervention moderators of effectiveness.
   Methods: A total of 5 databases (PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to May 2021. Terms related to eHealth, pregnancy, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), depression, anxiety, and insomnia were included. RCTs and pilot RCTs were included if they reported an eHealth intervention for the prevention or treatment of depression, anxiety, or insomnia in pregnant women. Study screening, data extractions, and quality assessment were conducted independently by 2 reviewers from an 8-member research team (KAS, PRS, Hangsel Sanguino, Roshni Sohail, Jasleen Kaur, Songyang (Mark) Jin, Makayla Freeman, and Beatrice Valmana). Random-effects meta-analyses of pooled effect sizes were conducted to determine the effect of eHealth interventions on prenatal mental health. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify potential moderators.
   Results: In total, 17 studies were included in this review that assessed changes in depression (11/17, 65%), anxiety (10/17, 59%), and insomnia (3/17, 18%). Several studies included both depression and anxiety symptoms as outcomes (7/17, 41%). The results indicated that during pregnancy, eHealth interventions showed small effect sizes for preventing and treating symptoms of anxiety and depression and a moderate effect size for treating symptoms of insomnia. With the exception of intervention type for the outcome of depressive symptoms, where mindfulness interventions outperformed other intervention types, no significant moderators were detected.
   Conclusions: eHealth interventions are an accessible and promising resource for treating symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia during pregnancy. However, more research is necessary to identify ways to increase the efficacy of eHealth interventions for this population.

AB  - BackgroundThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and control measures adopted have had a disproportionate impact on workers, with migrants being a group specifically affected but poorly studied. This scoping review aims to describe the evidence published on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of migrant workers. MethodsPapers written in English covering physical and mental health among international migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, retrieved from six electronic databases searched on July 31, 2021, were included. A total of 1,096 references were extracted, of which 26 studies were finally included. ResultsMost of the migrant populations studied were born in Asia (16 of 26) and Latin America (8 of 26) and were essential workers (15 of 26). Few studies described the length of stay in the host country (9 of 26), the legal status of the migrant population (6 of 26), or established comparison groups (7 of 26). Ten studies described COVID-19 outbreaks with high infection rates. Fourteen studies evaluated mental health (anxiety, depression, worries, fears, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder). Three of the 26 studies presented collateral positive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic because of improved hygiene. ConclusionThere is a limited number of original publications related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of migrant workers around the world. These publications mainly focus on migrants born in Asia and Latin America. The physical, long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has, so far, not been evaluated. The positive collateral effects of improving healthcare conditions for migrant workers should also be further investigated.

AB  - Fear-related disorders, mainly phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder, are highly prevalent, debilitating disorders that pose a significant public health problem. They are characterized by aberrant processing of aversive experiences and dysregulated fear extinction, leading to excessive expression of fear and diminished quality of life. The gold standard for treating fear-related disorders is extinction-based exposure therapy (ET), shown to be ineffective for up to 35% of subjects. Moreover, ET combined with traditional pharmacological treatments for fear-related disorders, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, offers no further advantage to patients. This prompted the search for ways to improve ET outcomes, with current research focused on pharmacological agents that can augment ET by strengthening fear extinction learning. Hallucinogenic drugs promote reprocessing of fear-imbued memories and induce positive mood and openness, relieving anxiety and enabling the necessary emotional engagement during psychotherapeutic interventions. Mechanistically, hallucinogens induce dynamic structural and functional neuroplastic changes across the fear extinction circuitry and temper amygdala's hyperreactivity to threat-related stimuli, effectively mitigating one of the hallmarks of fear-related disorders. This paper provides the first comprehensive review of hallucinogens' potential to alleviate symptoms of fear-related disorders by focusing on their effects on fear extinction and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We overview both preclinical and clinical studies and emphasize the advantages of hallucinogenic drugs over current first-line treatments. We highlight 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and ketamine as the most effective therapeutics for fear-related disorders and discuss the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for their potency with implications for improving hallucinogen-assisted psychotherapy.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important problem that has significant detrimental effects on the wellbeing of female victims. The chronic physical and psychological effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) are complex, long-lasting, chronic, and require treatments focusing on improving mental health issues, safety, and support. Various psycho-social intervention programs are being implemented to improve survivor wellbeing. However, little is known about the effectiveness of different treatments on IPV survivors' wellbeing. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of interventions on improving outcomes that describe the wellbeing of adult female survivors of IPV. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. We explored the effectiveness of available interventions on multiple outcomes that are critical for the wellbeing of adult female victims of IPV. To provide a broad and comprehensive view of survivors' wellbeing, we considered outcomes including mental health, physical health, diminishing further violence, social support, safety, self-efficacy, and quality of life. We reviewed 2,770 citations. Among these 25 randomized-controlled-study with a total of 4,683 participants met inclusion criteria. Findings of meta-analyses on interventions indicated promising results in improving anxiety [standardized mean difference (SMD) -7.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.39 to -5.92], depression (SMD -0.26, CI -0.56 to -0.05), safety (SMD = 0.43, CI 0.4 to -0.83), violence prevention (SMD = -0.92, CI -1.66 to -0.17), health (SMD = 0.39, CI 0.12 to 0.66), self-esteem (SMD = 1.33, CI -0.73 to 3.39), social support (SMD =0.40, CI 0.20 to 0.61), and stress management (SMD = -8.94, CI -10.48 to -7.40) at the post-test. We found that empowerment plays a vital role, especially when treating depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which are difficult to improve across interventions. We found mixed findings on self-efficacy and quality of life. The effects of IPV are long-lasting and require treatments targeting co-morbid issues including improving safety and mental health issues.

Methods: We developed a tool that makes both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store searchable using keywords and that facilitates the extraction of basic app information of the search results. All app results were filtered using various inclusion and exclusion criteria. We characterized all resultant applications according to their technical details. Furthermore, we searched for scientific publications on each app's website and PubMed, to understand whether any of the apps were supported by any type of scientific evidence on their acceptability, validation, use, effectiveness, etc. Results: Thirty apps were identified that fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The literature search yielded 27 publications related to the apps. However, these did not exclusively concern mood disorders. 6 were randomized studies and the rest included a protocol, pilot-, feasibility, case-, or qualitative studies, among others. The majority of studies were conducted on relatively small scales and 9 of the 27 studies did not explicitly study the effects of mobile application use on mental wellbeing. Conclusion: While there exists a wealth of mobile applications aimed at the treatment of mental health disorders, including mood disorders, this study showed that only a handful of these are backed by robust scientific evidence. This result uncovers a need for further clinically oriented and systematic validation and testing of such apps.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mood disorders are a leading cause of morbidity. Many patients experience treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and suicide rates are rising. Faster-acting and more effective antidepressant medications are needed. Four decades of research has transformed the use of ketamine from an anesthetic to an outpatient treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Ketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and has been shown to rapidly improve mood symptoms and suicidal ideation by targeting the glutamate system directly.
   METHODS: We used the PubMed database to identify relevant articles published until September 1, 2020. We focused on meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and original observational studies. We included relevant studies for depression, MDD, TRD, bipolar disorder, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicide, ketamine, and esketamine.
   RESULTS: Both racemic ketamine and esketamine have been shown to rapidly treat depression and suicidality. There is evidence that ketamine can be helpful for anxiety and PTSD; however, more research is needed. Intranasal esketamine has been FDA approved to treat depression.
   CONCLUSIONS: This narrative review describes the evolution of ketamine to treat mood disorders and suicidality. We provide the evidence supporting recent developments using esketamine as well as unresolved issues in the field, such as dosing and safety.

AB  - Mental disorders represent a worldwide public health concern. Psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies are recommended as first line treatments. However, evidence has emerged that their efficacy may be overestimated, due to a variety of shortcomings in clinical trials (e.g., publication bias, weak control conditions such as waiting list). We performed an umbrella review of recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies for the main mental disorders in adults. We selected meta-analyses that formally assessed risk of bias or quality of studies, excluded weak comparators, and used effect sizes for target symptoms as primary outcome. We searched PubMed and PsycINFO and individual records of the Cochrane Library for meta-analyses published between January 2014 and March 2021 comparing psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies with placebo or treatment-as-usual (TAU), or psychotherapies vs. pharmacotherapies head-to-head, or the combination of psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy to either monotherapy. One hundred and two meta-analyses, encompassing 3,782 RCTs and 650,514 patients, were included, covering depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders, insomnia, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and bipolar disorder. Across disorders and treatments, the majority of effect sizes for target symptoms were small. A random effect meta-analytic evaluation of the effect sizes reported by the largest meta-analyses per disorder yielded a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.26-0.42) for psychotherapies and 0.36 (95% CI: 0.32-0.41) for pharmacotherapies compared with placebo or TAU. The SMD for head-to-head comparisons of psychotherapies vs. pharmacotherapies was 0.11 (95% CI: -0.05 to 0.26). The SMD for the combined treatment compared with either monotherapy was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.19-0.44). Risk of bias was often high. After more than half a century of research, thousands of RCTs and millions of invested funds, the effect sizes of psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies for mental disorders are limited, suggesting a ceiling effect for treatment research as presently conducted. A paradigm shift in research seems to be required to achieve further progress.

AB  - Introduction The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic affected countries worldwide and has changed peoples' lives. A reduction in physical activity and increased mental health problems were observed, mainly in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this systematic review aims to examine the association between physical activity and mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In July 2021, a search was applied to PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria included cross-sectional, prospective, and longitudinal study designs and studies published in English; outcomes included physical activity and mental health (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, positive and negative effects, well-being). Results Thirty-one studies were included in this review. Overall, the studies suggested that higher physical activity is associated with higher well-being, quality of life as well as lower depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress, independently of age. There was no consensus for the optimal physical activity level for mitigating negative mental symptoms, neither for the frequency nor for the type of physical activity. Women were more vulnerable to mental health changes and men were more susceptive to physical activity changes. Conclusion Physical activity has been a good and effective choice to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health policies should alert for possibilities to increase physical activity during the stay-at-home order in many countries worldwide.

AB  - Aim Interpersonal trauma exposures are associated with anxiety, depression, and substance use in youth populations (aged 12-25 years). This meta-analysis reports on the efficacy of psychological interventions on these symptom domains in addition to post-traumatic stress. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of electronic databases was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing interventions for young people following interpersonal trauma exposure. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were analysed using random-effects meta-analyses. Results Of the 4832 records screened, 78 studies were reviewed, and 10 RCTs, involving 679 participants (mean age 15.6 years), were analysed. There was a large pooled effect size for post-traumatic stress (7 studies, g = 1.43, 95% CI [0.37, 2.15], p = .002) and substance use (2 studies, g = 0.70, 95% CI [-0.11, 1.22], p < .001) and small effect sizes for anxiety (4 studies, g = 0.30, 95% CI [0.10, 0.49], p = .003), and trend-level effect for depression (10 studies, g = 0.27, 95% CI [0.00, 0.54], p = .052). Heterogeneity was significant for post-traumatic stress and moderate for depression. Conclusions High-quality RCTs of psychological interventions for anxiety, depression, substance use, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in young people exposed to interpersonal trauma are scarce. While available studies show either statistically significant or trend-level efficacy for psychological interventions in reducing these symptoms, wide confidence intervals, heterogeneity and small sample size mean that results need to be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Question: Given that depression and anxiety can be comorbid to several treatable eye diseases, it is paramount to understand whether vitreous opacities are also associated with increased risk of well-being and mental health problems. The current systematic review summarises research examining psychological implications of vitreous opacities in adult patients.Study selection and analysis: PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, Global Health, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Science Direct were systematically searched for all articles published up to May 5th 2021. Inclusion criteria included studies that have assessed outcomes related to patients' mental health; well-being; quality of life; coping with the disease; studies exploring patients' experiences/perceptions/cognitions of illness and/or medical treatments related to vitreous opacities.Findings: 5 studies were included in this review, with a total of 139 patients [278 eyes] assessed. Patients' age ranged from 32 to 78 years old. Compared with healthy controls, patients with vitreous opacities showed significantly higher levels of symptoms of depression, perceived stress, state anxiety, and trait anxiety. Studies also suggested that patients are more likely to show low vision-related quality of life, and social functioning. Studies also suggested a significant positive effect of medical treatments [e.g. pars plana victretomy] on patients' symptoms of depression and anxiety and on patients' vision-related quality of life.Conclusions: The topic of psychological implications of vitreous opacities is still relatively new in the literature with very preliminary evidence of mental health problems and reduced quality of life associated with this condition.

AB  - Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) are at high risk of developing mental health concerns across several domains. The aim of this study is to determine the updated, global frequency of these outcomes. Methods A multistep literature search was performed from database inception until March 1, 2021. PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant systematic review and PROSPERO protocol were used to identify studies reporting on depression, anxiety, acute stress, post-traumatic symptoms, insomnia, and burnout in HCWs exposed to COVID-19. A quantitative meta-analysis with random effects was conducted to analyze the proportion rate of the mental health disorders. Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the effect of the different continents and scales. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of gender, age, and work position. Results 239 articles were included (n = 271,319 HCWs, mean age = 36.08 +/- 8.33 (66.99% female). 33% HCWs exposed to COVID-19 reported depressive symptoms (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 28-38%), 42% anxiety features (95% CI = 35-48), 40% acute stress (95% CI = 32-47), 32% post-traumatic symptoms (95% CI = 26-37%), 42% insomnia (95% CI = 36-48), 37% burnout (95% CI = 31-42). Sensitivity analyses did not show statistically significant differences. Meta-regressions found a statistically significant lower prevalence of post-traumatic symptoms in Asia. Conclusions HCWs exposed to COVID-19 were found to have a significant prevalence of mental health concerns in all domains analyzed. The effects of COVID-19 on HCWs' mental health could be underestimated and the future consequences dismissed.

AB  - Several reviews focused on the use of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) across different populations. This review synthesized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital CBT on psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms). An extensive search was conducted in 10 databases from inception until August 29, 2021. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed using Hedges' g. The potential sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analyses and meta regression analysis. A total of 18 RCTs in 2514 perinatal women were identified from over 23 countries. The sample size ranged from 25 to 910. Meta-analyses showed that digital CBT significantly reduced depression (g =-0.56, 95% CI:-0.85,-0.27, I-2 = 84.81%, p < 0.001), anxiety (g =-0.30, 95% CI:-0.44, 0.17, I-2 = 0%, p < 0.001), and stress (g =-0.75, 95% CI:-0.95,-0.56, I-2 = 0%, p < 0.001) symptoms at post-intervention and stress symptoms at follow-up (g =-0.52, 95% CI:-0.93,-0.11, I-2 = 0%, p = 0.01) compared with those in the control group. Subgroup analyses highlighted that the intervention was effective when CBT was combined with other therapeutic components which delivered via a mobile application. Preferable features of intervention should be more than eight sessions and conducted for than 6 weeks among postnatal women. Multivariable meta regression showed that age was a significant covariate on depression symptoms. The sample size in the selected RCTs was small, and the overall quality of the evidence was very low. Digital CBT is a potential intervention for alleviating psychological outcomes in perinatal women. This review suggests the essential features to optimize the intervention effect. Further well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes are necessary.

AB  - Objectives:& nbsp;This study aims to systematically analyze the effects of mind-body exercises on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and anxiety in patients with PTSD. Furthermore, it intends to provide scientific evidence-based exercise prescriptions.& nbsp;Methods:& nbsp;Chinese (i.e., China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, and Wanfang) and English (i.e., Web of Science, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE) databases were used as data sources to search for studies on the effects of mind-body exercises on symptoms associated with patients with PTSD from January 1980 to November 2020. After a rigorous screening, 16 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis.& nbsp;Results:& nbsp;Mind-body exercises exerted a significant effect on PTSD symptoms [standard mean difference (SMD) = -0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.64 to -0.19, p < 0.001], depression (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.55 to -0.15, p < 0.001), and anxiety (SMD = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.74 to -0.12, p < 0.001) among patients with PTSD. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that 60-150 min per session for 8-16 weeks of mindfulness was more effective in improving symptoms in patients with PTSD under 45 years of age compared with other subgroups. For depression, 150-180 min of yoga exercises once per week was effective. For anxiety, the frequency, timing, duration, and type of mind-body exercises that are most effective in relieving anxiety in patients with PTSD cannot be determined at this time due to the limited number of eligible RCTs.& nbsp;Conclusions:& nbsp;Mind-body exercises were found to be significantly effective in improving PTSD symptoms, depression, and anxiety in patients with PTSD. Therefore, they can be used as an adjunct to intervention for symptoms of patients with PTSD. However, this conclusion requires further confirmation through additional scientific and objective RCTs.Systematic Review Registration:Unique Identifier: .

AB  - Objective: This meta-review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of overall mental health of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.Method: We conducted a comprehensive literature search on Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE. A predefined eligibility criterion was used to screen the articles. The methodology quality of eligible studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for systematic reviews. The data were narratively synthesised in line with the meta-review aim.Result: Forty systematic reviews (represented as K = 40), which reported data from 1,828 primary studies (N) and 3,245,768 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The findings from a pooled prevalence indicate that anxiety (16-41%, K = 30, N = 701), depression (14-37%, K = 28, N = 584), and stress/post-traumatic stress disorder (18.6-56.5%, K = 24, N = 327) were the most prevailing COVID-19 pandemic-related mental health conditions affecting healthcare workers. Other reported concerns included insomnia, burnout, fear, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatization symptoms, phobia, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts. Considering regions/countries, the highest anxiety was reported in the United-Kingdom [22.3, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):7-38, N = 4] compared to other countries, while the highest depression was in the Middle-East, (41, 95% CI:16-60, N = 5) and stress in the Eastern Mediterranean region (61.6, 95% CI:56.4-66.8, N = 2) compared to other regions. The most significant risk factors include female gender, younger age, being a nurse, and frontline professional. The most-reported coping strategies include individual/group psychological support, family/relative support, training/orientation, and the adequacy of personal protective equipment.Conclusion: It was concluded that healthcare professionals (nurses, doctors, allied health) have experienced various mental health issues during COVID-19 pandemic. The meta-review, therefore, recommends targeted interventions and health policies that address specific mental health issues to support health professionals worldwide during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar future health crises.

AB  - Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises a series of rare hereditary connective tissue diseases characterized by joint hypermobility, joint dislocation, and hyperextensibility of the skin, as well as cardiovascular involvement. EDS is often associated with chronic widespread physical pain, which can lead to psychological pain. Poor awareness and limited diagnosis of EDS and related symptoms result in decreased self-esteem and confusion regarding physical sensation. Furthermore, EDS imposes substantial psychological burden on patients due to exercise restriction, scars, keloids, and subcutaneous fat accumulation on the extremities, which leads to parental overprotection and bullying experiences from other children at school age. Recent large-scale studies have suggested that patients with EDS have a higher risk of mood disorders than the general population. Other cohort studies indicated high prevalence of anorexia nervosa, addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder, and anxiety disorder were found in patients with EDS. Case reports instead indicated that some psychiatric disorders were secondary symptoms due to physical problems from EDS. Therefore, psychiatrists must be more knowledgeable and proactive about EDS in their practice. We review the previous case reports and literature for patients with EDS, along with our own case of complicated psychiatric problems, which are strongly related to early stressful situations through childhood and adolescence. This is to aid general psychiatrists in the discussion of appropriate medical management in such infrequent, yet challenging conditions.

AB  - Background and Purpose The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of students and exacerbated the prevalence of anxiety among them. The purpose of the literature review was to consolidate evidence for the prevalence of anxiety among students of higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic and to underscore the effect of various pandemic-related factors on this anxiety. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted utilizing various databases such as MEDLINE, PsycInfo Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Embase to identify relevant studies. To be incorporated in this review, studies had to include students of higher education, measure the prevalence of anxiety, and assess anxiety during Covid-19 pandemic. Results 37 studies met the inclusion criteria and assessed the prevalence of anxiety among students during confinement. Studies showed that more than one-third of the students suffered from anxiety during the early stages of the pandemic. Moreover, being a female, living in rural areas, facing financial hardship, working full-time, spending the quarantine in isolation, worrying about infection for themselves and others, having the uncertainty of the future, having reduced sleep quality, and transitioning to online learning, were factors associated with increased anxiety during the pandemic. Conclusion Anxiety was shown to be highly prevalent among the student population during the Covid-19 pandemic. Higher education institutions and governments should take action to ensure the safety and the physical, social, and mental wellbeing of the students.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis generates evidence of the prevalence and associated factors of common mental disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) related to the pandemic among the Saudi general population. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was performed in the respective databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science), from 22 July to 17 August 2021, and identified a total of 220 articles. Adhering to the inclusion criteria (i.e., original research concerning the prevalence and/or associated factors of depression and/or anxiety and/or stress disorders among the general Saudi population, published in English peer-reviewed journals), 15 studies were included in this review which consisted of a total of 262,656 participants. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22% to 38%, I-2 = 99.58%), 20% (95% CI: 16% to 24%, I-2 = 99.32%), and 29% (95% CI: 11% to 47%, I-2 = 99.76%), respectively. Risk factors of mental health problems were found to be female sex, younger age group, single/divorced marital status, lower education, lower income, non-Saudis, unemployment status, students, being in a small family and living with elderly of the sociodemographic factors. Smokers, less physical activities, lower resilience, reduced immune status, chronic health problems, and psychiatric illness history were associated with a higher degree of mental health problems. In addition, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related risk factors of mental illness included lack of knowledge, fear, worry and concern, family member or friends' infection or death, lockdown restrictions, quarantine, confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 infection, and even pandemic effects. In conclusion, appropriate mental health preventive approaches for the Saudi general people are highly needed, where this review can be worthy of help by providing in detailed information to the respective authorities.

AB  - Background The immense social upheaval and ongoing humanitarian crisis created by the 2011 war in Syria has forced millions of civilians to flee their homeland, many of whom seek refugee status in Western nations. Whilst it is known that the prevalence of mental illness is higher within refugee populations, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to pool the prevalence rates of common mental disorders (namely posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and generalized anxiety disorder) in adult Syrian refugees resettled in high income Western countries. Methods Seven electronic databases (Medline, PsychInfo, CINAHL, PTSDpubs, SCOPUS, PubMed and Embase) were searched up to the 31st of December 2020. Using pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria, relevant articles were screened by title and abstract, and later by full text. A meta-analysis was used to estimate the prevalence rates for each mental illness. Results Eleven studies met the eligibility criteria for the systematic review. Nine of these studies had a low-moderate risk of bias and were included in the meta-analysis. Of the 4873 refugees included in the meta-analysis, the total pooled prevalence rate of having any of the three mental disorders was 33% (CI 95%, 27-40%), 40% for anxiety (CI 95%, 31-50%), 31% for depression (CI 95%, 20-44%) and 31% for PTSD (CI 95%, 22-41%). A meta-regression revealed that the total pooled prevalence rate for having any of the three mental disorders was not influenced by age, host country, duration in host country, educational or marital status. Conclusions Despite significant study heterogeneity, the prevalence rates of common mental disorders in adult Syrian refugees resettled in high-income Western countries are significantly higher than reported rates in the general population.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood or feeling of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in everyday activities. Depressed individuals have a cognitive impairment, low self-esteem, difficulty making decisions, feeling helpless and hopeless. The factors that have been associated with depression include the lack of social support, living in rural areas, suffering from chronic diseases, smoking, and alcohol abuse. This study aimed to investigate the global prevalence of major depressive disorder in the elderly.
   Method: The electronic database such as Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, SID, PubMed, Google Scholar, Mag Iran, and IranDoc were systematically searched for studies reporting the prevalence of major depressive disorderin the elderly published up to March 2021. Meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. Heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated using the I-2 index. Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test was used to assess publication bias.
   Result: A total of 20 studies involving 18953 participants were included in this study. The global prevalence of major depression in the elderly was 13.3 % (95 % CI: 8.4-20.3 %). In the subgroup analysis, the prevalence of major depression in elderly women was 11.9 % (95 % CI: 7.6-18.6) and men 9.7 % (95 % CI: 5.2-17.3). No comparison was made between the two sexes, but based on the confidence intervals and large overlap, the two groups are not statistically different. Among continents, Australia had the highest prevalence of major depression in the elderly at 20.1 % (CI: 14.5-27.2 %). This was followed by Europe at 12.9 % (95 % CI: 5.1-28.9 %).
   Conclusion: Major depressive disorder has a growing trend in the elderly population of the world. The prevalence of major depression in the elderly depends on various clinical and demographic factors such as age and gender. Therefore, mental health and the quality of life (QoL) of the elderly are important. The present study emphasizes the importance of social support in mental health that can reduce depression in the elderly.

AB  - A recent rapid review highlighted the negative psychological impacts of quarantining during coronavirus outbreaks on the public. However, to date, there has been no review of the psychological impacts of coronavirus on adults using research from community samples and not restricted to people quarantined during coronavirus. A rapid review was conducted to provide timely evidence about the mental health implications of coronavirus outbreaks on adults and to inform psychological research concerning the current COVID-19 outbreak. Three databases and Google Scholar were searched and a total of 27 studies were identified. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were identified during coronavirus outbreaks alongside concerns about becoming infected and family becoming infected. Those with pre-existing mental health conditions, young adults, women and those reporting physical symptoms appear to be vulnerable to negative psychological outcomes during coronavirus outbreaks. How people think about and understand coronavirus, and the coping strategies employed by people, may play a role in mitigating negative psychological outcomes. Results demonstrate the adverse psychological impacts of coronavirus outbreaks on adults and the need for continued investment in mental health services for the wider community during these times. Further longitudinal research is required to ascertain the long-term psychological consequences of coronavirus outbreaks. This review can be used to inform continued research on the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental distress is often endured by injured workers participating in the rehabilitation or return to work process following a physical injury. Delays in detecting the onset and treating mental distress can lead to a diverse range of cognitive and behavioural changes that may precipitate psychological distress such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to provide an overview of existing health questionnaires utilised by health care providers and affiliated researchers. It reviewed their effectiveness and suitability to detect mental distress endured by injured workers engaged in the return to work process.
   METHODS: A scoping review methodology was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework which examined peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and March 2020 comprising health questionnaires. Database searches included Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO combining specific MeSH terms and key words.
   RESULTS: The full search identified 3168 articles. Following full screening a total of 164 articles reviewed the use of health questionnaires and specific criteria to determine their suitability. Most of the health questionnaires reviewed were used as screening measures for identifying both work and non-work-related psychological hazards. However, they were found to be limited in their application when considering all potential predictors of delayed return to work such as poor or stressful interactions with stakeholders, financial stress and the injured workers experience of the RTW process.
   CONCLUSION: Earlier identification of mental distress using an optimal MHSQ followed by appropriate intervention will reduce the risk of psychological injury becoming cumulative on a physical workplace injury. Without such complications, early return to work can be achieved with significant cost saving to the economy.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to synthesize published literature on seafarers' mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This scoping review searched four electronic databases for literature on the mental health and wellbeing of seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Fourteen studies were included in the review. Few reported on the prevalence of mental health conditions. Only one compared mental health data gathered during the pandemic to pre-pandemic matched samples, suggesting symptoms of depression and anxiety were greater during the pandemic. There was some evidence that mental health worsened with longer stays on board during the pandemic and being on board longer than expected. Crew exchange difficulties forced many participants to extend their contracts or delay repatriation, often with little information as to when they might get to go home, leading them to feel they had no control over their lives and causing concern about fatigue and the potential for accidents and injuries. Participants described other challenges such as denial of shore leave; concerns about finances and future employment; loneliness and isolation; fears of COVID-19 infection; limited access to essential supplies; and feeling unsupported by management. Conclusions Maritime organizations must understand how best to support their staff in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and in any other prolonged crises that may arise in the future. Recommendations include ensuring that staff feel valued by their organization; enhancing work-related autonomy; ensuring that communication is accurate, consistent, and timely; and using lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic to inform emergency preparedness policies.

AB  - Introduction: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been growing progressively as treatment options in the field of mental health. Aim: To assess the impact of mindfulness-based interventions for reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
   Methods: A systematic review was performed in December 2020 using PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SciELO, Pepsic, and LILACS databases with no year restrictions. The search strategy included the terms ('mindfulness' OR 'mindfulness-based') AND ('suicide' OR 'suicidal' OR 'suicide risk' OR 'suicide attempt' OR 'suicide ideation' OR 'suicide behavior'). The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), CRD42020219514.
   Results: A total of 14 studies met all inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Most of the studies presented Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy as the MBI assessed (n=10). An emerging and rapidly growing literature on MBI presents promising results in reduction of suicide risk, particularly in patients with MDD. Four studies assessing other MBI treatment protocols (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction; Daily Mindfulness Meditation Practice; Mind Body Awareness and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy) all demonstrated that MBI reduces factors associated with suicide risk.
   Conclusion: MBI might target specific processes and contribute to suicide risk reduction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care providers (HCPs) and health care students experience a huge amount of stress due to high workloads and pressure to perform and are likely to develop anxiety, depression and burnout.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective was to carry out an umbrella review of systematic and narrative reviews on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing stress and improving well-being in HCPs and health care students.
   METHODS: Systematic and narrative reviews that examined the impact of mindfulness-based interventions on HCPs and healthcare students' perceived stress were identified through a systematic search of three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science.
   RESULTS: Fifteen articles were included in the analysis: eleven systematic and four narrative reviews. Studies' quality varied from critically low to high. The different interventions showed positive results in reducing stress in both HCPs and students, with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course having the major impact.
   CONCLUSIONS: MBSR techniques and other mindfulness-based interventions resulted to be potentially effective in reducing stress. However, despite the vast amount of data collected by the studies and the promising results, several limitations affected the validity of the studies. Therefore, more research that considers the critical aspects of this field is required, in order to provide more reliable results.

AB  - There is a dearth of evidence synthesis on the prevalence of anxiety among university students even though the risk of psychological disorders among this population is quite high. We conducted a quantitative systematic review to estimate the global prevalence of anxiety among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search for cross-sectional studies on PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO, using PRISMA guidelines, was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021. A total of 36 studies were included, using a random-effects model to calculate the pooled proportion of anxiety. A meta-analysis of the prevalence estimate of anxiety yielded a summary prevalence of 41% (95% CI = 0.34-0.49), with statistically significant evidence of between-study heterogeneity (Q = 80801.97, I-2 = 100%, p <= 0.0001). A subgroup analysis reported anxiety prevalence in Asia as 33% (95% CI:0.25-0.43), the prevalence of anxiety in Europe as 51% (95% CI: 0.44-0.59), and the highest prevalence of anxiety in the USA as 56% (95% CI: 0.44-0.67). A subgroup gender-based analysis reported the prevalence of anxiety in females as 43% (95% CI:0.29-0.58) compared to males with an anxiety prevalence of 39% (95% CI:0.29-0.50). University students seem to have a high prevalence of anxiety, indicating an increased mental health burden during this pandemic.

AB  - Both mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) and systemic injuries trigger a transient neuroinflammatory response that result in similar clinical outcome. The ensuing physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms fail to subside in approximately 15-20% of the concussed population. Emotional impairments, particularly depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are commonly associated with poor recovery following mTBI. These emotional impairments also have a significant neuroinflammatory component. We hypothesized that the inflammatory cytokines seen in mTBI patients with emotional symptoms would coincide with those commonly seen in patients with emotional symptoms without mTBI. A systematic review was conducted to identify the most common neuroinflammatory cytokines in the mTBI population with psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, PTSD). The electronic databases EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PUBMED, and PSYCINFO were searched from data inception to 31 August 2021. A systematic screening approach was employed from screening to data analysis. A total of 994 articles were screened, 108 were selected for full article review, and 8 were selected for data analysis. The included studies consisted of 875 patients of which 81.3% were male. The mean sample size of patients with at least one mTBI was 73.8 +/- 70.3 (range, 9-213), with a mean age of 33.9 +/- 4.8 years. The most common cytokines associated with poor psychological outcomes involving PTSD and/or depression in the chronic mTBI population were IL-6, TNF alpha, IL-10, and CRP.

AB  - There are increasing concerns about internet gaming disorder (IGD). No review of existing studies has system-atically analyzed and visualized the trends of IGD and those early identification of symptoms related to IGD beha-viors. This critical review focuses on the emerging trends for early identification of symptoms related to IGD behaviors in papers published in Web of Science Core Collection from 2009 to 2021 by scientometric analysis and critical review. Scientometric data analysis technique includes co-occurrence analysis, cluster analysis and burst analysis of authors, countries, keywords and co-citation to visualize those contributing and associated fac-tors to develop IGD behaviors and their relationships to mental-emotional symptoms. About 81.8% of the papers were published in the following countries: United States, United Kingdom, Australia, China and South Korea. The top co-occurrence keywords were 'children', 'depression', 'anxiety' and 'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)', 'scale', identifying the population, characteristics and commonly used assessment tools that are suscep-tible to certain symptoms relating to IGD of which influencing factors facilitate the understanding of the associa-tion of sociodemographic characteristics. The main emerging topics were identified in this critical review after conducted the scientometric analysis. The results identified five topics: game impulse, motivation, evaluation scale, mediating effects and diagnostic criteria. This study provides an overview of the research trends on the identity and development of the IGD field of study.

AB  - The health and safety of LGBTQI+ migrants or migrants who are of diverse sexual orientation, gender identity or expression (SOGIE) remains an under-studied area, particularly for the period during transit from their place of origin to destination. This systematic review aims to describe the literature on the health risks and consequences among SOGIE migrants during transit and examine their access and use of services. Six peer-reviewed databases and websites of nine large migration organisations were searched to identify the literature on forced migrants and sexual and gender minorities. Twenty English-language studies from 2000-2021 were included and analysed drawing on a conceptual framework. Studies emerged from six regions and the majority of research participants identified as gay men. In general, quality appraisal demonstrated studies as either medium or high quality. Findings suggested five common themes associated with SOGIE health and well-being, including: daily exposure to discrimination, harassment and violence; coping, social support and resilience; access to services; mental health; and physical and sexual health. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were prevalent amongst SOGIE migrants, particularly when associated with detention or camp environments, and were exacerbated by social isolation. Barriers to accessing healthcare were identified and specific sexual health services were often found lacking, especially for trans persons. Unsurprisingly, during transit, SOGIE migrants are very likely to experience the double marginalisation of their migrant or minority status and their gender identity. Results indicate that services for SOGIE migrants need to tailor service access and support approaches to respond to the particular health and protection needs of SOGIE individuals in each setting.

AB  - The Colombian armed conflict has had an impact on all the population's life dimensions, including their biopsychosocial health; thus, it is relevant to assess how this topic has been addressed, and the instruments used to measure mental health indicators. This research reviewed scientific article's approach mental health indicators of population exposed to armed conflict, which used instruments for that purpose. A scoping review of scientific articles was carried out following the PRISMA methodology and using the CADIMA software. The bibliographic search was made in Web of Science, Scielo and Scopus databases, using key terms in both English and Spanish. 21 articles which used 53 instruments were analyzed, the most applied being the AUDIT and the CIDI-CAPI. Most of the works sought to characterize mental health in different victimized populations, finding diagnoses such as post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, and substance use. Few studies of validation or construction of instruments were found. It is necessary to develop and validate tests to evaluate the effects of the conflict on mental health in Colombian victim populations that go beyond the diagnostic emphasis and allow a better assessment of those consequences.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic affects people's psychological well-being as well as their risk of physical complications. Under the circumstance, it is essential to synthesize the existing evidence on psychological consequences with a view to fostering policymaking. Thus, a systematic attempt was compiled to review the Bangladeshi literature related to common mental health problems (i.e. depression, anxiety, and stress) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed using Medline or PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PsyArxiv, MedRxiv, and ResearchGate, between 20 December 2020 and 5 March 2021, followed by predetermined eligibility criteria. The inclusion criteria for this review were observational studies involving at least one mental health problem (i.e. stress, depression, and anxiety) published in peer-reviewed journals or preprint servers in the English language after the inception of the pandemic in Bangladesh. The pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 47% (95% CI 39-55%, I-2 = 99.14%), 47% (95% CI 39-54%, I-2 = 99.78%), and 44% (95% CI 30-58%, I-2 = 99.36%), respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that students were experiencing a higher rate of depression, anxiety, and stress than general people and healthcare professionals. The associated risk factors of mental health problems were gender, age, residence area, family size, monthly family income, educational status, marital status, physical exercise, smoking, alcohol use, fear of COVID-19, presence of chronic illness, unemployment status, and exposure to COVID-19-related news and social media. This systematic review provides baseline data on the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress across various Bangladeshi cohorts, which are anticipated to be helpful to the respective authorities for implementing cohort-specific mental health strategies.

AB  - Parents have experienced considerable challenges and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact their well-being. This meta-analysis sought to identify: (1) the prevalence of depression and anxiety in parents of young children (<age 5) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) sociodemographic (e.g., parent age, being racially minoritized) and methodological moderators (e.g., study quality) that explain heterogeneity among studies. A systematic search was conducted across four databases from January 1, 2020 to March 3, 2021. A total of 18 non-overlapping studies (8981 participants), all focused on maternal mental health, met inclusion criteria. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted. Pooled prevalence estimates for clinically significant depression and anxiety symptoms for mothers of young children during the COVID-19 pandemic were 26.9% (95% CI: 21.3-33.4) and 41.9% (95% CI: 26.7-58.8), respectively. Prevalence of clinically elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were higher in Europe and North America and among older mothers. Clinically elevated depressive symptoms were lower in studies with a higher percentage of individuals who were racially minoritized. In comparison, clinically elevated anxiety symptoms were higher among studies of low study quality and in samples with highly educated mothers. Policies and resources targeting improvements in maternal mental health are essential.

AB  - Background In the past two decades, subanaesthetic doses of ketamine have been demonstrated to have rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, and accumulating research has demonstrated ketamine's therapeutic effects for a range of psychiatric conditions. Aims In light of these findings surrounding ketamine's psychotherapeutic potential, we systematically review the extant evidence on ketamine's effects in treating mental health disorders. Method The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (identifier CRD42019130636). Human studies investigating the therapeutic effects of ketamine in the treatment of mental health disorders were included. Because of the extensive research in depression, bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. We searched Medline and PsycINFO on 21 October 2020. Risk-of-bias analysis was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Checklist. Results We included 83 published reports in the final review: 33 systematic reviews, 29 randomised controlled trials, two randomised trials without placebo, three non-randomised trials with controls, six open-label trials and ten retrospective reviews. The results were presented via narrative synthesis. Conclusions Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide support for robust, rapid and transient antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine. Evidence for other indications is less robust, but suggests similarly positive and short-lived effects. The conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias of included studies. Optimal dosing, modes of administration and the most effective forms of adjunctive psychotherapeutic support should be examined further.

AB  - Accumulating clinical evidence shows that psychedelic therapy, by synergistically combining psychopharmacology and psychological support, offers a promising transdiagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with restricted and/or maladaptive habitual patterns of emotion, cognition and behavior, notably, depression (MDD), treatment resistant depression (TRD) and addiction disorders, but perhaps also anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and eating disorders. Despite the emergent transdiagnostic evidence, the specific clinical dimensions that psychedelics are efficacious for, and associated underlying neurobiological pathways, remain to be well-characterized. To this end, this review focuses on pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the acute and sustained therapeutic potential of psychedelic therapy in the context of a transdiagnostic dimensional systems framework. Focusing on the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) as a template, we will describe the multimodal mechanisms underlying the transdiagnostic therapeutic effects of psychedelic therapy, traversing molecular, cellular and network levels. These levels will be mapped to the RDoC constructs of negative and positive valence systems, arousal regulation, social processing, cognitive and sensorimotor systems. In summarizing this literature and framing it transdiagnostically, we hope we can assist the field in moving toward a mechanistic understanding of how psychedelics work for patients and eventually toward a precise-personalized psychedelic therapy paradigm.

Moderate effect sizes were noted with sleep disorders [-0.45 (95% CI, -0.70 to -0.20, P = 0.0004)]. There was no evident impact of CBT on fatigue or QOL. We found an intervention period > 8 weeks was advantageous compared with < 8 weeks, and CBT implemented in non-group was more effective than in group. Between the delivery methods, no significant difference was found.<br>Conclusion: We found that CBT in patients with PD was an efficacious therapy for some non-motor symptoms in PD, but not efficacious for fatigue and QOL. These results suggest that CBT results in significant improvement in PD and should be used as a conventional clinical intervention.

AB  - Burnout can be defined as an occupational syndrome resulting from poorly managed chronic workplace stress. It is characterized by three dimensions: feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and reduced professional efficacy. Teachers are among the human service professionals particularly vulnerable to occupational burnout. Teaching is a highly demanding and challenging task, in that requires constant confrontation with different stakeholders (students and their parents, administrators). Among teachers, physical education teachers have been particularly understudied even though a recently published systematic review has found that they are exposed to high levels of stress. To better explore burnout syndrome among physical education teachers, the present systematic review was undertaken, searching up to six languages. Fifty-six studies were included in the present review. The reported rate of high emotional exhaustion ranged from 11.52 to 60.6%, according to the single study. Pooling together 12 studies and totaling 2,153 physical education teachers, the prevalence rate of high emotional exhaustion was computed to be 28.6 [95% CI 21.9-35.8]. The reported rate of high depersonalization ranged from 3.6 to 45.2%, according to the single study. Pooling together 11 studies and totaling 2,113 physical education teachers, the prevalence rate of high depersonalization was computed to be 14.5% [95% CI 8.0-22.4]. The reported rate of low personal accomplishment ranged from 13.63 to 55.6%, according to the single study. Pooling together 12 studies and totaling 2,153 physical education teachers, the prevalence rate of low personal accomplishment was computed to be 29.5% [95% CI 23.8-35.4]. The reported rate of overall burnout ranged from 10.0 to 51.6%, according to the single study. Pooling together 7 studies and totaling 1,101 physical education teachers, the prevalence rate of overall burnout was computed to be 23.9% [95% CI 13.6-36.0]. No evidence of publication bias could be found, both visually inspecting the funnel plot and conducting the Egger's linear regression test. Burnout imposes a significant burden among physical education teachers. Based on the information contained in the present systematic review and meta-analysis, tailored interventions could be designed to mitigate such a burden. However, due to the limitations of the studies included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis, further research in the field is urgently warranted.

AB  - Objectives Common mental health problems (CMHP) represent a major health issue and burden to employees and employers. Under certain conditions work contributes to wellbeing and participation of employees with CMHP. Promoting work participation is important, however the specific conditions in which work participation occurs is complex and largely unclear. This calls for a novel, realistic approach to unravel the complex relationship between outcomes, context and underlying mechanisms of work participation.
   Methods In the present realist review, peer-reviewed studies conducted between 1995 and 2020 were systematically reviewed on the outcome measures 'stay at work' (SAW) and 'work performance' (WP). The database search from seven databases identified 2235 records, of which 61 studies met the selection criteria and methodological rigor.
   Results The synthesis demonstrates how work participation is promoted by the following mechanisms and contextual factors: (i) organizational climate and leadership, (ii) social support, (iii) perceived job characteristics, (iv) coping styles, (v) health symptoms and severity, (vi) personal characteristics, and (vii) features of interventions. An explanatory framework, based on the Capability-for-Work model, presents a new set of capabilities leading to SAW and WP.
   Conclusions This systematic realist review revealed mechanisms and contextual factors that promote both SAW and WP among employees with CMHP. These show how the organizational climate, social support in the work context, job characteristics and certain capabilities enable employees with CMHP to participate at work. Our contributions and practical implications are discussed, providing valuable insights for employers, professionals and researchers in the development of evidence-based interventions.

AB  - Background: Although grief and its symptoms constitute a normal reaction to experiences of loss, some of those affected still report elevated levels of distress after an extended period, often termed complicated grief. Beneficial treatment effects of face-to-face therapies, for example, grief counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy against complicated grief, have been reported. Evaluations of internet-and mobile-based interventions targeting symptoms of grief in bereaved individuals with regard to objective quality criteria are currently lacking.
   Objective: We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness and feasibility of internet-and mobile-based interventions against symptoms of grief after bereavement.
   Methods: We conducted systematic literature searches of randomized controlled trials or feasibility studies published before January 9, 2020, following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, in PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, and the Cochrane Library. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations system. We further assessed aspects of feasibility and rated quality of interventions using criteria suggested by an expert panel on mental health care (German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, and Psychosomatics). A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to assess between-group effect sizes.
   Results: In total, 9 trials (N=1349) were included. Of these, 7 studies were analyzed meta-analytically. Significant effects were found for symptoms of grief (g=0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.77), depression (g=0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.68), and posttraumatic stress (g=0.82, 95% CI 0.63-1.01). Heterogeneity was moderate for grief and depression (I-2=48.75% and 55.19%, respectively) and low for posttraumatic stress symptoms (I-2=0%). The overall quality of evidence was graded low (grief and depression) to moderate (posttraumatic stress). User satisfaction with the interventions was high, as was the quality of the interventions assessed using objective quality criteria.
   Conclusions: Internet-or mobile-based interventions might constitute an effective treatment approach against symptoms of grief in bereaved adults. However, the small sample sizes and limited number of studies included in the review warrant further investigation.

AB  - Introduction There has been a global increase in the prevalence of common mental disorders (CMD), particularly in conflict hotspots. The limited amount of resources is one of the key barriers to effective treatment within Low- and Middle-income countries (LAMICs). The lack of service provision for mental health disorders in LAMICs has resulted in limited opportunities to conduct mental health research. Libya is a North African country that has suffered from ongoing conflict with the current political unrest in Libya further impacting the mental health of the population. Main text The aim of this review is to conduct a synthesis of evidence regarding the estimated prevalence and associated risk factors of CMD in Libya. A search was completed in the academic databases; PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINHAL, and the Institute for Development, Research, Advocacy and Applied Care (IDRAAC) from inception to March 2020. Only studies that investigated prevalence and associated risk factors of CMD in Libya were included. A total of 219 studies were identified of which 15 met the inclusion criteria for the review. There were (n = 3) papers investigated the prevalence of depression, (n = 4) studies were focused on stress-related disorders and the remaining papers looked at both anxiety and depression. Statistically, sample sizes of the included studies ranged from (n = 41-13,031) for the prevalence studies (mean = 1188.6, median = 233). Conclusion The status of Libya as a conflict hotspot has led to a reduced level of epidemiological data on mental health, with a vital need to conduct research in CMD. Libya requires better clinical governance which can allow for more scientific research into CMD and enabling the Libyan government to develop evidence-based policy initiatives for CMD.

AB  - Transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) individuals are at a high risk of adverse mental health outcomes due to minority stress-the stress faced by individuals categorised as stigmatised social minority groups. This systematic review sought to summarise the key mental health findings of the research on TGNC individuals in mainland China. We also aimed to consolidate research on the topic, identify specific mental health disparities, and offer new perspectives for future research to inform both policy and dinical practice. An extensive search of the literature, published in English and Chinese, was done between jan 1, 1990, and Aug 1, 2021, using PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Wanfang (in Chinese), and CNKI (in Chinese). Overall, two qualitative and 28 quantitative articles were identified. The quantitative findings showed a high prevalence of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and stress-related issues, and greater disparities in psychological wellbeing. High prevalence is also reported in suicidality and self-harm behaviours in this group. Across the two qualitative studies, attributable factors included gender-related discrimination, barriers to accessing health services, low social support, decreased knowledge and awareness of HIV prevention, and demographic characteristics-such as marital status, educational level, and gender identity. This Review also found little evidence of gender-affirming care and mental health interventions in mainland China. Following from these results, the next step is to integrate multi-level, social-psychological interventions with education to reduce cultural stereotypes and transphobia in mainland China. Political and social implications are also discussed to inform a standard set of guidelines for transgender-indusive health-care services, including advocating for funding to create these special care programmes and services.

AB  - Background Mental disorders in comorbidity with chronic skin diseases may worsen disease outcome and patients' quality of life. We hypothesized the comorbidity of depression, anxiety syndromes, or symptoms as attributable to biological mechanisms that the combined diseases share. Methods We conducted a systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement searching into PubMed, PsycInfo, and Scopus databases. We examined the literature regarding the comorbidity of psoriasis (Ps), atopic dermatitis (AD), or hidradenitis suppurativa with depression and/or anxiety in adults >= 18 years and the hypothetical shared underlying biological mechanisms. Results Sixteen studies were analyzed, mostly regarding Ps and AD. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways arose as shared mechanisms in Ps animal models with depression- and/or anxiety-like behaviors. Activated microglia and neuroinflammatory responses emerged in AD depressive models. As to genetic studies, atopic-dermatitis patients with comorbid anxiety traits carried the short variant of serotonin transporter and a polymorphism of the human translocator protein gene. A GA genotype of catechol-O-methyltransferase gene was instead associated with Ps. Reduced natural killer cell activity, IL-4, serotonin serum levels, and increased plasma cortisol and IgE levels were hypothesized in comorbid depressive AD patients. In Ps patients with comorbid depression, high serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-18, as well as IL-17A, were presumed to act as shared inflammatory mechanisms. Conclusions Further studies should investigate mental disorders and chronic skin diseases concurrently across patients' life course and identify their temporal relation and biological correlates. Future research should also identify biological characteristics of individuals at high risk of the comorbid disorders and associated complications.

AB  - Background. Self-report screening instruments are frequently used as scalable methods to detect common mental disorders (CMDs), but their validity across cultural and linguistic groups is unclear. We summarized the diagnostic accuracy of brief questionnaires on symptoms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Arabic-speaking adults.
   Methods. Five databases were searched from inception to 22 January 2021 (PROSPERO: CRD42018070645). Studies were included when diagnostic accuracy of brief (maximally 25 items) psychological questionnaires was assessed in Arabic-speaking populations and the reference standard was a clinical interview. Data on sensitivity/specificity, area under the curve, and data to generate 2 x 2 tables at various thresholds were extracted. Meta-analysis was performed using the diagmeta package in R. Quality of studies was assessed with QUADAS-2.
   Results. Thirty-two studies (N-participants = 4042) reporting on 17 questionnaires with 5-25 items targeting depression/anxiety (n = 14), general distress (n = 2), and PTSD (n = 1) were included. Seventeen studies (53%) scored high risk on at least two QUADAS-2 domains. The meta-analysis identified an optimal threshold of 11 (sensitivity 76.9%, specificity 85.1%) for the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (n(studies )= 7, n(participants) = 711), 7 (sensitivity 81.9%, specificity 87.6%) for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety subscale and 6 (sensitivity 73.0%, specificity 88.6%) for the depression sub-scale (n(studies) = 4, n(participants) = 492), and 8 (sensitivity 86.0%, specificity 83.9%) for the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) (n(studies) = 4, n(participants) = 459).
   Conclusion. We present optimal thresholds to screen for perinatal depression with the EPDS, anxiety/depression with the HADS, and CMDs with the SRQ-20. More research on Arabiclanguage questionnaires, especially those targeting PTSD, is needed.

AB  - Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, affecting similar to 800,000 people every year. Fibromyalgia is an extremely prevalent rheumatic disease with a predisposition for comorbid anxiety and depression, which are known risk factors for suicidal behavior. Suicidality and relevant risk factors for suicidal behavior have not been thoroughly studied in patients with fibromyalgia.
   Objectives: To investigate the risk of suicidal ideation and attempts in patients with fibromyalgia.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses" (PRISMA) standards. Also, the gray literature was extensively searched.
   Results: Thirteen studies were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis, including 394,087 fibromyalgia patients. Sample size ranged from 44 to 199,739 subjects, mean age ranged from 45.8 to 54.5 years while the female percentage with fibromyalgia ranged from 17.1 to 100.0%. The overall suicide ideation prevalence was 29.57% (95%CI 1.84-72.07), with an OR 9.12 of (95%CI 1.42-58.77), ranging from 2.34 (95%CI 1.49-3.66) to 26.89 (95%CI 5.72-126.42). Pooled suicide attempt prevalence was 5.69% [95%CI 1.26-31.34], with an OR of 3.12 [95%CI 1.37-7.12]. Suicide risk was higher with respect to the general population with an OR of 36.77 (95%CI 15.55-96.94), as well as suicide events with an HR of 1.38 (95%CI 1.17-1.71). Determinants of suicidality were found to be: employment status, disease severity, obesity and drug dependence, chronic pain and co-morbidities, in particular depression, anxiety, poor sleep, and global mental health. However, in some cases, after adjusting for psychiatric conditions, the threshold of statistical significance was not achieved.
   Conclusion: Fibromyalgia patients are particularly prone to suicide, in terms of ideation, attempt, risk and events, warranting a pre-emptive screening of their mental health status. Given the few studies available, the high amount of heterogeneity, the evidence of publications bias and the lack of statistical significance when adjusting for underlying psychiatric co-morbidities, further high-quality studies should be conducted.

AB  - Mental health in young people is a public health challenge worldwide, with around one-fifth of university students suffering from a 12-month mental disorder. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of Southeastern Asia, resources for mental health are limited and counseling services are not regularly established at universities. This review aims to determine the prevalence of mental health problems among university students in 6 ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries (Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam) and to identify the determinants of mental health. A systematic database search (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubPsych, and Scopus) for peer-reviewed, English language articles, published 2010-2020, reporting prevalence data based on standardized screening instruments resulted in 335 articles; 108 were eligible for full-text analysis, of which 34 could be included in the review. Median point prevalence was 29.4% for depression, 42.4% for anxiety, 16.4% for stress, and 13.9% for disordered eating. Current suicidality was present in 7% to 8% of students. There was a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity. Despite the high prevalence of mental health problems, the willingness to seek professional help was comparatively low. Implications for mental health promotion and prevention in university settings are discussed.

AB  - Depression, anxiety and eating disorders ("social-emotional disorders") are common during adolescence/emerging adulthood, periods of intense identity development. Despite this, there are few reviews of existing research on the relationship between symptoms of these disorders and ongoing identity development. This study systematically reviewed, narratively synthesized and meta-analyzed longitudinal investigations of the relationship between identity synthesis/confusion and depression, anxiety and eating disorders symptoms during adolescence/emerging adulthood. Three databases (PsycInfo, Medline, Embase) were searched. Study quality was systematically appraised, findings were qualitatively synthesized and (where possible) meta-analyzed. 20 studies (55% "fair" quality, 45% "poor" quality) were identified, including 13,787 participants (54.2% female, mean age = 14.48 years, range 10-29 years). The narrative synthesis found evidence of bidirectional relationships between identity synthesis/confusion and depression, anxiety and eating disorder symptoms. Meta-analyses and meta-regressions of a sub-sample of studies (N = 9) indicated no significant associations between identity synthesis or confusion and anxiety or depression symptoms. More high-quality research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.

AB  - Introduction: Frontline health care workers (HCWs) have had an increased risk of developing health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to physical illness, they have experienced mental health challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of PTSD among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic via an umbrella review and meta-analysis.Methods: This study was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline to perform a systematic literature search using various medical databases (Web of science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Embase, and Google scholar). The search included all articles published through the first of January 2020 the end of March 2021. The systematic review and meta-analysis studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD among health care workers were included in the study, and studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD in normal people or other epidemics were excluded. The random effects model was used to perform a meta-analysis, and the I-2 index was used to evaluate heterogeneity among studies. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger test. Data was analyzed using STATA (version 14) software.Results: The initial literature search yielded 145 studies. After excluding duplicates and assessing the quality of the studies, 7 studies were selected for meta-analysis. The results showed that the overall prevalence of PTSD among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic was 13.52% (95% CI: 9.06-17.98, I-2 = 65.5%, p = 0.008).Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of PTSD among frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to invest in efforts to screen HCWs for mental health disorders such as PTSD and provide them with mental health support.

AB  - Background: As India is fighting against the second wave of COVID-19, Healthcare professionals are the front-line warriors on that battlefield which puts them under psychological pressure, this systematic review aims to critically look into and amalgamate the evidence on impact of COVID-19 on psychological health of healthcare professionals in India and to seek the attention of policymakers.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using the following databases PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect. Additionally, random search in Google, Google Scholar and ResearchGate was also performed until February 2021. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Downs and Black for reporting quality. Meta-analysis was performed using revMAN. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online.
   Result: Prevalence of depression was found to be present in 41.90% of 5796 participants in five studies (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 29.17 to 54.64), and prevalence of anxiety was found to be 42.87% common in 10 studies with a total sample size of 3059 people (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 30.26 to 55.49), Stress was found to be prevalent (58.04%) in 12 studies with 4209 participants, (95% CI: 44.81-71.28), Prevalence of sleeping problem in 3 studies with 416 participants recorded a prevalence rate of 31.94 (95% CI: 21.38-42.49)
   Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people's mental and physical health, particularly among health-care workers. Authorities should develop programmes to help health-care workers improve their mental health.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex mental disorder where the neurochemical, neuroendocrine, immune, and metabolic systems are impaired. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional network where the central and enteric nervous systems are linked through the same endocrine, immune, neural, and metabolic routes dysregulated in MDD. Thus, gut-brain axis abnormalities in MDD patients may, at least in part, account for the symptomatic features associated with MDD. Recent investigations have suggested that the oral microbiome also plays a key role in this complex molecular picture of relationships. As on one hand there is a lot of what we know and on the other hand little of what we still need to know, we structured this review focusing, in the first place, on putting all pieces of this complex puzzle together, underlying the endocrine, immune, oxidative stress, neural, microbial neurotransmitters, and metabolites molecular interactions and systems lying at the base of gut microbiota (GM)-brain-depression interphase. Then, we focused on promising but still under-explored areas of research strictly linked to the GM and potentially involved in MDD development: (i) the interconnection of GM with oral microbiome that can influence the neuroinflammation-related processes and (ii) gut phageome (bacteria-infecting viruses). As conclusions and future directions, we discussed potentiality but also pitfalls, roadblocks, and the gaps to be bridged in this exciting field of research. By the development of a broader knowledge of the biology associated with MDD, with the inclusion of the gut/oral microbiome, we can accelerate the growth toward a better global health based on precision medicine.

AB  - Introduction: Central sensitization (CS) was first defined in animal studies to be increased nociceptive responsiveness due to sensitization of neurons in the central nervous system, usually the result of prolonged nociceptive input or a disease state. Recently, the concept of CS has been adopted in clinical assessments of chronic pain, but its diagnosis in humans has expanded to include the enhancement of a wide range of nociceptive, sensory, and emotional responses. Many poorly understood pain disorders are referred to as "central sensitivity syndrome," a term associated with a broad range of hypervigilant sensory and emotional responses. Diagnosis often involves a review of medical records and an assessment of behaviour, emotional disposition, and overall sensitivity of a patient. Obviously, these assessments are unable to directly capture the responsiveness of nociceptive neurons. The purpose of this review is to ascertain whether self-report questionnaires associated with central sensitization and the diagnosis of central sensitivity syndrome are associated with enhanced nociceptive responses or whether they more validly measure sensitivity in a broader sense (ie, including emotional responses). Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a detailed search of studies that involve the Central Sensitization Inventory or Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire correlated with either nociceptive sensory tests (quantitative sensory testing) or emotional hypervigilance (anxiety, depression, stress, etc) will be conducted on MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. Perspective: The review is expected to synthesize correlations between sensitivity questionnaires and nociceptive or emotional sensitivity to determine whether these questionnaires reflect a broadened understanding of the term "central sensitization."

AB  - (1) Background: Food insufficiency is a global pandemic affecting many people, especially those residing in developing countries. African countries have been affected by food insufficiency, which is mostly caused by drought or wars. Famine or food insufficiency has been reported to have an impact on the psychological health and quality of life of people affected. This review assessed the mental health outcomes of famine and food insufficiency in West Africa. (2) Methods: A search of the published literature was conducted using PubMed, PsycExtra, Medline, and PsycINFO databases. The search was limited to papers published in English between the years 2010 and 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved papers using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and a third reviewer resolved conflicts. Data were extracted and appraised using a data extraction form and an appraisal checklist. (3) Results: A total of 81 papers were identified through the journal databases search. Out of the seven papers that met the inclusion criteria, six papers used cross-sectional designs and one paper used an experimental design. The six papers used quantitative approach for data collection, while the one paper used a qualitative technique. The evidence synthesized from this review indicated that exposure to food insecurity or insufficiency is associated with increased psychological distress including anxiety, sleeplessness, intellectual disability, general mental, and emotional instability. (4) Conclusions: This review strongly highlights the need for further research across the sub-region. It further suggests that famine and food insufficiency are associated with significant mental health problems in adults and impacts the cognitive and intellectual development of children. Although there is paucity of literature about famine and its impact on mental health in West Africa, these findings are important for developing social policy initiatives for increasing food supply and mental health interventions for all ages.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic had imposed a variety of containment measures on the general population for prolonged periods. Confinement has had, and still has, social, economic, educational, health, and psychological consequences on the entire population. Objective: In this article, a systematic search has been performed based on studies carried out since the beginning of the pandemic, regarding the impact of these containment measures on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population and their caregivers. Method: We consulted six databases (i.e., PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct) and selected ten studies that met the inclusion criteria. The chosen studies have been classified according to their theoretical focus, methodology, and target population. Results: We found an increase in stress and a decrease in psychological well-being among individuals diagnosed with ASD (i.e., parents and caregivers). Additionally, in studies focused on children, youth, and adults with ASD diagnosis, the results are contradictory depending on variables such as age, ASD severity, or type of family structure. Conclusions: The results show that the consequences of quarantine and social confinement are quite contradictory and depend on variables such as age, ASD severity, and family features.

AB  - The relationship between child development and adolescent health, and how this may be modified by socio-economic conditions, is poorly understood. This limits cross-sector interventions to address adolescent health inequality. This review summarises evidence on the associations between child development at school starting age and subsequent health in adolescence and identifies factors affecting associations. We undertook a participatory systematic review, searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ASSIA and ERIC) for articles published between November 1990 and November 2020. Observational, intervention and review studies reporting a measure of child development and subsequent health outcomes, specifically weight and mental health, were included. Studies were individually and collectively assessed for quality using a comparative rating system of stronger, weaker, inconsistent or limited evidence. Associations between child development and adolescent health outcomes were assessed and reported by four domains of child development (socio-emotional, cognitive, language and communication, and physical development). A conceptual diagram, produced with stakeholders at the outset of the study, acted as a framework for narrative synthesis of factors that modify or mediate associations. Thirty-four studies were included. Analysis indicated stronger evidence of associations between measures of socio-emotional development and subsequent mental health and weight outcomes; in particular, positive associations between early externalising behaviours and later internalising and externalising, and negative associations between emotional wellbeing and later internalising and unhealthy weight. For all other domains of child development, although associations with subsequent health were positive, the evidence was either weaker, inconsistent or limited. There was limited evidence on factors that altered associations. Positive socio-emotional development at school starting age appears particularly important for subsequent mental health and weight in adolescence. More collaborative research across health and education is needed on other domains of development and on the mechanisms that link development and later health, and on how any relationship is modified by socio-economic context.

AB  - This review aimed to systematically review observational studies investigating the longitudinal association between anxiety, depression and quality of life (QoL). A systematic search of five electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, NHS EED and EconLit) as well as forward/backward reference searches were conducted to identify observational studies on the longitudinal association between anxiety, depression and QoL. Studies were synthesized narratively. Additionally, a random-effects meta-analysis was performed using studies applying the mental and physical summary scores (MCS, PCS) of the Short Form Health Survey. The review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO and a study protocol was published. n = 47 studies on heterogeneous research questions were included, with sample sizes ranging from n = 28 to 43,093. Narrative synthesis indicated that QoL was reduced before disorder onset, dropped further during the disorder and improved with remission. Before onset and after remission, QoL was lower in comparison to healthy comparisons. n = 8 studies were included in random-effects meta-analyses. The pooled estimates of QoL at follow-up (FU) were of small to large effect sizes and showed that QoL at FU differed by disorder status at baseline as well as by disorder course over time. Disorder course groups differed in their MCS scores at baseline. Effect sizes were generally larger for MCS relative to PCS. The results highlight the relevance of preventive measures and treatment. Future research should consider individual QoL domains, individual anxiety/depressive disorders as well as the course of both over time to allow more differentiated statements in a meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mood disorders are a leading cause of morbidity. Many patients experience treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and suicide rates are rising. Faster-acting and more effective antidepressant medications are needed. Four decades of research has transformed the use of ketamine from an anesthetic to an outpatient treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Ketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and has been shown to rapidly improve mood symptoms and suicidal ideation by targeting the glutamate system directly.
   METHODS: We used the PubMed database to identify relevant articles published until September 1, 2020. We focused on meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and original observational studies. We included relevant studies for depression, MDD, TRD, bipolar disorder, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicide, ketamine, and esketamine.
   RESULTS: Both racemic ketamine and esketamine have been shown to rapidly treat depression and suicidality. There is evidence that ketamine can be helpful for anxiety and PTSD; however, more research is needed. Intranasal esketamine has been FDA-approved to treat depression.
   CONCLUSIONS: This narrative review describes the evolution of ketamine to treat mood disorders and suicidality. We provide the evidence supporting recent developments using esketamine as well as unresolved issues in the field, such as dosing and safety.

AB  - Background: There has been an increase in deaths by suicide in old age in the last decade. Depression and suicide in the elderly, 60 years and above, is a major global public health concern. Determining the prevalence of depression, and correlates of death by suicide in the geriatric population, is an important first step toward addressing this public health concern. This literature review aims to determine the prevalence of major depressive disorders and the correlates of death by suicide in the geriatric population. Methods: This general review of the literature was performed using relevant search terms to determine both the prevalence of depression and the correlates of death by suicide among the geriatric population. Databases such as MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and PubMed were searched. Relevant and current articles were extracted, reviewed, and analyzed. The elderly population was defined as individuals 60 years and above. Only full texts articles in English were reviewed. Findings: The prevalence estimates of major depressive disorder in the elderly ranged from 5.37 to 56%. Adults aged 60 years and older have a high risk of depression that exposes them to suicide. Moreover, elderly women are more likely to experience depression than elderly men, but successful suicide is more common in men. Depression and other mental health conditions (schizophrenia, anxiety disorders) and perceived stress were found to be predictors of suicide in the elderly. Other predictors included physical illnesses such as malignancies, financial constraints, cuckoldry, and sexual dysfunction, and also social factors like living alone triggers depressive symptoms and increases suicidal risk in the elderly. Hanging was found to be the most common method of death by suicide for both sexes. While elderly women preferred poisoning, elderly men in Western countries preferred firearms. Differences in gender, the aging process and social issues were also contributing factors to methods used for suicide. Conclusions: Depression and debilitating physical illnesses were identified as significant contributors to suicide risk in the elderly population, and emphasis should be placed on identifying these factors early and treating them. Recognizing and addressing factors that predict suicide in the elderly will help to improve the mental wellbeing of the elderly.

AB  - The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is an important brain modulatory network. ECS regulates brain homeostasis throughout development, from progenitor fate decision to neuro- and gliogenesis, synaptogenesis, brain plasticity and circuit repair, up to learning, memory, fear, protection, and death. It is a major player in the hypothalamic-peripheral system-adipose tissue in the regulation of food intake, energy storage, nutritional status, and adipose tissue mass, consequently affecting obesity. Loss of ECS control might affect mood disorders (anxiety, hyperactivity, psychosis, and depression), lead to drug abuse, and impact neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's, Parkinson, Huntington, Multiple, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and neurodevelopmental (autism spectrum) disorders. Practice of regular physical and/or mind-body mindfulness and meditative activities have been shown to modulate endocannabinoid (eCB) levels, in addition to other players as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). ECS is involved in pain, inflammation, metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunctions, general immune responses (asthma, allergy, and arthritis) and tumor expansion, both/either in the brain and/or in the periphery. The reason for such a vast impact is the fact that arachidonic acid, a precursor of eCBs, is present in every membrane cell of the body and on demand eCBs synthesis is regulated by electrical activity and calcium shifts. Novel lipid (lipoxins and resolvins) or peptide (hemopressin) players of the ECS also operate as regulators of physiological allostasis. Indeed, the presence of cannabinoid receptors in intracellular organelles as mitochondria or lysosomes, or in nuclear targets as PPAR gamma might impact energy consumption, metabolism and cell death. To live a better life implies in a vigilant ECS, through healthy diet selection (based on a balanced omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids), weekly exercises and meditation therapy, all of which regulating eCBs levels, surrounded by a constructive social network. Cannabidiol, a diet supplement has been a major player with anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, antidepressant, and antioxidant activities. Cognitive challenges and emotional intelligence might strengthen the ECS, which is built on a variety of synapses that modify human behavior. As therapeutically concerned, the ECS is essential for maintaining homeostasis and cannabinoids are promising tools to control innumerous targets.</p>

AB  - Background: Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a transdiagnostic construct defined as the inability to regulate the intensity and quality of emotions (such as, fear, anger, sadness), in order to generate an appropriate emotional response, to handle excitability, mood instability, and emotional overreactivity, and to come down to an emotional baseline. Because ED has not been defined as a clinical entity, and because ED plays a major role in child and adolescent psychopathology, we decided to summarize current knowledge on this topic based on a narrative review of the current literature.
   Methods: This narrative review is based on a literature search of peer-reviewed journals. We searched the databases ERIC, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO and PSYNDEX on June 2, 2020 for peer reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2020 in English language for the preschool, school, and adolescent age (2-17 years) using the following search terms: "emotional dysregulation" OR "affect dysregulation," retrieving 943 articles.
   Results: The results of the literature search are presented in the following sections: the relationship between ED and psychiatric disorders (ADHD, Mood Disorders, Psychological Trauma, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Non-suicidal Self-Injury, Eating Disorders, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Conduct Disorder, Disruptive Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Personality Disorders, Substance Use Disorder, Developmental Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Psychosis and Schizophrenia, and Gaming Disorder), prevention, and treatment of ED.
   Conclusion: Basic conditions of ED are genetic disposition, the experience of trauma, especially sexual or physical abuse, emotional neglect in childhood or adolescence, and personal stress. ED is a complex construct and a comprehensive concept, aggravating a number of various mental disorders. Differential treatment is mandatory for individual and social functioning.

AB  - Background: Interpreters often play a crucial role in the health care of refugees. Although interpreters working with refugees are regularly confronted with emotionally stressful content, little is known about their work-related stress and psychological well-being. Primarily qualitative studies indicate increased emotional stress in interpreters, and difficulties in handling the traumatic content from their clients. Additionally, the working conditions of interpreters appear to be demanding, due to low payment and a lack of supervision or adequate preparation.</p>
   Objective: The presented systematic review aimed to identify and summarise quantitative and qualitative research on the mental health of interpreters in the mental health care of refugees.</p>
   Method: A systematic search was performed in five databases, and specific interpreting journals were searched. After removal of duplicates, 6,920 hits remained. Eligible studies included quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies as well as case studies and grey literature. The studies aimed to examine mental health aspects or work experiences of spoken language interpreters in mental health care settings for adult refugees.</p>
   Results: Altogether, 25 studies were identified, including six quantitative and 19 qualitative studies. Studies were analysed and presented narratively. In the analysis of the qualitative studies, three themes emerged: "Emotions, behaviour, and coping strategies," "Working in a triad," and "Working environment." In the quantitative studies, interpreters showed heightened levels of emotional stress and anxiety, and secondary traumatic stress reactions. In several qualitative studies, interpreters described a devaluing health care system and stressful working conditions with a lack of support structures.</p>
   Conclusion: Overall, the results indicate a high level of stress among interpreters working with refugees. Quantitative data are sparse, and studies employ heterogeneous assessments in diverse study settings. Therefore, future quantitative research is necessary to consistently investigate interpreters' mental health in different mental health care settings.</p>

AB  - The hippocampus-prefrontal cortex (HPC-PFC) pathway plays a fundamental role in executive and emotional functions. Neurophysiological studies have begun to unveil the dynamics of HPC-PFC interaction in both immediate demands and long-term adaptations. Disruptions in HPC-PFC functional connectivity can contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in mental illnesses and neurological conditions, such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. Given the role in functional and dysfunctional physiology, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that modulate the dynamics of HPC-PFC communication. Two of the main mechanisms that regulate HPC-PFC interactions are synaptic plasticity and modulatory neurotransmission. Synaptic plasticity can be investigated inducing long-term potentiation or long-term depression, while spontaneous functional connectivity can be inferred by statistical dependencies between the local field potentials of both regions. In turn, several neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and endocannabinoids, can regulate the fine-tuning of HPC-PFC connectivity. Despite experimental evidence, the effects of neuromodulation on HPC-PFC neuronal dynamics from cellular to behavioral levels are not fully understood. The current literature lacks a review that focuses on the main neurotransmitter interactions with HPC-PFC activity. Here we reviewed studies showing the effects of the main neurotransmitter systems in long- and short-term HPC-PFC synaptic plasticity. We also looked for the neuromodulatory effects on HPC-PFC oscillatory coordination. Finally, we review the implications of HPC-PFC disruption in synaptic plasticity and functional connectivity on cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders. The comprehensive overview of these impairments could help better understand the role of neuromodulation in HPC-PFC communication and generate insights into the etiology and physiopathology of clinical conditions.

AB  - Background Shared decision-making encourages patients to explore treatment options/choices in collaboration with their healthcare provider, inclusive of the best available evidence and the patient's values/preferences. Several effective treatments exist for people with anxiety and/or depressive disorders; shared decision-making may be particularly useful in this context. Aims To investigate whether shared decision-making enhances clinical outcomes in adults with anxiety and/or depressive disorders. Method A systematic review was conducted. Five electronic health databases were searched from database inception until August 2019, in addition to reference lists of included studies. Prospective controlled studies of shared decision-making in adults (aged 18-64 years) diagnosed with an anxiety and/or depressive disorder were included. Two reviewers independently conducted each stage of the review process. Results Six randomised controlled trials (N = 1834 participants) were included. Patient satisfaction improved in four studies. Patients were more likely to receive adequate treatment for depression in three studies. Anxiety symptoms decreased in one study. Patient involvement in decision-making increased in three studies. Because of the lack of blinded interventions and outcome assessment, the included studies were at moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to moderate, per GRADE criteria. Conclusions Shared decision-making shows promise for enhancing quality-of-care outcomes such as patient satisfaction, without increasing consultation time, but appears unlikely to improve symptoms of depression. However, it appears to be understudied in patients with anxiety disorders. Heterogeneity regarding definition and measurement of shared decision-making posed challenges for interpreting the results. More research is recommended to advance the field.

AB  - Introduction: The recommendation of exercise programs in the senior population may benefit inactive and sedentary individuals and improve and help to treat specific health conditions. The purpose of this review is to summarize the published evidence from RCT studies of aerobic exercise interventions for mental health in older adults over the last 20 years.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted using electronic databases including Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, and ProQuest.
   Results: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The subjects of these studies were aged 60 years or older and had various physical health statuses. In 15 studies, the mean effect size for the experimental outcome was 0.56 +/- 0.39 (95%CI: 0.36-0.76). One-way ANOVA indicated no significant differences in the intervention duration [F-(2,F-15) = 0.919, p = 0.420], subject category [F-(2,F-15) = 0.046, p = 0.955], or measurement category [F-(3,F-14) = 0.967, p = 0.436]. However, there were significant differences in exercise frequencies [F-(2,F-15) = 6.03, p = 0.012].
   Conclusion: The available evidence suggests that aerobic exercise is beneficial for improving the mental health of adults aged 60 years and older. The intervention effect can be achieved regardless of the type of subject and the duration of the intervention. Further, the present study indicates that low-frequency, long-term and regular aerobic exercise is more effective for older adults. Therefore, we recommend that older adults to exercise at a low frequency depending on their physical condition.

AB  - This narrative review aims to summarize initiatives developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to support healthcare workers' emotional well-being within the context of a preexisting framework of occupational mental health guidelines. This occupational mental health framework integrates principles from multiple disciplines to optimize prevention and management of mental health issues among employees. We conducted an online search on Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies that reported on design or execution of medical institution-based interventions, aiming to support healthcare worker mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inclusion criteria was intentionally broad in order to incorporate as many types of interventions at varying stages of development or evaluation. We included 31 studies in our review that reported on newly designed psychological support interventions for healthcare workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that most programs commonly supported HCW mental health through offering one or more of the following initiatives: expanded basic need resources/services, additional workplace training programs that bolstered professional preparedness while also indirectly boosting HCW emotional health, and/or expanded psychological support programs, such as peer support programs, psychoeducational or counseling services. Most programs, however, did not consider methods to ensure program longevity or sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the acuity of HCW mental health issues and is likely to leave long lasting mental health strains among HCW. This pandemic is a critical point in time to catalyze much needed progress in reducing stigma and expanding HCW mental health care access.

AB  - By exposing individuals to trauma, wars can cause a host of psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to collect and compare the studies conducted to estimate the prevalence of depression among veterans, former prisoners of war (POWs) and military personnel in the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988). In this systematic review, a search was conducted using relevant keywords in major national and international databases, personal archives and national academic libraries. We screened 135 records using their abstracts and selected a total of 56 studies for full-text review. Eventually, 19 studies were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. The estimated pooled prevalence of depression among Iranian veterans and POWs was 22.4% (95% confidence interval = 15.0-32.0). Although the results indicated disparities in the prevalence of depression among veterans and POWs, the aggregate estimated prevalence was much higher than what has been reported for military personnel. Effective policies and strategies are required for prevention and treatment of depression and related psychiatric complications among veterans and former POWs.

AB  - Psychedelics have inspired new hope for treating brain disorders, as they seem to be unlike any treatments currently available. Not only do they produce sustained therapeutic effects following a single administration, they also appear to have broad therapeutic potential, demonstrating efficacy for treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorder, and alcohol use disorder, among others. Psychedelics belong to a more general class of compounds known as psychoplastogens, which robustly promote structural and functional neural plasticity in key circuits relevant to brain health. Here we discuss the importance of structural plasticity in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, as well as the evidence demonstrating that psychedelics are among the most effective chemical modulators of neural plasticity studied to date. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical framework with the potential to explain why psychedelic compounds produce long-lasting therapeutic effects across a wide range of brain disorders. Despite their promise as broadly efficacious neurotherapeutics, there are several issues associated with psychedelic-based medicines that drastically limit their clinical scalability. We discuss these challenges and how they might be overcome through the development of non-hallucinogenic psychoplastogens. The clinical use of psychedelics and other psychoplastogenic compounds marks a paradigm shift in neuropsychiatry toward therapeutic approaches relying on the selective modulation of neural circuits with small molecule drugs. Psychoplastogen research brings us one step closer to actually curing mental illness by rectifying the underlying pathophysiology of disorders like depression, moving beyond simply treating disease symptoms. However, determining how to most effectively deploy psychoplastogenic medicines at scale will be an important consideration as the field moves forward.</p>

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps individuals to eliminate avoidant and safety-seeking behaviors that prevent self-correction of faulty beliefs, thereby facilitating stress management to reduce stress-related disorders and enhance mental health. The present review evaluated the effectiveness of CBT in stressful conditions among clinical and general populations, and identified recent advances in CBT-related techniques. A search of the literature for studies conducted during 1987-2021 identified 345 articles relating to biopsychosocial medicine; 154 (45%) were review articles, including 14 systemic reviews, and 53 (15%) were clinical trials including 45 randomized controlled trials. The results of several randomized controlled trials indicated that CBT was effective for a variety of mental problems (e.g., anxiety disorder, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, bulimia nervosa, depression, hypochondriasis), physical conditions (e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, breast cancer), and behavioral problems (e.g., antisocial behaviors, drug abuse, gambling, overweight, smoking), at least in the short term; more follow-up observations are needed to assess the long-term effects of CBT. Mental and physical problems can likely be managed effectively with online CBT or self-help CBT using a mobile app, but these should be applied with care, considering their cost-effectiveness and applicability to a given population.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of the worldwide population. Citizens suffer the social, economic, physiological, and psychological effects of this pandemic. Primary sources, scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages were used for a consensus critical review. The method was a narrative review of the available literature to summarize the existing literature addressing mental health concerns and stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The main search engines used in the present research were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. We found the pandemic has had a direct impact on psychopathologies such as anxiety, increasing its ratios, and depression. Other syndromes such as burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder have increased with the pandemic, showing a larger incidence among medical personnel. Moreover, eating disorders and violence have also increased. Public authorities must prepare healthcare systems for increasing incidences of mental pathologies. Mental health apps are one of the tools that can be used to reach the general population.</p>

AB  - The current systematic review aimed to evaluate the variables influencing foster parents' parenting stress, distress and parenting style, thereby supporting their adjustment and well-being as well as that of foster children. A PRISMA-guided search was conducted in three databases. Observational studies examining parenting stress, parenting distress (subsuming anxiety, depression and stress symptoms) and parenting style-all assessed through validated tools-were considered. A total of 16 studies were included, comprising N = 1794 non-relative foster parents (age range = 30-67 years). Results showed heightened parenting stress over time, both overall and compared to parents at large. Neither foster parents' nor foster children's socio-demographic characteristics significantly contributed to the increase in parenting stress; yet child-related stress and children's externalizing problems were its main predictors. Foster parents' couple cooperation was associated with reduced parenting stress. Moreover, the authoritative parenting style was associated with parental warmth, while the authoritarian style was associated with foster parents' greater perceived burden, greater criticism and rejection toward the foster child. Evidence supports the mutual influence between foster parents and children. Foster care services should support foster parents' needs within a concentric modular system, to ultimately provide better care for both foster parents and children.</p>

AB  - Vulnerable populations may be more vulnerable to mental health problems posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A systematic review was performed to compare the mental health impact of COVID-19 between vulnerable and non-vulnerable groups. Five electronic databases were searched for observational studies reporting the psychological outcomes of both vulnerable populations and healthy controls during the COVID-19 era. The primary outcomes are the severity of depression and anxiety, and secondary outcomes include other aspects of mental health such as stress or sleep disturbance. Meta-analysis was performed for the severity of mental health symptoms, and the results were presented as standardized mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. A total of 25 studies were included. According to the findings, the elderly generally experienced significantly lower levels of psychological symptoms including depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. Pregnant women, patients with chronic diseases, and patients with pre-existing severe mental disorders showed mixed results according to each mental health outcome. The results indicate that vulnerable groups have been affected differently in the COVID-19 era. Though the insufficient number and heterogeneity of included studies leave the results inconclusive, our findings may contribute to identifying priorities of mental health needs among various vulnerable populations and allocating health resources with efficiency.

AB  - Terrorism, though not well-defined, is a violent act that has been shown to have longstanding effects on the mental health of those who witness it. The aim of this general literature review is to explore the effect that terrorism has on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders, as well as the bio-psycho-social determinants that mediate its impact. This paper describes the prevalence, risk factors, protective factors, common presentations and interventions identified for PTSD, depression and anxiety disorders occurring following terrorist attacks. We conducted a literature search in MEDLINE using a number of keywords detailed below. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we kept 80 articles, which we summarized in tabular form. A majority of articles found detailed the impact of terrorism on PTSD, and took place in a Western, mainly American setting. The main factors that impacted the presentation of mental illness include gender, ethnicity, social supports, socioeconomic status, level of preparedness, level of exposure, pre-existing trauma and mental illness, and subsequent life stressors. The main intervention detailed in this article as showing evidence post-terrorism is trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy. This study highlights the importance of this topic, and in particular, its implications for public health policy and practice.

AB  - The purpose of this article was to systematically review and organise the available literature devoted to the topic of depressive symptoms and burnout in football players. A systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, SPORTdiscus, PubMed, and Psychinfo for articles published up to June 2020. The searches yielded 1589 articles, and after the screening process, a total of 18 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included for review. Playing position and conflicts with coach/management seems to have a direct influence on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in current players as do the injuries and life events of former players. During the pre-competition phase, most of the athletes displayed reduced rates, indicating burnout. An exploration of the mental health of football players will help to create models of care and guide professionals so that they may help players achieve better performance while also having better wellbeing. Understanding how to prevent and cope with the emotional wellbeing of football players will be possible to guide players and coaches.

AB  - Salinization of freshwater is occurring throughout the world, affecting freshwater biota that inhabit rivers, streams, ponds, marshes and lakes. There are many freshwater insects, and these animals are important for ecosystem health. These insects have evolved physiological mechanisms to maintain their internal salt and water balance based on a freshwater environment that has comparatively little salt. In these habitats, insects must counter the loss of salts and dilution of their internal body fluids by sequestering salts and excreting water. Most of these insects can tolerate salinization of their habitats to a certain level; however, when exposed to salinization they often exhibit markers of stress and impaired development. An understanding of the physiological mechanisms for controlling salt and water balance in freshwater insects, and how these are affected by salinization, is needed to predict the consequences of salinization for freshwater ecosystems. Recent research in this area has addressed the whole-organism response, but the purpose of this Review is to summarize the effects of salinization on the osmoregulatory physiology of freshwater insects at the molecular to organ level. Research of this type is limited, and pursuing such lines of inquiry will improve our understanding of the effects of salinization on freshwater insects and the ecosystems they inhabit.

AB  - Aim: Present systematic review and meta-analysis examined the burden of psychological reactions predominantly anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia during the novel COVID-19 pandemic phase among the frontline healthcare, nonfrontline healthcare, and general population. Material and Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched for studies between January 1, 2020, and May 25, 2020. Brief protocol of the systematic review was registered with the PROSPERO database, (CRD42020186229). Any study that reported the burden of at least one of psychological reactions including anxiety or depression or stress or insomnia was eligible. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic and results were synthesized using random-effect meta-analysis. Results: Out of 49 eligible studies, 41 databases from 37 studies reported anxiety, 39 databases (35 studies) reported depression, 20 studies reported stress and 12 databases from 11 studies reported insomnia. The overall prevalence for anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia was 26.3%, 25.9%, 26.2%, and 31.3%, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia were found highest among the frontline healthcare as compared to general healthcare workers and the general population. Conclusion: Anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia were more prevalent among frontline health-care workers compared to general. Such increased prevalence is prompting toward the global mental health emergency. Therefore, a call of urgent attention and pan-region effective mental-health intervention are required to mitigate these psychological reactions.

   Methods Four databases were systematically searched following the PRISMA guidelines and using strict eligibility criteria. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the COSMIN checklist.
   Results Eight questionnaires were previously used in populations on the autism spectrum, reported over 31 studies.
   Discussion Future research should focus more on examining psychometric properties of these self-report measures in this population as current evidence is scarce. In addition, it is important to consider which concept of stress one aims to measure as not all questionnaires cover the same aspects of stress.

AB  - This study aimed to systematically review studies which conducted a controlled mediation analysis in order to examine the potential mechanisms which underlie mindfulness-based programme's (MBPs) effects on anxiety, depression and psychological distress in any health or mental health population. Searches of six databases (Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Cinahal Plus and Cochrane Reviews) were undertaken in September 2020. After removing duplicates, 2052 records were screened, of these 1822 were excluded based on the abstract and 230 were further assessed for eligibility against the full study inclusion criteria. Full texts were acquired for the 11 studies which met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the methodologies of each of these 11 studies were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (Higgins et al., 2011). The quality of the findings from each study relating to the hypothesised mechanisms of action of the MBP reviewed were evaluated using Alsubaie et al. (2017)'s framework for abstracting and interpreting mechanistic study quality, derived from recommendations made by Kazdin (2007, 2009). We found preliminary evidence that MBCT/MBSR treatment effects on anxiety and depression may be mediated by hypothesised mechanisms, such as mindfulness, rumination, worry, self-compassion, cognitive reactivity, aversion, attention regulation skills and positive affect. An overall lack of methodological rigour does preclude us from making any definitive conclusions on causality. The results from this study do however provide some insights into what the potential causal pathways connecting MBPs with improved anxiety and depression might be.

AB  - Background: Mental health burden has been massively reported during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Aiming to summarise these data, we present a meta-review of meta-analyses that evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety, depressive and stress symptoms, psychological distress, post-traumatic stress disorder/symptoms (PTSD), and sleep disturbance, reporting its prevalence on general public (GP) and health care workers (HCW).
   Methods: A search was performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science. Sleep disturbances, psychological distress, stress, and burnout were grouped as "Psychophysiological stress," and anxiety, depression, and PTSD were grouped as "Psychopathology." A random-effects model, calculating the pooled prevalence together with 95% confidence interval was performed for each domain. Subgroup analyses were performed for each population type (GP and HCW) and for each mental health outcome. For anxiety and depression, subgroup analysis for population type was performed. Heterogeneity is reported as I-2. Publication bias was assessed through visual inspection of the funnel plot, and further tested by Egger's test and trim and fill analyses.
   Results: A total of 18 meta-analyses were included. The prevalence of psychophysiological stress was 31.99% (CI: 26.88-37.58, I-2 = 99.9%). HCW showed a higher prevalence (37.74%, CI: 33.26-42.45, I-2 = 99.7%) than the GP (20.67%, 15.07-27.66, I-2 = 99.9%). The overall prevalence of insomnia, psychological distress, and stress were, respectively, 32.34% (CI: 25.65-39.84), 28.25% (CI: 18.12-41.20), and 36% (CI: 29.31-43.54). Psychopathology was present at 26.45% (CI: 24.22-28.79, I-2 = 99.9%) of the sample, with similar estimates for population (HCW 26.14%, CI: 23.37-29.12, I-2 = 99.9%; GP: 26.99%, CI: 23.41-30.9, I-2 = 99.9%). The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD was 27.77% (CI: 24.47-31.32), 26.93% (CI: 23.92-30.17), and 20% (CI: 15.54-24.37), respectively. Similar proportions between populations were found for anxiety (HCW = 27.5%, CI: 23.78-31.55; GP = 28.33%, CI: 22.1-35.5) and depression (HCW = 27.05%, CI: 23.14-31.36; GP = 26.7%, CI: 22.32-31.59). Asymmetry in the funnel plot was found, and a slight increase in the estimate of overall psychopathology (29.08%, CI: 26.42-31.89) was found after the trim and fill analysis.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of mental health problems ranged from 20 to 36%. HCW presented a higher prevalence of psychophysiological stress than the general population.

AB  - Background: Sex and gender are important modifiers of mental health and behavior in normal times and during crises. We investigated whether they were addressed by empirical, international research that explored the mental health and health behavior ramifications after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We systematically searched the databases PsyArXiv, PubMed, PsycInfo, Psyndex, PubPsych, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies assessing mental health outcomes (main outcomes) as well as potential risk and protective health behavior (additional outcomes) up to July 2, 2020.
   Findings: Most of the 80 publications fulfilling the selection criteria reflected the static difference perspective treating sex and gender as dichotomous variables. The focus was on internalizing disorders (especially anxiety and depression) burdening women in particular, while externalizing disorders were neglected. Sex- and gender-specific evaluation of mental healthcare use has also been lacking. With respect to unfavorable health behavior in terms of adherence to prescribed protective measures, men constitute a risk group.
   Interpretations: Women remain a vulnerable group burdened by multiple stresses and mental health symptoms. The neglect of sex- and gender-specific evaluation of aggression-related disorders, substance addiction, and mental healthcare use in the early stage represents a potentially dangerous oversight.

Overall, 81.2% of studies investigated the impacts of acculturative stress on mental health with the majority concluding that increased acculturative stress had a significant relationship with greater mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and psychological stress. Other studies in this review examined impacts on physical health and health behaviors, but yielded inconclusive results indicating that these are areas for future research.

AB  - Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased risk of many mental health conditions, including mood and anxiety disorders. Whether PCOS is more common in mental health conditions than in the general population is less clear. A systematic review investigating this question may provide clarity regarding whether increased prevalence of PCOS is seen in particular mental health disorders, and thus, whether screening female mental health patients for PCOS is warranted. Aims To systematically synthesise and review research examining rates of PCOS in mental health disorders. Methods Peer-reviewed articles assessing the prevalence of PCOS within a sample of reproductive-aged females with a diagnosis of Axis I or II mental health disorder were included. Key studies were identified through a comprehensive search of PubMed and Web of Science. Results Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, assessing rate of diagnosed PCOS in samples with bipolar disorder (n = 7), autism spectrum disorders (ASD; n = 2), bulimia nervosa (n = 1), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n = 1). Overall, there was limited evidence of elevated rates of PCOS in bipolar disorder, compared with population estimates or healthy control group rates. In ASD, bulimia nervosa, and PTSD samples, significantly increased rates of PCOS were reported compared with healthy control samples, although studies were relatively small. Conclusions This review highlights complexities and methodological considerations in this area of research. There are a limited number of studies assessing PCOS in mental health samples, and thus, important areas of future research have been identified.

AB  - Background: This scoping review analyzed research about how music activities may affect participants' health and well-being. Primary outcomes were measures of health (including symptoms and health behaviors) and well-being. Secondary measures included a range of psychosocial processes such as arousal, mood, social connection, physical activation or relaxation, cognitive functions, and identity. Diverse music activities were considered: receptive and intentional music listening; sharing music; instrument playing; group singing; lyrics and rapping; movement and dance; and songwriting, composition, and improvisation.</p>
   Methods: Nine databases were searched with terms related to the eight music activities and the psychosocial variables of interest. Sixty-three papers met selection criteria, representing 6,975 participants of all ages, nationalities, and contexts.</p>
   Results: Receptive and intentional music listening were found to reduce pain through changes in physiological arousal in some studies but not others. Shared music listening (e.g., concerts or radio programs) enhanced social connections and mood in older adults and in hospital patients. Music listening and carer singing decreased agitation and improved posture, movement, and well-being of people with dementia. Group singing supported cognitive health and well-being of older adults and those with mental health problems, lung disease, stroke, and dementia through its effects on cognitive functions, mood, and social connections. Playing a musical instrument was associated with improved cognitive health and well-being in school students, older adults, and people with mild brain injuries via effects on motor, cognitive and social processes. Dance and movement with music programs were associated with improved health and well-being in people with dementia, women with postnatal depression, and sedentary women with obesity through various cognitive, physical, and social processes. Rapping, songwriting, and composition helped the well-being of marginalized people through effects on social and cultural inclusion and connection, self-esteem and empowerment.</p>
   Discussion: Music activities offer a rich and underutilized resource for health and well-being to participants of diverse ages, backgrounds, and settings. The review provides preliminary evidence that particular music activities may be recommended for specific psychosocial purposes and for specific health conditions.</p>

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is primarily a crisis that affects people's physical health. However, it is well-known from previous epidemics and pandemics that there are other indirect negative impacts on mental health, among others. The purpose of this scoping review was to explore and summarise primary empirical research evidence on how the COVID-19 pandemic and societal infection control measures have impacted children and adolescents' mental health.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted in five scientific databases: PubMed, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINHAL, and Social Science Premium Collection. The search string was designed using the Population (0-18 years), Exposure (COVID-19), Outcomes (mental health) framework. Mental health was defined broadly, covering mental well-being to mental disorders and psychiatric conditions.
   Results: Fifty-nine studies were included in the scoping review. Of these, 44 were cross-sectional and 15 were longitudinal studies. Most studies reported negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent mental health outcomes, yet the evidence was mixed. This was also the case for studies investigating societal control measures. Strong resilience, positive emotion regulation, physical activity, parental self-efficacy, family functioning and emotional regulation, and social support were reported as protective factors. On the contrary, emotional reactivity and experiential avoidance, exposure to excessive information, COVID-19 school concerns, presence of COVID-19 cases in the community, parental mental health problems, and high internet, social media and video game use were all identified as potentially harmful factors.
   Conclusions: Due to the methodological heterogeneity of the studies and geographical variation, it is challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the real impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents. However, the existing body of research gives some insight to how parents, clinicians and policy makers can take action to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 and control measures. Interventions to promote physical activity and reduce screen time among children and adolescents are recommended, as well as parenting support programs.

AB  - The effectiveness of positive psychology interventions in the treatment of stress-related difficulties have not been well established. To estimate the effectiveness of positive psychology interventions on the reduction of stress-related symptoms, a systematic review using PubMed, Scopus, Wiley, Psychinfo, Cochrane and Sage databases with no limitation of date of publication was conducted. We identified additional studies by searching positive psychology reviews and academic books. Only studies trying positive interventions that included measures of anxiety, stress, or posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were reviewed. We extracted data using predefined data fields and study quality was assessed with the National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools. Twenty-nine records were included in this study: 23 controlled trials and six pre-post studies. Every study showed significant improvement in at least one dimension. Several studies reported improvements in well-being as well. This review shows promising results of positive psychology interventions as a treatment for stress-related difficulties. However, important methodological biases and strong heterogeneity among the studies highlight the need for replication and better validation of positive psychology interventions.

AB  - Objective: Problematic Internet and smartphone use is associated with serious mental health problems. We thus investigated the effectiveness of psychological interventions on problematic Internet and smartphone use. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and searched in PubMed, PsyArticles, PsycInfo, Medline and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed experimental and quasi-experimental research published between 2008 and 2021. Results: A total of 10 studies accompanied by 14 effect sizes were included in the meta-analyses for problematic Internet use and 3 studies accompanied by 4 effect sizes for problematic smartphone use. The total sample size was n = 1439 with a mean age of 20.34 (SD = 6.63) years. Psychological interventions were effective for both problematic Internet use (g = -1.41, 95% confidence interval = [-1.90, -0.91], p < 0.001) and problematic smartphone use (g = -0.40, 95% confidence interval = [-0.79, -0.01], p < 0.001). Conclusion: Current evidence indicates that psychological interventions can be effective in reducing problematic Internet use/problematic smartphone use. However, the results must be considered preliminary due to the limited number of studies available in the respective fields.

AB  - Objectives: Despite the high prevalence of coronavirus and various treatment approaches, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), there is still no definitive treatment for coronavirus. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of CAM interventions on COVID-19 patients.
   Content: Four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE) were searched from the inception of databases until July 16, 2020. Keywords included complementary and alternative medicine therapies and Coronavirus.
   Summary and Outlook: Of the 1,137 studies searched, 14 studies performed on 972 COVID-19 patients entered the systematic review final stage. The results showed that different CAM interventions (acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine [TCM], relaxation, Qigong) significantly improved various psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, negative emotions, quality of life) and physical symptoms (inflammatory factors, physical activity, chest pain, and respiratory function) in COVID-19 patients. The results showed that various CAM interventions have a positive effect on improving the various dimensions of coronavirus disease but since there are few studies in this regard, further studies using different CAM approaches are recommended.

AB  - Physical exercise has a positive impact on anxiety and depression. However, the evidence that associates strength training with a decrease in adolescents' psychosocial disorders is scarce. Consequently, the objective was to analyze the effects of training with different modes of strength intervention on anxiety, stress, and depression in adolescents. The search was designed according to PRISMA (R). We searched WoS, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, PubMed, and MEDLINE (2010-2020). Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration. The analysis was carried out with a standardized mean difference (SMD) pooled using the Hedges g test (95% CI). The Main Outcome Measures were: anxiety, stress, and depression in adolescents post strength training. Nine studies were included in the systematic review and seven in the meta-analysis. These studies showed a large and significant effect of strength training on anxiety (SMD = -1.75; CI = 95%: -3.03, -0.48; p = 0.007) and depression (SMD = -1.61; CI = 95%: -2.54, -0.67, p = 0.0007). In conclusion, training with different modes of strength intervention have shown control over anxiety and depression in adolescents. However, conventional strength training seems to have better results than other modes of strength intervention.

AB  - Due to the rapid rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a number of restrictions have been introduced into public spaces, including those related to the operation of sports facilities, compounding the difficulty for athletes to conduct appropriate forms of training. The aim of this study was to review current scientific reports assessing the impact of the pandemic on the physical activity, mental state, and quality of life of professional athletes. Popular scientific databases-PubMed, Scopus, and Embase-were systematically searched from the beginning of the pandemic until 12 July 2021. According to the adopted criteria, 14 articles were included in the review. Ten of the qualified studies determined the impact of the pandemic on the physical activity of athletes. The authors of 11 papers assessed the mental state and quality of life of athletes during the pandemic. The studies showed negative effects of the pandemic: a decrease in overall physical fitness and number of days and hours of training, as well as an increase in the occurrence of negative emotions (stress, fatigue, and depression) and a decrease in sleep quality. Changes in physical activity had an impact on overall well-being ratings, which depended on the sex of the subjects. Women were more likely to experience negative emotions compared to men. The mental state of the athletes affected the quality of sleep. This review summarises the negative effects of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic on the physical and mental health of professional athletes.

AB  - Gender, which expresses the roles given by a society to men and women unlike the biological sex of women and men, leads to discrimination and inequalities in many fields such as education, health, economy and social status. Today, the women who live in patriarchal societies are restricted by the pressure of gender roles, economic dependence, heavy responsibilities, negative attitudes, stereotypes towards women. All these cause women to often experience psychological problems like depression, anxiety, fear and low self-respect. The biomedical model and mainstream therapy approaches applied as a treatment for mental problems of the women are especially inadequate for producing permanent solutions for the problems experienced by women due to considering the symptoms only as biological changes, supporting traditional gender roles and ignoring characteristics such as culture, sex and ethnicity. As an alternative method, feminist therapy gives both the therapist and the client the opportunity of social and emotional development in daily life. Feminist therapy aims at helping the individuals discover their strengths rather than a disease-oriented approach and enabling individuals to get rid of their feelings of guilt and to acquire new skills. Feminist therapy is a modern approach specifically fulfilling the needs of women and aims at radical changes in society.

AB  - This paper is a systematic review of quantitative studies conducted on the benefits of visiting gardens and gardening therapy for people with dementia (PWD) in an effort to assess the effectiveness of such treatments and obtain information on the most appropriate garden design for this population. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines. Four databases were searched (PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus), with no time limits. Out of a total of 480 articles considered, 16 studies were selected for review. In all but two of the studies examined, gardening therapy and the use of therapeutic gardens induced psychophysiological improvements in PWD. The areas showing the greatest effects were Engagement, Agitation, Depression/Mood, Stress, and Medication. It also emerged that interest in this sphere has been growing in the last decade, but there is still a shortage of empirical evidence of the beneficial effects of therapeutic gardens in relation to the type and severity of dementia, and of garden design guidelines. Despite the limited number of studies investigated, the review confirmed the benefits of gardening and therapeutic gardens in PWD. There is nonetheless a need to conduct more quantitative research to support currently-available evidence and generate more information, focusing on garden design criteria, in-garden activities, the type and severity of dementia examined, and effects on caregivers as well as on PWD.

AB  - COVID-19 has impacted people psychologically globally, including healthcare providers. Anxiety, depression, and stress are the most common impacts that have affected these people. Thus, this study was aimed to ascertain the estimated prevalence of psychological impacts among healthcare providers in the Asian region. A systematic search was performed in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for original research articles published between 2020 and April 2021. Only studies published in English were included. The quality of data was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis, and the analysis was performed using generic inverse variance with a random-effects model by Review Manager software. A total of 80 studies across 18 countries in Asia region were pooled to assess the data prevalence on anxiety (34.81% (95% CI: 30.80%, 38.83%)), depression (34.61% (95% CI: 30.87%, 38.36%)), stress (31.72% (95% CI: 21.25%, 42.18%)), insomnia (37.89% (95% CI: 25.43%, 50.35%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (15.29% (95% CI: 11.43%, 19.15%)). Subgroup analyses were conducted across regions, type of healthcare providers, sex, and occupation. This review has identified a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia but a low prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among healthcare providers in Asia regions. Effective intervention support programs are urgently needed to improve psychological health of healthcare providers and maintaining the health system.

AB  - Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have been accumulating adverse psychological symptoms due to the closure of educational centers and the need to adapt to different teaching modalities. Methods: Medline and PubMed were searched for studies on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and burn-out in teachers, published from 1 December 2019 to 15 June 2021. Results: In total, eight studies were included in this study. The results show that teachers report levels of anxiety (17%), depression (19%), and stress (30%). In Asia, there has been more anxiety compared to other continents. Overall, anxiety has been higher among teachers in schools compared to universities. However, stress levels have been higher among teachers in universities compared to schools. Statistically, there were no significant differences regarding gender and age in any of the symptoms. Conclusions: The results suggest that teachers at different educational levels are experiencing adverse psychological symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that anxiety levels vary between different countries. However, more international studies are needed to fully understand the impact of the pandemic on teachers' mental health.

AB  - The links between early life stress (ELS) and the emergence of psychopathology such as increased anxiety and depression are now well established, although the specific neurobiological and developmental mechanisms that translate ELS into poor health outcomes are still unclear. The consequences of ELS are complex because they depend on the form and severity of early stress, duration, and age of exposure as well as co-occurrence with other forms of physical or psychological trauma. The long term effects of ELS on the corticolimbic circuit underlying emotional and social behavior are particularly salient because ELS occurs during critical developmental periods in the establishment of this circuit, its local balance of inhibition:excitation and its connections with other neuronal pathways. Using examples drawn from the human and rodent literature, we review some of the consequences of ELS on the development of the corticolimbic circuit and how it might impact fear regulation in a sex- and hemispheric-dependent manner in both humans and rodents. We explore the effects of ELS on local inhibitory neurons and the formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) that terminate critical periods of plasticity and promote the formation of stable local networks. Overall, the bulk of ELS studies report transient and/or long lasting alterations in both glutamatergic circuits and local inhibitory interneurons (INs) and their associated PNNs. Since the activity of INs plays a key role in the maturation of cortical regions and the formation of local field potentials, alterations in these INs triggered by ELS might critically participate in the development of psychiatric disorders in adulthood, including impaired fear extinction and anxiety behavior.

AB  - Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease triggered by dysbiotic biofilms, involving the host's immune response, systemic and behavioral factors, including psychosocial conditions. This systematic review aimed to investigate the possible association between periodontitis and anxiety in adults. Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Lilacs, Cochrane, and OpenGrey databases, without language restrictions, considering studies in adults (P-Participants), with (E-Exposure) and without periodontitis (C- Comparison) in an outcome of association with anxiety (O-outcome). Methodological quality assessment was carried out using the Newcastle-Ottawa protocol for case-control and cross-sectional studies, followed by an analysis of the level of evidence using the GRADE tool. Metanalysis was not performed due to several differences in methods applied by authors in primary studies. Eleven observational studies were selected according to the inclusion criteria from the total of 6,380 studies retrieved from databases. Eight studies demonstrated higher anxiety levels in subjects with periodontitis, among which only one study presented a high risk of bias. The GRADE tool revealed a low level of evidence for the anxiety outcome measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), both for case-control and cross-sectional studies. However, since anxiety may affect the quality of life of many subjects, it reinforces the need for further studies that evaluate this association for more extended periods.

AB  - Objective To investigate the effectiveness of community-based mental health interventions by professionally trained, lay counsellors in low- and middle-income countries. Methods We searched PubMed (R), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PROSPERO and EBSCO databases and professional section publications of the United States National Center for PTSD for randomized controlled trials of mental health interventions by professionally trained, lay counsellors in low- and middle-income countries published between 2000 and 2019. Studies of interventions by professional mental health workers, medical professionals or community health workers were excluded because there are shortages of these personnel in the study countries. Additional data were obtained from study authors. The primary outcomes were measures of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and alcohol use. To estimate effect size, we used a random-effects meta-analysis model. Findings We identified 1072 studies, of which 19 (involving 20 trials and 5612 participants in total) met the inclusion criteria. Hedges' g for the aggregate effect size of the interventions by professionally trained, lay counsellors compared with mostly either no intervention or usual care was -0.616 (95% confidence interval: -0.866 to -0.366). This result indicates a significant, medium-sized effect. There was no evidence of publication bias or any other form of bias across the studies and there were no extreme outliers among the study results. Conclusion The use of professionally trained, lay counsellors to provide mental health interventions in low- and middle-income countries was associated with significant improvements in mental health symptoms across a range of settings.

AB  - This scoping review of population-based epidemiological studies was done to provide background information on the prevalences and distribution of psychiatric disorders in Africa for calls to broaden diversity in psychiatric genetic studies. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science to retrieve relevant literature in English, French, and Portuguese from Jan 1, 1984, to Aug 18, 2020. In 36 studies from 12 African countries, the lifetime prevalence ranged from 3 center dot 3% to 9 center dot 8% for mood disorders, from 5 center dot 7% to 15 center dot 8% for anxiety disorders, from 3 center dot 7% to 13 center dot 3% for substance use disorders, and from 1 center dot 0% to 4 center dot 4% for psychotic disorders. Although the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders appears to be lower than that observed in research outside the continent, we identified similar distributions by gender, although not by age or urbanicity. This review reveals gaps in epidemiological research on psychiatric disorders and opportunities to leverage existing epidemiological and genetic research within Africa to advance our understanding of psychiatric disorders. Studies that are methodologically comparable but diverse in geographical context are needed to advance psychiatric epidemiology and provide a foundation for understanding environmental risk in genetic studies of diverse populations globally.

AB  - The mental health of nurses including burnout is an important issue. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate whether mind-body modalities improve burnout and other mental health aspects of nurses. A comprehensive search was conducted using six electronic databases. Randomized controlled trials using mind-body modalities on the mental health of nurses, up to January 2021, were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Seventeen studies were included in the review. Data on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and yoga were available for burnout, and there was no evidence that multimodal resilience programs including MBIs statistically significantly improved burnout levels compared to no intervention or active control groups. However, one study reported that yoga could significantly improve emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, which are subscales of burnout, compared to usual care. In addition, the effects of MBIs, relaxation, yoga, and music on various mental health outcomes and stress-related symptoms have been reported. In conclusion, there was some evidence that yoga was helpful for improvement in burnout of nurses. However, due to the heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes of the studies included, further high-quality clinical trials are needed on this topic in the future.

AB  - This narrative review synthesizes the literature on the psychological consequences of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident of 1979, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011. A search was conducted on OVID for studies in English from 1966 to 2020. Fifty-nine studies were included. Living through a nuclear disaster is associated with higher levels of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Decontamination workers, those living in closest proximity to the reactor, and evacuees experience higher rates of mental health problems after a nuclear disaster. Those with greater psychological resilience and social supports experience lower rates of psychological distress. Individual-level interventions, such as mindfulness training, behavioral activation, and cognitive reappraisal training, have shown modest benefits on improving psychological wellbeing. At the population level, many of the measures in place aimed at reducing exposure to radiation actually increase individuals' anxiety. Technology-based supports have been studied in other types of natural disasters and it may be beneficial to look at mobile-based interventions for future nuclear disasters.

AB  - We aimed to systematically identify and evaluate all studies of good quality that compared the occurrence of mental disorders in the self-employed versus employees. Adhering to the Cochrane guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and searched three major medical databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase), complemented by hand search. We included 26 (three longitudinal and 23 cross-sectional) population-based studies of good quality (using a validated quality assessment tool), with data from 3,128,877 participants in total. The longest of these studies, a Swedish national register evaluation with 25 years follow-up, showed a higher incidence of mental illness among the self-employed compared to white-collar workers, but a lower incidence compared to blue-collar workers. In the second longitudinal study from Sweden the self-employed had a lower incidence of mental illness compared to both blue- and white-collar workers over 15 years, whereas the third longitudinal study (South Korea) did not find a difference regarding the incidence of depressive symptoms over 6 years. Results from the cross-sectional studies showed associations between self-employment and poor general mental health and stress, but were inconsistent regarding other mental outcomes. Most studies from South Korea found a higher prevalence of mental disorders among the self-employed compared to employees, whereas the results of cross-sectional studies from outside Asia were less consistent. In conclusion, we found evidence from population-based studies for a link between self-employment and increased risk of mental illness. Further longitudinal studies are needed examining the potential risk for the development of mental disorders in specific subtypes of the self-employed.

Standardized questionnaires have been commonly used to measure coping in this body of research. This article identifies some of these studies and discusses several of these instruments, with a focus on their appropriateness for studying coping with stigmatization and discrimination. A systematic search of the literature was adapted for this review. The search term "(cope OR coping) AND stress* AND (stigma OR discriminat*)" was used, within the abstract field of five scientific databases. Articles that then met certain inclusion criteria were reviewed and organized using a matrix approach. Race and ethnicity were the most frequent stigma characteristics studied, with some commonly stigmatized groups being absent from the literature. Measures specifically designed to assess coping with stigmatization or discrimination were used less frequently. Only a few studies measured coping responses related to a specific form of stigmatization or discrimination.

AB  - BackgroundPregnancy is a time of profound physical and emotional change as well as an increased risk of mental illness. While strengthening social support is a common recommendation to reduce such mental health risk, no systematic review or meta-analysis has yet examined the relationship between social support and mental problems during pregnancy.MethodsThe PRISMA checklist was used as a guide to systematically review relevant peer-reviewed literature reporting primary data analyses. PubMed, Psych Info, MIDIRS, SCOPUS, and CINAHL database searches were conducted to retrieve research articles published between the years 2000 to 2019. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool was used for quality appraisal and the meta-analysis was conducted using STATA. The Q and the I-2 statistics were used to evaluate heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used to pool estimates. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's regression test and adjusted using trim and Fill analysis.ResultFrom the identified 3760 articles, 67 articles with 64,449 pregnant women were part of the current systematic review and meta-analysis. From the total 67 articles, 22 and 45 articles included in the narrative analysis and meta-analysis, respectively. From the total articles included in the narrative analysis, 20 articles reported a significant relationship between low social support and the risk of developing mental health problems (i.e. depression, anxiety, and self-harm) during pregnancy. After adjusting for publication bias, based on the results of the random-effect model, the pooled odds ratio (POR) of low social support was AOR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.41) for studies examining the relationship between low social support and antenatal depression and AOR: 1.97 (95% CI: 1.34, 2.92) for studies examining the relationship between low social support and antenatal anxiety.ConclusionLow social support shows significant associations with the risk of depression, anxiety, and self-harm during pregnancy. Policy-makers and those working on maternity care should consider the development of targeted social support programs with a view to helping reduce mental health problems amongst pregnant women. Plain language summaryPregnancy is a significant event for reproductive-age women. It is supplemented by hormonal changes and can represent a time of increased risk for the occurrence of mental illness like depression, anxiety and self-harm. Providing good social support for the pregnant mother reduce this risk and prevent pregnancy complication and adverse birth outcome. However, no systematic review and/or meta-analysis has explored the associations between social support and mental illness (depression, anxiety, self-harm) among pregnant women. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the association between social support and mental illness (anxiety, depression, and self-harm) during pregnancy.The review identified 67 relevant articles with 64,449 pregnant women, from PubMed, Psych Info, MIDIRS, SCOPUS, and CINAHL database. Of the total 67 articles, 22 articles included in the narrative review and 45 articles included in the meta-analysis. Among studies included in the narrative synthesis, a majority of them reported significant positive associations between low social support and antenatal depression, antenatal anxiety and self-harm during pregnancy. Further, the pooled estimates of the meta-analysis show that low social support had a significant positive association with antenatal depression (AOR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.
   41)) and antenatal anxiety (AOR: 1.97 (95% CI: 1.34, 2.92)). Therefore, maternal health professionals need to have discussions with pregnant women regarding the level and source of social support they receive. Maternal health professionals may also need to consider encouraging the social network of pregnant women to improve social support being given. Policy-makers and those working on maternity care should consider the development of targeted social support programs with a view to helping reduce mental health problems amongst pregnant women.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Heterogeneous evidence exists for the association between COVID-19 and the clinical outcomes of patients with mental health disorders. It remains unknown whether patients with COVID-19 and mental health disorders are at increased risk of mortality and should thus be targeted as a high-risk population for severe forms of COVID-19.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether patients with mental health disorders were at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality compared with patients without mental health disorders.
   DATA SOURCES For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to February 12, 2021. Bibliographies were also searched, and the corresponding authors were directly contacted. The search paradigm was based on the following combination: (mental, major[MeSH terms]) AND (COVID-19 mortality[MeSH terms]). To ensure exhaustivity, the term mental was replaced by psychiatric, schizophrenia, psychotic, bipolar disorder, mood disorders, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, personality disorder, eating disorder, alcohol abuse, alcohol misuse, substance abuse, and substance misuse.
   STUDY SELECTION Eligible studies were population-based cohort studies of all patients with identified COVID-19 exploring the association between mental health disorders and mortality.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was used for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Pooled crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the association of mental health disorders with mortality were calculated using a 3-level random-effects (study/country) approach with a hierarchical structure to assess effect size dependency.
   RESULTS In total, 16 population-based cohort studies (data from medico-administrative health or electronic/medical records databases) across 7 countries (1 from Denmark, 2 from France, 1 from Israel, 3 from South Korea, 1 from Spain, 1 from the UK, and 7 from the US) and 19 086 patients with mental health disorders were included. The studies covered December 2019 to July 2020, were of good quality, and no publication bias was identified. COVID-19 mortality was associated with an increased risk among patients with mental health disorders compared with patients without mental health disorders according to both pooled crude OR (1.75 [95% CI, 1.40-2.20]; P<.05) and adjusted OR (1.38 [95% CI, 1.15-1.65]; P<.05). The patients with severe mental health disorders had the highest ORs for risk of mortality (crude OR: 2.26 [95% CI, 1.18-4.31]; adjusted OR: 1.67 [95% CI, 1.02-2.73]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 observational studies in 7 countries, mental health disorders were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality. Thus, patients with mental health disorders should have been targeted as a high-risk population for severe forms of COVID-19, requiring enhanced preventive and disease management strategies. Future studies should more accurately evaluate the risk for patients with each mental health disorder. However, the highest risk seemed to be found in studies including individuals with schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorders.

AB  - Depression is the most prevalent mental disorder in pregnancy, and yet it is less studied than postpartum depression despite the consequences it may have on both the pregnant woman and her offspring. Therefore, it would be important to know which risk factors may favour the appearance of antenatal depression in order to carry out appropriate prevention interventions. The aim of the present review was to identify the main risk factors of antenatal depression. We searched in databases PubMed and PsycINFO for articles published about the factors associated with antenatal depression from January 2010 through December 2020. The literature review identified three main groups of antenatal depression risk factors: sociodemographic, obstetric, and psychological. First, among the sociodemographic variables, the low level of studies and the economic income clearly stood out from the rest. Then, not having planned the pregnancy was the main obstetric variable, and finally, the main psychological risk factors were having a history of psychological disorders and/or depression as well as presenting anxiety, stress, and/or low social support during pregnancy. This review shows that the antenatal depression is affected by multiple factors. Most can be identified at the beginning of the pregnancy, and some are risk factors potentially modifiable through appropriate interventions, such as psychological factors. For this reason, it is important to carry out a good screening for depression during pregnancy and consequently, be able to prevent its appearance or treat it if necessary.

AB  - Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been spreading and brought unprecedented psychological pressure on people across the entire globe since December 2019.
   Objectives To synthesize the existing evidence of the prevalence of mental health status during the epidemic and provide the basis for mental health education.
   Materials and methods The literature search was conducted in nine databases from December 2019 to October 2020. The risk of bias for each study was assessed, and the random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42020208619.
   Results About 27 studies were included in the analysis with a total of 706,415 participants combined, and 14 mental health problems were gathered. Meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression was 39% (95% CI: 27-51%) and that of anxiety was 36% (95% CI: 26-46%). Subgroup analysis indicated that the prevalence of depression and anxiety varied among nations and due to the survey date. The prevalence of depression (60%, 95% CI: 46-74%) and anxiety (60%, 95% CI: 46-74%) in non-Chinese college students was higher than those in Chinese college students (26%, 95% CI: 21-30% and 20%, 95% CI: 14-26%). The proportion of depression (54%, 95% CI: 40-67%) and anxiety (37%, 95% CI: 26-48%) was higher after March 1 than before it (21%, 95% CI: 16-25% and 19%, 95% CI: 13-25%).
   Conclusions The meta-analysis results presented that the prevalence of depression (39%) or anxiety (36%) among college students greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the mental health of college students is affected by the nations and the survey date. It was necessary to take measures to reduce mental health risks during the pandemic.

AB  - Objectives: To synthesize the prevalence of mental and substance use disorders in countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) of the World Health Organization.
   Methods: The literature search was conducted across several databases in two phases. First, we searched for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses published before 2014, reporting prevalence estimates for mental disorders in the EMR. Then, we identified new primary cross-sectional or longitudinal studies published between 2014 and 2020. Studies were included if they had a sample size of >= 450 and were conducted among the general adult population. Current, period and lifetime prevalence estimates for each disorder were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses, and subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were conducted.
   Findings: Prevalence estimates were extracted from 54 cross-sectional studies across 15 countries within the EMR. Pooled analyses of current, period and lifetime prevalence showed the highest prevalence for depression (14.8%, 95% confidence interval, CI: 10.7-20.1%), followed by generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (10.4%, 95% CI: 7.1-14.7%), post-traumatic stress disorder (7.2%, 95% CI: 2.9-16.6%), substance use (4.0%, 95% CI: 3.1-5.2%), obsessive compulsive disorder (2.8%, 95% CI: 1.6-4.9%), phobic disorders (1.8%, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8%), panic disorders (1.1 %, 95% CI: 0.6-2.2%), bipolar disorders (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%), and psychosis (0.5%, 95% CI: 0.3-0.9%). Populations exposed to adverse events had higher prevalence of mental disorders than the general population. Period and lifetime prevalence showed little difference across mental disorders. More pronounced differences in prevalence were seen for depression and GAD, specifically between current and lifetime prevalence (depression: current prevalence 20.5% (95% CI: 14.9-27.4%), vs. lifetime prevalence: 4.2% (95%CI: 1.8-9.6%); GAD: current prevalence 10.3% (95% CI: 6.1-17.0), vs. lifetime prevalence: 4.5% (95% CI: 2.4-8.3%). Differences between current and lifetime prevalence of mental disorders may be due to the use of different screening instruments and thresholds being applied.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of mental and substance use disorders in the EMR is high. Despite substantial inter-survey heterogeneity, our estimates align with previous global and regional data on mental disorders. Our meta-review provides new evidence on the burden of mental health problems in the EMR.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Egyptian healthcare workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Six databases were searched for relevant papers. The quality of the selected articles was measured using the National Institute of Health quality assessment tool. We used a fixed-effects model when there was no heterogeneity and a random-effects model when there was heterogeneity. RESULTS: After screening 197 records, 10 studies were ultimately included. Anxiety was the most commonly reported psychiatric disorder among HCWs, with a prevalence of 71.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.4 to 86.9), followed by stress (66.6%; 95% CI, 47.6 to 81.3), depression (65.5%; 95% CI, 46.9 to 80.3), and insomnia (57.9%; 95% CI, 45.9 to 69.0). As measured using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, the most common level of severity was moderate for depression (22.5%; 95% CI, 19.8 to 25.5) and stress (14.5%; 95% CI, 8.8 to 22.9), while high-severity anxiety was more common than other levels of severity (28.2%; 95% CI, 3.8 to 79.6). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on Egyptian HCWs' psychological well-being. More psychological support and preventive measures should be implemented to prevent the further development of psychiatric illness among physicians and other HCWs.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on society's overall mental health. Measures such as mandated lockdowns and physical distancing have contributed to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and other metrics indicating worsening mental health. Peer support, which is peer-to-peer provided social and emotional support, is an underutilized and effective mental health resource that can potentially be used to ameliorate mental health during these times.
   Objective: This review aims to summarize the toll that this pandemic has had on society's mental health as found in peer-reviewed literature from October 2019 to March 2021, as well as suggest the utility of peer support to address these needs.
   Methods: References for this review were chosen through searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for articles published between October 2019 and March 2021 that used the terms: "coronavirus, " "COVID-19, " "mental health, " "anxiety, " "depression, " "isolation, " "mental health resources, " "peer support, " "online mental health resources, " and "healthcare workers. " Articles resulting from these searches and relevant references cited in those articles were reviewed. Articles published in English, French and Italian were included.
   Results: This pandemic has ubiquitously worsened the mental health of populations across the world. Peer support has been demonstrated to yield generally positive effects on the mental health of a wide variety of recipients, and it can be provided through numerous accessible mediums.
   Conclusions: Peer support can overall be beneficial for improving mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and may be an effective tool should similar events arise in the future, although the presence of a few conflicting studies suggests the need for additional research.

Depression is estimated in 39 studies, and the pooled prevalence of depression is 36% (95% CI 0.31-0.41, I-2 = 99.6%). There are 10 studies reported the prevalence of insomnia, and the overall prevalence of insomnia is 32% (95% CI 0.23-0.42, I-2 = 99.5%). The subgroup analysis showed a higher incidence of anxiety and depression among women and the frontline HCWs compared to men and non-frontline HCWs respectively. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused heavy psychological impact among healthcare professionals especially women and frontline workers. Timely psychological counseling and intervention ought to be implemented for HCWs in order to alleviate their anxiety and improve their general mental health.

AB  - Objective: Psychological distress is a common complication in patients after Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) which often has significant impact on the prognosis. The objective of this study was to determine the pooled prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms in patients after SAH and identify relevant risk factors. Methods: The study adopted a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol. Multiple databases including EMBASE, Medline, PsychInfo, and Web of Science were searched for publications before 1st January 2020. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken following the PRISMA guidelines for preferred reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The random-effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence rates. Meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020182594) . Results: 42 studies reporting anxiety symptoms and 64 studies reporting depressive symptoms were included. The pooled short term(<3 years) and long term(>= 3 years) prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms were 31.4%(95% CI: 23.6%, 40.4%) and 40.4%(95% CI: 31.6%, 49.8%), respectively, whereas the pooled short term and long term prevalence rates of depressive symptoms were 25.2%(95%CI: 17.8%, 34.5%) and 35.8%(95%CI: 28.6%, 43.6%), respectively. Gender and pre-existing psychiatric conditions were identified as potential risk factors. Conclusions: The high prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms after SAH highlights the need for appropriate assessment and management of psychological stress in patients after SAH. Further research is warranted to explore potential underlying mechanisms and to develop holistic interventions that incorporate understanding of both the biological and psychological impact of SAH.

AB  - Background: b-Blockers (BBs) are a widely used class of medications with a number of medical indications. Their ability to suppress the adrenergic response has made them a target of investigation for treating a variety of psychiatric symptoms. Objective: The aim of this review is to identify evidence regarding the use of BBs for various psychiatric disorders including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, psychosis, and posttraumatic stress dis -order. We also review the evidence for use for aggression and agitation and for extrapyramidal side effects of psychiatric medications. Methods: A search of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted with search terms relevant to the use of BBs for psychiatric conditions. Studies were selected based on relevance to the review objective, focusing on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Case reports were included and are clearly identified when referenced in this review. Results: A total of 44 publications were included that examined the use of BBs as treatment for the following psychiatric symptoms and conditions: anxiety disorders, depression and mood disorders, acute stress disorder and postraumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorders and extrapyramidal symp-toms, as well as aggression and agitation. Additionally, adverse effects and drug-drug interactions were reviewed. Conclusion: Well-characterized psychiatric uses of BBs include treating symptoms of performance anxiety and akathisia. Some positive evidence exists for BB therapy in other disorders such as specific phobia, panic disorder, and for aggression in patients with psychosis, acquired brain injury, or intellectual disability. Most of the evi-dence on the role of BBs in psychiatry is as adjunctive treatment for management of somatic symptoms rather than as monotherapy. Outside of performance anxiety and akathisia, the role of BBs in psychiatry has not been subjected to careful study, and further investigative trials are needed.

AB  - Objective Heart rate variability (HRV) is a marker of autonomic nervous system function associated with both physical and mental health. Many studies have suggested that mindfulness and meditation-based interventions (MBIs) are associated with improvements in HRV, but findings are mixed, and to date, no comprehensive meta-analysis has synthesized results. Methods Systematic literature searches were conducted using PsycINFO, Embase, Medline, CINAHL, ERIC, and Scopus to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of predominantly seated MBIs on resting-state vagally mediated HRV. Risk of bias was judged using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results Nineteen RCTs met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis found that MBIs were not efficacious in increasing vagally mediated resting-state HRV relative to control conditions (Hedges g = 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.014 to 0.77). When removing an outlier (g = 3.22), the effect size was reduced, CI narrowed, and findings remained nonsignificant (g = 0.19, 95% CI = -0.02 to 0.39). High heterogeneity in results (I-2 = 89.12%) could not be explained by a priori-determined moderators including intervention duration, study setting, and control type. Conclusions There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate that MBIs lead to improvements in vagally mediated HRV over control conditions. Future large, well-designed RCTs with low risk of methodological bias could help add to the current evidence to elucidate any role MBIs might play in impacting HRV.

AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence that healthcare workers (HCWs) experience significant psychological distress during an epidemic or pandemic. Considering the increase in emerging infectious diseases and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review and synthesize the available evidence on the psychological impact of disease outbreaks on HCWs. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of epidemics and pandemics on the mental health of HCWs. Method: PubMed, PsycInfo, and PsycArticles databases were systematically searched from inception to June-end 2020 for studies reporting the impact of a pandemic/epidemic on the mental health of HCWs. Results: Seventy-six studies were included in this review. Of these, 34 (45%) focused on SARS, 28 (37%) on COVID-19, seven (9%) on MERS, four (5%) on Ebola, two (3%) on H1N1, and one (1%) on H7N9. Most studies were cross-sectional (93%) and were conducted in a hospital setting (95%). Common mental health symptoms identified by this review were acute stress disorder, depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The associated risk factors were working in high-risk environments (frontline), being female, being a nurse, lack of adequate personal protective equipment, longer shifts, lack of knowledge of the virus, inadequate training, less years of experience in healthcare, lack of social support, and a history of quarantine. Conclusion: HCWs working in the frontline during epidemics and pandemics experience a wide range of mental health symptoms. It is imperative that adequate psychological support be provided to HCWs during and after these extraordinary distressful events.

AB  - This study aimed to address knowledge gaps related to the prevention and management of mental health responses among those with a condition that presents risk of severe COVID-19 infection. A scoping review that mapped English and Chinese-language studies (2019-2020) located in MEDLINE (Ovid), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and Airiti Library was undertaken. Search terms related to COVID-19, mental health, and physical health were used and articles that included all three of these factors were extracted (n = 77). With the exception of one hospital-based pilot study, there were no intervention studies targeting mental health in those at risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Promising practices such as integrated care models that appropriately screen for mental health issues, address health determinants, and include use of digital resources were highlighted. Patient navigator programs, group online medical visits, peer support, and social prescribing may also support those with complex needs. Future policies need to address digital health access inequities and the implementation of multi-integrated health and social care. Furthermore, research is needed to comprehensively assess multi-integrated interventions that are resilient to public health crises.

AB  - Introduction: The psychological impact of COVID-19 on health-care workers (HCWs) has received attention from researchers to understand the extent of the effects of the ongoing pandemic on this population. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the currently available literature on the topic to determine the prevalence of mental health problems in HCWs.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases for articles published from December 2019 to August 15, 2020. We identified studies reporting the prevalence of any mental health condition in HCWs involved directly or indirectly in providing services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence proportion for individual outcome was extracted as an estimate of interest. We performed random-effects meta-analyses evaluated using Q statistic, I-2 statistic, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses and assessed study quality. This review was done in adherence to the Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The study protocol was registered prospectively at PROSPERO (CRD42020182005).
   Results: We identified 1958 studies, of which 33 studies including 39703 participants (with a median = 393; range = 88-14825) were finally included for analysis. The estimated overall prevalence were as follows: depression 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.9-39.3, I-2 = 99%), anxiety 32.5% (95% CI: 26.4-39.0, I-2 = 99%), insomnia or sleep disturbance 36.6% (95% CI: 36.6-48.3, I-2 = 99%), and stress 37.7% (95% CI: 24.0-52.3, I-2 = 100%).
   Conclusion: HCWs who are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic have a significant prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia and poor sleep quality, and stress. The health-care workforce needs to practice self-care now more than ever, while health-care managers and policymakers need to factor in the mental health consequences of COVID-19 on their workforce.

AB  - Parents of children with developmental disabilities are susceptible to mental health problems. Mindfulness-based and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)-based interventions can improve their mental well-being. This review examined the effectiveness of mindfulness-based and ACT-based interventions in improving mental well-being and mindfulness among parents of children with developmental disabilities. Six electronic databases were searched, resulting in the inclusion of ten studies published between 2014 and 2020. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effect model. The results suggest that mindfulness-based and ACT-based interventions were effective in decreasing parental stress, anxiety and depression, however, the effectiveness of these interventions in increasing parental mindfulness was inconclusive. Based on these findings, we discussed considerations for implementing interventions and identified areas which warrant further research.

AB  - Background Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered as an index of both physical and emotional health, and biofeedback aiming to increase the level of HRV has demonstrated extensive beneficial effects. Although HRV biofeedback is commonly and reliably applied in adults, the use of this technique, alone or in addition to other treatments, in children and adolescents has not been widely explored to date. Methods This systematic review following PRISMA guidelines covers all human studies using HRV biofeedback in children and adolescents. A literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus, and a standardized methodological quality assessment was performed. Results Results showed the efficiency of HRV biofeedback sessions with children and adolescents to reduce physical and mental health-related symptoms and enhance well-being. Conclusions These findings underline the therapeutic value of using HRV biofeedback as a complement to more conventional behavioural and cognitive interventions to help children to manage stress and/or pain. Capitalizing on the identified strengths and shortcomings of available results, we propose research avenues as well as evidence-based clinical guidelines for using HRV biofeedback in clinical paediatric settings.

AB  - Objectives: This review aims to (i) summarize the literature on optogenetic applications of different stress-induced mood disorder models of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and its projection circuits, and (ii) examine methodological variability across the literature and how such variations may influence the underlying circuits of stress-induced mood disorders. Methods: A variety of databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley) were systematically searched to identify optogenetic studies that applied to mood disorders in the context of stress. Results: Eleven studies on optogenetic stimulation of the mPFC and the effect of its efferent circuitry on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in different rodent models were selected. The results showed that the optogenetics (i) can provide insights into the underlying circuits of mood disorders in the context of stress (ii) and also points out new therapeutic strategies for treating mood disorders. Conclusions: These findings indicate a clear role for the mPFC in social avoidance, and highlight the central role of stress reactivity circuitry that may be targeted for the treatment of stress-induced mood disorders.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to summarize the prevalence and risk factors of mental health problems among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We applied an optimized search strategy across the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO, and four Chinese databases, with hand searching supplemented to identify relevant surveys. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published in peer-reviewed literature and used a validated method to assess the prevalence and risk factors of mental health problems among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Heterogeneity was quantified using Q statistics and the I2 statistics. The potential causes of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the robustness of the results.
   Results: We pooled and analyzed data from 20 studies comprising 10,886 healthcare workers. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, phobia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and somatization symptoms was 24.1, 28.6, 44.1, 25.6, 35.0, 16.2, and 10.7%, respectively. Female and nurses had a high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Frontline healthcare workers had a higher prevalence of anxiety and a lower prevalence of depression than the those in the second-line. Furthermore, the proportion of moderate-severe depression and anxiety is higher in the frontline. Additionally, four studies reported on risk factors of mental health problems.
   Conclusions: In this systematic review, healthcare workers have a relatively high prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, phobia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and somatization symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, and focus should be on the healthcare workers at high risk of mental problems. Mental health problems in healthcare workers should be taken seriously, and timely screening and appropriate intervention for the high-risk group are highly recommended.

AB  - Exercise as a treatment option for people with mental disorders is a field of growing interest. The increased number of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of exercise in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders in recent years calls for an update of the available meta-analytic evidence. Electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PSYCArticles, and Embase) were searched up to 17.2.2021, for RCTs evaluating the effects of exercise on anxiety and stress symptoms in adults with anxiety and related disorders. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted. A total of 13 RCTs comprising 731 adult participants (exercise n=376; control n=355) were included. Exercise had a small, bordering medium, but statistically significant effect on decreasing anxiety symptoms compared to control condition (standardized mean difference=-0.425, 95%CI -0.67 to -0.17; I2 = 47.9%) in people with anxiety and related disorders. Our meta-analysis updates the existing evidence supporting exercise as an efficacious intervention for anxiety and related disorders. Although the updated meta-analytic evidence is less heterogenous than previously reported, future research is still needed to explore the factors moderating the effects of exercise on outcome such as frequency, intensity, duration of the sessions, and type of exercise and qualification of the provider in more detail.

AB  - The purpose was to assess prevalence of suicidality, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety among female sex workers (FSW). A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. Search strategy was performed in MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Ovid and Cochrane Central Database from inception until March 2020. Considered for inclusion were cross-sectional studies performed on FSW that assessed prevalence of any of the following: suicide attempt or suicidal ideation, depression, PTSD, or anxiety. Five reviewers, independently and in duplicate, selected all eligible articles in an abstract and full-text screening phase and, moreover, extracted information from each study. A binomial-normal generalized linear mixed model was employed to estimate prevalence of the conditions. From 8035 studies yielded in the search strategy, 55 were included for analysis. The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt was 27% (95% C.I. 18-39%) and 20% (95% C.I. 13-28%), respectively. Furthermore, overall prevalence of depression and PTSD was 44% (95% C.I. 35-54%) and 29% (95% C.I. 18-44%), respectively. Eleven studies were classified as high quality. Findings indicate that there is an overall high prevalence of suicidality, depression, and PTSD among FSW. Development of accessible large-scale interventions that assess mental health among this population remains critical.

AB  - Background: Despite an increasing number of available mental health apps in the bipolar disorder field, these tools remain scarcely implemented in everyday practice and are quickly discontinued by patients after downloading. The aim of this study is to explore adherence characteristics of bipolar disorder patients to dedicated smartphone interventions in research studies.
   Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Three databases (EMBASE, PsychInfo and MEDLINE) were searched using the following keywords: "bipolar disorder" or "mood disorder" or "bipolar" combined with "digital" or "mobile" or "phone" or "smartphone" or "mHealth" or "ehealth" or "mobile health" or "app" or "mobile-health".
   Results: Thirteen articles remained in the review after exclusion criteria were applied. Of the 118 eligible studies, 39 did not provide adherence characteristics. Among the selected papers, study length, sample size and definition of measures of adherence were strongly heterogeneous. Activity rates ranged from 58 to 91.6%.
   Conclusion: The adherence of bipolar patients to apps is understudied. Standardised measures of adherence should be defined and systematically evaluated in future studies dedicated to these tools.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has affected not only physical health but also mental health and psychological wellbeing. This narrative review aimed to map the literature on the psychological impact on the young generation of the COVID-19 pandemic, social restrictions, and extraordinary measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE through PubMed and Web of Science [Science Citation Index Expanded, SCI-EXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)] of all scientific literature published from May 2020 until 15 March 2021. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 15 articles were included. We conducted a narrative review. The reviewed articles suggested the impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures on young persons for several mental symptoms as well as anxiety, stress, depression, event-specific distress, decrease in psychological wellbeing, and changes in sleep habits. Psychological symptoms were related to the experience of several stressors, such as risk for reduction of academic perspectives, massive e-learning adoption, economic issues, social restrictions, and implications for daily life related to the COVID-19 outbreak. This narrative review points out the negative psychological impact of the pandemic outbreak and the high vulnerability of the young in the development of psychological distress, highlighting the relevant focus on the mental health of young people during the pandemic and the need for structured and tailored psychological support and interventions focused to the improvement of Quality of Life of university students after the pandemic experience.

AB  - Top-tier evidence on the safety/tolerability of 80 medications in children/adolescents with mental disorders has recently been reviewed in this jour-nal. To guide clinical practice, such data must be combined with evidence on efficacy and acceptability. Besides medications, psychosocial inter-ventions and brain stimulation techniques are treatment options for children/adolescents with mental disorders. For this umbrella review, we systematically searched network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses (MAs) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating 48 medications, 20 psychosocial interventions, and four brain stimulation techniques in children/adolescents with 52 different mental disorders or groups of mental disorders, reporting on 20 different efficacy/acceptability outcomes. Co-primary outcomes were disease-specific symptom reduction and all-cause discontinuation ("acceptability"). We included 14 NMAs and 90 MAs, reporting on 15 mental disorders or groups of mental disorders. Overall, 21 medications outperformed placebo regarding the co-primary outcomes, and three psychosocial interventions did so (while seven outperformed waiting list/no treatment). Based on the meta-analytic evidence, the most convincing efficacy profile emerged for amphetamines, methylphenidate and, to a smaller extent, behavioral therapy in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; aripiprazole, risperidone and several psychosocial interventions in autism; risperidone and behavioral interventions in disruptive behavior disorders; several antipsychotics in schizophrenia spectrum disorders; fluoxetine, the combination of fluoxetine and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and interpersonal therapy in depression; aripiprazole in mania; fluoxetine and group CBT in anxiety disorders; fluoxetine/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, CBT, and behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention in obsessive-compulsive disorder; CBT in post-traumatic stress disorder; imipramine and alarm behavioral intervention in enuresis; behavioral therapy in encopresis; and family therapy in anorexia nervosa. Results from this umbrella review of interventions for mental disorders in children/adolescents provide evidence-based information for clinical decision making.

AB  - Objectives Despite the studies that examined the effect of exercise and meditation on depression and anxiety, no meta-analysis has proved this effect so far. Also, the effect of these factors is unknown in terms of gender and aerobic exercise. This meta-analysis addressed these gaps.
   Methods Major electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase, were searched until July 2019. Studies addressing the effect of exercise and meditation on depression and anxiety were found. Q-test and I-2 statistic investigated the heterogeneity across the studies. The probability of publication bias was explored using Begg's and Egger's tests. The results were expressed as the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval using a random-effects model.
   Results We identified a total of 10015 references and 51 studies involving 3594 participants. Compared with the control group, the SMD estimate of anxiety was -0.7 (-1.20, -0.19) for meditation, -0.9 (-1.24, -0.57) for aerobic, and -1.07 (-1.67, -0.46) for other exercises. Also, the SMD estimate of depression was0.84 (-1.26, -0.42) for meditation, -0.44 (-0.72, -0.17) for aerobic, and -1.10 (-1.55, -0.65) for other exercises.
   Conclusion Exercise and meditation had a significant effect on depression and anxiety. Furthermore, there was an effect of the exercise and meditation on depression and anxiety regarding the female gender and aerobic exercise.

This systematic review aims to identify the best available scientific evidence on the impact that home confinement and social distancing, derived from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, have had on the mental health of the general population in terms of depression, stress and anxiety. (2) Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect between 2 January 2021 and 7 January 2021, in accordance with the recommendations of the PRISMA Declaration. The selection of studies and the evaluation of their methodological quality were performed in pairs, independently and blindly, based on predetermined eligibility criteria. (3) Results: The 26 investigations reviewed were developed in different regions and countries. Factors that are associated with poor mental health were female gender, young ages, having no income and suffering from a previous psychiatric illness. Inadequate management of the pandemic by authorities and a lack or excess of information also contributed to worse mental health. (4) Conclusions: There are groups of people more likely to suffer higher levels of anxiety, depression and stress during the restrictive measures derived from COVID-19.

AB  - Background A unique feature of the global coronavirus pandemic has been the widespread adoption of mask-wearing as a public health measure to minimize the risk of contagion. Little is known about the effects of increased mask-wearing on social interactions, social anxiety, or overall mental health. Objectives Explore the potential effects of mask-wearing on social anxiety. Design We review existing literatures to highlight three preselected sets of factors that may be important in shaping the effects of mask-wearing on social anxiety. These are: (a) people's perceptions of the social norms associated with wearing masks; (b) people's experiences of the degree to which masks prevent accurate interpretation of social and emotional cues; and (c) people's use of masks as a type of safety behavior that enables self-concealment. Methods APA PsycNet and PubMed were searched principally between September and November 2020 for articles describing the relationship between social anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, ambiguous feedback, and safety behavior use and for research on the relationship between mask-wearing and social norms and social interactions. Information identified as relevant from articles of interest was extracted and included in our review. Results & Conclusions The effects of mask-wearing on social anxiety are likely to be substantial and clinically relevant.

AB  - Introduction: Health care workers, due to be involved in caring for COVID-19 patients may experience various psychological problems including anxiety disorders. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic by systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: The PRISMA guideline was used for conducting this study. Related keywords were searched in credited resources including ISC, Magiran, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Embase to find the articles published on the prevalence of GAD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the first of January to the end of June 2020. Meta-analysis was conducted by the random effects model.
   Results: In this study, 553 articles were initially identified, from which 19 studies were finally included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that the prevalence of GAD in health care workers based on the GAD-7 and GAD-2 instruments were 32.04% (95% CI: 26.89-37.19, I-2 = 98.2%, p < 0.001) and 22.62% (95% CI: 9.01-36.24, I-2 = 97.7%, p < 0.001). The overall prevalence of GAD was obtained 30.5% (95% CI: 25.58-35.42, I-2 = 98.4%, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: This study showed a relatively high GAD prevalence, as one of the fundamental psychological problems, among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, health system managers should implement preventive strategies to protect health staff from contracting the virus and monitor them for psychological problems and provide them with supportive measures if necessary.

AB  - Home demolition is considered a miserable and frequent reality of life for thousands of Palestinian people. Recently, in January 2020, at least 44 structures were demolished by Israeli forces, displacing at least 87 people. Studies have revealed high levels of stress was associated with losing a family home during home demolition, and the stress doesn't only carry out immediate effects but also long-term mental consequences. This paper aims to provide an overview of the literature and established studies related to the mental health consequences of home demolitions in Palestine. Methods PubMed, Science Direct, Semantic Scholar and Google Scholar were used to search for materials for the critical analysis of empirical articles. The following aspects were taken into consideration: study type, sample, and key findings. Results In this review, nine studies related to mental health consequences of home demolition were found and considered in this paper. The results indicate depression, stress, anxiety, phobias and lack of hope in the future are mutual themes running throughout the lives of those Palestinian families who have actually experienced home demolition along with those who have experienced a constant threat of demolition to their homes. In addition, many of life stressors such as lack of educational opportunities, low incomes, and a tendency to live in poor housing conditions after and before demolition also play a role in developing serious mental disorders. Conclusion As primary prevention, the practice of home demolition in Palestine has to be ended. In addition to conduct a constant monitoring of the resulting displacement and the damage caused, and ensuring the necessary assistance in particular mental health and psychological support for victims of home demolitions.

AB  - Objectives: The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread globally, and we aimed to investigate the psychosocial impact on healthcare workers (HWs) in China during the pandemic.
   Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched seven electronic databases for cross-sectional studies on psychosocial impact on HWs in relation to COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to October 7, 2020. We included primary studies involving Chinese HWs during the pandemic, and data were extracted from the published articles. Our primary outcome was prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress disorders. We pooled prevalence value with their 95% confidence interval using random effect models and assessed study quality on the basis of an 11-item checklist recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020195843).
   Results: We identified 25 articles comprising a total of 30,841 completed questionnaires and 22 studies for meta-analysis. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress disorders was 34.4% (29.5-39.4%), 31.1% (24.5-37.7%), and 29.1% (24.3-33.8%) for HWs. The pooled prevalence of anxiety disorders for HWs from late January to early February was 46.4% (42.9-49.9%), significantly higher than those in mid-term February (28.0%, 23.9-32.1%) and after late February (27.6%, 16.0-39.2%). The pooled prevalence of depression disorders for HWs from late January to early February was 46.5% (38.8-54.2%), significantly higher than those in mid-term February (27.1%, 19.8-34.5%) and after late February (32.9%, 16.2-49.5%). HWs working in Hubei Province had a higher prevalence of anxiety (37.9 vs. 30.8%) and a lower prevalence of depression (27.5 vs. 34.7%) than those working in other regions. Nurses had a higher prevalence of anxiety (44.1 vs. 29.0%) and depression (34.1 vs. 29.2%) than other HWs.
   Conclusions: About one-third of HWs in China suffered anxiety, depression, and stress at the early epidemic of COVID-19. HWs in Hubei Province, especially nurses, had a higher prevalence of psychological disorders. During the pandemic, a negative psychological state may persist in a proportion of Chinese HWs, fluctuating with the control of the pandemic. The long-term impact should continue to be observed. Attention should be paid to HWs for their psychological impact due to the pandemic.
   Systematic Review Registration: The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020195843).

AB  - Objective: Several long-lasting health complications have been reported in previous coronavirus infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review studies that evaluated physical and mental health problems postCOVID-19. Methods: Articles for inclusion in this scoping review were identified by searching the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases for items dated from 1 January to 7 November 2020. Observational studies evaluating physical health (musculoskeletal symptoms, functional status) or mental health status with a followup period longer than 1 month after discharge or after the onset of symptoms were included. Results: This scoping review included 34 studies with follow-up periods of up to 3 months post-COVID-19. The most commonly reported physical health problems were fatigue (range 28% to 87%), pain (myalgia 4.5% to 36%), arthralgia (6.0% to 27%), reduced physical capacity (six-minute walking test range 180 to 561 m), and declines in physical role functioning, usual care and daily activities (reduced in 15% to 54% of patients). Common mental health problems were anxiety (range 6.5% to 63%), depression (4% to 31%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (12.1% to 46.9%). Greater fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression were reported in female patients and individuals admitted to intensive care. An overall lower quality of life was seen up to 3 months post-COVID19. Conclusions: This review highlights the presence of several physical and mental health problems up to 3 months post-COVID-19. The findings point to the need for comprehensive evaluation and rehabilitation post-COVID-19 to promote quality of life.

AB  - Mental health symptoms are pervasive, with 1 in 5 American adults experiencing a mental disorder. Poor mental health is associated with a significant global cost burden, from disability to economic impacts. The field of lifestyle medicine, which emphasizes the role of lifestyle factors in the onset and treatment of disease and well-being, is well suited to address mental health. More recently, there has been attention to the need to incorporate mental health into the field of lifestyle medicine and to attend to the bidirectional role of mental health and lifestyle. Thus, there is a critical opportunity for the field of lifestyle medicine to incorporate mental health into each of the foundational pillars (diet, exercise, substance use, psychological well-being/stress, relationships, sleep) while also specifically targeting lifestyle interventions for populations with mental disorders. The current article provides a framework for the role of mental health within lifestyle medicine by addressing the scope of the problem, clarification regarding mental health, and areas of practice (ie, psychiatry), and providing an overview of the relevant mental health literature for each pillar. This article serves as a call to action to explicitly address and include mental health within all aspects of lifestyle medicine research and practice.

AB  - Humankind is confronted with progressing climate change, pollution, environmental degradation, and/or destruction of the air, soil, water, and ecosystems. The climate and environmental crisis is probably one of the greatest challenges in the history of humankind. It not only poses a serious current and continuing threat to physical health, but is also an existing and growing hazard to the mental health of millions of people worldwide. This synergy of literature provides a current summary of the adverse mental health impacts of the climate and environmental crisis from the perspective of Clinical Psychology. Furthermore, it presents potential underlying processes, including biological, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and social pathways. The existing data suggest that the climate and environmental crisis not only acts as a direct stressor, but can also exert a detrimental impact on the various pathways, with the potential to amplify an individual's biopsychosocial vulnerability to develop mental ill-health. This is a call for an increased investigation into this emerging research field of Clinical Ecopsychology by clinical psychologists and other researchers.

AB  - Discrimination heavily impacts the lives of trans populations and causes adverse mental health outcomes. As stated by the Gender Minority Stress Model self-stigmatization could play an important role in this process. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate whether there is a positive association between self-stigmatization and mental health and to identify mediation factors. Studies which quantitatively investigated the association between internalized transnegativity and selected mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal tendency) in self-identified trans populations were included. Comprehensive search of 5 large databases in June 2020 and the following screening and selection procedure, performed by two researchers separately, identified 14 studies which met criteria. The relationship to be studied was reported with correlation and/or mediation analysis of cross-sectional data. IT was directly positively associated with depression, anxiety and suicidal tendency in most of the reviewed studies. Data indicates links between self-stigmatization and other general mental health stressors such as rumination and thwarted belongingness. Community connectedness showed to be the strongest protective factor for mental health impairments. These results should be considered in transition counseling. More research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the GMSM and to address unsolved operationalization and measurement issues.

AB  - In this general literature review, we will explore the impacts and contribution of social determinants to mental health and resiliency following both natural and man-made disasters. Natural disasters, such as wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes, as well as man-made disasters, such as civil wars, have been known to inflict significant damage to the mental health of the victims. In this paper, we mainly explore some most studied vulnerability and protective social determinant factors such as gender, age, ethnicity, socials support and socioeconomic status for the mental health and resiliency in survivors of such disasters. Several other possible factors such as previous trauma, childhood abuse, family psychiatric history, and subsequent life stress that were explored by some studies were also discussed. We conducted a literature search in major scientific databases, using keywords such as: mental health, social determinants, disasters, wildfires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and resilience. We discuss the implications for public health policy and practice.

AB  - Background: Altering components of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures to better suit the purposes of individual studies is a common and oftentimes necessary step. Though the inherent flexibility in EMA has its benefits, no resource exists to provide an overview of the variability in how convergent constructs and symptoms have been assessed in the past. The present study fills that gap by examining EMA measurement design for mood and anxiety symptomatology.
   Methods: Various search engines were used to identify 234 relevant studies. Items administered, data collection schedules (i.e., beeps per day), response scales (i.e., Likert), data collection platforms (i.e., apps), and psychometric properties (i.e., reliability) were extracted.
   Results: Study designs varied greatly in all aspects across the identified papers. Over 4,600 extracted items were qualitatively analyzed, resulting in the identification of 12 themes. The most EMA items focused on affect, with categories such as "happiness" and "tension" appearing most frequently. We provide all of our data extraction in the format of an open-source database.
   Limitations: Despite our best attempts to include as much of the relevant literature as possible, this review and the accompanying database are not exhaustive, but can easily be built upon to include other, newer studies.
   Conclusions: The fact that the affect theme featured both positive and negative emotional constructs highlights the dichotomous focus on valence and affect within the literature surrounding anxious and depressive symptomatology. We hope that our database will act as a helpful design decision-making resource for researchers studying this kind of symptomatology in the future.

   Design/methodology/approach
   The literature related to suicide among students were identified through various electronic database searches. The databases searched included: PsycINFO, PubMed, MEDLINE, ERIC/ProQuest, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar and PMC using the following search terms and their derivatives: suicide/self-harm, suicide risk and students, mental health issues and suicide, substance use and suicide, childhood adversities and suicide, recent life stressors, help-seeking attitude and elevated suicidal risk, help-seeking behavior and suicide and subjective factors and suicide.
   Findings
   Suicide is an important public health problem. Several factors influence suicide (including suicidal ideation and taking life or dying by suicide) such as genetics, family functions, socioeconomic status, personality and psychiatric comorbidity. The main themes that were investigated included: mental health issues, childhood adversity and recent life stressors, barriers toward seeking professional help and subjective factors (psychache risk of suicidal behavior, impulsivity, aggression).
   Originality/value
   This review focuses on several modifiable psychological factors that have been shown to contribute toward suicidal ideation in youth, especially among university students.

AB  - Modern research has proven that the "typical patient" requiring standardized treatments does not exist, reflecting the need for more personalized approaches for managing individual clinical profiles rather than broad diagnoses. In this regard, precision psychiatry has emerged focusing on enhancing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders through identifying clinical subgroups, suggesting personalized evidence-based interventions, assessing the effectiveness of different interventions, and identifying risk and protective factors for remission, relapse, and vulnerability. Literature shows that recent advances in the field of precision psychiatry are rapidly becoming more data-driven reflecting both the significance and the continuous need for translational research in mental health. Different etiologies underlying depression have been theorized and some factors have been identified including neural circuitry, biotypes, biopsychosocial markers, genetics, and metabolomics which have shown to explain individual differences in pathology and response to treatment. Although the precision approach may prove to enhance diagnosis and treatment decisions, major challenges are hindering its clinical translation. These include the clinical diversity of psychiatric disorders, the technical complexity and costs of multiomics data, and the need for specialized training in precision health for healthcare staff, besides ethical concerns such as protecting the privacy and security of patients' data and maintaining health equity. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent findings in the conceptualization and treatment of depression from a precision mental health perspective and to discuss potential challenges and future directions in the application of precision psychiatry for the treatment of depression.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying infection control measures introduced significant disruptions to the routines of many higher education students around the world. It also deprived them of in-person counselling services and social support. These changes have put students at a greater risk of developing mental illness. The objective of this review is to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances in higher education students during the pandemic. A systematic search of English and Chinese databases was conducted current to January 1st, 2021. The quality of included studies was evaluated using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Eighty-nine studies (n=1,441,828) were included. The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep disturbances was 34%, 32% and 33%, respectively. The prevalence values differ based on geographical regions, diagnostic criteria, education level, undergraduate year of study, financial situation, living arrangements and gender. Overall, the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms synthesized in this study was higher compared to pre-pandemic prevalence in similar populations. Evidently, mental health screening and intervention should be a top priority for universities and colleges during the pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 is creating panic among people around the world and is causing a huge public mental health crisis. Large numbers of observational studies focused on the prevalence of psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic were published. It is essential to conduct a meta-analysis of the prevalence of different psychological statuses to insight the psychological reactions of general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Sixty six observational studies about the psychological statuses of people during the COVID-19 were included, searching up to 1 December 2020. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. OpenMeta[Analyst] was used for the data analysis. High prevalence of acute stress and fear symptoms were observed in the early period of the epidemic. Additionally, anxiety and depression symptoms continued at a high prevalence rate during the epidemic. It should alert the lasting mental health problems and the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental disorders.

AB  - Background
   In total numbers, Germany has faced the largest number of refugees and asylum seekers (RAS) in Europe in the past decade. Although a considerable proportion have experienced traumatic and stressful life events, there is no systematic review to date examining the prevalence of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in RAS in Germany.
   Aims
   To calculate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms in the general population of RAS living in Germany after the year 2000 and explore the impact of study- and participant-related characteristics on prevalence estimates.
   Method
   We systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, Academic Search Complete, Science Direct and Web of Science from January 2000 to May 2020 to identify articles reporting prevalence of depressive symptoms and PTSD in RAS in Germany (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020182796).
   Results
   In total, 31 different surveys met inclusion criteria with 20 surveys reporting prevalence estimates of depressive symptoms and 25 surveys symptoms of PTSD. Based on screening tools, the pooled prevalence estimate of PTSD symptoms was 29.9% (95% CI 20.8-38.7%) and of depressive symptoms 39.8% (95% CI 29.8-50.1%). Heterogeneity was large within and between subgroups. In multivariate meta-regressions on depressive symptoms, heterogeneity was largely explained by survey period, length of field period and study quality.
   Conclusions
   Prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms in RAS are notably large. They exceed the prevalence in the general German population. As a result of high heterogeneity, however, pooled prevalence rates should be interpreted with caution.

   This study aimed to quantify the prevalence of the adverse mental health outcomes in medical staff working in the hospital settings during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and explore the relative distribution of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Methods
   PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANFANG DATA, and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals were searched for articles published from January 1, 2019, to April 19, 2020. The prevalence estimates of adverse mental health symptoms in medical staff were pooled using the random-effects model. Results
   A total of 35 articles and data of 25,343 medical staff were used in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence estimates in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic were as follows (ordered from high to low): fear-related symptoms, 67% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 61%-73%); high levels of perceived stress, 56% (95% CI = 32%-79%), anxiety symptoms, 41% (95% CI = 35%-47%); insomnia, 41% (95% CI = 33%-50%); posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, 38% (95% CI = 34%-43%); depressive symptoms, 27% (95% CI = 20%-34%); and somatic symptoms, 16% (95% CI = 3%-36%). The subgroup analysis revealed that the prevalence estimates of fear-related symptoms were consistently high. Conclusions
   Medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic have a high prevalence of adverse mental health symptoms. Data-based strategies are needed to optimize mental health of medical staff and other health care professionals during times of high demand such as the COVID-19 and other epidemics.

AB  - Objective: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify the effect of vitamin C supplementation on mood in both depressed and non-depressed populations.
   Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web of science and Scopus databases was conducted, from inception to 1 March 2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the effect size (as Hedge's g) of vitamin C supplementation on depressive symptoms.
   Results: Finding from 10 trials with 836 participants revealed no significant improvement in mood status in overall analysis (n = 10, Hedge's g = 0.09; 95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.33; P = 0.465). However, subgroup analysis showed beneficial effects of vitamin C supplementation in patients who were not prescribed antidepressants (subclinical depressed) (n = 5, Hedge's g: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.01, P = 0.041; I-2 = 0.00%,).
   Conclusions: Although no significant effect on mood status was observed in overall population, this meta-analysis tentatively suggests that vitamin C may produce mood-elevating effects in patients with subclinical depression. Further research is recommended to reach a firm conclusion. Protocol registration: The study protocol was registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews database (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO, registration no: CRD42018086677).

AB  - Despite a rich theoretical and clinical history, psychodynamic child and adolescent psychotherapy has been slow to engage in the empirical assessment of its effectiveness. This systematic review aims to provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence base for psychodynamic therapy with children and adolescents. Building on two earlier systematic reviews, which covered the period up to 2017, the current study involved two stages: an updated literature search, covering the period between January 2017 and May 2020, and a narrative synthesis of these new studies with those identified in the earlier reviews. The updated search identified 37 papers (28 distinct studies). When combined with papers identified in the earlier systematic reviews, this resulted in a combined total of 123 papers (82 distinct studies). The narrative synthesis of findings indicates that there is evidence of effectiveness for psychodynamic therapy in treating a wide range of mental health difficulties in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests this approach may be especially effective for internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety, as well as in the treatment of emerging personality disorders and in the treatment of children who have experience of adversity. Both the quality and quantity of empirical papers in this field has increased over time. However, much of the research demonstrates a range of methodological limitations (small sample sizes, lack of control groups etc.), and only 22 studies were Randomized Controlled Trials. Further high-quality research is needed in order to better understand the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy for children and young people.

KW  - Coronavirus

KW  - POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS
AB  - Background: The current COVID pandemic is happening while the long-term effects of coronavirus infection remain poorly understood. The present article meta-analyzed mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, etc.) from a previous coronavirus outbreak in China (2002).
   Method: CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, and Google Scholar were searched up to early June 2020 for articles in English or Chinese reporting mental illness symptoms of SARS patients. Main outcome measures include SCL-90, SAS, SDS, and IES-R scales. 29 papers met the inclusion criteria. The longest follow-up time included in the analysis was 46 months.
   Findings: The systematic meta-analysis indicated that mental health problems were most serious before or at hospital discharge and declined significantly during the first 12 months after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, average symptom levels remained above healthy norms even at 12 months and continued to improve, albeit slowly, thereafter.
   Interpretation: The adverse mental health impact of being hospitalized with coronavirus infection long outlasts the physical illness. Mental health issues were the most serious for coronavirus infected patients before (including) hospital discharge and improved continuously during the first 12 months after hospital discharge. If COVID-19 infected patients follow a similar course of mental health development, most patients should recover to normal after 12 months of hospital discharge.

AB  - Background:
   During the Great Recession of 2008 many of the European and other western economies had been affected with the unemployment rising and income shrinking. Daily lives of a country's citizens always are affected by an economic downturn in various ways and mental health problems are expected to be worsen.
   Aim:
   The aim of this systematic review is to identify to what extent the economic crisis of the last decade has influenced mental health issues in daily life, by offering an in-depth analysis of such effect.
   Methods:
   PRISMA guidelines were followed and PubMed platform was used for the literature research. There were included articles that were published between 2009 and 2019. The search terms used were economic crisis and mental health. An extraction sheet was created to collect the results.
   Results:
   Thirty-five studies from several countries were included in this review. The results from this articles point out that specific social groups are more vulnerable during periods of economic crisis in terms of mental health impact. Depression, anxiety and stress are some of the most common outcomes. However, not all the evidence sources agree.
   Conclusions:
   Despite the disagreements, the economic downturn and its outcomes can effect negatively the psychological state either of the population as a whole or of specific subgroups. Mental health is largely affected by economy and regulatory adjustments of supportive care services are needed to buffer negative effects. Primary care could be a 'remote access server' of specific interventions designed to target vulnerable population groups. The development of strategies at a country level is essential in order to support the most vulnerable groups of the population during a recession period.

AB  - Mindfulness is a psychological technique based on Eastern meditative practices that was developed in the late 1970s by Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts. Initially, there was a debate over whether it should be considered a scientific technique or labelled as part of the "new wave" practices. Today, mindfulness is omnipresent in modern societies but has suffered from merchandising and banalization, which has been strongly criticized. Despite some limitations regarding methodological aspects of mindfulness research, it is considered effective for treating many physical and psychological disorders, and even it is recommended in clinical guidelines such the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. During the last 2500 years, mindfulness practices have moved from Northern India across most of Asia, but their mixing with Western science and culture at the end of the 20(th) century is considered a key event in recent history. For the first time in human history, due to globalization, the wisdom of all contemplative traditions can be shared with all human beings and assessed by science. Mindfulness practices, yoga included, are giving birth to a new field of knowledge, contemplative sciences, which go beyond mindfulness and is devoted to helping humanity to reach higher levels of happiness and mental peace.

AB  - The role of personality as distal risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behavior is still unclear. This review aims to propose two conceptual models that explain the psychological plausibility of Type D personality as distal risk factor and contributor to the transition from general to suicide distress. To support this aim, we performed a systematic review of existing studies on the association between Type D personality and suicidal distress. A systematic search yielded eight studies that reported on Type D personality and suicidal distress. Type D personality was robustly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, across populations and countries. Type D was related to the level/frequency of suicidal ideation in seven studies, and suicide attempt in two studies. Our first theoretical model identifies intra-psychic (depression, alcohol misuse, posttraumatic stress) and interpersonal (low belonging, social isolation, lack of support) vulnerabilities of individuals with Type D that may fuel the development of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Type D by itself will not account for why people become suicidal, but our second theoretical model suggests that the avoidant-passive tendencies of Type D individuals may result in persistent problem-solving deficits, and, eventually, feelings of entrapment that may contribute to the desire to escape from pain. We conclude that empirical evidence supports the hypothesized link between Type D personality, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Our conceptual models - albeit often supported by indirect evidence - further substantiate the plausibility of this link, and offer concrete guidance for future studies. Primarily, more longitudinal research is necessary.

KW  - athletes
KW  - psychosocial
KW  - occupational stress
KW  - primary health care
AB  - Background: The ongoing global pandemic has become the world's leading health problem, causing massive public fear and concern. Reports suggest that athletes are seeking mental health support, showing the pressures of boredom, and tension associated with their anticipated social isolation. The current study seeks to evaluate the evidence regarding the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on occupational stress in professional athletes.
   Method: A scoping review was conducted. A comprehensive search involving Embase and PubMed databases was conducted using a combination of the following key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, and athletes. In this study, articles were retained if they were original studies reporting on the impact of the pandemic on professional athletes.
   Results: Nine studies were identified as they investigated the impact of the pandemic on athletes. Most were observational and cross-sectional, and one was longitudinal. Outcome measures mainly investigated were level of depression, anxiety, and stress. Dependent variables were physical activity, nutrition, mental state, sleep quality, individual well-being, social identity, exclusivity, negative affectivity, alcohol consumption, psychological distress, and gambling habits.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the need for proactive engagement with professional athletes, coaches, trainers, and sports councils to facilitate understanding and awareness-raising, process optimization, and delivery of consistent training and psychosocial aid and occupational therapy programs that maintain the health and well-being of athletes while minimizing occupational stress during a pandemic.

AB  - Background: Temperament involves individual variations in behavioural tendencies of emotional responses and reactions to stimuli after birth. Because 'foetal programming' is a strong hypothesis in developing temperament, prenatal and intrapartum factors may be significant determinants of infant temperament. This systematic literature review aims to elucidate the evidence of prenatal and intrapartum predictors, including genetic, biological, environmental, socio-demographic, psychological, and obstetric factors of parents and their child.
   Methods: Relevant articles were searched using MEDLINE, PubMed, and SCOPUS. The inclusion criteria were (a) original research article, (b) written in English, (c) assessed the temperament of infants 12 months old or younger as an outcome variable, and (d) investigated prenatal and intrapartum factorial variables of infant temperament. Following the PRISMA guideline, the articles found in the three databases were screened and selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria before the final review.
   Results: Finally, 35 articles were reviewed. This systematic review identified a variety of prenatal and intrapartum factors that were significantly associated with infant temperament: (1) genetic and biological factors: certain genotypes, maternal cortisol and ACTH, and CRHs, (2) environmental factors: substance use such as tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs, (3) socio-demographic factor: lower-income, (4) psychological factors: depression or anxiety, eating disorders, personality types of mothers, and domestic violence, and (5) obstetric factors: foetal growth (birth weight), hypertension in mothers, nausea (emesis), and preterm birth.
   Conclusion: The findings support gene-environment interaction and biological mechanisms for developing infant temperament, suggesting the importance of ensuring a safe and comfortable environment for pregnant mothers, unborn infants, and families during pregnancy and delivery.

AB  - BackgroundThe aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to examine the prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes, both short-term and long-term, among SARS patients, healthcare workers and the general public of SARS-affected regions, and to examine the protective and risk factors associated with these mental health outcomes.MethodsWe conducted a systematic search of the literature using databases such as Medline, Pubmed, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science Core Collection, CNKI, the National Central Library Online Catalog and dissertation databases to identify studies in the English or Chinese language published between January 2003 to May 2020 which reported psychological distress and mental health morbidities among SARS patients, healthcare workers, and the general public in regions with major SARS outbreaks.ResultsThe literature search yielded 6984 titles. Screening resulted in 80 papers for the review, 35 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of post-recovery probable or clinician-diagnosed anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among SARS survivors were 19, 20 and 28%, respectively. The prevalence of these outcomes among studies conducted within and beyond 6months post-discharge was not significantly different. Certain aspects of mental health-related quality of life measures among SARS survivors remained impaired beyond 6months post-discharge. The prevalence of probable depressive disorder and PTSD among healthcare workers post-SARS were 12 and 11%, respectively. The general public had increased anxiety levels during SARS, but whether there was a clinically significant population-wide mental health impact remained inconclusive. Narrative synthesis revealed occupational exposure to SARS patients and perceived stigmatisation to be risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers, although causality could not be determined due to the limitations of the studies.ConclusionsThe chronicity of psychiatric morbidities among SARS survivors should alert us to the potential long-term mental health complications of covid-19 patients. Healthcare workers working in high-risk venues should be given adequate mental health support. Stigmatisation against patients and healthcare workers should be explored and addressed. The significant risk of bias and high degree of heterogeneity among included studies limited the certainty of the body of evidence of the review.

AB  - Background: Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRVB) is a treatment in which patients learn self-regulation of a physiological dysregulated vagal nerve function. While the therapeutic approach of HRVB is promising for a variety of disorders, it has not yet been regularly offered in a mental health treatment setting. Aim: To provide a systematic review about the efficacy of HRV-Biofeedback in treatment of anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders. Method: Systematic review in PubMed and Web of Science in 2020 with terms HRV, biofeedback, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, panic disorder, and anxiety disorder. Selection, critical appraisal, and description of the Random Controlled Trials (RCT) studies. Combined with recent meta-analyses. Results: The search resulted in a total of 881 studies. After critical appraisal, nine RCTs have been selected as well as two other relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups treatment as usual, muscle relaxation training and a "placebo"-biofeedback instrument revealed significant clinical efficacy and better results compared with control conditions, mostly significant. In the depression studies average reduction at the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale was 64% (HRVB plus Treatment as Usual (TAU) versus 25% (control group with TAU) and 30% reduction (HRVB) at the PSQ scale versus 7% (control group with TAU). In the PTSD studies average reduction at the BDI-scale was 53% (HRV plus TAU) versus 24% (control group with TAU) and 22% (HRVB) versus 10% (TAU) with the PTSD Checklist (PCL). In other systematic reviews significant effects have been shown for HRV-Biofeedback in treatment of asthma, coronary artery disease, sleeping disorders, postpartum depression and stress and anxiety. Conclusion: This systematic review shows significant improvement of the non-invasive HRVB training in stress related disorders like PTSD, depression, and panic disorder, in particular when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy or different TAU. Effects were visible after four weeks of training, but clinical practice in a longer daily self-treatment of eight weeks is more promising. More research to integrate HRVB in treatment of stress related disorders in psychiatry is warranted, as well as research focused on the neurophysiological mechanisms.

AB  - Mental and substance use disorders have been identified as the leading cause of global disability, and the global burden of mental illness is concentrated among those experiencing disability due to serious mental illness (SMI). Music has been studied as a support for SMIs for decades, with promising results; however, a lack of synthesized evidence has precluded increased uptake of and access to music-based approaches. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify the types and quantity of research at intersections of music and SMIs, document evidentiary gaps and opportunities, and generate recommendations for improving research and practice. Studies were included if they reported on music's utilization in treating or mitigating symptoms related to five SMIs: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Eight databases were searched; screening resulted in 349 included studies for data extraction. Schizophrenia was the most studied SMI, with bipolar disorder studied the least. Demographics, settings, and activity details were found to be inconsistently and insufficiently reported; however, listening to recorded music emerged as the most common musical activity, and activity details appeared to have been affected by the conditions under study. RCTs were the predominant study design, and 271 unique measures were utilized across 289 primary studies. Over two-thirds of primary studies (68.5%) reported positive results, with 2.8% reporting worse results than the comparator, and 12% producing indeterminate results. A key finding is that evidence synthesis is precluded by insufficient reporting, widely varied outcomes and measures, and intervention complexity; as a result, widespread changes are necessary to reduce heterogeneity (as feasible), increase replicability and transferability, and improve understandings of mechanisms and causal pathways. To that end, five detailed recommendations are offered to support the sharing and development of information across disciplines.

AB  - Background: Mental health is an important public health issue globally. A potential link between heat exposure and mental health outcomes has been recognised in the scientific literature; however, the associations between heat exposure (both high ambient temperatures and heatwaves) and mental health-related mortality and morbidity vary between studies and locations. Objective: To fill gaps in knowledge, this systematic review aims to summarize the epidemiological evidence and investigate the quantitative effects of high ambient temperatures and heatwaves on mental health-related mortality and morbidity outcomes, while exploring sources of heterogeneity. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on heat exposure and mental health outcomes published between January 1990 and November 2020 was conducted using five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO). We included studies that examined the association between high ambient temperatures and/or heatwaves and mental health-related mortality and morbidity (e.g. hospital admissions and emergency department visits) in the general population. A range of mental health conditions were defined using ICD-10 classifications. We performed random effects meta-analysis to summarize the relative risks (RRs) in mental health outcomes per 1 degrees C increase in temperature, and under different heatwaves definitions. We further evaluated whether variables such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, and climate zone may explain the observed heterogeneity. Results: The keyword search yielded 4560 citations from which we identified 53 high temperatures/heatwaves studies that comprised over 1.7 million mental health-related mortality and 1.9 million morbidity cases in total. Our findings suggest associations between heat exposures and a range of mental health-related outcomes. Regarding high temperatures, our meta-analysis of study findings showed that for each 1 degrees C increase in temperature, the mental health-related mortality and morbidity increased with a RR of 1.022 (95%CI: 1.015-1.029) and 1.009 (95%CI: 1.007-1.015), respectively. The greatest mortality risk was attributed to substance-related mental disorders (RR, 1.046; 95%CI: 0.991-1.101), followed by organic mental disorders (RR, 1.033; 95%CI: 1.020-1.046). A 1 degrees C temperature rise was also associated with a significant increase in morbidity such as mood disorders, organic mental disorders, schizophrenia, neurotic and anxiety disorders. Findings suggest evidence of vulnerability for populations living in tropical and subtropical climate zones, and for people aged more than 65 years. There were significant moderate and high heterogeneities between effect estimates in overall mortality and morbidity categories, respectively. Lower heterogeneity was noted in some subgroups. The magnitude of the effect estimates for heatwaves varied depending on definitions used. The highest effect estimates for mental health-related morbidity was observed when heatwaves were defined as "mean temperature >90th percentile for >3 days" (RR, 1.753; 95%CI: 0.567-5.421), and a significant effect was also observed when the definition was "mean temperature >95th percentile for >3 days", with a RR of 1.064 (95%CI: 1.006-1.123).

AB  - There is increasing knowledge regarding the role of the microbiome in modulating the brain and behaviour. Indeed, the actions of microbial metabolites are key for appropriate gut-brain communication in humans. Among these metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan, and bile acid metabolites/pathways show strong preclinical evidence for involvement in various aspects of brain function and behaviour. With the identification of neuroactive gut-brain modules, new predictive tools can be applied to existing datasets. We identified 278 studies relating to the human microbiota-gut-brain axis which included sequencing data. This spanned across psychiatric and neurological disorders with a small number also focused on normal behavioural development. With a consistent bioinformatics pipeline, thirty-five of these datasets were reanalysed from publicly available raw sequencing files and the remainder summarised and collated. Among the reanalysed studies, we uncovered evidence of disease-related alterations in microbial metabolic pathways in Alzheimer?s Disease, schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. Amongst studies that could not be reanalysed, many sequencing and technical limitations hindered the discovery of specific biomarkers of microbes or metabolites conserved across studies. Future studies are warranted to confirm our findings. We also propose guidelines for future human microbiome analysis to increase reproducibility and consistency within the field.

AB  - BackgroundMental burden due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been widely reported for the general public and specific risk groups like healthcare workers and different patient populations. We aimed to assess its impact on mental health during the early phase by comparing pandemic with prepandemic data and to identify potential risk and protective factors.MethodsFor this systematic review and meta-analyses, we systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020, and screened reference lists of included studies. In addition, we searched PubMed and PsycINFO for prepandemic comparative data. Survey studies assessing mental burden by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the general population, healthcare workers, or any patients (eg, COVID-19 patients), with a broad range of eligible mental health outcomes, and matching studies evaluating prepandemic comparative data in the same population (if available) were included. We used multilevel meta-analyses for main, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses, focusing on (perceived) stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sleep-related symptoms as primary outcomes.ResultsOf 2429 records retrieved, 104 were included in the review (n=208,261 participants), 43 in the meta-analysis (n=71,613 participants). While symptoms of anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.40; 95% CI 0.15-0.65) and depression (SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.07-1.27) were increased in the general population during the early phase of the pandemic compared with prepandemic conditions, mental burden was not increased in patients as well as healthcare workers, irrespective of COVID-19 patient contact. Specific outcome measures (eg, Patient Health Questionnaire) and older comparative data (published >= 5years ago) were associated with increased mental burden. Across the three population groups, existing mental disorders, female sex, and concerns about getting infected were repeatedly reported as risk factors, while older age, a good economic situation, and education were protective.ConclusionsThis meta-analysis paints a more differentiated picture of the mental health consequences in pandemic situations than previous reviews. High-quality, representative surveys, high granular longitudinal studies, and more research on protective factors are required to better understand the psychological impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to help design effective preventive measures and interventions that are tailored to the needs of specific population groups.

AB  - Objective: To systematically analyze the effects of art therapy on the levels of depression, anxiety, blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin in diabetic patients.
   Methods: We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to January 24, 2021. The language of publication was limited to English. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that used art therapy to improve mental disorders in diabetic patients were involved. After selection of eligible studies, data were extracted, including the first author's full-name, year of publication, the first author's country of residence, number of intervention and control groups, the mean age of participants, method of intervention, duration of follow-up, and outcome measures. Assessment of quality of the included studies and data extraction were independently carried out by two researchers. RevMan 5.3 software was used to perform statistical analysis.
   Results: A total of 396 samples from five studies were included, and the eligible studies were RCTs with a parallel design. Methods of art therapy included music therapy and painting therapy. The results showed that compared with the control group, art therapy could positively affect the levels of depression [standardized mean difference (SMD), -1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), (-1.63, -1.09); P < 0.00001] and blood glucose in diabetic patients [mean difference (MD), -0.90; 95% CI, (-1.03, -0.77); P < 0.0001], while it had no influence on the levels of anxiety [SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, (-0.93, 0.31); P = 0.32] and glycated hemoglobin [MD, 0.22; 95% CI, (-0.02, 0.46); P = 0.07].
   Conclusion: Art therapy may have significant effects on the levels of depression and blood glucose for diabetic patients.

AB  - BackgroundThe 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic syndrome that results in a highly variable profile of affected individuals of which impairments in the social domain and increased psychopathology are the most prominent. Notably, 25-30% of affected individuals eventually develop schizophrenia/psychosis, predisposing persons with the syndrome to increased risk for this disorder. Because social cognition is considered to underlie social behavior and to be related to psychopathology, this systematic review investigated social cognition in individuals with 22q11DS and examined reported links across its domains with psychopathology and social outcomes. This can provide the basis for a closer understanding of the path from risk to disorder and will inform on the specific domains that can be targeted with preventive intervention strategies.MethodSystematic literature review of studies that reported the links between social cognitive domains and psychopathology and/or social outcomes in individuals with 22q11DS. Electronic databases searched were PubMed and PsycINFO.ResultsDefined eligibility criteria identified a total of ten studies to be included in the present review. Selected studies investigated links between two domains of social cognition (emotion processing and theory of mind (ToM)) and psychopathology and/or social outcomes. With respect to the links to psychopathology, two aspects of social cognition were related primarily to negative symptoms. Results regarding the associations to positive and emotional symptoms (anxiety/depression) are limited and require further investigation. Even though both aspects of social cognition were associated with social outcomes, several studies also found no links between these two domains. Both reports invite for an additional examination of reported results and specific considerations regarding chosen constructs.ConclusionAlthough equivocal, results of the present review provide sufficient evidence that social cognition is a useful domain for the closer elucidation of clinical outcomes and social difficulties in this population. At the same time, longitudinal studies and consideration of other variables are also necessary for a timely understanding of affected persons in this respect.

AB  - This study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that analyzed the efficacy of psychological interventions for parents of children with cancer. The search was conducted in the databases Psycinfo, Medline, PsycArticles, and PsycTests. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Two independent researchers extracted relevant data, and the studies were assessed for methodological quality. The standardized mean difference (d) was used as the effect size index. The meta-analyses, which applied random and mixed-effects models, showed that weighted effect sizes were statistically significant for depression at posttreatment (d= 1.19). However, the methodological quality moderated the depression estimate. The weighted effect sizes for the remaining variables were not statistically significant: stress/burnout (d= 0.90), quality of life (d= 1.26), anxiety (d= 0.21), posttraumatic stress (d= 0.05), and general indicator of emotional symptoms (d= 0.33). This review also highlights several methodological limitations of the studies. Future directions for research that examines interventions targeting primary caregivers of children with cancer are discussed. In conclusion, more high-quality research is needed to establish the efficacy of psychological interventions for parents of children with cancer.

The review was performed using systematic literature searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and COVID-19-specific databases, including the CDC COVID-19 Research Database, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Database on COVID-19 Research and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register and the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) up to 25th September 2020. The search yielded 6657 unique citations. After title/abstract and full text screening, 11 study protocols reporting on trials planned in China, the US, Canada, the UK, and Hungary during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Four interventions targeted children >= 10 years directly, seven system-based interventions targeted the parents and caregivers of younger children and adolescents. Outcome measures encompassed mainly anxiety and depressive symptoms, different dimensions of stress or psychosocial well-being, and quality of supportive relationships. In conclusion, this systematic review revealed a paucity of studies on psychosocial interventions for children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should be encouraged in light of the expected demand for child mental health management.

KW  - transnational mother
KW  - immigration
KW  - mental health
KW  - emotional distress
KW  - depressive symptoms
KW  - maternal depression
AB  - Background: Female led migration is a recent trend that has been gaining momentum, particularly in Latin America. However, little attention has been given to the psychological consequences of mothers who leave their children in their country of origin and migrate to a host country to work. Therefore, it is important to investigate the mental health status of transnational mothers and to further identify issues for intervention and supportive services.
   Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, CENTRAL, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases were searched systematically for peer-reviewed articles published from inception through July 2019. The search included the following terms: migrant, immigrant, transnational, transnational mother, AND mood disorders, depressive symptoms, and depression. Initially, 8,375 studies were identified. After exclusionary criteria were applied, 17 studies were identified and included in the review.
   Results: We found six quantitative studies that investigated depressive symptoms among transnational mothers. Of these studies, three found a positive association between transnational motherhood and depressive symptoms; three of these articles found a null correlation. A total of eight qualitative studies and three mixed-methods studies were found that addressed depressive symptoms and emotional distress among transnational mothers. The eight qualitative studies identified highlighted the significant emotional distress transnational mothers experience. Lastly, the three mixed-methods studies similarly discussed the emotional hardships faced by transnational mothers.
   Implications: The studies identified suggest that depressive symptoms and emotional distress are prevalent among transnational mothers. Therefore, public health social workers and other mental health providers need to focus on developing strategies to identify and screen transnational mothers for depressive symptoms.

AB  - Background: Cannabis is known to have a broad range of effects on behavior, including experiencing a "high" and tranquility/relaxation. However, there are several adverse behavioral sequalae that can arise from cannabis use, depending on frequency of use, potency (e.g., THC content), age of onset, and cumulative exposure. This systematic review examined evidence for cannabis-related adverse behavioral sequalae in otherwise healthy human subjects.
   Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies from 1990 to 2020 that identified cannabis-related adverse behavioral outcomes in subjects without psychiatric and medical co-morbidities from PubMed and PsychInfo searches. Key search terms included "cannabis" OR "tetrahydrocannabinol" OR "cannabidiol" OR "marijuana" AND "anxiety" OR "depression" OR "psychosis" OR "schizophrenia" "OR "IQ" OR "memory" OR "attention" OR "impulsivity" OR "cognition" OR "education" OR "occupation".
   Results: Our search detected a total of 2,870 studies, from which we extracted 124 relevant studies from the literature on cannabis effects in the non-clinical population. Effects of cannabis on several behavioral sequelae including cognition, motivation, impulsivity, mood, anxiety, psychosis intelligence, and psychosocial functioning were identified. The preponderance of the evidence suggests that frequency of cannabis use, THC (but not CBD) content, age of onset, and cumulative cannabis exposure can all contribute to these adverse outcomes in individuals without a pre-existing medical condition or psychiatric disorder. The strongest evidence for the negative effects of cannabis are for psychosis and psychosocial functioning.
   Conclusions: Although more research is needed to determine risk factors for development of adverse behavioral sequelae of cannabis use, these findings underline the importance of understanding vulnerability to the adverse effects of cannabis, which has implications for prevention and treatment of problematic cannabis use.

KW  - Mental health
KW  - Psychological therapy
AB  - Global conflict in 2019 created record numbers of displaced children. These children have experienced multiple traumas and subsequently suffer high levels of mental health symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is commonly used for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety, however the current evidence-base of CBT in child refugees is sparse, with mixed results. This study aimed to assess the effects of CBT on symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety in child refugees/AS. Ethics were reviewed and granted by the University of Manchester ethics committee. Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PsycINFO and CINAHL were systematically searched. Studies were included if CBT was delivered to refugee/AS children with pre and post-intervention measures of symptoms. Sixteen studies fulfilled criteria. In all studies, mental health symptom scores post-intervention had reduced, suggesting an improvement in mental health following CBT. This reduction was statistically significant in twelve studies (p < 0.001-0.5), clinically significant in eight studies and maintained at follow-up periods. No adverse effects of CBT were identified. This is the first systematic review to focus solely on CBT in child refugee populations, with unanimously positive results. Its use is cautiously recommended, however the need for more methodologically rigorous studies in this population is highlighted.

AB  - Circadian disruptions, along with altered affective and reward states, are commonly associated with psychiatric disorders. In addition to genetics, the enduring influence of environmental factors in programming neural networks is of increased interest in assessing the underpinnings of mental health. The duration of daylight or photoperiod is known to impact both the serotonin and dopamine systems, which are implicated in mood and reward-based disorders. This review first examines the effects of circadian disruption and photoperiod in the serotonin system in both human and preclinical studies. We next highlight how brain regions crucial for the serotoninergic system (i.e., dorsal raphe nucleus; DRN), and dopaminergic (i.e., nucleus accumbens; NAc and ventral tegmental area; VTA) system are intertwined in overlapping circuitry, and play influential roles in the pathology of mood and reward-based disorders. We then focus on human and animal studies that demonstrate the impact of circadian factors on the dopaminergic system. Lastly, we discuss how environmental factors such as circadian photoperiod can impact the neural circuits that are responsible for regulating affective and reward states, offering novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology, systems, and therapeutic treatments necessary for mood and reward-based disorders.

AB  - Vulnerability markers for onset of anxiety disorders are scarce. In depression, patients at risk tend to respond with a negative mood to 'acute tryptophan depletion' (ATD), while healthy volunteers and current patients do not. The serotonergic system thus provides indications for vulnerability for depression. It is unknown whether ATD reveals vulnerability in anxiety too. This study systematically reviews the effects of ATD on anxiety and assesses whether challenging anxiety modifies the response. PubMed, Embase and PsychInfo were systematically searched up to April 2019 for studies in which (1) healthy volunteers or patients with a (remitted) anxiety disorder underwent ATD and (2) levels of anxiety were reported. In total, 21 studies were included. Studies conducted in healthy volunteers (n=13), and patients with a remitted (n=6) or current (panic, social or generalised) anxiety disorder (n=4). Studies were mostly of poor quality and heterogeneous regarding population, challenge test used and outcome measures. ATD did not consistently affect anxiety in any of the groups. Moreover, a challenge test after ATD (n=17 studies) did not consistently provoke anxiety in healthy volunteers or remitted patients. A 35% CO2 challenge did consistently increase anxiety in patients with a current panic disorder (PD). To conclude, this systematic review found no clear indications that ATD provokes anxiety in those at risk for anxiety disorders. Hence, unlike in depression, ATD does not indicate vulnerability to develop an anxiety disorder. Because included studies were heterogeneous and mostly of poor quality, there is an urgent need for high quality research in homogeneous samples.

AB  - BackgroundPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians experienced unprecedented levels of burnout. The uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic along with increased workload and difficult medical triage decisions may lead to a further decline in physician psychological health.MethodsWe searched Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for primary research from database inception (Medline [1946], EMBASE [1974], PsycINFO [1806]) to November 17, 2020. Titles and abstracts were screened by one of three reviewers and full-text article screening and data abstraction were conducted independently, and in duplicate, by three reviewers.ResultsFrom 6223 unique citations, 480 articles were reviewed in full-text, with 193 studies (of 90,499 physicians) included in the final review. Studies reported on physician psychological symptoms and management during seven infectious disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], three strains of Influenza A virus [H1N1, H5N1, H7N9], Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], and COVID-19) in 57 countries. Psychological symptoms of anxiety (14.3-92.3%), stress (11.9-93.7%), depression (17-80.5%), post-traumatic stress disorder (13.2-75.2%) and burnout (14.7-76%) were commonly reported among physicians, regardless of infectious disease outbreak or country. Younger, female (vs. male), single (vs. married), early career physicians, and those providing direct care to infected patients were associated with worse psychological symptoms.InterpretationPhysicians should be aware that psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, fear and distress are common, manifest differently and self-management strategies to improve psychological well-being exist. Health systems should implement short and long-term psychological supports for physicians caring for patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Background and objective: Emotional and cognitive impairments are common comorbidities of chronic neuropathic pain that significantly impact the quality of life of patients. While the nociceptive components of the peripheral nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) animal model have been extensively analyzed, data related to the development of mood and cognitive disorders, and especially its impact on female rats remains fragmented. We systematically reviewed the literature analyzing the methods used to induce and evaluate the development of emotional- and cognitive-like impairments and sex-specific differences in the CCI model.
   Databases and data treatment: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science from inception to September 30th, 2019, and a total of 44 papers were considered eligible for inclusion. We included animal studies assessing nociception, locomotion, anxious-like, depressive-like and cognitive behaviours after the CCI induction.
   Results: The overall quality of the studies was considered moderate to high. Overall, the induction of CCI leads to the development of emotional impairments, namely anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours, as well as cognitive impairments. With the majority of the studies using male subjects, the lack of evidence on female animals prevents the evaluation of sex-specific differences.
   Conclusions: This review supports the development of an anxiodepressive-like phenotype, associated with cognitive impairments, in CCI-induced animals. These results support the use of this animal model for the study of the mechanisms underlying these comorbidities, as well as a screening tool for the development/repurposing of drugs that tackle both the neuropathy-induced nociceptive and emotional impairments, such as tricyclic antidepressants. Importantly, our review also highlights the need for studies performed in female rodents as these are almost non-existent.

KW  - National Rivers and Streams Assessment
AB  - Multimetric index (MMI) approach is a broadly used in ecological assessment because it can integrate information of various kinds of ecologically related metrics of freshwater ecosystems and provide an easily understandable score for purpose of further evaluation and managements. Accounting for natural variation and disentangling covariation between natural environmental factors and human disturbance factors are imperative for an accurate assessment. Lots of progress has been made recently on the aforementioned two aspects. Three approaches, a priori classification of sites by regions or typologies, site-specific modeling of expected reference condition and vary ingmetrics in site groups, have been tested in lakes and streams to improve assessment accuracy. All existed studies support that site-specific modeling can efficiently account for natural variation and generate a MMI with good performance. However, until now, no strong evidence has shown that diatom/blue-algae typologies are better than regionalization frameworks on accounting for natural variation either in lakes or in streams. To separate the natural variation explained by site specific modeling from that of varying metrics is necessary for a thorough and accurate evaluation on the valuableness of site-grouping by typologies. Different performance of varying metrics among site groups of streams and lakes was most probably caused by the lack of representativeness of diatom metrics on biological condition rather than the complex multi-stressor gradients in streams and rivers. A recent study showed that blue-green algae enhanced performance of diatom-based MMI on defining lake condition under high level of human disturbance. On the other hand, with more and more extensive and intensive use of statistics techniques in developing MMI, we also discussed some statistical challenges faced by scientists in field of ecological assessment, especially on setting significance level of a statistical test and multiple comparison issue in MMI performance comparison.

AB  - Background: The new coronavirus disease's (COVID-19) high risk of infection can increase the workload of healthcare workers, especially nurses, as they are most of the healthcare workforce. These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I2) statistics.
   Results: A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37-49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32-41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31-39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36-50).
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions. Further longitudinal study is needed to distinguish of psychological symptoms during and after the infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - In light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and potential future infectious disease outbreaks, a comprehensive understanding of the negative effects of epidemics and pandemics on healthcare workers' mental health could inform appropriate support interventions. Thus, we aimed to synthesize and quantify the psychological and psychosomatic symptoms among frontline medical staff. We searched four databases up to March 19, 2020 and additional literature, with daily search alerts set up until October 26, 2020. Studies reporting psychological and/or psychosomatic symptoms of healthcare workers caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently conducted the search, study selection, quality appraisal, data extraction, and synthesis and involved a third reviewer in case of disagreement. We used random effects modeling to estimate the overall prevalence rates of psychological/psychosomatic symptoms and the I-2 statistic. We included 86 studies, reporting data from 75,991 participants. Frontline staff showed a wide range of symptoms, including concern about transmitting the virus to the family (60.39%, 95% CI 42.53-76.96), perceived stress (56.77%, 95% CI 34.21-77.95), concerns about own health (45.97%, 95% CI 31.08-61.23), sleeping difficulties (39.88%, 95% CI 27.70-52.72), burnout (31.81%, 95% CI 13.32-53.89), symptoms of depression (25.72%, 95% CI 18.34-33.86), symptoms of anxiety (25.36%, 95% CI 17.90-33.64), symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (24.51%, 95% CI 18.16-31.46), mental health issues (23.11%, 95% CI 15.98-31.10), and symptoms of somatization (14.68%, 95% CI 10.67-19.18). We found consistent evidence for the pervasive and profound impact of large-scale outbreaks on the mental health of frontline healthcare workers. As the CO-VID-19 crisis continues to unfold, guaranteeing easy access to support structures for the entire healthcare workforce is vitally important.

AB  - Humanitarian workers are at an elevated risk of occupational trauma exposure and its associated psychological consequences, and experience increased levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to the general population. Psychological first aid (PFA) aims to prevent acute distress reactions from developing into long-term distress by instilling feelings of safety, calmness, self- and community efficacy, connectedness and hope. Group PFA (GPFA) delivers PFA in a group or team setting. This research sought to understand 'What works, for whom, in what context, and why for group psychological first aid for humanitarian workers, including volunteers?' A rapid realist review (RRR) was conducted. Initial theories were generated to answer the question and were subsequently refined based on 15 documents identified through a systematic search of databases and grey literature, in addition to the inputs from a core reference panel and two external experts in GPFA. The findings generated seven programme theories that addressed the research question and offered consideration for the implementation of GPFA for the humanitarian workforce across contexts and age groups. GPFA enables individuals to understand their natural reactions, develop adaptive coping strategies, and build social connections that promote a sense of belonging and security. The integrated design of GPFA ensures that individuals are linked to additional supports and have their basic needs addressed. While the evidence is sparce on GPFA, its ability to provide support to humanitarian workers is promising.

AB  - Objective: Research on HPA axis dysregulation has been associated with vulnerability to, or perseverence of, several mental disorders. Hoever, measurements of cortisol levels in blood, saliva and/or urine have yielded variable results. Nevertheless, cortisol analysis in scalp hair appears to be a consistent tool for measurement of long-term exposure to stress. This article provides a systematic review of studies exploring hair cortisol concentrations in patients with mental disorders in comparison with healthy controls.
   Methods: This review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. The electronic databases of PubMed/Medline, Web of Science and Scopus were searched for relevant articles, using a specific syntax.
   Results: A total of 582 articles were identified, of which 22 were finally included. Patients with depression show a general trend for higher hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) than controls, whereas patients with PTSD tend to demonstrate lower HCC. Very little is known about other mental disorders, including suicidality and drug abuse. The divergence of samples included and the timing of cortisol sampling, seem to play a key role in the discrepancies of the results. Correlations of HCC with self-reported measures of stress were found, at best, inconclusive.
   Conclusions: Further research should attempt to describe specific cortisol profiles for each psychiatric disorder and HCC could contribute in evaluating therapy outcomes and predicting relapses. Obtaining information on HCC in different stages of psychiatric disorders in association with pertinent clinical variables, might help in forging a neuroendocrine model for clinical staging of mental disorders.

AB  - LAY SUMMARY A growing number of smartphone apps are being recommended to help build resilience. It is important to test whether these apps are of good quality and evidence-based. This study systematically evaluated 12 popular resilience-related apps for military and public service personnel and found that the majority were of high quality.
   Introduction: Military members and public safety personnel need targeted mental health interventions that are clinically effective, confidential, easily accessed, and cost effective. Smartphone apps are an emergent method of service delivery that provide an alternative to in-person therapy. However, although apps are increasingly prevalent, app development is unregulated and often lacks health care professional input and a clear evidence base. This study evaluates the quality of mental health apps for resiliency that are specifically targeted to military members and public safety personnel. Methods: After a comprehensive search for relevant apps costing no more than $5.00, a review was conducted, based on the Mobile Application Rating Scale. Results: Eighty-two apps were retrieved, and 12 met the inclusion criteria for evaluation. All evaluated apps were free and had been updated in the past two years. The resilience strategies offered by the majority of apps were diaphragmatic breathing, mindfulness practice, and progressive muscle relaxation. One app had been tested in a randomized controlled trial, seven had been tested with other methods, and four had not been research trialed. All apps except one were ranked as high quality, and the content provided evidence-based strategies for mental health resiliency interventions. Discussion: The apps reviewed are well suited to foster resilience among public safety personnel and military members. They offer evidence-based resiliency interventions and encourage help-seeking behaviors.

AB  - Objective: Health-care workers (HCW) are at risk for psychological distress during an infectious disease outbreak, such as the coronavirus pandemic, due to the demands of dealing with a public health emergency. This rapid systematic review examined the factors associated with psychological distress among HCW during an outbreak.
   Method: We systematically reviewed literature on the factors associated with psychological distress (demographic characteristics, occupational, social, psychological, and infection-related factors) in HCW during an outbreak (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, H1N1, H7N9, and Ebola). Four electronic databases were searched (2000 to 15 November 2020) for relevant peer-reviewed research according to a pre-registered protocol. A narrative synthesis was conducted to identify fixed, modifiable, and infection-related factors linked to distress and psychiatric morbidity.
   Results: From the 4,621 records identified, 138 with data from 143,246 HCW in 139 studies were included. All but two studies were cross-sectional. The majority of the studies were conducted during COVID-19 (k = 107, N = 34,334) and SARS (k = 21, N = 18,096). Consistent evidence indicated that being female, a nurse, experiencing stigma, maladaptive coping, having contact or risk of contact with infected patients, and experiencing quarantine, were risk factors for psychological distress among HCW. Personal and organizational social support, perceiving control, positive work attitudes, sufficient information about the outbreak and proper protection, training, and resources, were associated with less psychological distress.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the key factors to the identify HCW who are most at risk for psychological distress during an outbreak and modifying factors to reduce distress and improve resilience. Recommendations are that HCW at risk for increased distress receive early interventions and ongoing monitoring because there is evidence that HCW distress can persist for up to 3 years after an outbreak. Further research needs to track the associations of risk and resilience factors with distress over time and the extent to which certain factors are inter-related and contribute to sustained or transient distress.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to study the association between specific environmental risk factors (ERF) and later development of Bipolar disorder and Psychotic depression. Methods: A systematic search of prospective studies was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases, and supplemented by hand searching, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (registration number: CRD42018092253). Selected ERF included: pre-lperinatal factors-paternal age at birth, maternal infection, obstetric complications, perinatal stress; early childhood factors-urbanicity at birth, childhood infection, childhood adversity; later life factors-substance misuse, ethnic minority and migration, urbanicity later in life, stressful life events, and traumatic head injury. Pooled effect sizes of the association between these ERF and affective psychoses were calculated from systematically selected studies. When studies examining each ERF were insufficient for meta-analysis, results were presented narratively. Resuits: Forty-six studies were included for quantitative analyses among selected ERF for affective psychosis, with significant association found for paternal age >40 years (OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.12-1.23), early (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.07-2.17) and late (OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.05-1.67) gestational age, childhood adversity (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.18-1.50), substance misuse (OR 2.87, 95%CI 1.63-5.50), and being from an ethnic minority (OR 1.99, 95%CI 1.39-2.84). Conclusions: These results suggest some shared environmental load between non-affective and affective psychosis, implying generalized risks for psychosis rather than for specific diagnostic categories. Nonetheless, published studies for some ERF in the affective psychoses are scarce, and further longitudinal studies are needed.

AB  - Psychiatry remains in a permanent state of crisis, which fragmented psychiatry from the field of medicine. The crisis in psychiatry is evidenced by the many different competing approaches to psychiatric illness including psychodynamic, biological, molecular, pan-omics, precision, cognitive and phenomenological psychiatry, folk psychology, mind-brain dualism, descriptive psychopathology, and postpsychiatry. The current "gold standard" Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders/International Classification of Diseases taxonomies of mood disorders and schizophrenia are unreliable and preclude to employ a deductive reasoning approach. Therefore, it is not surprising that mood disorders and schizophrenia research was unable to revise the conventional classifications and did not provide more adequate therapeutic approaches. The aim of this paper is to explain the new nomothetic network psychiatry (NNP) approach, which uses machine learning methods to build data-driven causal models of mental illness by assembling risk-resilience, adverse outcome pathways (AOP), cognitome, brainome, staging, symptomatome, and phenomenome latent scores in a causal model. The latter may be trained, tested and validated with Partial Least Squares analysis. This approach not only allows to compute pathway-phenotypes or biosignatures, but also to construct reliable and replicable nomothetic networks, which are, therefore, generalizable as disease models. After integrating the validated feature vectors into a well-fitting nomothetic network, clustering analysis may be applied on the latent variable scores of the R/R, AOP, cognitome, brainome, and phenome latent vectors. This pattern recognition method may expose new (transdiagnostic) classes of patients which if cross-validated in independent samples may constitute new (transdiagnostic) nosological categories.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review evidence for the association between trauma experienced in childhood or adolescence, and the subsequent experience of affective or psychotic mental disorders in adulthood.
   Methods: Electronic databases (Scopus, Medline (for Ovid), EMBASE and PsychINFO) were searched for peer-reviewed, longitudinal cohort studies in the English language examining child or adolescent exposure to trauma, and adult-diagnosed depression, anxiety, psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder. A total of 23 manuscripts were retained.
   Results: Results revealed a significant association between the following childhood exposures and adult mental disorder: bullying (victimhood, perpetration and frequency); emotional abuse; physical neglect; parental loss; and general maltreatment (unspecified and/or multiple trauma exposure). There was some evidence of a dose-response relationship with those exposed to multiple forms of maltreatment having more than three times the odds of developing a mental disorder (Odds ratio = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.36-7.14). There was no significant association found between physical or sexual abuse and adult mental disorder; however, this is likely an artefact of how these adversities were assessed.
   Conclusion: There is strong evidence of an association between childhood trauma and later mental illness. This association is particularly evident for exposure to bullying, emotional abuse, maltreatment and parental loss. The evidence suggests that childhood and adolescence are an important time for risk for later mental illness, and an important period in which to focus intervention strategies.

AB  - Background: Psychological distress is common among patients with cancer, with severe consequences on their quality of life. Anxiety and depression are the most common clinical presentation of psychological distress in cancer patients, but in some cases cancer may represent a traumatic event resulting in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Currently, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is considered an evidence-based treatment for PTSD, but recent studies also showed its effectiveness for anxiety and depression. The aim of the present systematic review is to summarize the current literature on the effect of EMDR on cancer-related psychological distress.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted for peer-reviewed articles about "EMDR" and "cancer patients" in the following electronic databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library.
   Results: Our search identified 7 studies in which EMDR was used with a total of 140 cancer patients. The psychiatric diagnosis was PTSD in 3 studies. Otherwise, the diagnosis concerned the anxious and depressive disorder spectrum. Overall, EMDR treatment schedules used were highly heterogeneous, with a different number of sessions (from 2 to 12) and a different duration of therapy (up to 4 months). However, across all studies analyzed EMDR therapy was judged to be adequate in reducing symptoms of psychological distress in this population.
   Conclusions: According to the results of our analysis, the level of evidence regarding EMDR efficacy in cancer patients is limited by the scarcity of studies and their low methodological quality. Although better quality research is needed, available data suggest that EMDR could be a promising treatment for psychological distress in patients with cancer.

AB  - Adolescence is a period of dramatic developmental transitions-from puberty-related changes in hormones, bodies, and brains to an increasingly complex social world. The concurrent increase in the onset of many mental disorders has prompted the search for key developmental processes that drive changes in risk for psychopathology during this period of life. Hormonal surges and consequent physical maturation linked to pubertal development in adolescence are thought to affect multiple aspects of brain development, social cognition, and peer relations, each of which have also demonstrated associations with risk for mood and anxiety disorders. These puberty-related effects may combine with other nonpubertal influences on brain maturation to transform adolescents' social perception and experiences, which in turn continue to shape both mental health and brain development through transactional processes. In this review, we focus on pubertal, neural, and social changes across the duration of adolescence that are known or thought to be related to adolescent-emergent disorders, specifically depression, anxiety, and deliberate self-harm (nonsuicidal self-injury). We propose a theoretical model in which social processes (both social cognition and peer relations) are critical to understanding the way in which pubertal development drives neural and psychological changes that produce potential mental health vulnerabilities, particularly (but not exclusively) in adolescent girls.

AB  - Social exclusion and rejection have deleterious effects on psychological well-being. Research documents the negative effects of social exclusion and rejection on psychiatric problems like depression, social anxiety disorder, and non-suicidal self-injury. Additionally, prior research suggests that individuals with and at-risk for psychosis spectrum disorders may also be negatively affected by exclusion and rejection. Moreover, those on the psychosis spectrum may be at an even greater risk to experience social exclusion due to poor social functioning and the stigma surrounding the disorder. This systematic review aimed to investigate how individuals across the psychosis spectrum respond to social exclusion and rejection. We systematically searched PubMed and PsycINFO databases to identify studies that met the following eligibility criteria: 1) investigated social exclusion or rejection, 2) targeted a psychosis-related sample or symptoms, and 3) was an empirical study. 13 studies satisfied our eligibility criteria and were subsequently reviewed. Despite methodological variation and samples spanning the psychosis spectrum, the majority of the literature supports the conclusion that those with psychosis spectrum disorders report similar levels of exclusion-induced distress compared to healthy controls, but process and cope with exclusion differently, both behaviorally and neurobiologically.

AB  - Background: In Pakistan, almost 30% population is between 15 to 29 years of age, with university enrollment rates of 10-15%. Although there is a growing concern on mental health of university students across the globe, studies from low and middle income countries such as Pakistan are scarce. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence of depressive symptoms among Pakistani university students.
   Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo and Google Scholar were searched between 15 to 30th January 2020. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, published till 31st December 2019 were included. Data on study characteristics and prevalence of depressive symptoms were extracted. Meta-analysis was conducted using random effects models. To estimate subgroup difference based on study characteristics, meta-regression and sub-group analyses were conducted.
   Results: In total, 26 studies involving 7,652 participants were included in review. Overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was 42.66% (95% CI: 34.82% to 50.89%), with significant heterogeneity among studies. Subgroup analyses revealed a significant difference in prevalence estimates based on depression screening instrument and study major. Statistically significant differences were observed among studies employing different psychometric scales (test for subgroup differences, Q = 21.92, p < 0.05) and between students from different study majors (test for subgroup differences, Q = 3.76, p = 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our study found that overall prevalence of depressive symptoms among university students in Pakistan was 42.66%, however, findings should be interpreted with caution. Large scale epidemiological surveys using valid and reliable tools are needed to better estimate prevalence of depression among Pakistani university students.

AB  - Despite people spending nearly 10% of each day on social media platforms, many also now appear to be anxious to limit the intrusion of social media into their everyday lives. Given the known link between mental anguish and trait neuroticism, understanding how personality relates to social media usage has become an important area of study in recent years. As a result, there is an abundance of articles exploring neuroticism and social media across a variety of contexts. This article synthesizes and reviews the existing work, based on a systematic search that identified 159 studies. Our findings highlight that this current research is highly contradictory, for example people with high trait neuroticism report excessive use despite appearing to use social media infrequently. We discuss the key trends across existing studies to date, and we consider the apparent difficulties experienced by people with high trait neuroticism in exploiting the full benefits of 'social' media, discussing the importance of considerations for both designers and users of social media platforms.

AB  - Objective: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and Psychological distress (PD) related to COVID-19 among affected populations.
   Methods: We searched articles in Medline, Embase, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. Randomeffects meta-analyses on the proportions of individuals with symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and PD were generated and between-group differences for gender, healthcare workers (HCWs), and regions where studies were conducted.
   Results: A total of 2189 articles were screened, 136 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Fifty-five peerreviewed studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis (N=189,159). The prevalence of depression (k=46) was 15.97% (95%CI, 13.24-19.13). The prevalence of anxiety (k=54) was 15.15% (95%CI, 12.29-18.54). The prevalence of insomnia (k=14) was 23.87% (95%CI, 15.74-34.48). The prevalence of PTSD (k=13) was 21.94% (95%CI, 9.37-43.31). Finally, the prevalence of psychological distress (k=19) was 13.29% (95%CI, 8.80-19.57). Between-group differences were only found in HCWs (z=2.69, p < 0.05) who had a higher prevalence of insomnia than others.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that the short-term mental health consequences of COVID-19 are equally high across affected countries, and across gender. However, reports of insomnia are significantly higher among HCWs than the general population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present strategic options to support the adoption of mental health strengthening policies for university students in the field of health, to be implemented by university institutions.
   METHODS : Rapid review, without period delimitation, with searches carried out from May to June 2020, in 21 sources of bibliographic data, including gray literature. The following keywords were used: mental health, students and university. The selection process prioritized systematic reviews of mental health interventions for university students in health care courses, and also considered other types of review and relevant primary studies.
   RESULTS: Forty-five studies were included: 34 systematic reviews, an evidence synthesis, an overview, a scope review, three narrative reviews, three experience reports and two opinion articles. The evidence from these studies supported the development of four options: 1) to establish and support policies to strengthen the mental health of students in health care courses; 2) to integrate mental health care programs, expand their offer and facilitate access by students; 3) to promote educational programs and communication strategies related to contemporary psychic suffering and its confrontation, so that students can get to know the services and resources and identify strengthening practices; 4) to continuously monitor and assess the mental health needs of students in health care courses.
   CONCLUSIONS: The options are challenging and require universities to establish institutional commissions to implement a policy to strengthen the mental health of university students in the health area, with the ability to recognize the different health needs, including manifestations of psychic suffering ; to integrate the university's internal actions with each other and with the services of the Unified Health System; to implement and monitor the actions that make up the mental health policy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Work-related stress can be defined as an individual's reactions to work characteristics and indicates a poor relationship between coping abilities and work environment. If unmanaged, stress can impact mental and physical health (e.g., causing depression and cardiovascular disease). Many individuals use maladaptive stress-coping strategies, such as sedentary activities, unhealthy eating behaviors, and alcohol consumption, which do not contribute to long-term stress management. In contrast, stress reduction programs can help people manage and effectively reduce stress in the long term.
   OBJECTIVE: To gather the state of the art of work-related stress interventions, their efficacy and applications.
   METHOD: The PsycINFO and EBSCOHost databases were used. The search was carried out between January 28 and March 30, 2019. Inclusion criteria were full text available, text in English or Spanish and a study population comprising workers.
   RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles that included interventions involving aromatherapy, bibliotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise, alternative medicine, mindfulness, technology, stress management and sensory intervention were analyzed. The interventions showed significant reductions in stress, anxiety, depression and burnout; however, most of the studies were not based on specific stress models, and control groups often received no intervention whatsoever. As a result, it is challenging to draw conclusions regarding the success of the interventions, especially if they are novel.
   CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there is a broad portfolio of successful interventions regarding work-related stress. Most of the successful interventions were based on mindfulness; however, aerobic exercise and bibliotherapy may also be successful. The structure and level of evidence appear to be very relevant to the development of a successful intervention.

AB  - Purpose: Psychological trauma is a significant risk factor for physical and mental health development distortion. This paper presents the results of longitudinal epidemiological surveys and naturalistic observations. It also reviews the results of the most important neurobiological findings in the field of impact of early life trauma on cognitive and emotional development, and the structure and functions of the brain.
   Views: Trauma is defined as subjective experiences that overwhelm a person's ability to maintain psychophysical integrity. During the stage of neurodevelopment, various life adversities, such as emotional and sensory deprivation, abandonment and neglect by caregivers as well as physical or emotional violence and sexual abuse overwhelm the physiological and mental capacity of a child and impact their cognitive, emotional and social development, adversely influencing adulthood functioning. Symptoms of abused children can evolve and change with time, from moderate signs of distress to more complex symptoms and organized disorders. The most important longitudinal studies, such as the Lives Across Time Study, Minnesota Study, Adverse Childhood Experiences Study, The Great Smoky Mountains Study, and the English and Romanian Adoptee Study are discussed in the paper. The lifelong influences of early adversities on brain structures like the corpus callosum, hippocampus, the amygdaloid nuclei, ventral striatum and cerebral cortex has been described. The variability of the sensitivity of specific brain regions, based on different rates of maturation, has also been discussed.
   Conclusions: This review integrates and summarizes the basic knowledge about the impact and neurobiological consequences of early traumatic adversities.

AB  - The objective of this systematic review was to examine the pooled prevalence of common mental disorder (CMD) and to evaluate the predictability of screening instruments to detect CMD in the children and adolescent population in India. Data sources included the MEDLINE, PubMed, PyschEXTRA, and PyschINFO up to 2020, with additional studies identified from a search of reference lists to examine the diagnostic utility of tools carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines, PRISMA within parentheses after the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). Only studies involving children and adolescents with an independent measure of depression and anxiety in India were included. Random effects meta-analyses were employed to calculate a pooled estimate of depression prevalence. Twenty studies met all inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review. The analysis showed that several tools were used in different regions of the nation to measure CMD such as the beck depression inventory (BDI), Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. The pooled prevalence of depression was 19% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.57-27.12), 15% (95% CI = 4.67-30.90) for anxiety, and 11% (95% CI = 4.37-19.77) for any depressive disorder. In terms of BDI had the highest sensitivity (61%) while CDRS-R had the highest specificity (75%). Given the high heterogeneity of the studies, there is insufficient evidence that any tool accurately screens for CMD and likely to underestimate the true prevalence.

AB  - The sensation of pain is common to both animals and human beings. Its threshold, intensity, tolerability, and characteristics are variable and depend on ethnicity, gender, stress exposure, co-existing mental disorders, such as depression or anxiety, social and economical background, as well as on genetic factors. It is estimated that about 5 and 20 percent of population suffer from acute and chronic pain, respectively, which results in the search for medical advice in healthcare facilities, and causes great expenses in health care budgets worldwide. Research aimed at identifying the causative agents of pain syndromes include single nucleotidepolymorphism (SNP), family history studies, twin siblings' genetic diversity studies, and recently, also a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Clinical syndromes of derangement of pain sensation are generally caused by single gene mutations (e.g. erythromelalgia and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder caused by mutations of SCN9A), but can also be associated with multiple gene mutations, as happens in migraine, fibromyalgia or hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies. Structural changes of proteins caused by gene mutations involve various cellular element, such as ion channels, receptors, scaffolding proteins, enzymes, transporting proteins, eventually leading to numerous clinical entities in which pain or its lack remain the leading symptoms. The sensation of pain is initiated by a stimulus, which activates the free nerve endings via chemical mediators, and the mechanical stimuli is then transmitted to the brain along the neurons and spinal tracts. Synaptic neurotransmitters and cell structures take part in this process and eventually affect the intensity of pain sensation.

AB  - Objective: We sought to determine the frequency of and risk factors for suicide outcomes in somatic symptom and related disorders and whether any risk was independent of co-occurring mental disorders.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies on suicide death, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation in those with somatic symptom disorders published prior to September 22, 2020 and indexed in PubMED, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, EMBASE, or SCOPUS according to PRISMA guidelines.
   Results: Our search yielded 33 articles with significant heterogeneity in study design, sample selection, and assessment for suicide or risk factors. While suicide deaths have not been adequately studied, somatic symptom and related disorders are associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, with estimates ranging from 24 to 34% of participants who endorsed current active suicidal ideation and 13-67% of participants who endorsed a prior suicide attempt. The risk appeared independent of co-occurring mental disorders. Identified risk factors for suicide attempts in samples with somatic symptom and related disorders include scores on measures of anger, alexithymia, alcohol use, past hospitalizations, dissociation, and emotional abuse.
   Conclusion: Although the literature is sparse, there exists evidence for an association, even independent of other mental disorders, between somatic symptom and related disorders and suicide outcomes. Practice guidelines for the management of these disorders should incorporate recommendations for the assessment and management of suicide risk. Future study is necessary to more fully elucidate potential unique risk factors for those suffering from these complex disorders.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has placed tremendous pressure on healthcare workers who are at the frontline in the battle against it, causing various forms of psychological distress.
   Aims To outline the prevalence and dynamic changing features of medical workers' psychological issues and to review the related national policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.
   Methods We systematically searched for studies on the psychological states of Chinese medical staff from 1 January 2020 to 8 May 2020. The aggregate prevalence of each psychological issue was calculated and plotted to observe the changes over time. Policies on psychological support for medical staff during the pandemic were reviewed to explore their link to the prevalence of psychological problems.
   Results In total, 26 studies were included in this study. A total of 22 062 medical workers were surveyed from 31 January to 27 February 2020. Medical staff exhibited a substantial prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, stress-related symptoms and sleep problems during the survey period, with aggregate prevalence rates of 27.0%, 26.2%, 42.1% and 34.5%, respectively. Cumulative meta-analyses revealed that the prevalence of psychological distress peaked at the beginning of the pandemic and subsequently exhibited a slow downward trend.
   Conclusion Chinese medical staff displayed significant psychological disturbance during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was especially severe at the early stage. Implementing supportive policies may help alleviate ongoing psychological problems in healthcare workers.

AB  - Objectives Work related stress is a major occupational health problem that is associated with adverse effects on physical and mental health. Healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable in the era of COVID-19. Physical methods of stress relief such as yoga and massage therapy may reduce occupational stress. The objective of this systematic review and network meta-analysis is to determine the effects of yoga, massage therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, and stretching on alleviating stress and improving physical and mental health in healthcare workers. Methods Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials on the use of physical relaxation methods for occupational stress in healthcare workers with any duration of follow-up. Meta-analysis was performed for standard mean differences in stress measures from baseline between subjects undergoing relaxation vs non-intervention controls. Network meta-analysis was conducted to determine the best relaxation method. Results Fifteen trials representing 688 healthcare workers were identified. Random-effects meta-analysis shows that physical relaxation methods overall reduced measures of occupational stress at the longest duration of follow-up vs baseline compared to non-intervention controls (SMD -0.53; 95% CI [-0.74 to -0.33]; p < .00001). On network meta-analysis, only yoga alone (SMD -0.71; 95% CI [-1.01 to -0.41]) and massage therapy alone (SMD -0.43; 95% CI [-0.72 to -0.14]) were more effective than control, with yoga identified as the best method (p-score = .89). Conclusion Physical relaxation may help reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers. Yoga is particularly effective and offers the convenience of online delivery. Employers should consider implementing these methods into workplace wellness programs.

AB  - Background The effects of disasters and conflicts are widespread and heavily studied. While attention to disasters' impacts on mental health is growing, mental health effects are not well understood due to inconsistencies in measurement. Objective The purpose of this study is to review mental health assessment tools and their use in populations affected by disasters and conflicts. Method Tools that assess posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, substance use disorder, and general mental health were examined. This review began with a search for assessment tools in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. Next, validation studies for the tools were obtained through snowball sampling. A final search was conducted for scientific studies using the selected tools in humanitarian settings to collect the data for analysis. The benefits and limitations described for each tool were compiled into a complete table. Results Twelve assessment tools were included, with 88 studies using them. The primary findings indicate that half of the studies used the Impact of Events Scale-Revised. The most common limitation discussed is that self-report tools inaccurately estimate the prevalence of mental health problems. This inaccuracy is further exacerbated by a lack of cultural appropriateness of the tools, as many are developed for Western contexts. Conclusion It is recommended that researchers and humanitarian workers reflect on the effectiveness of the mental health assessment tool they use to accurately represent the populations under study in emergency settings. In addition, mental health assessment should be coupled with action.

AB  - Objectives: To perform a systematic study about the contribution of architecture and interior design researchers in studying the effect of physical environment on mental disorders. Background: Mental disorders are a major health problem worldwide and related to severe distress, functional disabilities, and heavy economical burdens. Studies propose that physical environment design can trigger or reduce mental disorder symptoms. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the extent of architectural design research contribution to all types of mental disorder prevention or intervention. Methods: A team of cross-disciplinary researchers gathered information from peer-reviewed manuscripts about the effect of architectural design on enhancing or reducing mental disorder symptoms. Data were collected from manuscripts published between 2008 and 2020 (research related to the topic became clearer in quality and quantity then). Keywords including architecture, interior design, physical environment, and mental disorders were used in the systematic search. Databases were collected using online resources. Numerical data collected from quantitative studies were organized in tables. Results: Our data showed that there were a lot of studies about dementia and autism; few studies about schizophrenia, anxiety, stress-related disorders, and depressive disorders; and no studies about the rest of the mental disorders. General environment followed by housing facility design were the most assessed physical environments for mental disorders. Conclusions: As all mental disorders can have a significant impact on the society, we conclude that architectural studies should focus more on improving or preventing the symptoms of all types of mental disorders through the design of physical environments.

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, and then spread all over the world in a short time.
   Objectives To highlight and discuss the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental or psychological health.
   Method Literature search and collection of the information were performed using PubMed, the reports from the World health organization, and the Center for disease control and prevention.
   Results COVID-19 infection has already been declared as a global pandemic, which in association with infodemic has increased the risk of psychiatric/psychological disorders. A large population of the world is prone to develop anxiety, depressive disorders, and other mental abnormalities. Therefore, timely psychological interventions and preventive strategies are required. Moreover, the infection has been reported to be linked with cerebrovascular conditions; therefore, patients with underlying cerebrovascular diseases should be given attention.
   Conclusion COVID-19-mediated mental health complications and cerebrovascular conditions may cause a huge burden on healthcare communities in the future. Therefore, timely intervention and the development or application of preventive strategies are required to decrease the risk of neurological consequences.

AB  - Introduction Evidence suggests that Crohn's disease (CD) pathophysiology goes beyond the gastrointestinal tract and is also strongly associated with the brain. In particular, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which plays an integral role in the first brain as part of the default mode network (DMN) and pain matrix, shows abnormalities using multiple neuroimaging modalities. This review summarizes nine related studies that investigated changes in the ACC using structural magnetic resonance imaging, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
   Methods An extensive PubMed literature search was conducted from 1980 to August 2020. In a review of the articles identified, particular attention was paid to analysis methods, technical protocol characteristics, and specific changes in the ACC.
   Results In terms of morphology, a decrease in gray matter volume and cortical thickness was observed along with an increase in local gyrification index. In terms of function, functional connectivity (FC) within the DMN was increased. FC between the ACC and the amygdala was decreased. Higher amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuation and graph theory results, including connectivity strength, clustering coefficient, and local efficiency, were detected. In terms of neurotransmitter changes, the concentrations of glutamate increased along with a decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid, providing a rational explanation for abdominal pain. These changes may be attributed to stress, pain, and negative emotions, as well as changes in gut microbiota.
   Conclusions For patients with CD, the ACC demonstrates structural, functional, and metabolic changes. In terms of clinical findings, the ACC plays an important role in the onset of depression/anxiety and abdominal pain. Therefore, successful modulation of this pathway may guide treatment.

This paper aimed to summarise existing literature on the psychological impact of infectious disease outbreaks on women who were pregnant at the time of the outbreak.
   Study design: The design of this study is a rapid review.
   Methods: Five databases were searched for relevant literature, and main findings were extracted.
   Results: Thirteen articles were included in the review. The following themes were identified: negative emotional states; living with uncertainty; concerns about infection; concerns about and uptake of prophylaxis or treatment; disrupted routines; non-pharmaceutical protective behaviours; social support; financial and occupational concerns; disrupted expectations of birth, prenatal care and postnatal care and sources of information.
   Conclusions: Pregnant women have unique needs during infectious disease outbreaks and could benefit from up-to-date, consistent information and guidance; appropriate support and advice from healthcare professionals, particularly with regards to the risks and benefits of prophylaxis and treatment; virtual support groups and designating locations or staff specifically for pregnant women.

We focus on autism spectrum disorder, psychotic disorders, stress and anxiety disorders, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease and additionally discuss the comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disorder and mental health disorders. Recent Findings Human and animal studies show that sex may modify the relationship between the gut or immune system and brain and behavior. Sex also appears to modify the effect of microbial treatments such as probiotics and antibiotics on brain and behavior. There is emerging evidence that assessing the role of sex in the gut-brain axis may help elucidate the etiology of and identify effective treatments for neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Background Many observational studies have found a direct association between adverse in utero, perinatal and postnatal exposures and offspring's depression. These findings are consistent with the 'developmental origins of disease hypothesis'. But no review has comprehensively summarized the roles of these exposures. This review aims to systematically scrutinize the strength of associations between individual prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal exposures and subsequent depression in offspring.
   Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the literature from the EMBASE, HealthStar, PsychoInfo, and Medline databases since their inception to September 1, 2019. English language articles on population-based prospective cohort studies examining the associations between in utero, perinatal, and postnatal exposures and offspring's depression were searched. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled estimates, and heterogeneity and sensitivity tests were conducted to explore potential confounders in the relationships of depression and early-life factors. Qualitative analysis was also conducted.
   Results Sixty-four prospective cohort studies with 28 exposures studied in the relationships to offspring's depression met inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis found 12 prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal characteristics were associated with an increased risk of depression in offspring: low birth weight, premature birth, small gestational age, maternal education, socioeconomic status, having younger parents (<20 years), having older parents (>= 35 years), maternal smoking, paternal smoking, maternal stress, maternal anxiety, and prenatal depression. Heterogeneity and sensitivity tests supported the findings. By and large, study characteristics had no effects on conclusions. Qualitative analyses generally supported the findings of meta-analysis and reported on additional risk factors.
   Conclusions This review provides a robust and comprehensive overview of the lasting psychopathological effects of in utero, perinatal, and postnatal exposures. The findings highlight the need for clinical and public health interventions focusing on the identified risk factors. Large prospective cohort studies are warranted to investigate the combined effects of multiple co-existing early-life exposures.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been devastating in all senses, particularly psychologically. Physical activity (PA) is known to aid psychological well-being, and it is worth investigating whether PA has been a coping strategy during this pandemic. The objective of this literature review is to analyze the extent to which engaging in PA during the COVID-19 pandemic impacts psychological health in the adult population. The literature was searched in all databases from the EBSCOhost Research Database-MEDLINE, APA PsycArticles, between others-published between 1 January 2019 and 15 July 2020. From 180 articles found, 15 were eligible. The reviewed articles showed an association between mental health distress-e.g., stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, social isolation, psychological distress-and PA. This research concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures caused psychological distress. Those studies that analyzed PA showed that, during quarantine, adults increased their sedentary time and reduced their PA levels, showing controversial psychological outcomes. This review discusses whether PA is an effective strategy to face the COVID-19 pandemic psychological effects contributing to a further putative increase in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Introduction Intervention fidelity refers to whether an intervention is delivered as intended and can enhance interpretation of trial outcomes. Fidelity of interventions to reduce or prevent stress and anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum has yet to be examined despite inconsistent findings for intervention effects. This study systematically reviews use and/or reporting of intervention fidelity strategies in trials of interventions, delivered to (expectant) parents during pregnancy and postpartum, to reduce or prevent stress and/or anxiety. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and Maternity and Infant Care were searched from inception to March 2019. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials including pregnant women, expectant fathers and/or partners during pregnancy, and/ or parents within the first two years postpartum. The National Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium checklist was used to assess fidelity across five domains (study design, provider training, delivery, receipt, enactment). Results Sixteen papers (14 interventions) were identified. Average reported use of fidelity strategies was 'low' (45%), ranging from 17.5 to 76%. Fidelity ratings ranged from 22% for provider training to 54% for study design. Conclusions Low levels of intervention fidelity may explain previous inconsistent effects of stress and anxiety reduction interventions. Important methodological areas for improvement include intervention provider training, fidelity of comparator conditions, and consideration of non-specific treatment effects. Increased methodological rigour in fidelity enhancement and assessment will improve intervention implementation and enhance examination of stress and anxiety reduction and prevention interventions delivered during pregnancy and the postpartum.

AB  - Background: Prenatal and postnatal mental disorders can exert severe adverse influences on mothers, fetuses, and children. However, the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women remains unclear.
   Methods: Relevant studies that were published from January 1, 2019 to September 19, 2020 were identified through the systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. Quality assessment of included studies, random-effects meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, and planned subgroup analysis were performed.
   Results: A total of 23 studies conducted with 20,569 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and with 3,677 pregnant women before the COVID-19 pandemic were included. The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and insomnia among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic were 37% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25-49%), 31% (95% CI 20-42%), 70% (95% CI 60-79%), and 49% (95% CI 46-52%), respectively. The prevalence of postpartum depression was 22% (95% CI 15-29%). Multigravida women and women in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy were more vulnerable than other pregnant women. The assessment of the associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health problems revealed that the pooled relative risks of anxiety and depression in pregnant women were 1.65 (95% CI: 1.25-2.19) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.80-1.46), respectively.
   Conclusions: The prevalence rates of mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic were high. Timely and tailored interventions should be applied to mitigate mental problems among this population of women, especially multigravida women and women in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy.

AB  - Background: The twenty-first century viral respiratory epidemics have taught us valuable lessons. Our systematic review examined the impact of these epidemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on mental health among different population groups, drawing on their insights for recommendations for the current COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane on April 4, 2020. Studies that had undefined mental health outcomes or did not use a validated scale for measure were excluded. Quality assessment was carried out via the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
   Results: We included 95 studies, most of which were conducted in Hong Kong (31.6%) and China (21.4%). A total of 30 (30.9%) studies are on the general public, 41 (42.2%) on healthcare workers, and 26 (26.6%) on patients and quarantined individuals. Furthermore, 36 (37.1%) of the studies are of high quality, 48 (49.5%) are of moderate quality, and 13 (13.4%) are of low quality. The most significant mental health outcomes reported include anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The subgroups identified to have a higher risk of psychiatric symptoms among the general public include females, the elderly, individuals with chronic illness, migrant workers, and students. Long-term mental health impact was reported in some healthcare workers and epidemic patients, even up to 3 years in the former. Interestingly, when compared to non-quarantined groups, quarantine was not significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes.
   Conclusion: Important implications for the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted. Respiratory epidemics pose a significant psychological morbidity onto many population groups. Psychological support for vulnerable groups, including healthcare workers and patients, should be implemented to prevent them from spiraling into clinical psychiatric conditions.

TI  - Depression treatment research in people with cancer does not reflect cancer prevalence: findings from a systematic review
KW  - depression &amp
KW  - mood disorders
KW  - EXPERIENCES
KW  - SURVIVORS
KW  - ANXIETY
AB  - Background
   One in six people with cancer will develop depression at some point in their care. Untreated depression affects quality of life, cancer care satisfaction and healthcare expenditure. Treatments for this vulnerable heterogenous population should be evidence based and specific. A common sentiment is that psychiatric research does not reflect the prevalence of patients with cancer and comorbid depression and is biased towards certain cancers, but this has not been empirically shown.
   Study selection and analysis
   A systematic review of studies on psychological and pharmacological treatments for depression in people with cancer was conducted. Of 4621 papers identified from a search of PubMed and PsycINFO up to 27 June 2020, 84 met inclusion criteria (eg, adults with cancer; depression diagnosis; treatment study) and comprised 6048 participants with depression with cancer.
   Findings
   Cancer types are not proportionally represented in depression research in accordance with their incidence. Breast cancer is over-represented (relative frequency in research 49.3%, but 11.7% of global cancer). Cancers of the head and neck and bone and soft tissue were close to parity. All other cancers are under-represented. Representativeness varied 40-fold across different cancers.
   Conclusions
   The evidence base for depression treatments is dominated by a single cancer. Given heterogeneity in cancer populations (eg, stage of illness; psychological impact; cancer treatments), it is possible that depression treatments may not have the same benefits and harms across all cancers, impeding the ability to offer people with different cancers the best depression treatment. While the dominant opinion within this research field is that a cancer bias exists, this is the first study to demonstrate as such.

AB  - Background: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a psychological intervention with established efficacy in the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders. Previous systematic reviews have not evaluated the effectiveness of IPT on symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, quality of life, relationship satisfaction/quality, social supports, and an improved psychological sense of wellbeing. There is limited information regarding moderating and mediating factors that impact the effectiveness of IPT such as the timing of the intervention or the mode of delivery of IPT intervention. The overall objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of IPT interventions to treat perinatal (from pregnancy up to 12 months postpartum) psychological distress. Methods: MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (OVID), CINAHL with Full Text (Ebsco), Social Work Abstracts (Ebsco), SocINDEX with Full Text (Ebsco), Academic Search Complete (Ebsco), Family & Society Studies Worldwide (Ebsco), Family Studies Abstracts (Ebsco), and Scopus databases were searched from inception until 31 January 2019. Two researchers independently screened articles for eligibility. Of the 685 screened articles, 43 met the inclusion criteria. The search was re-run on 11 May 2020. An additional 204 articles were screened and two met the inclusion criteria, resulting in a total of 45 studies included in this review. There were 25 Randomized Controlled Trials, 10 Quasi-experimental studies, eight Open Trials, and two Single Case Studies. All included studies were critically appraised for quality. Results: In most studies (n = 24, 53%), the IPT intervention was delivered individually; in 17 (38%) studies IPT was delivered in a group setting and two (4%) studies delivered the intervention as a combination of group and individual IPT. Most interventions were initiated during pregnancy (n = 27, 60%), with the remaining 18 (40%) studies initiating interventions during the postpartum period. Limitations: This review included only English-language articles and peer-reviewed literature. It excluded government reports, dissertations, conference papers, and reviews. This limited the access to grassroots or community-based recruitment and retention strategies that may have been used to target smaller or marginalized groups of perinatal women. Conclusions: IPT is an effective intervention for the prevention and treatment of psychological distress in women during their pregnancy and postpartum period. As a treatment intervention, IPT is effective in significantly reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as improving social support, relationship quality/satisfaction, and adjustment. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO CRD42019114292.

AB  - Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and severity as a consequence of climate change and pose a significant threat to population mental health. This is the case even in temperate regions such as the United Kingdom (UK) where flooding and heat waves are forecast to become more common. We conducted a systematic review to quantify the prevalence and describe the causes of common mental health problems in populations exposed to extreme weather events in the UK. We searched Web of Science, EMBASE and PsycINFO for studies that measured the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in populations exposed to extreme weather events in the UK, published up to 12 December 2019. We included 17 studies, four of which were included in meta-analyses to determine the point prevalence of common mental health problems in the period within 12 months following extreme weather events. The point prevalence was 19.8% for anxiety (k = 4; n = 1458; 95% CI 7.42 to 32.15), 21.35% for depression (k = 4; n = 1458; 95% CI 9.04 to 33.65) and 30.36% for PTSD (k = 4; n = 1359; 95% CI 11.68 to 49.05). Key factors that affected mental ill health in people exposed to flooding were water depth and absence of flood warnings. Displacement from home underscored the narratives associated with people's perceptions of the impact of flooding. The high prevalence of common mental health problems suggests that the prevention of mental ill health in populations at risk or exposed to extreme weather events should be a UK public health priority.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has deeply altered social and working environments in several ways. Social distancing policies, mandatory lockdowns, isolation periods, and anxiety of getting sick, along with the suspension of productive activity, loss of income, and fear of the future, jointly influence the mental health of citizens and workers. Workplace aspects can play a crucial role on moderating or worsening mental health of people facing this pandemic scenario. The purpose of this literature review is to deepen the psychological aspects linked to workplace factors, following the epidemic rise of COVID-19, in order to address upcoming psychological critical issues in the workplaces. We performed a literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus, selecting papers focusing on workers' psychological problems that can be related to the workplace during the pandemic. Thirty-five articles were included. Mental issues related to the health emergency, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep disorders are more likely to affect healthcare workers, especially those on the frontline, migrant workers, and workers in contact with the public. Job insecurity, long periods of isolation, and uncertainty of the future worsen the psychological condition, especially in younger people and in those with a higher educational background. Multiple organizational and work-related interventions can mitigate this scenario, such as the improvement of workplace infrastructures, the adoption of correct and shared anti-contagion measures, including regular personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, and the implementation of resilience training programs. This review sets the basis for a better understanding of the psychological conditions of workers during the pandemic, integrating individual and social perspectives, and providing insight into possible individual, social, and occupational approaches to this "psychological pandemic".

AB  - This review was done to synthesize the existing evidence on the prevalence of various psychological morbidities among general public, healthcare workers and COVID-19 patients amidst this pandemic situation. Systematic searches were conducted in various databases and search engines such as Medline, Chinese national knowledge infrastructure, Cochrane library, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar from inception until 22 April 2020. Newcastle Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of included studies. We carried out a meta-analysis with random-effects model and reported pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 50 studies were included in the review. Only seven studies (14%) had low risk of bias. Pooled prevalence rate of psychological morbidities includes poor sleep quality (40%), stress (34%), psychological distress (34%), insomnia (30%), post-traumatic stress symptoms (27%), anxiety (26%), depression (26%). Pooled prevalence rate of psychological morbidities with respect to impact of event due to COVID-19 pandemic was 44% (95%CI-42% to 47%). The burden of these psychological morbidities was highest among the COVID-19 patients followed by healthcare workers and general population.

KW  - Public health
AB  - Background: The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic promptly changed people's daily lives, influenced human interactions and economic activities and induced mental reactions.
   Objective: This review synthesized the evidence of correlation between demographic factors, social media exposure, stressors and anxiety and depression status in the early phase of COVID-19.
   Method: A systematically search included observational studies published before May15, 2020. We selected studies designed with valid measuring instruments of anxiety and depression.
   Result: 20 articles were included (19 cross-sectional) for review. People who were divorced/widowed, with poor self-rated health status, chronic illness and previous psychiatric illness had higher anxiety and depression prevalence. Higher COVID-19 awareness (including COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary measure) decreased anxiety and depression. The protective measures to reduce anxiety and depression levels included avoiding sharing meals, frequently washing hands and wearing mask. Economic loss, academic delay, influence of daily life, worrying and symptoms related to infection were stressors of anxiety and depression. There were lots of inconsistent results due to convenience sampling and diverse measuring instrument.
   Conclusion: Our review suggested that reliable information from health authorities, enhancing health literacies and prevention measures of general population can reduce anxiety and depression levels.

AB  - The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely discussed during the past few months, with scholars expressing concern about its potential debilitating consequences on youth mental health. Hence, this research aimed to provide a systematic review of the evidence on the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on youth mental health. We conducted a mixed methods integrated review to identify any empirical study that focused on young people <= 18 years old. Eight databases were systematically searched to identify studies of any type of research design. The selection procedure followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol of this systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (protocol ID: CRD4202019375). Twelve studies deemed eligible for data extraction (n = 12,262). The findings show that COVID-19 has an impact on youth mental health and is particularly associated with depression and anxiety in adolescent cohorts. The quality appraisal indicated that all studies were of low or moderate methodological quality. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting young people's lives, and thus generating robust research evidence to inform policy decisions is essential. Hence, the methodological quality of future research should be drastically improved.

AB  - Much of the burden associated with poor mental health is associated with symptom experience in the general population. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies conducted in nonclinical samples, evaluating mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) for outcomes related to psychological health and well- being. We focused on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) because they have the strongest evidence base. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL (from 2006 to February 2019) for published peer-reviewed journals articles of intervention studies evaluating MBCT or MBSR for psychological health and well-being in nonclinical samples. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, and effect estimates were reported as Hedges' g. We included 49 studies conducted in nonclinical samples (n = 4,733). When compared with a passive control, MBPs significantly reduced symptoms of rumination/ worry (g = -1.13, [-2.17, -0.08]), stress/psychological distress (g = -0.52 [-0.68, -0.36]), depression (g = -0.45 [-0.64, -0.26]), and anxiety (g = -0.44 [-0.65, -0.23]), and significantly improved quality of life/well-being (g = 0.32 [0.10, 0.54]). In general, MBCT generated larger effect sizes than MBSR for all outcomes. This study provides evidence that in nonclinical samples, MBPs are associated with benefits to health and well-being. These findings add to the growing evidence base suggesting that MBSR and MBCT may be effective approaches for subclinical levels of mental ill-health and could form part of the public mental health agenda.

AB  - Police face an increased risk of developing mental health problems, yet reliable estimates of their psychological difficulties remain unknown. This systematic review and meta-analysis estimate the pooled prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems among police personnel worldwide. Three independent reviewers searched 16 databases and screened 11 506 articles published between January 1980 and October 2019. Eligible studies involved at least 100 active police professionals and used validated instruments to ascertain specific mental health problems. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. In total, 60 cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies, involving 272 463 police personnel from 24 countries met criteria for inclusion. The overall pooled point prevalence was 14.6% for depression (95% CI 10.9% to 18.6%), 14.2% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 95% CI 10.3% to 18.7%), 9.6% for a generalised anxiety disorder (95% CI 6.7% to 12.9%), 8.5% for suicidal ideation (95% CI 6.1% to 11.2%), 5.0% for alcohol dependence (95% CI 3.5% to 6.7%) and 25.7% for hazardous drinking (95% CI 19.6% to 32.4%). The strongest risk factor for depression and suicidal ideation was higher occupational stress, and the strongest risk factors for PTSD were higher occupational stress and avoidant coping strategies. Higher levels of peer-support were associated with significantly lower PTSD symptoms. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of mental health problems among police exceeds twice that previously reported in mixed samples of first responders, and is associated with poor social support, occupational stress and maladaptive coping strategies. Without effective intervention, psychological difficulties will remain a substantial health concern among police.

A literature search yielded 34 meta-analyses (total number of studies k = 1,390, n = 145,744) that were summarized. Overall, self-guided interventions showed small to medium effects in comparison to control groups. In particular, self-guided therapeutic approaches (including cognitive-behavioral, mindfulness, and acceptance-based interventions), selected positive psychology interventions, and multi-component and activity-based interventions (music, physical exercise) showed promising evidence for effectiveness. Overall, self-guided interventions on average did not show the same degree of effectiveness as traditional guided individual or group therapies. There was no consistent evidence of dose effects, baseline differences, and differential effectiveness of eHealth interventions. More research on the effectiveness of interventions in diverse cultural settings is needed.

AB  - Background
   The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) shows several similarities with previous outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide evidence of the psychopathologic burden on health care workers (HCWs) of the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks to get lessons for managing the current burden of COVID-19 outbreak.
   Method
   According to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA Statement, the study quantified the effects of frontline work on mental health of HCWs. Major databases - Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science - were searched for observational and case-control studies evaluating mental health indexes reported by front-line work. This study computed the percentage of sample that reported clinically significant levels of psychiatric symptoms. Cohen's d was used for comparing mental health outcomes of health care workers directly involved in addressing pandemic emergency with a control group that was not directly exposed to such conditions. Pooled effect sizes (d(w)) were estimated whenever at least three independent studies yielded data. Heterogeneity of findings and bias of publication were estimated as well.
   Findings
   Fifteen studies have been selected for a total of 7,393 HCWs. From 9.6% to 51% of HCWs reported symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and from 20% to 75% reported psychiatric symptoms, with a prevalence of anxiety and depression. From one to the three years after outbreak, from 2% to 19% reported PTSD symptoms and from 5% to 90% psychiatric symptoms. Interestingly, HWCs who were directly involved in pandemic emergency showed significantly higher depressive and anxious symptoms (d(w) = .66 (.46-.85); p <.001) than ones who were not directly exposed. Similarly, the direct involvement significantly affected the severity of PTSD symptoms (d(w) = .30 (.21-.39); p <.001).
   Conclusion
   Health care professionals in general and most of all frontline workers showed an association with a likely risk of developing psychiatric disorders following outbreaks and for at least three years later. Mental health interventions for professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented. Further studies are warranted to investigate long-term consequences carefully, and to look for mediating and buffering factors as well. The role of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists in delivering adequate interventions is critically important.

AB  - Background The WHO reports that anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders worldwide. Most people who experience such events recover from it; however, people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) continue to be severely depressed and anxious for several months or even years following the event. Palestinians are particularly at a higher risk for developing anxiety disorders and PTSD due to the continuous exposure to political violence, prolonged displacement, and other limitation on professional, educational, financial opportunities, and mental health services. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the literature and established studies concerning Anxiety disorders besides PTSD in Palestine. Methods PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar was used to search for materials for the critical analysis of empirical articles. The following aspects were taken into consideration: study type, sample, and key findings. Results In this review, we included about twenty-four studies from Palestine (West Bank and Gaza). Five studies relate to children, five relate to adolescents, three relate to women, three relate to physical diseases, and four relate to gender and age differences. Results show that anxiety disorders and PTSD are one of the most common mental disorders in Palestine. Anxiety and PTSD develop from a complex set of risk factors, including genetics, personality, and life events. They are mostly associated with low quality of life and disability. The results indicate that a significant proportion of Palestinian experiencing serious issues that deal with several challenges, distinct barriers including; inconsistent availability of medications, absence of multidisciplinary teamwork, insufficient specialists, fragmented mental health system, and occupation. Conclusion As primary prevention, the occupation has to have considered as the main source of anxiety and other mental health disorders in Palestine. Besides, there is a need to implement a mental health care system through multidisciplinary work and raising awareness regarding the prevalence of mental disorders.

AB  - Cognitive and mental health are major determinants of quality of life, allowing integration into society at all ages. Human epidemiological and animal studies indicate that in addition to genetic factors and lifestyle, prenatal environmental influences may program neuropsychiatric disorders in later life. While several human studies have examined the effects of prenatal stress and nutrient restriction on brain function and mental health in later life, potentially mediating effects of prenatal stress and nutrient restriction on offspring neuroanatomy in humans have been studied only in recent years. Based on neuroimaging and anatomical data, we comprehensively review the studies in this emerging field. We relate prenatal environmental influences to neuroanatomical abnormalities in the offspring, measured in utero and throughout life. We also assess the relationship between neuroanatomical abnormalities and cognitive and mental disorders. Timingand gender-specific effects are considered, if reported. Our review provides evidence for adverse effects of an unfavorable prenatal environment on structural brain development that may contribute to the risk for cognitive, behavioral and mental health problems throughout life.

AB  - Introduction: The health benefits of physical activity have gained interest as an intervention tool for mental health. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effects of interventions with physical activity components on measures of anxiety, depression and stress in young people.
   Methods: A systematic search was carried out across nine electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, British Education Index, Child Development and Adolescent Studies, CENTRAL, Embase, SportDiscus and Psychinfo). Inclusion criteria were studies that used physical activity components with anxiety, depression and stress outcomes in a target population aged 10-19 years. Intervention effects (mean differences) were calculated with a random-effects model. A risk of bias assessment was conducted.
   Results: A total of 13 studies depicting 11 RCT and 2 Cluster RCT's with 1928 participants were included. 11 studies were eligible for meta-analyses. The meta-analyses for anxiety demonstrated no difference between groups at follow-up (SMD 0.04; 95% CI -0.20, 0.28; I-2 = 55%) or when measured as change from baseline (SMD -0.33; 95% CI -0.68, 0.03; I-2 = 0%). Similarly, no difference in depression was demonstrated between groups at follow-up (SMD 0.09; 95% CI -0.20, 0.40; I-2 = 72%) or when measured as change from baseline (SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.29, 0.07; I-2 = 0%). The meta-analyses showed no overall affect and included studies had high risk of bias and heterogeneity therefore results should be viewed tentatively.
   Conclusion: The ability of physical activity components within interventions to produce meaningful change in anxiety, depression and stress outcomes in adolescents remains unclear as the results of the meta-analyses showed no overall affect. Therefore more conclusive studies should be conducted in the future.

AB  - Background Neuropsychiatricsymptoms(NPS)of dementia, such as anxiety, depression, agitation, and apathy, are complex, stressful, and costly aspects of care, and are associated to poor health outcomes and caregiver burden. A steep worsening of such symptoms has been reported during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, their causes, their impact on everyday life, and treatment strategies have not been systematically assessed. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a detailed description of behavioral andpsychopathologicalalterations in subjects with dementia during COVID-19 pandemic and the associated management challenges. Methods A PubMed search was performed focusing on studies reporting alterations in behavior and mood and treatment strategies for elderly patients with dementia, in accordance withPRISMAguidelines. The following search strategy was utilized: (COVID* OR coronavirus OR "corona vir*" OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (dementia OR demented OR dement* OR alzheimer* OR "pick's disease" OR "lewy body" OR "mild cognitive" OR mild cognitive impairment OR MCI). Results Apathy, anxiety and agitation are the most frequentlyNPSduring the COVID-19 pandemic and are mainly triggered by protracted isolation. Most treatment strategies rely on pharmacotherapy; technology is increasingly utilized with mixed results. Conclusions NPSof dementia during COVID-19 appear to arise from social restrictions occurring as a consequence of the pandemic. Implementation of caregiver support and the presence of skilled nursing home staff are required to restore social interaction and adjust technological support to the patients' needs.

AB  - Background:Children with physical health long-term conditions (LTCs) have increased risk of mental health difficulties relative to healthy peers. However, availability of psychological support integrated into pediatric physical health settings is limited, and there are long waiting times for access to child mental health services. Arts-based therapies involve using creative media to develop a therapeutic relationship, and offer a potential alternative to talking-based therapies. The aim of this systematic review is to establish the effectiveness of arts-based therapies for improving the mental health of children with physical health LTCs. Methods:The review protocol was published on PROSPERO. Four electronic databases were searched (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and PsycINFO), plus hand searches of two key journals and relevant reviews, and forward/back citations searches of selected articles were conducted. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess bias in selected articles. Second reviewers completed 10% of article screening and 20% of bias assessments. The findings were synthesized narratively. Results:Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria and demonstrated some improvements on indicators of mental health and well-being including quality of life, coping behaviors, anxiety, self-concept, and mood. However, replication across interventions and outcomes was absent. Overall, the quality of evidence of effectiveness in the studies reviewed was moderate/weak. This was due to bias in study design; other limitations included a lack of detail on intervention components, e.g., use of a manual, and single recruitment sites. Conclusions:The heterogeneity of existing research evaluating arts-based therapies for children with physical health LTCs limits conclusions about effectiveness. Suggestions are made to inform the design of future research studies to help build a robust evidence base.

AB  - Background: Certain nutrient supplements (nutraceuticals) may target neurobiological pathways perturbed in bipolar disorder (BD) such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nutraceuticals thus may have a potential role as adjunctive treatments for BD.
   Methods: A search of Embase via, PubMed via PubMed, Cumulated index to nursing and allied health literature (CINAHL) Complete via EBSCO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials viawas conducted to identify published randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of nutraceuticals on mood symptomatology in adults with BD. Search terms for BD, nutraceuticals, and clinical trials (total search terms = 75) were used to search from inception to February 20, 2020. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials was used to assess the risk of bias.
   Results: A total of 1,712 studies were identified through the search. After rigorous screening, 22 studies were included in the review. There was large variability across the studies with 15 different nutraceutical agents assessed and as such insufficient homogeneity for a meta-analysis to be conducted (I-2 > 50%). Studies revealed promising, albeit conflicting, evidence for omega-3 fatty acids and N-acetylcysteine. Isolated positive results were reported for coenzyme Q10.
   Conclusion: Given nutraceuticals are tolerable and accessible, they may be useful as potential adjunctive treatments for BD. Nutraceuticals targeting neuroinflammation or mitochondrial activity may have the most potential for the depressive phase. However, further studies are required to determine efficacy.

AB  - Background: Postpartum depression is one of the most common postpartum diseases, which has an important impact on the interaction between mother, infant, partner and family, as well as the long-term emotional and cognitive development of infants. However, there are still great disagreements on whether the delivery mode will affect the risk of postpartum depression. The purpose of this study is to explore whether the mode of delivery will affect the risk of postpartum depression through the comprehensive network meta-analysis of elective cesarean section, emergency cesarean section, instrumental vaginal delivery and spontaneous vaginal delivery. Methods: We searched in three electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library. Results: This paper included 43 studies with a total sample size of 1,827,456 participants. Direct meta-analysis showed that the odds ratio of postpartum depression risk was 1.33 (95% confidence interval = [1.21, 1.46]) between cesarean section and vaginal delivery. The odds ratios of high Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale score between cesarean section and vaginal delivery in the three postpartum periods (within 2 weeks, within half a year and over half a year) were basically the same. There was no difference between cesarean section and vaginal delivery in the risk of severe postpartum depression at the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale cut-off point > 13 (odds ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval = [0.99, 1.16]). Network meta-analysis showed that the risk of postpartum depression in the pairwise comparisons emergency cesarean section vs spontaneous vaginal delivery and elective cesarean section vs spontaneous vaginal delivery was odds ratio = 1.53 (95% confidence interval = [1.22, 1.91]) and 1.47 (95% confidence interval = [1.16, 1.86]). Conclusion: The mode of delivery has a significant effect on the occurrence of mild postpartum depression. Women who give birth by cesarean section, especially who give birth by emergency cesarean section, are at a higher risk of mild postpartum depression. We should carefully monitor the progress of postpartum mental disorders in women who delivered by cesarean section and make it possible for women to have a quick access to mental healthcare.

AB  - Our study systematically reviews articles about the prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among children and adolescents, aiming to evaluate its prevalence after earthquakes and floods.Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched for articles published from 1981 to 2019 containing information on PTSD prevalence among survivors of earthquakes and floods. Articles with insufficient data on the prevalence of PTSD or without any available full-text were excluded. Major study variables consist of the prevalence of PTSD of the included studies, gender, and the elapsed time after the disaster. The overall PTSD prevalence was determined using a fixed-effect model for eligible studies. Of 4107 studies listed using our search strategy, 439 underwent full-text review, 59 records included in the systematic review, and 39 records met the criteria for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of PTSD among children and adolescent survivors after earthquakes and floods was 19.2% (95%CI = 18.6-19.7%), 30.0% (95%CI = 29.5-30.6%), 24.4% (95%CI = 23.4-25.4%) and 20.4% (95%CI = 19.1-21.7%), in the first, second, third and fourth six-month intervals after the disaster, respectively. Our analysis also revealed that PTSD was more prevalent among girls(p < 0.001). The absence of psychological support for affected areas considerably increases the risk of PTSD among survivors. Our results indicated that children and adolescents, especially girls, are more vulnerable and should be in top priority. The governments should refine their policies on post-disaster services and run early screening, immediate intervention, and ongoing monitoring for PTSD, as well as mental and emotional supports.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anxiety disorders constitute a leading cause of disability worldwide. The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize the top 50 most frequently cited publications in the field of anxiety disorder research.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The Clarivate Analytics Web of Science citation indexing service was searched for articles published from 1900 and onward concerning anxiety disorders. After implementation of a two-step inclusion and exclusion criteria, the 50 mostly highly cited articles were analyzed according to the number of citations, publication year, first author, journal, country of origin, research institution, and topic.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The 50 most highly cited articles were published from the years 1953 to 2010 with the greatest number of articles being published during the 1990s decade. The number of citations ranged from 756 for the 50th most cited paper to 17,585 for the most cited paper. Journals with the most publications included Behavior Research and Therapy, Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, Science, and Journal of Psychosomatic Research. Article topics included diagnostic and screening tools research, basic and translational research, anxiety modeling, treatment, epidemiology, imaging, and other topics.
   CONCLUSIONS. This study identifies the top 50 most cited studies in the field of anxiety disorder research and recognizes the individuals who have made impactful changes that have shaped the modern approach of diagnosis, basic science knowledge, and the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders.

AB  - Objectives: Rates of psychiatric disorders are considerably elevated in young people with long term physical health conditions. Currently few children obtain effective mental health treatments in the context of long term physical health conditions, and ways to improve access to evidence-based mental health interventions are urgently needed. One approach is to deploy briefer, more economical, yet still evidence-based, treatments. The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of brief interventions targeting psychiatric disorders in children and young people with long term physical health conditions.
   Methods: Predefined terms relating to brief psychological interventions for psychiatric disorders in children with long term physical health conditions were used to search relevant databases. A systematic review and meta analysis was carried out in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted the data and conducted risk of bias assessments.
   Results: A total of 12 randomised controlled trials were found to meet the inclusion criteria of the review. Of those, three studies were suitable for meta-analysis. A large effect size in favour of brief cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety was found (g = - 0.95, CI-1.49 to -0.041; p < .001) with non-significant moderatesubstantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 58%; p = .09).
   Conclusion: This review suggests there is preliminary evidence that brief interventions, based on cognitive behavioural principles, may benefit young people with an anxiety disorder in the context of a long term physical health condition. There was insufficient evidence to assess whether this held true for depression and disruptive behaviour. Superscript/Subscript Available

AB  - Background Exposure to conflict, violence and forced displacement can increase poor mental health among affected populations. Our aim was to examine evidence on the burden of mental disorders and access to and effectiveness of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services in Syria and among Syrian refugees in neighboring countries.
   Methods A systematic review was done following systematic review criteria. Twelve bibliographic databases and additional gray literature sources were searched for quantitative and qualitative studies. Descriptive analysis and quality assessment were conducted.
   Results Twenty-eight eligible studies were identified, of which two were with conflict-affected populations within Syria. Levels of post-traumatic stress disorder ranged from 16 to 84%, depression from 11 to 49%, and anxiety disorder from 49 to 55%. Common risk factors were exposures to trauma and having a personal or family history of mental disorder. Financial and socio-cultural barriers were identified as the main obstacles to accessing MHPSS care. Evaluations of MHPSS services, albeit from predominantly nonrandomised designs, reported positive treatment outcomes.
   Conclusions The MHPSS burden was high, but with considerable variation between studies. There are key evidence gaps on: MHPSS burden and interventions-particularly for those living within Syria; access and barriers to care; and implementation and evaluation of MHPSS interventions.

AB  - Aim of the study: The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of a third wave CBT group intervention for the management of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia.
   Method: 38 patients with schizophrenia presenting with auditory hallucinations, followed in mental health services, participated in six sessions of a group based on acceptance and engagement therapy (ACT). The study followed a repeated single case experimental design (type A-B-A) based on the principle of a control phase followed by an intervention phase and a follow-up phase of similar duration. The various measurements were administered during the control phase, at pre-/postgroup and six weeks after the last group session.
   Results: The results show a significant decrease in auditory hallucinations, as measured by the PSYRATS scale, during the treatment and follow-up phase, compared to the control phase. In addition, the participants saw significant reductions in depressive and anxious symptomatology (assessed with CDSS and SEAS), and increases in coping and acceptance in regards to voices (assessed using a study scale and VAAS). The level of Malevolence beliefs about voices (measured with BAVQ-R) also decreased significantly.
   Conclusions: A brief group intervention based acceptance show promise in the reduction of the intensity of auditory hallucinations, depression and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia, while improving their acceptance.

AB  - Diet is an environmental factor with significant potential to affect the brain and behavior in both positive and negative ways. Work in animals is necessary to understand this relationship and how it may apply to mental health in humans. One area which has been investigated extensively is whether diet, specifically a high fat diet (HFD), can alter behavior in tasks, such as the forced swim test (FST) that assess stress coping. Therefore, we sought to analyze the literature regarding the effect of HFD on performance in the FST to determine whether there was a consistent effect of HFD on stress coping behavior. We conducted a Google Scholar search of English-language articles with the following terms: high fat diet, obesity, forced swim test, depression like behavior, mouse. Thirty studies from twenty-five publications are included in this survey. Fifteen studies were found where HFD had no effect on FST, 4 where HFD decreased immobility, and 11 where HFD increased immobility. Experimental details in these studies varied widely, including differences in the diet, mice, and experimental design. Additionally, we analyzed thirteen studies that performed the tail-suspension test (TST) after HFD, with six studies finding no change due to HFD and 7 reporting that HFD increased immobility. Further, 6 of these studies used both FST and TST with largely similar results in the two tasks, indicating concordance between the two tests of stress-coping behavior. We conclude that due to widely varying experimental details across studies no consistent effect of high fat diet on stress coping behavior can be determined at this point.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused enormous psychological impact worldwide. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures. In conclusion, psychological interventions targeting high-risk populations with heavy psychological distress are in urgent need.

AB  - Introduction: Mental health concerns and treatment usually take a backseat when the limited resources are geared for pandemic containment. In this global humanitarian crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues have been reported from all over the world. Objectives: In this study, we attempt to review the prevailing mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic through global experiences, and reactive strategies established in mental health care with special reference to the Indian context. By performing a rapid synthesis of available evidence, we aim to propose a conceptual and recommendation framework for mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A search of the PubMed electronic database and google scholar were undertaken using the search terms 'novel coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'nCoV', SARS-CoV-2, 'mental health', 'psychiatry', 'psychology', 'anxiety', 'depression' and 'stress' in various permutations and combinations. Published journals, magazines and newspaper articles, official webpages and independent websites of various institutions and non-government organizations, verified social media portals were compiled.
   Results: The major mental health issues reported were stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. Children and older people, frontline workers, people with existing mental health illnesses were among the vulnerable in this context. COVID-19 related suicides have also been increasingly common. Globally, measures have been taken to address mental health issues through the use of guidelines and intervention strategies. The role of social media has also been immense in this context. State-specific intervention strategies, telepsychiatry consultations, toll free number specific for psychological and behavioral issues have been issued by the Government of India.
   Conclusion: Keeping a positive approach, developing vulnerable-group-specific need-based interventions with proper risk communication strategies and keeping at par with the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 would be instrumental in guiding the planning and prioritization of mental health care resources to serve the most vulnerable.

AB  - We had discussed earlier that, after most of the primary author's multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms were lessened by prior neuroimmune therapies, use of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) gradually subdued his asthma and urticaria symptoms, as well as his MS-related intercostal cramping; and bupropion supplemented with S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and vitamin D-3 (vit-D3) helped remit major depression (MD). Furthermore, the same cocktail (bupropion plus supplements), along with previously discussed routines (yoga, meditation, physical exercises, and timely use of medications for other illnesses), continued to subdue MD during new difficulties with craniopharyngioma, which caused bitemporal vision loss; sphenoid sinus infections, which caused cranial nerve-VI (CN6) palsy and diplopia; and through their treatments. Impressed with the benefit the four compounds provided, in this manuscript, we focus on explaining current neuroimmune literature proposals on how: (1) DMF impedes inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death in CNS and peripheral tissues; (2) Bupropion curbs anxiety, MD, and enhances alertness, libido, and moods; (3) SAMe silences oxidative stress and depression by multiple mechanisms; and (4) Vit-D3 helps brain development and functioning and subdues inflammation. We realize that herein we have reviewed proposed mechanisms of remedies we discovered by literature searches and physician assisted auto-experimentation; and our methods might not work with other patients. We present our experiences so readers are heartened to reflect upon their own observations in peer-reviewed forums and make available a wide body of information for the chronically ill and their physicians to benefit from.

AB  - Background:This systematic review analyzed the relationship between alexithymia, considered as the inability to recognize and express thoughts and emotions, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), one of the most common chronic illness, characterized by a metabolic disorder burdened by high morbidity and mortality worldwide due to its outcomes. Methods:PRISMA guidelines were followed throughout this systematic review of the recent literature indexed in the databases PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science. Search terms for eligible studies were: "Type 2 diabetes" OR "T2DM" AND "Toronto Alexithymia Scale" OR "TAS-20"[All Fields]. Results:The initial search identified 61 indexed scientific publications. After screening we found that seven publications met the established scientific inclusion and exclusion criteria. It emerged that alexithymic patients ranged from 25 to 50% across the examined publications and it appeared that patients with T2DM generally reflected greater values of alexithymia, revealing particular differences among TAS domains. Moreover, emlpoyed participants were alexithymic to a greater extent compared to non-working participants (77.8 vs. 35.4%) and alexithymia was 2.63 times more severe among working participants when examining predictors of alexithymia. When evaluating the correlations between alexithymia and HbA1c or fasting blood glucose levels we found strong associations equal to 0.75 and 0.77 for TAS-20 total scores, respectively. While alexithymic participants showed significantly higher levels of HbA1c and blood glucose when compared to the non-alexithymic participants. Conclusions:The results of this systematic review of the current literature highlight the need of alexithymia evaluation in patients with T2DM. The high prevalence in T2DM and strong associations with poorly regulated diabetes and psychological distress, indicate a significant relationship between poor glycemic control and psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression, and quality of life. Further studies are needed focusing on age and gender differences in order to be able to improve clinical psychological care and prevention.

AB  - To synthesize literature addressing maternal distress and associated variables in response to infant hospitalization in the NICU. CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, PsychINFO, and Scopus were searched for studies addressing maternal distress during NICU hospitalization published between January 2009 and August 2019. The initial literature search yielded 862 articles. Articles were included for analysis if (a) they were peer-reviewed, (b) maternal distress was defined or measured, and (c) maternal distress occurred in the NICU. Ultimately, 33 articles were included for analysis. Distress symptoms were not consistently measured across the literature by one specific instrument. However, despite the variety of instruments, distress was prevalent in this population. Individual elements of maternal distress in the NICU include depression, anxiety, trauma, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. These elements often occur together and tend to follow a specific trajectory during hospitalization. This body of literature was inconsistent regarding the timing of distress measurement as well as the relationship between relevant associated variables (e.g., marital status or infant illness severity) and maternal distress. Additionally, researchers often excluded mothers of non-preterm infants and infants with congenital anomalies from investigation. Researchers and clinicians should carefully consider timing and instrumentation in their interpretations of maternal distress measurement during a NICU hospitalization. Future work should focus on developing a comprehensive, valid, and reliable screening tool for clinicians and researchers to use to identify maternal distress in the NICU. Additionally, future research should address gaps in the populations included in studies.

AB  - Objective Meditation techniques are widely used as therapy and wellbeing practices, but there are growing concerns about its potential for harm. The aim of the present study is to systematically review meditation adverse events (MAEs), investigating its major clinical categories and its prevalence. Method We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Embase and AMED up to October 2019. Eligible studies included original reports of meditation practices (excluding related physical practices such as Yoga postures) with adult samples across experimental, observational and case studies. We identified a total of 6742 citations, 83 of which met the inclusion criteria for MAEs with a total of 6703 participants who undertook meditation practice. Results Of the 83 studies analysed, 55 (65%) included reports of at least one type of MAE. The total prevalence of adverse events was 8.3% (95% CI 0.05-0.12), though this varied considerably across types of studies - 3.7% (95% CI 0.02-0.05) for experimental and 33.2% (95% CI 0.25-0.41) for observational studies. The most common AEs were anxiety (33%, 18), depression (27%, 15) and cognitive anomalies (25%, 14); gastrointestinal problems and suicidal behaviours (both 11%, 6) were the least frequent. Conclusion We found that the occurrence of AEs during or after meditation practices is not uncommon, and may occur in individuals with no previous history of mental health problems. These results are relevant both for practitioners and clinicians, and contribute to a balanced perspective of meditation as a practice that may lead to both positive and negative outcomes.

AB  - Background:Given the role of alexithymia-as the inability to identify, differentiate, and express emotions-in chronic and immune-mediated illness, this systematic review analyzed the prevalence of alexithymia in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), mainly represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods:Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed throughout this systematic review of the literature published between 2015 and 2020 in indexed sources from PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Search terms for eligible studies were: "Inflammatory bowel disease" AND "Alexithymia" [Titles, Abstract, Keywords]. Inclusion criteria were: articles written and published in English from 2015 and up to April 2020, reporting relevant and empirical data on alexithymia and IBD. Results:The initial search identified 34 indexed scientific publications. After screening, we found that five publications met the established scientific inclusion criteria. Overall, the mean value of alexithymia ranged from 39 to 53.2 [Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) score], thus mostly falling in non-clinical range for alexithymia (<= 51). Comparisons of alexithymia between patients with UC and CD highlighted that patients with CD showed externally oriented thinking and difficulties identifying feelings to a greater extent. Regarding comparisons with other samples or pathologies, patients with IBD were more alexithymic than healthy controls and less alexithymic than patients with major depressive disorder, but no difference was found when compared with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Then, regarding correlations with other variables, alexithymia was positively associated with anxiety and depression, as well as with psychopathological symptoms and somatic complaints. Conclusion:This systematic review suggests that patients with IBD cannot be generally considered alexithymic at a clinically relevant extent. However, their greater alexithymic levels and its associations with psychological variables and somatic distress may suggest a reactivity hypothesis, in which living with IBD may progressively lead to impaired emotion recognition over time. Specifically, the relationship between IBD and IBS should be further explored, paying deeper attention to the clinical psychological functioning of CD, as IBD requires more emotional challenges to patients.

AB  - Esketamine was recently licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Drug Agency (EDA) for use in treatment resistant depression (TRD), and further research indicates ketamine as a possible treatment in other mental health conditions. While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, it has been hypothesised that ketamine's acute psychoactive effects may be associated with psychiatric treatment efficacy. We systematically reviewed the evidence for this association. The databases Medline, Embase and Psychlnfo were searched up to June 2019. Studies were included if they enrolled adults with a psychiatric diagnosis, assessed acute psychoactive effects using a quantitative measure, and reported on the relationship between acute effects and treatment outcome. We included 21 studies, involving 891 patients. Seventeen studies assessed patients with depression (TRD [k = 14]), three assessed substance use disorders, and one assessed social anxiety disorder. Overall, 41 associations were assessed, of which 26 % were significant. The studies reviewed displayed great variability in terms of methodology and quality of reporting. The most commonly assessed effect was dissociation, measured by the CADSS. Our results suggest that the CADSS total is not consistently associated with antidepressant outcomes. Apart from this, the current literature is too limited to draw definite conclusions on the presence of an association between acute psychoactive effects and mental health outcomes. The field would benefit from consistently employing a priori hypotheses, more transparent reporting and sufficiently powered statistical analyses. Furthermore, the use of a broader range of assessments tools of acute psychoactive effects during ketamine administration would be beneficial.

AB  - BackgroundEpidemics or pandemics, such as the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, pose unique challenges to healthcare professionals (HCPs). Caring for patients during an epidemic/pandemic may impact negatively on the mental health of HCPs. There is a lack of evidence-based advice on what would be effective in mitigating this impact. Objectives: This rapid review synthesizes the evidence on the psychological impact of pandemics/epidemics on the mental health of HCPs, what factors predict this impact, and the evidence of prevention/intervention strategies to reduce this impact.MethodAccording to rapid review guidelines, systematic searches were carried out in Embase.com, PubMed, APA PsycINFO-Ovid SP, and Web of Science (core collection). Searches were restricted to the years 2003 or later to ensure inclusion of the most recent epidemic/pandemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Papers written in French or English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and of quantitative design using validated measures of mental health outcomes were included. Of 1308 papers found, 50 were included. The full protocol for this rapid review was registered with Prospero (reg.no. CRD42020175985).ResultsResults show that exposed HCPs working with patients during an epidemic/pandemic are at heightened risk of mental health problems in the short and longer term, particularly: psychological distress, insomnia, alcohol/drug misuse, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, burnout, anger, and higher perceived stress. These mental health problems are predicted by organizational, social, personal, and psychological factors and may interfere with the quality of patient care. Few evidence-based early interventions exist so far.DiscussionHCPs need to be provided with psychosocial support to protect their mental wellbeing if they are to continue to provide high quality patient care. Several recommendations relevant during and after an epidemic/pandemic, such as COVID-19, and in preparation for a future outbreak, are proposed.

AB  - Problem Identification Approximately 2.8 million Americans care for an individual with cancer. Because the literature typically describes caregiving experiences within patient age-groups (e.g., pediatrics, geriatrics), the purpose of this narrative review was to describe common and unique burdens and distress among caregivers of cancer-patients of different ages. Literature Search We identified representative peer-reviewed manuscripts related to caregivers of pediatric, adolescent, young-, middle-, and late-adult oncology patients. We combined search terms "caregiver" and "cancer" with "burden," "distress," and/or age-related terms ("pediatric" or "geriatric"). Included studies focused on factors of caregiver-burden and distress. Data Evaluation/Synthesis Universal cancer-caregiving experiences include negative impacts on work-productivity, finances, social-/family-dynamics, and physical/emotional health. Age-related life experiences shape outcomes; pediatric caregivers may have fewer financial resources, whereas concurrent comorbidities create challenges for geriatric caregivers. Conclusions Caregiving for cancer patients has universal, shared, and patient age-specific burdens. Implications for Practice Supportive care based on patient-age may improve caregiver well-being.

AB  - Background:Interoception and heart rate variability have been found to predict outcomes of mental health and well-being. However, these have usually been investigated independently of one another. Objectives:This systematic review aimed to explore a key gap in the current literature, that being, identifying whether HRV and interoception predict emotional regulation outcomes and strategies. Methods:The process of article retrieval and selection followed the PRISMA guidelines. Databases PsychINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, and MEDLINE were scanned for papers published. Preliminary inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified following the PICO framework, whilst the CHARMS framework was used to help formulate the research question, and critically assess for bias. Results:Two hundred and thirty-seven studies were identified after initial database searches. Of these, eight studies were included in the final selection. Six studies explored the associations between HRV and ER, whilst three investigated the associations between interoception and ER (one study included both). Results show that greater HRV and interoception are associated with better ER. Specifically, high parasympathetic activity largely predicted the use of adaptive ER strategies such as reappraisal, and better acceptance of emotions. High interoception, instead, was predictive of effective downregulation of negative emotions and handling of social uncertainty, there was no association with any specific ER strategy. Conclusions:Awareness of one's own bodily feelings and vagal activation seem to be of central importance for the effective regulation of emotional responses. However, one limitation is the small sample of studies found, thus more studies in this area are needed in the future.

AB  - We sought evidence on quantifiable offspring outcomes, including problems, needs and strengths, associated with their experience of major parental psychiatric disorder(s), focusing on schizophrenia, affective illnesses and personality disorder(s). We were motivated by the absence of any systematic exploration of the needs of offspring of parents in secure hospitals. Seven electronic databases were searched to identify systematic reviews of studies quantifying offspring outcomes when a parent, or parent surrogate, has major psychiatric disorder(s). Our search (updated in February 2018) identified seven high-quality reviews, which incorporated 291 unique papers, published in 1974-2017. The weight of evidence is of increased risk of poor offspring outcomes, including psychiatric disorder and/or behavioural, emotional, cognitive or social difficulties. No review explored child strengths. Potential moderators and mediators examined included aspects of parental disorder (eg, severity), parent and child gender and age, parenting behaviours, and family functioning. This clinical review is the first review of systematic reviews to focus on quantifiable offspring problems, needs or strengths when a parent has major psychiatric disorder(s). It narratively synthesises findings, emphasising the increased risk of offspring problems, while highlighting limits to what is known, especially the extent to which any increased risk of childhood problems endures and the extent to which aspects of parental disorder moderate offspring outcomes. The absence of the reviews' consideration of child strengths and protective factors limits opportunity to enhance offspring resilience.

AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a potentially effective supplement for the treatment of insomnia; however, there is no comprehensive review of its mental health effects among insomnia patients. This study aimed to synthesize relevant quantitative evidence and evaluate MBSR application and effectiveness for insomnia patients' sleep quality and mental health.
   Methods: A systematic search through eight databases from the earliest available dates until August 2019 was conducted. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of MBSR on sleep quality, anxiety, and depression as outcome measures among insomnia patients comprising patients aged above 18 years were included in this meta-analysis. Each study's quality was assessed using the modified Jadad quality scale. The Review Manager 5.3 software was used to calculate the standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the data analyses.
   Results: In total, data for 497 patients in seven randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The results revealed that compared to the control group, the MBSR group significantly improved in sleep quality (SMD = -0.69, 95% CI: -1.12 similar to - 0.26, Z = 3.16, p = .002), depression (SMD = -1.83, 95% CI: -2.81-0.84, Z = 3.63, p < .001), and anxiety (SMD = -1.74, 95% CI: -2.90-0.59, Z = 2.96, p = .003). A sensitivity analysis was undertaken. After carefully reviewing included trials, we can reasonably conclude that these heterogeneities did not impair the overall effect size of MBSR in the results.
   Conclusions: MBSR significantly improved sleep quality and mental health. Future research is needed using standardized methods examining the long-term effects of MBSR on the mental health of individuals with insomnia.

AB  - Objective Several lines of evidence support a relationship between circadian rhythms disruption in the onset, course, and maintenance of mental disorders. Despite the study of circadian phenotypes promising a decent understanding of the pathophysiologic or etiologic mechanisms of psychiatric entities, several questions still need to be addressed. In this review, we aimed to synthesize the literature investigating chronobiologic theories and their associations with psychiatric entities.
   Methods The Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and Scopus databases were comprehensively and systematically searched and articles published between January 1990 and October 2019 were reviewed. Different combinations of the relevant keywords were polled. We first introduced molecular elements and mechanisms of the circadian system to promote a better understanding of the chronobiologic implications of mental disorders. Then, we comprehensively and systematically reviewed circadian system studies in mood disorders, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders.
   Results Although subject characteristics and study designs vary across studies, current research has demonstrated that circadian pathologies, including genetic and neurohumoral alterations, represent the neural substrates of the pathophysiology of many psychiatric disorders. Impaired HPA-axis function-related glucocorticoid rhythm and disrupted melatonin homeostasis have been prominently demonstrated in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, while alterations of molecular expressions of circadian rhythm genes including CLOCK, PER, and CRY have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders.
   Conclusion Further translational work is needed to identify the causal relationship between circadian physiology abnormalities and mental disorders and related psychopathology, and to develop sound pharmacologic interventions.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16-28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.

AB  - Socially Assistive Robots are promising in their potential to promote and support mental health in children. There is a growing number of studies investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of robot interventions in supporting children's mental wellbeing. Although preliminary evidence suggests that Socially Assistive Robots may have the potential to help address concerns such as stress and anxiety in children, there is a need for a greater focus in examining the impact of robotic interventions in this population. In order to better understand the current state of the evidence in this field and identify critical gaps, we carried out a scoping review of the available literature examining how social robots are investigated as means to support mental health in children. We identified existing types of robot intervention and measures that are being used to investigate specific mental health outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest that robot interventions for children may positively impact mental health outcomes such as relief of distress and increase positive affect. Results also show that the strength of evidence needs to be improved to determine what types of robotic interventions could be most effective and readily implemented in pediatric mental health care. Based on our findings, we propose a set of recommendations to guide further research in this area.

AB  - Multicomponent positive psychology interventions are increasing in the general population but the study of its effectiveness in adolescents is still scarce, especially in the school context. Previous meta-analyses have reported that multicomponent positive psychology interventions increase well-being and reduce distress outcomes. However, the results on these outcomes limit their samples to adult populations. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate and compare the immediate but also long-lasting effects of school-based multicomponent positive psychology interventions aimed at increasing well-being indicators of mental health (i.e., subjective and psychological well-being) and reducing the most common psychological distress indicators (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) in adolescents. A total of 9 randomized and non-randomized controlled trials from the searched literature met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The results showed small effects for subjective well-being (g = 0.24), psychological well-being (g = 0.25), and depression symptoms (g = 0.28). Removing low-quality studies led to a slight decrease in the effect sizes for subjective well-being and a considerable increase for psychological well-being and depression symptoms. The relevant moderation analyses had an effect on subjective well-being and depression symptoms. The present systematic review and meta-analysis found evidence for the efficacy of school-based multicomponent positive psychology interventions in improving mental health in the short and long-term. Small effects for subjective well-being, psychological well-being, and depression symptoms were identified. Effects for psychological well-being and depression symptoms remained significant over time. In light of our results, education policy-makers and practitioners are encouraged to include positive practices within the schools' curriculum as effective and easily implemented tools that help to enhance adolescents' mental health. Further research is needed in order to strengthen the findings about school-based multicomponent positive psychology interventions in adolescents.

AB  - Background:This article aims to review research manuscripts in the past 5 years that focus on the effects of debt on depression, anxiety, stress, or suicide ideation in Asian countries. Methods:A search for literature based on the PRISMA guidelines was conducted on Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect, resulting in nine manuscripts meeting inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in Thailand, Korea, Singapore, Pakistan, India, Cambodia, and China. Results:The findings of the studies show that there is evidence to support that being in debt is related to Asian participants experiencing depression, anxiety, stress, or suicide ideation. However, the studies are limited to quantitative studies only. The definition of debt is also unclear in most manuscripts. Few manuscripts also examined how other factors influence the relationship between debt and mental illness. Conclusion:There are limited studies on the psychological effects of debt on the Asian population. Future studies should focus on the relationship between debt and psychological well-being among this population.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be serious partly due to the challenges of assessing and treating its neurocognitive and affective sequelae. The effects of a single TBI may persist for years and can limit patients' activities due to somatic complaints (headaches, vertigo, sleep disturbances, nausea, light or sound sensitivity), affective sequelae (post-traumatic depressive symptoms, anxiety, irritability, emotional instability) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, including social cognition disturbances, attention deficits, information processing speed decreases, memory degradation and executive dysfunction). Despite a growing amount of research, study comparison and knowledge synthesis in this field are problematic due to TBI heterogeneity and factors like injury mechanism, age at or time since injury. The relative lack of standardization in neuropsychological assessment strategies for quantifying sequelae adds to these challenges, and the proper administration of neuropsychological testing relative to the relationship between TBI, MCI and neuroimaging has not been reviewed satisfactorily. Social cognition impairments after TBI (e.g., disturbed emotion recognition, theory of mind impairment, altered self-awareness) and their neuroimaging correlates have not been explored thoroughly. This review consolidates recent findings on the cognitive and affective consequences of TBI in relation to neuropsychological testing strategies, to neurobiological and neuroimaging correlates, and to patient age at and assessment time after injury. All cognitive domains recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) are reviewed, including social cognition, complex attention, learning and memory, executive function, language and perceptual-motor function. Affect and effort are additionally discussed owing to their relationships to cognition and to their potentially confounding effects. Our findings highlight non-negligible cognitive and affective impairments following TBI, their gravity often increasing with injury severity. Future research should study (A) language, executive and perceptual-motor function (whose evolution post-TBI remains under-explored), (B) the effects of age at and time since injury, and (C) cognitive impairment severity as a function of injury severity. Such efforts should aim to develop and standardize batteries for cognitive subdomains-rather than only domains-with high ecological validity. Additionally, they should utilize multivariate techniques like factor analysis and related methods to clarify which cognitive subdomains or components are indeed measured by standardized tests.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on public mental health. Therefore, monitoring and oversight of the population mental health during crises such as a panedmic is an immediate priority. The aim of this study is to analyze the existing research works and findings in relation to the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method In this systematic review and meta-analysis, articles that have focused on stress and anxiety prevalence among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in the Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases, without a lower time limit and until May 2020. In order to perform a meta-analysis of the collected studies, the random effects model was used, and the heterogeneity of studies was investigated using the I(2)index. Moreover. data analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. Results The prevalence of stress in 5 studies with a total sample size of 9074 is obtained as 29.6% (95% confidence limit: 24.3-35.4), the prevalence of anxiety in 17 studies with a sample size of 63,439 as 31.9% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-36.7), and the prevalence of depression in 14 studies with a sample size of 44,531 people as 33.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-40.6). Conclusion COVID-19 not only causes physical health concerns but also results in a number of psychological disorders. The spread of the new coronavirus can impact the mental health of people in different communities. Thus, it is essential to preserve the mental health of individuals and to develop psychological interventions that can improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review was to describe psychiatric presentations observed among Takotsubo syndrome (TS) patients, how psychiatric conditions and associated treatments impact TS events, and how psychiatric conditions are managed alongside TS medical treatment and follow-up. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Web of Science between 1990 and 2019 for case reports of TS with comorbid psychiatric conditions, behaviors, or substance use. Results: Of 2403 records, we included 243 records comprising 252 total cases. Common psychiatric conditions included depression (n = 98; 39%), anxiety (n = 44, 17%), alcohol use (n = 35, 14%), suicidality (n = 30, 12%), and severe mental illness (n = 25, 10%). Psychiatric conditions were frequently associated with triggering TS events (61%). Less than one-third of cases reported providing psychiatric care during hospitalization (n = 80, 32%). Only 33 cases (13%) described psychiatric functioning at follow-up. All case studies were assessed to be of low quality; patterns of reporting bias were observed. Conclusions: Despite heterogeneous psychiatric presentations among TS patients, psychiatric treatment was rarely incorporated into the medical care or addressed at follow-up. This gap may be better attended to by integrating psychiatrists and psychologists into the multidisciplinary treatment team. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019119998.

AB  - Culture, tradition, structural violence, and mental health-related stigma play a major role in global mental health for refugees. Our aim was to understand what factors determine the success or failure of community-based psychotherapy for trauma-affected refugees and discuss implications for primary health care programs. Using a systematic realist-informed approach, we searched five databases from 2000 to 2018. Two reviewers independently selected RCTs for inclusion, and we contacted authors to obtain therapy training manuals. Fifteen articles and 11 training manuals met our inclusion criteria. Factors that improved symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD included providing culturally adapted care in a migrant-sensitive setting, giving a role to other clinical staff (task-shifting), and intervention intensity. Precarious asylum status, constraining program monitoring requirements, and diverse socio-cultural and gender needs within a setting may reduce the effectiveness of the program. Primary care programs may enable community based mental health care and may reduce mental health-related stigma for refugees and other migrants. More research is needed on the cultural constructs of distress, programs delivered in primary care, and the role of cultural and language interpretation services in mental health care.

AB  - Background Mood disorders, i.e. major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorders, are leading sources of disability worldwide. Currently available treatments do not yield remission in approximately a third of patients with a mood disorder. This is in part because these treatments do not target a specific core pathology underlying these heterogeneous disorders. In recent years, abnormal inflammatory processes have been identified as putative pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment targets in mood disorders, particularly among individuals with treatment-resistant conditions. Aims In this selective review, we aimed to summarise recent advances in the field of immunopsychiatry, including emerging pathophysiological models and findings from treatment ttrials of immunomodulatory agents for both MDD and bipolar disorders. Method We performed a literature review by searching Medline for clinical trials of immunomodulating agents as monotherapy or adjunctive treatments in MDD and bipolar disorders. Included studies are randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs or cross-over trials of immunomodulating agents that had an active comparator or a placebo-arm. Results Current evidence shows an association between inflammation and mood symptoms. However, there is conflicting evidence on whether this link is causal. Conclusions Future studies should focus on identifying specific neurobiological underpinnings for the putative causal association between an activated inflammatory response and mood disorders. Results of these studies are needed before further treatment trials of immunomodulatory agents can be justified.

AB  - Effortful control (EC) or self-regulation refers to the ability to regulate behavior, emotion, and cognition. It has been identified as a contributor to both adaptive and adverse outcomes in children, adolescents, and adults and this across many domains. As such, it could be considered as a transdiagnostic dimension underlying internalizing (e.g., mood and anxiety disorders) and externalizing (e.g., substance use disorders, ADHD) psychopathology. We aimed to examine the role of EC throughout the adult psychopathological spectrum by means of a literature search of studies published between 2008 and 2018. Overall, the results point to the role of EC in the development of a broad spectrum of psychiatric diagnosis, reflecting the transdiagnostic characteristic of this construct. This role may be both directly causal or as a mediator factor influencing outcomes of a specific disorder. Early assessment of EC and early interventions to improve EC might help to avoid or decrease the risk of developing psychopathology.

AB  - Background: Anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) contribute significantly to disability adjusted life years in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). Screening has been proposed to improve identification and management of these disorders, but little is known about the validity of screening tools for these disorders. We conducted a systematic review of validated screening tools for detecting anxiety and PTSD in LMICs.
   Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and PsychINFO were searched (inception-April 22, 2020). Eligible studies (1) screened for anxiety disorders and/or PTSD; (2) reported sensitivity and specificity for a given cut-off value; (3) were conducted in LMICs; and (4) compared screening results to diagnostic classifications based on a reference standard. Screening tool, cut-off, disorder, region, country, and clinical population were extracted for each study, and we assessed study quality. Accuracy results were organized based on screening tool, cut-off, and specific disorder. Accuracy estimates for the same cut-off for the same screening tool and disorder were combined via meta-analysis.
   Results: Of 6322 unique citations identified, 58 articles including 77 screening tools were included. There were 46, 19 and 12 validations for anxiety, PTSD, and combined depression and anxiety, respectively. Continentally, Asia had the most validations (35). Regionally, South Asia (11) had the most validations, followed by South Africa (10) and West Asia (9). The Kessler-10 (7) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7) (6) were the most commonly validated tools for anxiety disorders, while the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (3) and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (3) were the most commonly validated tools for PTSD. Most studies (29) had the lowest quality rating (unblinded). Due to incomplete reporting, we could meta-analyze results from only two studies, which involved the GAD-7 (cut-off >= 10, pooled sensitivity = 76%, pooled specificity = 64%).
   Conclusion: Use of brief screening instruments can bring much needed attention and research opportunities to various at-risk LMIC populations. However, many have been validated in inadequately designed studies, precluding any general recommendation for specific tools in LMICs. Locally validated screening tools for anxiety and PTSD need further evaluation in well-designed studies to assess whether they can improve the detection and management of these common disorders.

AB  - Background There is increasing interest in digital technologies to help improve children and young people's mental health, and the evidence for the effectiveness for these approaches is rising. However, there is concern regarding levels of user engagement, uptake and adherence. Key guidance regarding digital health interventions stress the importance of early user input in the development, evaluation and implementation of technologies to help ensure they are engaging, feasible, acceptable and potentially effective. Co-design is a process of active involvement of stakeholders, requiring a change from the traditional approaches to intervention development. However, there is a lack of literature to inform the co-design of digital technologies to help child and adolescent mental health. Methods We reviewed the literature and practice in the co-design of digital mental health technologies with children and young people. We searched Medline, PsycInfo and Web of Science databases, guidelines, reviews and reference lists, contacted key authors for relevant studies, and extracted key themes on aspects of co-design relevant to practice. We supplemented this with case studies and methods reported by researchers working in the field. Results We identified 25 original articles and 30 digital mental health technologies that were designed/developed with children and young people. The themes identified were as follows: principles of co-design (including potential stakeholders and stages of involvement), methods of involving and engaging the range of users, co-designing the prototype and the challenges of co-design. Conclusions Co-design involves all relevant stakeholders throughout the life and research cycle of the programme. This review helps to inform practitioners and researchers interested in the development of digital health technologies for children and young people. Future work in this field will need to consider the changing face of technology, methods of engaging with the diversity in the user group, and the evaluation of the co-design process and its impact on the technology.

AB  - Understanding and improving the psychosocial adjustments (e.g., quality of life, depression) and treatment outcomes (e.g., adherence, beliefs about treatments) of people with mental disorders are major health issues. The self-regulation model (SRM) postulates that illness representations play a central role on adjustment and treatment of people with physical illnesses. Recently, the SRM has been used with people with mental disorders. However, the manifestations of somatic and psychiatric disorders can be very different. Therefore, the use of SRM in the field of mental health is very complex. This difficulty, as well as the growing interest for illness representations in the field of mental health, justifies the utility to conduct a review on this topic. The current review shows that illness representations are related to psychosocial adjustment and/or treatment outcomes for people with various mental disorders [e.g., psychotic disorders, mood disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]. However, some limitations to the applicability of SRM to mental disorders have been highlighted. These limitations should be considered in future studies.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been proposed to be associated with several mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, diminished sexual satisfaction, and lowered health-related quality of life, etc. A systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature was conducted comparing the mental health of women with and without PCOS. Ten English and Chinese databases were searched up to 12/31/2018. Random-effects models were introduced, and subgroup analysis, sensitivity test, and meta-regression were carried out to determine the source for heterogeneity among studies. Forty-six studies, including 30,989 participants (9265 women with PCOS and 25,638 controls), were qualified for review according to the inclusion criteria. Twenty-eight studies reported depression symptoms, 22 studies were on anxiety, 16 studies showed quality of life (QoL) status, 12 studies were about sexual dysfunction, five on emotional distress, four on binge eating, and four on somatization. Women with PCOS reported significantly higher depression (SMD = 0.64; 95% CI 0.50-0.78), anxiety (SMD = 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.77), lower QoL (SMD = - 0.55; 95% CI -0.69 to -0.40), and not significant sexual dysfunction (SMD = - 0.24; 95% CI - 0.49 to 0.01). Studies from different countries, adopting various diagnosis criteria, using diverse instruments, as well as in different years, have reported heterogenetic results. Women with PCOS in China reported a larger effect size of depression and anxiety than patients from other countries. The results of this study have indicated that women with PCOS suffer from depression, anxiety, and experience a lower quality of life, whereas their sexual function is not distinct from that of healthy women. Psychological health care interventions for women with PCOS were addressed.

AB  - Mental disorders are highly prevalent in eight South Asian countries, yet there is a gap of a synthesized overview of the prevalence of mental disorders in this region. This umbrella review aims to summarize the prevalence of mental disorders from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of South Asian studies. A systematic search of 11 major databases and additional sources was conducted until December 11, 2019. Articles were included if they were systematic reviews or meta-analyses, reported the prevalence of mental disorders, and reported primary studies conducted in South Asian countries only. Among 2591 citations, a total of 23 reviews met all the criteria of this umbrella review. The synthesized findings from those reviews suggest high prevalence rates for mental disorders, including depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, suicidal behavior and self-harm, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, dementia, and other mental health problems. Also, findings suggest a high burden of maternal depression, psychiatric comorbidities in chronic physical illnesses, and various mental disorders among children, elderly adults, refugees, and other vulnerable populations. Most studies were from India whereas evidence from Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives was limited. The findings of this review are constrained with heterogeneity in prevalence estimations, methodologies, sampling issues, and limitations in the existing literature, which should be addressed in future research. The evidence synthesized in this review provides national and regional overview of the prevalence of mental disorders, which may inform better policymaking and practice advancing mental health in South Asia.

AB  - The detrimental impact of early life adversities (ELAs; entailing pre- and postnatal experiences) on the developing brain has been well established. By inducing neural alterations underlying critical human socio-cognitive functions, ELAs may embed latent vulnerability to psychopathologies. However, single neuroimaging studies report conflicting results. Therefore, this coordinate-based meta-analysis aims to identify convergent functional alterations following ELAs. Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles (2001 to June 2019), retrieving 68 eligible studies containing 3685 unique participants. The activation likelihood estimation algorithm was used for analyses according to best-practice guidelines. Whereas pooled analyses did not yield any findings, further homogenizing the experiments revealed significant functional alterations in the left superior frontal gyrus in healthy subjects, left centromedial amygdala during emotion processing, left precuneus during memory processing and left centromedial amygdala and putamen when analyzing the impact of postnatal experiences. These results support the current consensus in the field of environmental imaging: ELAs might exert their effects through systematically altering critical neurocognitive systems and enhance one's vulnerability to future mental health problems.

AB  - Introduction: The spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic.
   Materials and methods: This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review.
   Results: Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW.
   Conclusion: Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.

AB  - Close to one million people commit suicide each year, with suicidal attempts being the main risk factor for suicide. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to achieve a greater understanding of suicidality in the general population of Europe by studying associated factors and their statistical significance with suicidality, as well as the effect of the temporal moment in which suicidality is observed in a relationship. A search strategy was carried out in electronic databases: Proquest's Psychology Database, Scopus, PsycINFO, Medline and Embase. Odds ratios (ORs), publication bias, influential studies on heterogeneity and analysis moderators were calculated. Twenty-six studies were included after meeting the inclusion criteria. Factors statistically associated with suicidality are female gender, age over 65 years, unemployment, low social support, adulthood adversity, childhood adversity, family history of mental disorder, any affective disorder, major depression, anxiety/stress/somatoform disorders, tobacco and substance use, any mental disorder and body mass index. As a limitation, a high heterogeneity between studies was found. Factors associated with suicidality in the general population are relevant for understanding the suicidal phenomenon. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO (CRD42017075190).

AB  - Background:
   Homelessness is a major problem that critically impacts the mental health and well-being of the affected individuals. This umbrella review aimed to evaluate the current evidence on the prevalence of mental disorders among homeless people from evidence-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
   Methods:
   We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for umbrella reviews. We searched 12 major databases and additional sources to identify systematically conducted reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of mental disorders among homeless populations.
   Results:
   We evaluated 1,277 citations and found 15 reviews meeting our criteria. Most studies were conducted among high-income countries with samples from different age groups. Studies reported high prevalence rates of depressive and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia spectrum and psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, suicidal behavior, bipolar and mood disorders, neurocognitive disorders and other mental disorders among homeless people. Moreover, studies also reported a high burden of co-occurring mental and physical health problems among the homeless experiencing mental disorders.
   Conclusion:
   This umbrella review synthesized the current evidence on the epidemiological burden of mental disorders in homelessness. This evidence necessitates advanced research to explore psychosocial and epidemiological correlates and adopt multipronged interventions to prevent, identify and treat mental disorders among homeless populations.

AB  - Background
   The association between infertility treatments and mental disorders has been poorly addressed. This work aims to review current evidence on the psychopathological effects of hormonal treatments used for infertility on women and the occurrence of newly diagnosed mood and psychotic disorders.
   Methods
   A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov databases from inception until September 2019. Clinical trials on hormone treatments for infertility in patients with mood or psychotic disorders, as well as those evaluating the onset of symptoms, were included. Selected studies were published in English, Spanish, and Dutch language peer-reviewed journals. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Observational studies and case reports were excluded. Effect sizes for changes in depressive symptoms were calculated with Hedges'g and Cohen's d confidence intervals. A meta-analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity of hormonal compounds in protocols.
   Results
   From 1,281 retrieved records, nine trials were included; all of them were conducted in non-clinical populations. Four trials compared Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and GnRH antagonists, showing a better mood profile for hormonal protocols including antagonists in one trial. Two trials compared protocols using GnRH agonists/antagonists versus natural cycle protocols (without gonadotropin stimulation), with a better mood profile (less depressive symptoms) in those protocols without gonadotropin stimulation. Other studies compared long and short protocols of GnRH agonists (no differences); two GnRH agonists, buserelin, and goserelin (no differences); and two patterns of clomiphene vs placebo administration (no differences). None of the selected studies investigated the risk of relapse in women with a previous diagnosis of depressive or psychotic disorders. When exploring pre-post changes in depressive symptoms, effect sizes suggested mild mood worsenings for most protocols (effect sizes <= -0.4), with the following pattern (worse to better): GnRH agonist > GnRH antagonist > no gonadotropin stimulation.
   Conclusions
   This is the first systematic review exploring the psychopathological effects of hormonal infertility treatments. Our study suggests that protocols without gonadotropin stimulation show a better mood profile when compared to those using GnRH antagonists or GnRH agonists. Future studies need to include patients with major mood and psychotic disorders.

AB  - Background
   A large number of Chinese suffer from common mental disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder), but treatment seeking is typically low in this population. It is unclear what barriers influence professional mental health help-seeking behavior within the Chinese population. Identifying these barriers could assist in implementation science efforts to reach this population.
   Objective
   This review systematically synthesizes findings related to the barriers to professional mental health help-seeking among Chinese adults.
   Methods
   Two English language databases (PubMed and PsycINFO) and two Chinese databases (WANFANGDATA and CNKI) were searched to find relevant studies. Quality assessment was conducted in identified studies. Quantitative findings were tabulated and frequently reported barriers were ranked. Primary data obtained from qualitative studies were thematically analyzed.
   Results
   Of 6,933 citations identified, 17 met inclusion criteria. There were 11 (64%) studies that reported quantitative methods; 3 (18%) employed qualitative research, and 3 (18%) mixed methods. Results indicated that frequently reported barriers to mental health help seeking among Chinese adults included a preference on self-reliance, seeking help from alternative sources, low perceived need toward help-seeking, a lack of affordability, negative attitude toward, or poor experiences with help-seeking. Less frequently mentioned barriers included stigma, families' opposition, limited knowledge about mental illness, a lack of accessibility, unwillingness to disclose mental illness, and fear of burdening family.
   Conclusions
   The current review identified a number of key barriers to help-seeking behavior. Effective strategies are needed to promote professional help-seeking among Chinese adults. Additional factors influencing professional mental health help-seeking need to be further investigated, as they may contribute to a better understanding the help-seeking behavior among Chinese.

AB  - Background
   Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is considered the main cerebral neurotrophin and is produced in the central neural system and peripherals. Its levels are reduced in patients with several psychiatric disorders, but it is unclear if the response to psychotherapy can alter its concentration.
   Objective
   To carry out a systematic review evaluating the effects of individual psychotherapy in BDNF levels in patients with mental disorders.
   Methods
   The databases PubMed, EMBASE, PsycArticles, SciELO, Web of Science, and CENTRAL; the last search was performed on October 2019 for trials evaluating the effects of individual psychotherapy in BDNF levels in adults with mental disorders. PROSPERO registration: CRD42018108144.
   Results
   Eight of 293 studies were included. A rise in BDNF levels was observed in depressive patients when psychotherapy was combined with medication. Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who responded to therapy presented a raise in BDNF levels mostly when combined with physical activity. There was a rise in BDNF levels in those who responded to psychotherapy in patients with bulimia, in borderline patients, and in insomniacs.
   Conclusions
   The BDNF seems to present variations after psychotherapy especially in patients with bulimia, PTSD, insomnia, and borderline. These subjects also have symptom reduction. Thereby, BDNF could be a supplemental tool to analyze the success to psychotherapy. BDNF levels in patients with major depression after therapy are still controversial and the short follow-up of most studies is a limiting factor.

AB  - Background Pregnancy and parenthood are known to be high-risk times for mental health. However, less is known about the mental health of pregnant adolescents or adolescent parents. Despite the substantial literature on the risks associated with adolescent pregnancy, there is limited evidence on best practices for preventing poor mental health in this vulnerable group. This systematic review therefore aimed to identify whether psychosocial interventions can effectively promote positive mental health and prevent mental health conditions in pregnant and parenting adolescents. Methods We used the standardized systematic review methodology based on the process outlined in the World Health Organization's Handbook for Guidelines Development. This review focused on randomized controlled trials of preventive psychosocial interventions to promote the mental health of pregnant and parenting adolescents, as compared to treatment as usual. We searched PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, ERIC, EMBASE and ASSIA databases, as well as reference lists of relevant articles, grey literature, and consultation with experts in the field. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence. Results We included 17 eligible studies (n = 3245 participants). Interventions had small to moderate, beneficial effects on positive mental health (SMD = 0.35, very low quality evidence), and moderate beneficial effects on school attendance (SMD = 0.64, high quality evidence). There was limited evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on mental health disorders including depression and anxiety, substance use, risky sexual and reproductive health behaviors, adherence to antenatal and postnatal care, and parenting skills. There were no available data for outcomes on self-harm and suicide; aggressive, disruptive, and oppositional behaviors; or exposure to intimate partner violence. Only two studies included adolescent fathers. No studies were based in low- or middle-income countries. Conclusion Despite the encouraging findings in terms of effects on positive mental health and school attendance outcomes, there is a critical evidence gap related to the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving mental health, preventing disorders, self-harm, and other risk behaviors among pregnant and parenting adolescents. There is an urgent need to adapt and design new psychosocial interventions that can be pilot-tested and scaled with pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents and their extended networks, particularly in low-income settings.

AB  - Research has shown that autistic adults have poor health outcomes. We conducted a systematic review to identify existing interventions to address health outcomes for autistic adults and to determine whether these interventions address the priorities of the autistic community. We searched PubMed for articles that included an intervention, a primary health outcome measured at the individual (not system) level, and a sample population of at least 50% autistic adults. Studies were excluded if they were not peer-reviewed, had a focus on caregivers, were expert opinions on specific interventions, untested protocols, or interventions without a primary health outcome. Out of the 778 articles reviewed, 19 were found to meet the stated criteria. Based on the evidence gathered, two were considered emerging evidence-based approaches: cognitive behavioral approaches and mindfulness. The remaining interventions included in the review did not have sufficient evidence to support current use with this population. The majority of the studies included samples of young autistic adults, primarily male, without an intellectual disability. Anxiety, quality of life, depression, and behavioral issues were among the health outcomes measured in the final included articles. More research on preferred interventions with prioritized health outcomes of the autistic adult population is needed.
   Lay abstract
   Autistic adults have more health problems then their same-aged peers. Yet little research has been conducted that focuses on addressing these health problems. In order to guide future research, it is important to know what intervention studies have been done to improve health outcomes among autistic adults. The project team and student assistants read studies that were published between 2007 and 2018 in the online research database, PubMed. We looked for studies published in English, which were peer-reviewed and included (1) an intervention, (2) an outcome that was related to health, and (3) a study group that included autistic adults. We did not include studies that had outcomes about employment (unless there was a health outcome), studies about caregivers or caregiving, or expert opinions about interventions. Of 778 reviewed articles, 19 studies met all of the criteria above. Within these studies, two approaches were found to have emerging evidence for their use in autistic adults: cognitive behavioral interventions and mindfulness-based approaches for improved mental health outcomes. The remaining intervention approaches did not have enough articles to support their use. Many of the outcomes were about reduced symptoms of co-occurring mental health diagnoses (e.g. reduced anxiety, depression). Most of the participants in these studies were male and did not have intellectual disability. Most study participants were adults younger than 40. There are not many intervention studies that address health outcomes among autistic adults. More research is needed on interventions which are desired by the adult autism community and address preferred health outcomes such as increased quality of life or well-being.

AB  - Physical exercise seems to have a promising effect on numerous variables related to the recovery of drug-dependent patients. However, some contradictions are found in the literature. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to identify the effect of physical exercise on mental disorders, quality of life, abstinence, and craving, and make a comparison of the effect of exercise depending on the type of program. A search for articles was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Studies were selected that measured the acute effects or long-term effect (>=2 weeks) of exercise in patients who met criteria for alcohol use disorders or substance use disorders. A total of 59 studies were included. An effect of exercise on quality of life and mental disorders was identified. Subgroup analysis revealed an effect of exercise on stress (SMD = 1.11 (CI: 0.31, 1.91); z = 2.73; p = 0.006), anxiety (SMD = 0.50 (CI: 0.16, 0.84); z = 2.88; p = 0.004) and depression (SMD = 0.63 (CI: 0.34, 0.92); z = 4.31; p < 0.0001), and an effect of exercise on the eight variables included in the SF36 test. The results also showed a trend towards a positive effect on craving (SMD = 0.89 (CI: -0.05, 1.82); z = 1.85, p = 0.06). Body-mind activities and programs based on improving physical conditions produced similar results in mental disorders and quality of life. Available evidence indicates that physical exercise, both body-mind and physical fitness programs, can be effective in improving mental disorders, craving, and quality of life in drug-dependent patients.

AB  - With ever-increasing prevalence of various mental disorders worldwide, a comprehensive evaluation of the prevalence of co-occurring psychiatric disorders among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is needed to strengthen the knowledge base. This umbrella review aims to summarize the current evidence on the prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders among people with ASD. A systematic search of 12 major databases and additional sources was conducted. Any systematically conducted narrative, qualitative, or meta-analytic review reporting the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among people with ASD with no age or geographical restriction were included. From a total of 2755 records, 26 articles representing 14 systematic reviews and 12 meta-analyses met the criteria of this review. The synthesized findings reveal a high burden of comorbid psychiatric disorders among people with ASD, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar and mood disorders, schizophrenia spectrum, suicidal behavior disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive, impulse-control and conduct disorders amongst diverse age groups, with a majority in younger participants. Most studies were conducted in developed nations, with limited evidence from low and middle-income countries. These synthesized findings provide high-quality evidence for clinical and policy-level decision-making from a global overview of the status of comorbid psychiatric disorders among people with ASD.

AB  - Objective: The authors provide an evidenced-based summary of the literature on the clinical application of psychedelic drugs in psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: Searches of PubMed and PsycINFO via Ovid were conducted for articles in English, in peer-reviewed journals, reporting on "psilocybin," "lysergic acid diethylamide," "LSD," "ayahuasca," "3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine,"and "MDMA," in human subjects, published between 2007 and July 1, 2019. A total of 1,603 articles were identified and screened. Articles that did not contain the terms "clinical trial," "therapy," or "imaging" in the title or abstract were filtered out. The 161 remaining articles were reviewed by two or more authors. The authors identified 14 articles reporting on well- designed clinical trials investigating the efficacy of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin,and ayahuasca for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders,trauma and stress-related disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders as well as in end-of-life care.
   Results: The most significant database exists for MDMA and psilocybin, which have been designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as "breakthrough therapies" for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and treatment-resistant depression, respectively. The research on LSD and ayahuasca is observational, but available evidence suggests that these agents may have therapeutic effects in specific psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusions: Randomized clinical trials support the efficacy of MDMA in the treatment of PTSD and psilocybin in the treatment of depression and cancer-related anxiety. There search to support the use of LSD and ayahuasca in the treatment of psychiatric disorders is preliminary, although promising. Overall, the database is insufficient for FDA approval of any psychedelic compound for routine clinical use in psychiatric disorders at this time, but continued research on the efficacy of psychedelics for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is warranted.

AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy and characteristics of psychological or educational eHealth interventions on reducing symptoms of mental illness in parents of preterm or low birthweight infants. Background: Many parents suffer psychological disorders after preterm birth. Computer or mobile application-based interventions are a promising alternative. Methods: We searched seven electronic databases up to January 2020 and included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing psychological or educational eHealth interventions in parents of infants born very preterm <32 weeks or with very low birthweight <1500g (primary question), or preterm <37 weeks or with low birthweight <2500g (secondary question). Primary outcomes were measures of depression, anxiety, acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. Secondary outcomes included other indicators of mental health, quality of life and intervention characteristics. We had planned random-effects meta-analysis in our protocol (CRD42018105731). Results: Of 9768 records, no study reported our primary outcomes. Three studies showed potential benefits for parental self-efficacy, discharge preparedness, parental satisfaction and family satisfaction with the neonatal intensive care unit. Conclusions: We found scarce evidence on the efficacy of psychological or educational eHealth interventions on reducing mental illness in parents of preterm or low birthweight infants, highlighting the need for more research.

AB  - Introduction: Music therapy is used as an adjunct oncological treatment aiming at the improvement of psychological and physical well-being through music. A growing body of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials has been published and reviewed recently. However, a global, quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of music therapy in adult cancer care is missing. The present study thus aims to synthesize the evidence of music therapy in different oncological treatment phases.
   Methods: We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42019133084) following standard guidelines. We searched electronic databases for studies on music therapy performed by a therapist with adult cancer patients.
   Results: The narrative synthesis included thirty studies showing that music therapy overall had positive effects on a broad range of outcomes, with techniques and effects varying in different phases. During curative treatment, results were most promising with regard to anxiety, depression, and pain medication intake, while in palliative settings, improvements with regard to quality of life, spiritual well-being, pain, and stress were reported. Twenty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis which showed small but significant effects of music therapy on psychological well-being (d = 0.35, p < 0.001), physical symptom distress (d = -0.26, p = 0.017), and quality of life (d = 0.36, p = 0.023). Heterogeneity between effect sizes was small to medium. Moderator analyses identified studies with a single session of music therapy and the use of receptive techniques to produce larger effects regarding psychological well-being.
   Conclusion: Music therapy can improve relevant health-outcomes in cancer patients and should therefore be offered in various treatment phases. Future research should include potential moderators such as individual information about patients to find out who benefits most from different kinds of music therapy.

AB  - Background To elucidate the populations and conditions where screen-based sedentary behaviors (SB) and internalizing symptoms are coupled, this review synthesized the evidence for factors that may moderate the associations between screen-based SB, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms among youth. Methods Two independent researchers conducted a systematic literature search of the Medline, psycINFO, and Scopus electronic databases in late 2018 for observational studies assessing moderators of the association between screen-based SB and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Studies among children and adolescents were eligible if moderation was assessed by statistical test (interaction) or stratification; and a narrative synthesis of eligible studies was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results Seventy empirical studies (46 cross-sectional, 19 longitudinal, and 5 both) of 13 different moderating variables of screen-based SB-internalizing symptom associations met the eligibility criteria. Of these, 40 studies were of depressive symptoms, 2 were of anxiety symptoms, and 28 studies assessed symptoms of both. The most consistent evidence of moderation was for screen-type, such that TV viewing was not as strongly associated with internalizing symptoms compared to other forms of screen-based SB. There was also inconsistent evidence for physical activity buffering screen-based SB-internalizing symptom associations and for female sex amplifying screen-based SB-internalizing symptom associations. In general, the body of evidence for anxiety symptoms was more limited than that for depressive symptoms, and were therefore more inconsistent. Conclusions Screen-type, physical activity, and sex may influence the magnitude of screen-based SB-internalizing symptom coupling; highlighting potential sources of heterogeneity of screen-based SB-internalizing symptom associations. Additional studies aimed at understanding potential mechanistic explanations for the above moderators are needed prior to the development of tailored intervention strategies designed to decouple screen-based SB and internalizing symptoms among youth.

AB  - Self-injurious behavior is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Anxiety, substance abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder, trauma, depression, and personality disorders are commonly reported in patients with self-injurious behavior. The primary purpose of this article is to present a summary of research examining the effectiveness of exercise to reduce self-injurious behavior and to recommend directions for further research. Major research databases including PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Taylor & Francis, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ERIC were searched for published work. Only five studies were found relevant to the topic of our interest: one retrospective case study, two cross-sectional studies, and two interventional/experimental studies. The results of interventional studies found beneficial effects of aerobic exercise for reduction in selfinjurious behavior. In addition, crosssectional studies found effectiveness of moderate to vigorous exercise for self-injury. The findings also showed that exercise appeared to reduce negative psychological conditions and improve overall psychological states in people with self-injurious behavior.

AB  - Responding to stimuli in ambiguous environments is partially governed by approach-avoidance tendencies. Imbalances in these approach-avoidance behaviors are implicated in many mental disorders including anxiety disorders, phobias and substance use disorders. While factors biasing human behavior in approach-avoidance conflicts have been researched in numerous experiments, a much-needed comprehensive overview integrating those findings is missing. Here, we systematically searched the existing literature on individual differences in task-based approach-avoidance behavior and aggregated the current evidence for the effect of self-reported approach/avoidance traits, anxiety and anxiety disorders, specific phobias, depression, aggression, anger and psychopathy, substance use and related disorders, eating disorders and habits, trauma, acute stress and, finally, hormone levels (mainly testosterone, oxytocin). We highlight consistent findings, underrepresented research areas and unexpected results, and detail the amount of controversy between studies. We discuss potential reasons for ambiguous results in some research areas, offer practical advice for future studies and highlight potential variables such as task-related researcher decisions that may influence how interindividual differences and disorders drive automatic approach-avoidance biases in behavioral experiments.

AB  - Pain often co-occurs with depression and anxiety, and together cause considerable social and economic burden. Twin studies have investigated the aetiology of these covariations. However, to our knowledge, no systematic review examining the covariation between these conditions has been conducted. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsychInfo for twin studies examining the covariation between pain with depression and/or anxiety published from inception to May 16, 2019. Included studies reported: original data on twin samples using the classical twin or co-twin control designs; investigated the association between pain and depression and/or anxiety; were published in peer-reviewed journals; used validated measures; included >= 100 twin pairs. Of 359 retrieved articles, 23 met our inclusion criteria. Most studies found that the covariation of pain with depression and/or anxiety was explained by genetic (n = 6) or both genetic and environmental (n = 16) factors. Most studies were cross-sectional, and all were led in adult populations. Future research requires the use of more standardized measurement tools, including quantitative sensory testing as well as assess child-adolescent cohorts.

AB  - This meta-analysis explores whether self-regulation in childhood relates to concurrent and subsequent levels of achievement, interpersonal behaviors, mental health, and healthy living. A comprehensive literature search identified 150 studies that met inclusion criteria (745 effect sizes; total n = 215,212). Data were analyzed using inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analysis. Mean effect sizes from 55 meta-analyses provided evidence that self-regulation relates to 25 discrete outcomes. Results showed that self-regulation in preschool (similar to age 4) was positively associated with social competency, school engagement, and academic performance, and negatively associated with internalizing problems, peer victimization, and externalizing problems, in early school years (similar to age 8). Self-regulation in early school years was positively related to academic achievement (math and literacy), and negatively related to externalizing problems (aggressive and criminal behavior), depressive symptoms, obesity, cigarette smoking and illicit drug use, in later school years (similar to age 13). Results also showed that self-regulation in early school years was negatively related to unemployment, aggressive and criminal behavior, depression and anxiety, obesity, cigarette smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, and symptoms of physical illness in adulthood (similar to age 38). Random effects metaregression identified self-regulation measurement as the most important moderator of pooled mean effects, with task-based assessments and teacher-report assessments often showing stronger associations than parent-report assessments. Overall, findings from this meta-analysis provide evidence that self-regulation in childhood can predict achievement, interpersonal behaviors, mental health, and healthy living in later life.

AB  - Background: Abortion is the ending of pregnancy due to removing an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus. Some women suffer from psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression and grief after abortion. Early detection of high-risk women after abortion and psychological intervention is one of the healing methods than can lead to improving outcomes but its effectiveness is not clear. The present meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of this approach.
   Methods: The international and national electronic databases were searched from Jan 1998 until Aug 2018 including Medline, Web of Knowledge, Ovid, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Google Scholar, Iranmedex, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Magiran. The pooled mean difference with the random-effects model was used for meta-analyses. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines adhered in this study.
   Results: We enrolled 7 relevant studies involving 918 subjects into the meta-analysis process. The meta-analysis of the interventions aiming at prevention of post-abortion grief yielded a pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.03 (95% CI: -0.40-0.34; Z=0.16; P=0.87) at post-test and of -0.21 (95% CI:-0.53-0.10; Z=1.32; P=0.19) at follow-up.
   Conclusion: This systematic review found psychotherapy-based interventions are effective in post-abortion grief treatment but; we found psychotherapy-based interventions are somewhat effective in short-term post-abortion grief and it has a better effect on long-term grief.

AB  - Context: The prevalence of infertility, as one of the most unpleasant experiences, is approximately 13.2% in Iran. It can affect the quality of life in infertile people through mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety.
   Objectives: This systematic review was carried out to assess the effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on anxiety and depression of infertile women in Iran.
   Data Sources: All articles published in English and Persian until 20 February 2019 in databases, including Magiran, Iranmedex, SID, Medline (via PubMed), Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Sciences were searched.
   Study Selection: All randomized controlled clinical trials conducted in Iran on the effect of CBT on anxiety and depression were studied. In the selected studies, participants were Iranian infertile women. The used intervention was the application of CBT, the control group had received only routine care, and the outcomes were anxiety and depression.
   Data Extraction: Two authors separately investigated the acceptability and quality of articles, and any disagreement was solved through consensus and a third opinion.
   Results: Six clinical trials with 321 infertile women entered the systematic review. The meta-analysis of six studies showed that the mean depression and anxiety score in the CBT group was lower than the routine care group, which was significant only for anxiety.
   Conclusions: The results indicated the effectiveness of CBT intervention in reducing anxiety and depression in infertile women. However, the between-group difference was not significant in terms of depression. Convenience sampling and small sample size in the selected studies reduced the generalizability of research findings. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct clinical trials with larger sample size and accurate methodology to obtain more generalizable results.

AB  - Doctors across the world work in stressful conditions, often making life or death decisions under considerable pressure. With changes in patient and societal expectations, these pressures continue to rise. For several decades, it has been illustrated that rates of psychiatric disorders, especially suicide, are considerably higher in doctors than the general population. We performed a comprehensive literature search of suicide in doctors. Using defined terms (suicide, self-harm, doctors, physicians, residents) in PubMed, we identified pertinent articles for review. We find that suicide in doctors is influenced by exposure to the physical and emotional distress endemic to the profession. These experiences may be compounded by emotional giving to the brink of exhaustion; a lack of positive feedback; alongside workplace isolation and poor support networks. Moreover, risks may be magnified by impacts outside of work; long hours, strained family relationships, poor work-life balance, as well as system and organizational politics. Despite this, doctors persistently avoid seeking help because of stigma against mental illnesses, stigma against themselves, and growing concerns that disclosure may impact their medical license. In many cases, doctors choose to self-medicate with prescription medications, alcohol, and a range of other substances. It is important that health services respond promptly, adequately, and sensibly to the needs of doctors in distress. Organizations including regulators have a moral responsibility to care for the wellbeing of its staff. A proactive approach to well-being, through training, and support will not only benefit doctors but also the patients who utilize their services each day.

AB  - Objective: Compassion-based interventions show promise in enhancing well-being and reducing distress, but little is known about their applications for people with long-term physical conditions. This study explores compassion-based interventions for this population: what are their differing elements (content, structure, tailoring, use of technology), feasibility and acceptability, effects and experienced benefits? Design: A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted. Four bibliographic databases were searched without study design restrictions. Meta-synthesis was used to integrate quantitative results of effects and qualitative results of experienced benefits. Results: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies targeted people with cancer or persistent pain. Interventions were either comprehensive with 6-12 face-to-face sessions, or brief based on a single compassion exercise. Feasibility and accessibility were highly rated by participants. Amongst a plethora of outcomes, reductions in depression and anxiety were the most common findings. Our qualitative synthesis yielded experienced benefits of (1) acceptance of the condition; (2) improved emotion regulation skills; (3) reduced feelings of isolation. There was minimal overlap between quantitative and qualitative outcomes. Conclusion: While the field is still in its infancy, this review highlights the potential benefits of compassion-based interventions for people with long-term physical conditions and discusses recommendations for further intervention research and development.

AB  - Background The World Health Organization estimates that 75% of patients with mental and substance use disorders in low- and middle-income countries do not have access to the care needed. In the Arab World, approximately 100-140 million people suffer from at least one psychiatric disorder. One main criticism of classification systems has been their lack of cultural sensitivity. The International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition aims to improve clinical utility of psychiatric classification across cultures. Mood, anxiety and stress-related disorders are the most common psychiatric manifestations and the most impacted by cultural factors. Main body Relying on rigorous field testing, including in three Arab countries, clinically meaningful changes have been introduced in the International Classification of Diseases 11. These include new disorders such as complex post-traumatic stress disorder and prolonged grief disorder. In classifying mood episodes, the pattern of symptoms over time is emphasized. Disorders associated with anxiety provide the basis for a new grouping separate from obsessive-compulsive-related disorders. Lastly, culture and its impact are incorporated into each diagnostic grouping. Conclusions This latest version of the International Classification of Diseases prioritizes addressing gaps in the validity and reliability of psychiatric classification. The methodology adopted in this latest revision is encouraging and opens the way to truly global collaboration on refining psychiatric diagnoses and practice.

AB  - Background
   In low- and middle-income countries, rates of common mental health disorders are found to be very high among children and adolescents while individuals, particularly in these countries, face barriers to mental health care. In the recent years, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted that implemented and tested different psychological and psychosocial treatment approaches to treat common mental disorders. This review aims to analyze psychological interventions among children and adolescents in low- and middle-income countries.
   Methods
   RCTs carried out in low- and middle-income countries on psychological and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents with symptoms of trauma- and stressor related disorders, depression or anxiety were identified in bibliographic databases. Databases were systematically searched until December 14, 2018. Effect sizes indicating differences between treatment and control groups at post-test were computed using a random-effects model. Outcomes were symptoms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Results
   Thirteen studies with a total of 2,626 participants aged between 5 and 18 years were included. Treatments varied between studies and number of treatment sessions ranged from 1 to 16. The pooled effect size, combining outcomes of depression, anxiety and PTSD of psychological or psychosocial intervention versus care-as-usual or a control conditions yielded a medium effect (g = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.27-0.98). Heterogeneity was very high (I-2 = 94.41; 95% CI = 80-91). The beneficial effect of interventions increased after excluding outliers (g = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.37-1.07), while heterogeneity remained high (I-2 = 86.12; 95% CI = 87-94).
   Conclusion
   High quality RCTs investigating the effect of psychological and psychosocial interventions on PTSD, depression and anxiety among children and adolescents in low- and middle-income countries are scarce. Results of the available studies may suggest that psychological and psychosocial interventions might be more effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD compared to control conditions. Due to very high heterogeneity, this evidence must be considered with caution.

AB  - More than two-thirds of patients suffering from stress-related disorders are women but over two-thirds of suicide completers are men. These are just some examples of the many sex differences in the prevalence and manifestations of stress-related disorders, such as major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety disorders, which have been extensively documented in clinical research. Nonetheless, the molecular origins of this sex dimorphism are still quite obscure. In response to this lack of knowledge, the NIH recently advocated implementing sex as biological variable in the design of preclinical studies across disciplines. As a result, a newly emerging field within psychiatry is trying to elucidate the molecular causes underlying the clinically described sex dimorphism. Several studies in rodents and humans have already identified many stress-related genes that are regulated by acute and chronic stress in a sex-specific fashion. Furthermore, current transcriptomic studies have shown that pathways and networks in male and female individuals are not equally affected by stress exposure. In this review, we give an overview of transcriptional studies designed to understand how sex influences stress-specific transcriptomic changes in rodent models, as well as human psychiatric patients, highlighting the use of different methodological techniques. Understanding which mechanisms are more affected in males, and which in females, may lead to the identification of sex-specific mechanisms, their selective contribution to stress susceptibility, and their role in the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders.

   Aim
   The aim of this article was to present a broad perspective on the current state of knowledge in a relatively new and complex field of "attachment and epigenetic processes."
   Method
   We conducted a scoping review based on a systematic literature search in PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase databases for relevant abstracts using the terms attachment and epigenet*.
   Results
   In total, 11 studies were included. Research predating 2009 and animal studies were excluded in order to review the current state of research in humans.
   Conclusion
   Overall, there seems to be a consistency in the literature, pointing to a link between early childhood adversity, attachment processes, and epigenetic changes. However, research in human subjects is still limited.

AB  - Background Women of childbearing age are at high risk of developing depression and antenatal depression is one of the most common mood disorders. Antenatal depression is also associated with a number of poor maternal and infant outcomes, however, there remains a lack of focus on mental issues in antenatal care, particularly in lower income countries. This systematic review of reviews provides useful evidence regarding the burden of antenatal depression which may provide guidance for health policy development and planning. Methods We searched CINAHL(EBSCO), MEDLINE (via Ovid), PsycINFO, Emcare, PubMed, Psychiatry Online, and Scopus databases for systematic reviews that based on observational studies that were published in between January 1st, 2007 and August 31st, 2018. We used the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist scores to assess the quality of the included reviews. We applied vote counting and narrative review to summarize the prevalence of antenatal depression and its associated factors, while statistical pooling was conducted for estimating the association of antenatal depression with low birth weight and preterm birth. This systematic review of reviews was registered on PROSPERO with protocol number CRD42018116267. Results We have included ten reviews (306 studies with 877,246 participants) on antenatal depression prevalence and six reviews (39 studies with 75,451 participants) conducted to identify the effect of antenatal depression on preterm and low birth weight. Globally, we found that antenatal depression prevalence ranged from 15 to 65%. We identified the following prominent risk factors based on their degree of influence: Current or previous exposure to different forms of abuse and violence (six reviews and 73 studies); lack of social and/or partner support (four reviews and 47 studies); personal or family history of any common mental disorder (three reviews and 34 studies). The risk of low birth weight and preterm birth was 1.49 (95%CI: 1.32, 1.68; I-2 = 0.0%) and 1.40 (95%CI: 1.16, 1.69; I-2 = 35.2%) times higher among infants born from depressed mothers. Conclusions Globally, antenatal depression prevalence was high and could be considered a common mental disorder during pregnancy. Though the association between antenatal depression and adverse birth outcomes appeared to be modest, its absolute impact would be significant in lower-income countries with a high prevalence of antenatal depression and poor access to quality mental health services.

AB  - Background Evidence on the effectiveness of psychological interventions for women with common mental disorders (CMDs) who also experience intimate partner violence is scarce. We aimed to test our hypothesis that exposure to intimate partner violence would reduce intervention effectiveness for CMDs in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, trials registries, 3ie, Google Scholar, and forward and backward citations for studies published between database inception and Aug 16, 2019. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for CMDs in LMICs which measured intimate partner violence were included, without language or date restrictions. We approached study authors to obtain unpublished aggregate subgroup data for women who did and did not report intimate partner violence. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychological distress outcomes. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as differences between standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, comparing women who did and who did not report intimate partner violence via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42017078611.
   Findings Of 8122 records identified, 21 were eligible and data were available for 15 RCTs, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. Anxiety (five interventions, 728 participants) showed a greater response to intervention among women reporting intimate partner violence than among those who did not (difference in standardised mean differences [dSMD] 0.31, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57, I-2=49.4%). No differences in response to intervention were seen in women reporting intimate partner violence for PTSD (eight interventions, n=1436; dSMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.33, I-2=42.6%), depression (12 interventions, n=2940; 0.10, -0.04 to 0.25, I-2=49 .3%), and psychological distress (four interventions, n=1591; 0.07, -0.05 to 0.18, I-2=0.0%, p=0.681).
   Interpretation Psychological interventions treat anxiety effectively in women with current or recent intimate partner violence exposure in LMICs when delivered by appropriately trained and supervised health-care staff, even when not tailored for this population or targeting intimate partner violence directly. Future research should investigate whether adapting evidence-based psychological interventions for CMDs to address intimate partner violence enhances their acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness in LMICs.

AB  - Clinical Practice Guidelines are succinct evidence-based recommendations and in psychiatry, exist to advise on psychotropic prescribing to effectively treat mental health conditions whilst minimising medication adverse effects. Implementation of psychiatric guidelines have, in the past, demonstrated little and transient impact on clinical practice. How effective prescribing guidelines are in aligning practice with evidence currently is unknown and this systematic review aimed to investigate said efficacy. Literature searches were performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL up to September 2019 and articles were selected by two reviewers independently with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. The review identified 18 eligible articles pertaining to the following conditions: depressive disorders, psychotic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar affective disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and opiate addiction with depression guidelines being the most frequently evaluated. Seven studies revealed guidelines effected no change in psychotropic prescribing. The remaining studies illustrated that even when practice was changed, the effect was generally small, emphasising the need to change guideline development and implementation, taking into account obstacles or opportunities specific to psychotropic pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Postpartum stress has been shown to have an association with infant growth, nutrition, bonding, temperament and ultimately childhood mental wellbeing. When persistent, recurring or chronic, it can negatively impact infant outcome, including the subscales of mental wellbeing such as growth, development, feeding, attachment and sleep. This study aims to define the physical and functional effect of postpartum stress on measures of infant mental wellbeing. A systematic review of English language articles published between 1995 and 2019 on PubMed, Medline and Psych base databases was carried out. Search terms used included postpartum, stress, infant, growth, development, nutrition, attachment and sleep. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were reviewed with eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria of human studies, mothers diagnosed with depressive and anxiety symptoms postpartum with infant correlates were used. All animal studies and studies with women already on medication were excluded. A total of 74 articles were reviewed and summarized into postpartum stress associations with infant growth, development, nutrition, sleep and maternal fetal attachment. Postpartum stress is negatively associated with poor developmental trajectories and linear growth deficits, causing stunting in growth; poor language and cognitive development; poor gross and fine motor movement, and infant sleep. An inverse relationship exists with breast feeding and postpartum depression. More importantly, breastfeeding efficacy is important for sustaining positive infant feeding outcome. Increased maternal age during postpartum depression has been linked, as a contributing factor, to decreased maternal fetal attachment/bonding. A ripple effect exists from the association between postpartum stress and poor infant sleep. There is strong evidence that correlates PPS to infant outcome, mediated through many external factors. More research needs to be conducted to delineate and potentially mitigate the impact of modifiable factors. Not all articles in the literature were reviewed.

AB  - Attachment security priming has been extensively used in relationship research to explore the contents of mental models of attachment and examine the benefits derived from enhancing security. This systematic review explores the effectiveness of attachment security priming in improving positive affect and reducing negative affect in adults and children. The review searched four electronic databases for peer-reviewed journal articles. Thirty empirical studies met our inclusion criteria, including 28 adult and 2 child and adolescent samples. The findings show that attachment security priming improved positive affect and reduced negative affect relative to control primes. Supraliminal and subliminal primes were equally effective in enhancing security in one-shot prime studies (we only reviewed repeated priming studies using supraliminal primes so could not compare prime types in these). Global attachment style moderated the primed style in approximately half of the studies. Importantly, repeated priming studies showed a cumulative positive effect of security priming over time. We conclude that repeated priming study designs may be the most effective. More research is needed that explores the use of attachment security priming as a possible intervention to improve emotional wellbeing, in particular for adolescents and children.

AB  - Introduction: Paternal psychopathology is associated with various adolescent outcomes. With emotional disorders presenting a significant public health concern in the adolescent age group, the aim of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence on the relationship between paternal mental health and adolescent anxiety or depression.
   Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, and PsycINFO were searched for articles which primarily aimed to investigate the relationship between paternal mental health (exposure) and adolescent anxiety or depression (outcome). Articles were assessed for risk of bias, and findings are presented in a narrative synthesis. The protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018094076).
   Results: Findings from the fourteen included studies indicated that paternal depression is associated with adolescent depression and anxiety. Findings relating to other paternal mental health disorders were inconclusive. Results largely suggested that adolescent depression and anxiety is equally associated with paternal and maternal mental health. The included studies were mostly cross-sectional, and the quality of included studies was mixed. Attempts to focus on the 11-17 year age range were hampered by the variability of age ranges included in studies.
   Conclusions: Further longitudinal research is needed to clarify the association between paternal mental health disorders other than depression, and adolescent anxiety or depression. Mechanisms in this relationship should also be further explored, and could be informed by existing models on younger children.

AB  - Objectives: Protests, riots and revolutions have long been a part of human history and are increasing globally, yet their impact on mental health remains largely unknown. We therefore systematically reviewed studies on collective actions and mental health. Method: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and CINAHL Plus for published studies from their inception until 1 January 2018. Study quality was rated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: We identified 52 studies (n = 57,487 participants) from 20 countries/regions. The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder ranged from 4% to 41% in riot-affected areas. Following a major protest, the prevalence of probable major depression increased by 7%, regardless of personal involvement in the protests, suggestive of community spillover effects. Risk factors for poorer mental health included female sex, lower socioeconomic status, exposure to violence, interpersonal conflicts, frequent social media use and lower resilience and social support. Nevertheless, two studies suggested that collective actions may reduce depression and suicide, possibly due to a collective cathartic experience and greater social cohesion within subpopulations. Conclusion: We present the first systematic review of collective actions and mental health, showing compelling evidence that protests even when nonviolent can be associated with adverse mental health outcomes. Health care professionals therefore need to be vigilant to the mental and psychological sequelae of protests, riots and revolutions. Further research on this emerging sociopolitical determinant of mental health is warranted.

AB  - Background: In the last decade, there has been a proliferation of mobile apps claiming to support the needs of people living with depression. However, it is unclear what functionality is actually provided by apps for depression, or for whom they are intended.
   Objective: This paper aimed to explore the key features of top-rated apps for depression, including descriptive characteristics, functionality, and ethical concerns, to better inform the design of apps for depression.
   Methods: We reviewed top-rated iPhone OS (iOS) and Android mobile apps for depression retrieved from app marketplaces in spring 2019. We applied a systematic analysis to review the selected apps, for which data were gathered from the 2 marketplaces and through direct use of the apps. We report an in-depth analysis of app functionality, namely, screening, tracking, and provision of interventions. Of the initially identified 482 apps, 29 apps met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Apps were included if they remained accessible at the moment of evaluation, were offered in mental health-relevant categories, received a review score greater than 4.0 out of 5.0 by more than 100 reviewers, and had depression as a primary target.
   Results: The analysis revealed that a majority of apps specify the evidence base for their intervention (18/29, 62%), whereas a smaller proportion describes receiving clinical input into their design (12/29, 41%). All the selected apps are rated as suitable for children and adolescents on the marketplace, but 83% (24/29) do not provide a privacy policy consistent with their rating. The findings also show that most apps provide multiple functions. The most commonly implemented functions include provision of interventions (24/29, 83%) either as a digitalized therapeutic intervention or as support for mood expression; tracking (19/29, 66%) of moods, thoughts, or behaviors for supporting the intervention; and screening (9/29, 31%) to inform the decision to use the app and its intervention. Some apps include overtly negative content.
   Conclusions: Currently available top-ranked apps for depression on the major marketplaces provide diverse functionality to benefit users across a range of age groups; however, guidelines and frameworks are still needed to ensure users' privacy and safety while using them. Suggestions include clearly defining the age of the target population and explicit disclosure of the sharing of users' sensitive data with third parties. In addition, we found an opportunity for apps to better leverage digital affordances for mitigating harm, for personalizing interventions, and for tracking multimodal content. The study further demonstrated the need to consider potential risks while using depression apps, including the use of nonvalidated screening tools, tracking negative moods or thinking patterns, and exposing users to negative emotional expression content.

AB  - Atrazine is a pre- and post-emergence herbicide used to control weeds in many crops. It was introduced in the late 1950s, but its use has been controversial because of its high potential for environmental contamination. In agriculture, the implementation of sustainable practices can help in reducing the adverse effects atrazine. This review addresses aspects related to the impacts of atrazine in the environment, with focus on its effects on aquatic species, as well as the potential use of nanoencapsulation to decrease the impacts of atrazine. The application of atrazine leads to its dispersal beyond the immediate area, with possible contamination of soils, sediments, plantations, pastures, public supply reservoirs, groundwater, streams, lakes, rivers, seas, and even glaciers. In aquatic ecosystems, atrazine can alter the biota, consequently interfering in the food chains of many species, including benthic organisms. Nanoformulations loaded with atrazine have been developed as a way to reduce the adverse impacts of this herbicide in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Ecotoxicological bioassays have shown that this nanoformulations can improve the targeted delivery of the active ingredient, resulting in decreased dosages to obtain the same effects as conventional formulations. However, more detailed analyses of the ecotoxicological potential of atrazine-based nanoherbicides need to be performed with representative species of different ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Preliminary evidence suggests that mind-body interventions, including mindfulness-based interventions and yoga, may be effective in reducing mental health difficulties and psychological distress in infertile patients undergoing fertility treatments. We systematically reviewed and synthesized current medical literature of the effectiveness of mind-body interventions in reducing the severity of psychological distress and improving marital function and pregnancy outcomes in infertile women/couple. Databases including PsychINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies. Manual searches were conducted in relevant articles. We included 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Four studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT), 4 non-randomized controlled trial (NRCT), and 4 uncontrolled studies (UCT). Participation in a mind-body intervention was associated with reduced anxiety trait and depression scores. The reduction was of low or moderate amplitude in most studies. Our review offers evidence for the effectiveness of mind-body interventions in reducing anxiety state and depression in infertile women and a possible improvement in pregnancy rate. Further RCTs with a precise timing of intervention are needed.

AB  - Mood disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder, are debilitating disorders that affect a significant portion of the global population. Individuals suffering from mood disorders often show significant disturbances in circadian rhythms and sleep. Moreover, environmental disruptions to circadian rhythms can precipitate or exacerbate mood symptoms in vulnerable individuals. Circadian clocks exist throughout the central nervous system and periphery, where they regulate a wide variety of physiological processes implicated in mood regulation. These processes include monoaminergic and glutamatergic transmission, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, metabolism, and immune function. While there seems to be a clear link between circadian rhythm disruption and mood regulation, the mechanisms that underlie this association remain unclear. This review will touch on the interactions between the circadian system and each of these processes and discuss their potential role in the development of mood disorders. While clinical studies are presented, much of the review will focus on studies in animal models, which are attempting to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms in which circadian genes regulate mood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the existing literature on the association between parents' depression and anxiety and their influence on their children's weight during childhood, identifying possible mechanisms involved in this association.
   METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in the PubMed, PsycINFO and SciELO databases, using the following descriptors: (maternal OR mother* OR parent* OR paternal OR father) AND ("common mental disorder" OR "mental health" OR "mental disorder" OR "depressive disorder" OR depress* OR anxiety OR "anxiety disorder") AND (child* OR pediatric OR offspring) AND (overweight OR obes* OR "body mass index" OR BMI). A total of 1,187 articles were found after peer selection.
   RESULTS: In total, 16 articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected for the review. Most of them investigated depressive symptoms and only three, symptoms of maternal anxiety. The evaluated studies suggested a positive association between symptoms of maternal depression and higher risk of childhood obesity. The results diverged according to the chronicity of depressive symptoms (episodic or recurrent depression) and income of the investigated country (high or middle income). Mechanisms were identified passing by quality of parenthood, affecting behaviors related to physical activity and child-feeding, as mediators of the association.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude there is evidence of a positive relationship between the occurrence of maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety and childhood obesity. It is emphasized the need for a better understanding on the effect of depressive symptoms and the contextual factors involved in this relationship so that effective intervention strategies can be implemented.

AB  - Psychologists and psychiatrists worldwide are expressing concerns regarding the growing prevalence of mental health problems and the incidence of suicide in young adults. The reasons are seen in the extremely high tempo of social changes, information pressure, and values evolution in the younger generations, which are exposed to growing inequalities, loneliness and lack of social support. Poverty, social isolation, consumerism, hedonism, and unrealistic expectations of the future generate in the vulnerable part of the young adults inevitable frustrations, which give way to depression, anxiety, addictions, and suicide. This creates additional risks for the situation on board ships, both military and merchant, and requires greater efforts during pre-admission selection and in the course of the service or voyages. Suicides in the Navy are better registered than in the cargo fleet and are lower than in the same age and gender groups from the general population, and usually lower than in other types of forces. Data on suicides in the civilian maritime sector are less conclusive, but suggest it as a growing problem, especially considering stress on board. Recent studies revealed quite a lot of mental health problems in the merchant fleet crews, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. Among the reasons such factor as "flag of convenience" strategy that implies lower standards, recruiting of the less trained and lower-paid workforce, multinational and multilanguage rotating crews, higher workload and stress and insufficient level of the pre-employment medical examination are mentioned. Recent trends in the mental health of the youth demand higher awareness both in the military ships and in the merchant fleet. We consider that more education and training aimed at mental health problems identification and stress-resilience promotion are needed both for the military and civilian staff on board. Better education of the whole personnel and "healthy ship" approach (better recognition of the crew members' needs, attention to mental health problems, nutrition, physical activity, etc.) may be applied both for the Navy and merchant fleet.

AB  - Objective This review aimed to examine systematically the epidemiological evidence linking work-related exposure to violence and threats thereof with risk of mental disorders and mental ill-health symptoms.
   Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science to identify original studies that provide quantitative risk estimates. The evidence was weighted according to completeness of reporting, potential common method bias, and bias due to differential selection and drop out, selective reporting, and misclassification of exposure and outcome.
   Results We identified 14 cross-sectional and 10 cohort studies with eligible risk estimates, of which 4 examined depressive disorder and reported an elevated risk among the exposed [pooled relative risk (RR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.54, I-2=%]. The occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, burnout and psychological distress was examined in 17 studies (pooled RR 2.33, 95% CI 3.17, I-2 =42%), and 3 studies examined risk of sleep disturbance (pooled RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.37, I-2 =%). In most studies, common method bias and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence and strong heterogeneity in most outcome definitions invalidate the strict interpretation of most pooled risk estimates.
   Conclusion The reviewed studies consistently indicate associations between workplace violence and mental health problems. However, due to methodological limitations the causal associations (if any) may be stronger or weaker than the ones reported in this study. Prospective studies with independent and validated reporting of exposure and outcome and repeated follow-up with relevant intervals are highly warranted.

This review aims to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health outcomes of hospital-based HCWs and formulate recommendations for future action.
   Methods: A systematic review was performed between 31st December 2019 and 17th June 2020 through Ovid Medline and Embase databases (PROSPERO ID CRD42020181204). Studies were included for review if they investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health outcomes of hospital-based HCWs and used validated psychiatric scoring tools. Prevalence of ICD-10 classified psychiatric disorders was the primary outcome measure.
   Results: The initial search returned 436 articles. Forty-four studies were included in final analysis, with a total of 69,499 subjects. Prevalence ranges of six mental health outcomes were identified: depression 13.5%-44.7%; anxiety 12.3%-35.6%; acute stress reaction 5.2%-32.9%; post-traumatic stress disorder 7.4%-37.4%; insomnia 33.8%-36.1%; and occupational burnout 3.1%-43.0%. Direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 patients was the most common risk factor identified for all mental health outcomes except occupational burnout. Nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs with low social support and fewer years of working experience reported the worst outcomes.
   Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly impacted the mental health of HCWs. Frontline staff demonstrate worse mental health outcomes. Hospitals should be staffed to meet service provision requirements and to mitigate the impact onmental health. This can be improved with access to rapid-response psychiatric teams and should be continually monitored throughout the pandemic and beyond its conclusion.

AB  - Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder appear to experience high levels of psychological distress, yet little is known about the prevalence of psychological disorders in this population. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the proportion of these parents who experience clinically significant psychopathology. Articles reporting proportions of psychological disorders in a sample of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were located. The initial search returned 25,988 articles. Thirty-one studies with a total sample of 9208 parents were included in the final review. The median meta-analytic proportions were 31% (95% confidence interval = [24%, 38%]) for depressive disorders, 33% (95% confidence interval = [20%, 48%]) for anxiety disorders, 10% (95% confidence interval = [1%, 41%]) for obsessive-compulsive disorder, 4% (95% confidence interval = [0%, 22%]) for personality disorders, 2% (95% confidence interval = [1%, 4%]) for alcohol and substance use disorders and 1% (95% confidence interval = [0%, 5%]) for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Significant heterogeneity was detected in these categories. Further research is needed to gain more insight into variables that may moderate parental psychopathology. This review and meta-analysis is the first to provide prevalence estimates of psychological disorders in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - Infection with the new corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) was first registered in December 2019 in China, and then later spread rapidly to the rest of the world. On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) informed the public for the first time about causes of pneumonnia of unknown origin, in the city of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China), in people who were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal whole sale local market in Wuhan. Coronavrus disease, called COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 2019), after China quickly spread to most countries in the wold, and the WHO on March 11, 2020 declared a pandmic with this virus. SARS-CoV-2, has a high level of sequential similarities to the SARS-CoV-1 and uses the same receptors when it enters the human body (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/ACE2). COVID-19 is respiratry infection that is primarily transmitted via respiratry droplets. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection can be very moderate (infected can be even asymptomatic) to very severe, with severe respiratory symptoms (bilateral severe pneumonia), septic schock, and fatal outcome. Numeous unknows regarding the biological, epidemilogical adn clinical characteristics of COVID-19, still exist, and make it impossible to predict with certainty the further course of the current pandemic.
   COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the respiratory system, but SARS-CoV-2, in a number of patients also penetrates the CNS, and apparently could be responsible for fatal outcome in some cases. The entrry of the virus into the brain can lead to neurological and psychiatric manifestationss, which are not uncommon, including headache, paresthesia, myalgia, impaired consciousnessm, confusion or delirum and cerebrovascular diseases.
   SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals should be evaluated in a timely manner for neurological and psychiatic symptoms because tretament of infection-related neurological and psychiatric complications is an important factor in better prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.From the current point of view, it seems that in COVID-19 survivors, in the coming years and decades, the inflammatory systemic process and/or the inflammatory process of the brain could trigger long-term mechanisms that generally lead to an increase of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.
   Psychosocial consequences as well as consequences for mental health are also significant, both for the general population and especially for health workers of all profiles.
   COVID-19 pandemia is associtaed with negative psychosocial consequences, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger and stress, sleep disorders, simpotms of posttrauamtic stres disorder, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization.

AB  - Leprosy has long-term consequences related to impairment and stigma. This includes a major impact on mental health. This study aims to consolidate current evidence regarding the mental health impact of leprosy on affected persons and their family members. In addition, determinants influencing mental health outcomes among leprosy-affected persons and effective interventions are examined. A keyword-based search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, Infolep and InfoNTD; additional literature was also considered. Articles presenting primary data involving leprosy-affected persons or their family members experiencing mental conditions were included. Independent extraction of articles was executed using predefined data fields. Articles were sorted according to relevance. In total, 65 studies were included in this systematic review. Multiple psychiatric morbidities have been identified among leprosy-affected persons, including depression, anxiety disorders and suicide (attempts). Additional factors were found that may impact mental health. Moreover, studies found that demographic factors, lifestyle and disease-specific factors and stigma and discrimination impact mental health. Depressive symptoms and low self-esteem were identified among children of leprosy-affected persons. In addition, interventions were identified that could improve the mental wellbeing of leprosy patients. Depressive disorders and anxiety disorders were found to be very common among persons affected by leprosy. Feelings such as fear, shame and low self-esteem are also experienced by those affected, and their children. Further research is necessary to ensure that mental health impact is included when determining the burden of disease for leprosy, and to relieve this burden.

AB  - Background: The crisis in Syria has resulted in vast numbers of refugees seeking asylum in Syria's neighboring countries and Europe. Refugees are at considerable risk of developing common mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Since the war, no systematic review has been conducted regarding the prevalence of these in the Syrian refugee group. Research is needed to develop strategies to improve the integration of Syrian refugees. Objective: This study provides a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles that feature originally collected data regarding the prevalence of post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety in adult Syrian refugees. Methods: The authors searched online databases (PsychInfo, PubMed, PILOTS) for peer-reviewed articles that used validated screening tools to provide mental health prevalence rate estimates in adult Syrian refugees. This article explores potential sources of heterogeneity, including individual risk factors such as demographic and environmental variables. Results: In total, 15 eligible studies provided cross-sectional data for 8176 adult Syrian refugees resettled in 10 countries, with significant variation in assessment and sampling methods. Combined, these studies indicate prevalence rates of 43.0% (range: 23.4-83.4%) for post-traumatic stress, 40.9% (range: 20-44.1%) for depression, and 26.6% (range: 19.30-31.8%) for anxiety morbidity in adult Syrian refugees. Larger and more rigorous surveys reported similar prevalence rates to studies with less rigorous designs, but vast heterogeneity in prevalence of morbidity persisted among all. Conclusions: Syrian refugees could be over 10 times more likely to develop post-traumatic stress and other disorders than the general population. Although there are limitations when comparing studies with different research methodologies, the results of this study suggest increased focus on adequate mental health support is necessary.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum psychosis (PPP) are serious mental conditions that are usually not diagnosed early enough, leading to delayed treatment. Several studies confirmed an association between preeclampsia (PE) and psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. We conducted a systematic review of the literature aiming to investigate whether women with a history of PE are more likely to develop PPD or PPP, and whether PE is a risk factor for depression outside the perinatal period (PROSPERO protocol number CRD42018114188). We also conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the severity of depressive symptoms between women with and without a history of PE. A literature search with no year and no language restriction was conducted. The search yielded 950 articles, with 698 remaining after duplicate removal, and 13 being suitable for the systematic review. Eight of the 13 studies found an association between preeclampsia and depression. All studies assessed the impact of PE on depression, and only two studies assessed the impact of PE on PPP. Eight of the studies were included in the meta-analysis, which yielded a higher severity of depressive symptoms postpartum in women with PE. However, these results must be interpreted with caution considering the high heterogeneity of the included studies. Our meta-analysis also showed that women with a history of PE showed higher severity of depressive symptoms outside of the puerperal period. In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that that PE is not only a risk factor for development of depression, but it is also associated with higher severity of depressive symptoms.

AB  - Background Medicinal cannabinoids, including medicinal cannabis and pharmaceutical cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have been suggested to have a therapeutic role in certain mental disorders. We analysed the available evidence to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of all types of medicinal cannabinoids in treating symptoms of various mental disorders.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and April 30, 2018. We also searched for unpublished or ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. We considered all studies examining any type and formulation of a medicinal cannabinoid in adults (>= 18 years) for treating depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis, either as the primary condition or secondary to other medical conditions. We placed no restrictions on language, publication status, or study type (ie, both experimental and observational study designs were included). Primary outcomes were remission from and changes in symptoms of these mental disorders. The safety of medicinal cannabinoids for these mental disorders was also examined. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as odds ratios (ORs) for disorder remission, adverse events, and withdrawals and as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059372, CRD42017059373, CRD42017059376, CRD42017064996, and CRD42018102977).
   Findings 83 eligible studies (40 randomised controlled trials, n=3067) were included: 42 for depression (23 randomised controlled trials; n=2551), 31 for anxiety (17 randomised controlled trials; n=605), eight for Tourette syndrome (two randomised controlled trials; n=36), three for ADHD (one randomised controlled trial; n=30), 12 for post-traumatic stress disorder (one randomised controlled trial; n=10), and 11 for psychosis (six randomised controlled trials; n=281). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) improved anxiety symptoms among individuals with other medical conditions (primarily chronic non-cancer pain and multiple sclerosis; SMD-0.25 [95% CI-0.49 to-0.01]; seven studies; n=252), although the evidence GRADE was very low. Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) worsened negative symptoms of psychosis in a single study (SMD 0.36 [95% CI 0.10 to 0.62]; n=24). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental disorders examined but did increase the number of people who had adverse events (OR 1.99 [95% CI 1.20 to 3.29]; ten studies; n=1495) and withdrawals due to adverse events (2.78 [1.59 to 4.86]; 11 studies; n=1621) compared with placebo across all mental disorders examined. Few randomised controlled trials examined the role of pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis.
   Interpretation There is scarce evidence to suggest that cannabinoids improve depressive disorders and symptoms, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. There is very low quality evidence that pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) leads to a small improvement in symptoms of anxiety among individuals with other medical conditions. There remains insufficient evidence to provide guidance on the use of cannabinoids for treating mental disorders within a regulatory framework. Further high-quality studies directly examining the effect of cannabinoids on treating mental disorders are needed. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim To systematically review evidence that objectively assessed level of physical fitness is associated with future risk of adverse mental health outcomes during the peak age range for onset of adult mental disorders. Methods Searches of Electronic databases (EBSCOhost, SPORTDISCUS, EMBASE, MedLINE, Cochrane database, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Dissertation Abstracts), supplemented by hand searches of journals, conference proceedings and citations. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to pool the intervention effects. Results Eight studies of adolescents and young adults were included in the qualitative review and six studies derived from four independent cohorts were included in the statistical analyses. Most publications reported on large samples (including >1 million), but male conscripts were over-represented in the study cohorts; quality of included studies was modest, and heterogeneity was significant. Meta-analytic estimates were conducted for different adverse mental health outcomes, but all showed an inverse association between fitness and incidence of mental disorders or suicidality. Overall, higher level of physical fitness was associated with lower rates of onset of mental health problems (odds ratio: 0.59; 95% confidence intervals: 0.54, 0.65). Conclusions All eligible studies were undertaken since 2010, suggesting this is an emerging but unfinished field of research. The study design and methodological limitations indicate that the reported results should be treated with caution. However, if the meta-analytic findings are reliably replicated for new cohorts of males and females, they have implications for research into the prevention of non-communicable diseases, as our review suggests that interventions should target physical and mental health in equal measure.

AB  - Background Over the past decade, smartphone use has become widespread amongst today's children and young people (CYP) which parallels increases in poor mental health in this group. Simultaneously, media concern abounds about the existence of 'smartphone addiction' or problematic smartphone use. There has been much recent research concerning the prevalence of problematic smartphone use is in children and young people who use smartphones, and how this syndrome relates to mental health outcomes, but this has not been synthesized and critically evaluated. Aims To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the prevalence of PSU and quantify the association with mental health harms. Methods A search strategy using Medical Subject Headings was developed and adapted for eight databases between January 1, 1st 2011 to October 15th 2017. No language restriction was applied. Of 924 studies identified, 41 were included in this review, three of which were cohort studies and 38 were cross sectional studies. The mental health outcomes were self-reported: depression; anxiety; stress; poor sleep quality; and decreased educational attainment, which were synthesized according to an a priori protocol. Results The studies included 41,871 CYP, and 55% were female. The median prevalence of PSU amongst CYP was 23.3% (14.0-31.2%). PSU was associated with an increased odds of depression (OR = 3.17;95%CI 2.30-4.37;I-2 = 78%); increased anxiety (OR = 3.05 95%CI 2.64-3.53;I-2 = 0%); higher perceived stress (OR = 1.86;95%CI 1.24-2.77;I-2 = 65%); and poorer sleep quality (OR = 2.60; 95%CI; 1.39-4.85, I-2 = 78%). Conclusions PSU was reported in approximately one in every four CYP and accompanied by an increased odds of poorer mental health. PSU is an evolving public health concern that requires greater study to determine the boundary between helpful and harmful technology use. Policy guidance is needed to outline harm reduction strategies.

AB  - Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) may be referred to by other terms (e.g., early life adversity or stress and childhood trauma) and have a lifelong impact on mental and physical health. For example, childhood trauma has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The heritability of ACE-related phenotypes such as PTSD, depression, and resilience is low to moderate, and, moreover, is very variable for a given phenotype, which implies that gene by environment interactions (such as through epigenetic modifications) may be involved in the onset of these phenotypes. Currently, there is increasing interest in the investigation of epigenetic contributions to ACE-induced differential health outcomes. Although there are a number of studies in this field, there are still research gaps. In this review, the basic concepts of epigenetic modifications (such as methylation) and the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the stress response are outlined. Examples of specific genes undergoing methylation in association with ACE-induced differential health outcomes are provided. Limitations in this field, e.g., uncertain clinical diagnosis, conceptual inconsistencies, and technical drawbacks, are reviewed, with suggestions for advances using new technologies and novel research directions. We thereby provide a platform on which the field of ACE-induced phenotypes in mental health may build.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this review is to evaluate the literature on the association between parental military-related factors and child well-being. Methods: We conducted a literature search for research published from 2000-2017 from NATO and Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries in the English language only. Eligible studies were those that included topics of military personnel and children's well-being; papers that included child maltreatment/abuse were excluded. Search databases included Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Results: Thirty-six predominantly United States (US)-based studies were included in the review: 27 of cross-sectional study design, 4 longitudinal, and 5 retrospective cohort studies. Discussion: The parental military-specific factors that affect child well-being are cumulative deployment months, frequent relocation, and factors related to relocation such as expanded household responsibility, disrupted daily routines, academic interruption, and disruption to social networks. These factors are associated with military children having higher levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties - such as symptoms of depression - than their civilian counterparts. Limitations of the review include the large proportion of studies with a cross-sectional design, as well as studies with small sample sizes. Indications for future research include looking at children from dual military families and the use of longitudinal study designs.

AB  - Background: Apart from its evident impact on physical health, physical activity also has a role to play in mental health. Individuals engaged in physical inactivity have been found to have higher morbidity and health care expenditure. In order to combat these issues and preserve mental health, interventions of exercise are typically advocated. This review aimed to assess the benefits of physical activity on common and severe mental disorders in the Indian context. Materials and methods: A Boolean search was carried out using both relevant keywords and MeSH terms. Articles were sourced from online databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Database, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. All studies included in the review were peer-reviewed articles exclusively from India with Indian subjects reporting the relationship between physical activity and at least one mental health outcome including depression, anxiety, psychosis, stress, self-esteem and cognitive functioning. Results: Nineteen articles were found eligible for the narrative review. Out of these, 7 were cross-sectional studies and 12 were intervention studies. Conclusion: Existing literature from India has shown promising results towards the impact of physical activity in mental health disorders. However, more research is needed in the assessment of physical activity and physical activity interventions suitable to the Indian context. This review found that exercise and yoga are effective in reducing mean scores for both severe and common mental disorders. Yoga had a more significant impact on patients with schizophrenia than exercise or no intervention. To confirm that exercise is an effective add-on treatment, further research is required.

AB  - Mental illness, deemed globally to account for 32% of years lived with a disability, generates significant impacts on workplaces. In particular, healthcare workers experience high rates of mental ill health such as burnout, stress, and depression due to workplace conditions including excessive workloads, workplace violence and bullying, which also produces negative effects on patients as well as on the happiness and wellbeing of those who remain at work. This review was undertaken to synthesize the evidence on workplace-based interventions at the organizational level promoting mental health and wellbeing among healthcare workers, to identify what has been receiving attention in this area and why, especially considering how such positive effects are produced. A search of three premier health-related databases identified 1290 articles that discussed healthcare workers, workplace interventions, and mental health. Following further examination, 46 articles were ultimately selected as meeting the criteria specifying interventions at the organizational level and combined with similar studies included in a relevant Cochrane review. The 60 chosen articles were then analyzed following a realist framework analyzing context, mechanism, and outcome. Most of the studies included in the realist review were conducted in high-income countries, and the types of organizational-level interventions studied included skills and knowledge development, leadership development, communication and team building, stress management as well as workload and time management. Common themes from the realist review highlight the importance of employee engagement in the intervention development and implementation process. The literature review also supports the recognized need for more research on mental health and happiness in low- and middle-income countries, and for studies evaluating the longer-term effects of workplace mental health promotion.

   Method: A literature search was conducted through four electronic databases from inception to February 2019. Considered for inclusion were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating exercise interventions and depression or anxiety as outcomes in people living with HIV (>= 18 years of age). Ten studies were included (n = 479 participants, 49.67% females at baseline), and the standardized mean difference (SMD) and heterogeneity were calculated using random-effect models. An additional pre-post meta-analysis was also conducted.
   Results: A large effect in favor of exercise when compared to controls was found for depression (SMD = -0.84, 95%CI = [-1.57, -0.11], p = 0.02) and anxiety (SMD = -1.23, 95%CI = [-2.42, 0.04], p = -0.04). Subgroup analyses for depression revealed large effects on depression for aerobic exercise only (SMD = -0.96, 95%CI = [-1.63, -0.30], p = 0.004), a frequency of >= 3 exercise sessions per week (SMD = -1.39, 95%CI = [-2.24, -0.54], p < 0.001), professionally supervised exercise (SMD = -1.40, 95%CI = [-2.46, -0.17], p = 0.03]), and high-quality studies (SMD = -1.31, 95%CI = [-2.46, -0.17], p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: Exercise seems to decrease depressive symptoms and anxiety in PLWH, but other larger and high-quality studies are needed to verify these effects.

AB  - Question This review will aim to critically evaluate the currently available literature concerning the use of online mobile-based applications and interventions in the detection, management and maintenance of children and young people's mental health and well-being. Study selection and analysis A systematic literature search of six electronic databases was conducted for relevant publications until May 2019, with keywords pertaining to mental health, well-being and problems, mobile or internet apps or interventions and age of the study population. The resulting titles were screened and the remaining 92 articles were assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria with a total of 4 studies included in the final review. Findings In general, young people seem to engage very well with this type of tools, and they demonstrate some positive effects in emotional self-awareness. There have been some studies about this issue and many of the outcomes were notstatistically significant. However, it is still a sparsely documented area, and more research is needed in order to prove these effects. Conclusions Mental health apps directed at young people have the potential to be important assessment, management and treatment tools, therefore creating easier access to health services, helping in the prevention of mental health issues and capacitating to self-help in case of need. However, a limited number of studies are currently available, and further assessments should be made in order to determine the outcomes of this type of interventions.

AB  - Background: Duloxetine hydrochloride (DUL) is an antidepressant included in the pharmacological class of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. The aim of this review was to elucidate current evidences on the use of DUL in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. PubMed database was searched from January 1, 2003, to September 30, 2018, using 11 key terms related to psychiatric disorders ("persistent depressive disorder," "dysthymic disorder," "bipolar disorder," "seasonal affective disorder," "obsessive-compulsive disorder," "social phobia," "panic disorder," "posttraumatic stress disorder," "schizophrenia," "eating disorders," "sexual disorders," "personality disorders") and one key term related to duloxetine ("duloxetine hydrochloride"). Article titles and abstracts were scanned to determine relevance to the topic. For additional studies, the authors also examined the reference lists of several of the included papers. Results: Duloxetine may be an effective treatment for mood spectrum disorders, panic disorder, several symptom clusters of borderline personality, and as add-on drug in schizophrenia. Modest or conflicting results have been found for the efficacy of duloxetine in obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating, and sexual disorders. Conclusion: Major limitations of the reviewed studies were short trial duration, small sample sizes, and the lack of control groups. Defining the potential role of DUL in the treatment of psychiatric disorders other than major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder needs further randomized, placebo-controlled studies.

AB  - In addition to the stresses common to medical school training, medical students in Nigeria face additional peculiar contemporary social problems due to income inequality, poverty, insecurity and political instability. These have a direct impact on their mental health and wellbeing. The aim of this study was to systematically review articles reporting on the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders among medical students in Nigeria. Studies were identified using MEDLINE, HINARI, African Journal Online (AJOL) and Google Scholar databases using search terms encompassing psychiatric morbidity amongst medical students. No date restrictions were applied to the search. The pooled prevalence estimate was calculated for each disorder. Psychological distress was present in 25.2% of the students, perceived stress in 60.5%, depression in 33.5% and anxiety in 28.8%. The current use of at least one psychoactive substance was present in up to 44.2%, while 35.5% of all the respondents had experienced one or more forms of abuse during their training as medical students. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among medical students in Nigeria is high. Positive coping mechanisms such as religiosity, positive reframing and resilience which were identified in this review should be optimized to reduce the burden.

AB  - Introduction: More than half of psychiatric patients have comorbid substance use disorder (dual diagnosis) and this rate, confirmed by many epidemiological studies, is substantially higher compared to general population. Combined operation of self-medication mechanisms, common etiological factors, and mutually causative influences most likely accounts for comorbidity, which, despite its clinical prevalence, remains underrepresented in psychiatric research, especially in terms of neuroimaging. The current paper attempts to review and discuss all existing methodologically sustainable structural and functional neuroimaging studies in comorbid subjects published in the last 20 years. Methods: Performing a systematic PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases search with predefined key-words and selection criteria, 43 structural and functional neuroimaging studies were analyzed. Results: Although markedly inconsistent and confounded by a variety of sources, available data suggest that structural brain changes are slightly more pronounced, yet not qualitatively different in comorbid patients compared to non-comorbid ones. In schizophrenia (SZ) patients, somewhat greater gray matter reduction is seen in cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal and frontotemporal cortex, limbic structures (hippocampus), and basal ganglia (striatum). The magnitude of structural changes is positively correlated to duration and severity of substance use, but it is important to note that at least in the beginning of the disease, dual diagnosis subjects tend to show less brain abnormalities and better cognitive functioning than pure SZ ones suggesting lower preexisting neuropathological burden. When analysing neuroimaging findings in SZ and bipolar disorder subjects, dorsolateral prefrontal, cingular, and insular cortex emerge as common affected areas in both groups which might indicate a shared endophenotypic (i.e., transdiagnostic) disruption of brain networks involved in executive functioning, emotional processing, and social cognition, rendering affected individuals susceptible to both mental disorder and substance misuse. In patients with anxiety disorders and substance misuse, a common neuroimaging finding is reduced volume of limbic structures (n. accumbens, hippocampus and amygdala). Whether this is a neuropathological marker of common predisposition to specific behavioral symptoms and drug addiction or a result from neuroadaptation changes secondary to substance misuse is unknown. Future neuroimaging studies with larger samples, longitudinal design, and genetic subtyping are warranted to enhance current knowledge on comorbidity.

AB  - BackgroundEmerging evidence shows sedentary behaviour may be associated with mental health outcomes. Yet, the strength of the evidence linking sedentary behaviour and stress is still unclear. This study aimed to synthesise evidence regarding associations between time spent in sedentary behaviour and stress in adults.MethodsA systematic search was conducted (January 1990 - September 2019). Following PRISMA guidelines, an evaluation of methodological quality, and best-evidence synthesis of associations between time in sedentary behaviour (including sitting time, TV viewing, computer use) and stress were presented. Twenty-six studies reporting on data from n=72,795 people (age 18-98y, 62.7% women) were included.ResultsAcross the studies (n=2 strong-, n=10 moderate- and n=14 weak-quality), there was insufficient evidence that overall time spent in sedentary behaviour and sitting time were associated with stress, particularly when using self-report measures of sedentary behaviour or stress. There was strong evidence of no association between TV viewing, or computer use and stress. Amongst studies using objective measures of sedentary behaviour and/or stress there was also strong evidence of no association.ConclusionAlthough previous research suggested sedentary behaviour may be linked to mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety, the evidence for an association between various types of sedentary behaviour and stress is limited in quality, and associations are either inconsistent or null. High-quality longitudinal/interventional research is required to confirm findings and determine the direction of associations between different contexts (i.e. purpose) and domains (i.e. leisure, occupational, transport) of sedentary behaviour and stress.

AB  - Background: The use of conversational agent interventions in mental health is growing at a fast pace. Recent existing reviews have focused exclusively on a subset of embodied conversational agent interventions despite other modalities aiming to achieve the common goal of improved mental health.
   Objective: This study aimed to review the use of conversational agent interventions in the treatment of mental health problems.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search using relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane library). Studies that reported on an autonomous conversational agent that simulated conversation and reported on a mental health outcome were included.
   Results: A total of 13 studies were included in the review. Among them, 4 full-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The rest were feasibility, pilot RCTs and quasi-experimental studies. Interventions were diverse in design and targeted a range of mental health problems using a wide variety of therapeutic orientations. All included studies reported reductions in psychological distress postintervention. Furthermore, 5 controlled studies demonstrated significant reductions in psychological distress compared with inactive control groups. In addition, 3 controlled studies comparing interventions with active control groups failed to demonstrate superior effects. Broader utility in promoting well-being in nonclinical populations was unclear.
   Conclusions: The efficacy and acceptability of conversational agent interventions for mental health problems are promising. However, a more robust experimental design is required to demonstrate efficacy and efficiency. A focus on streamlining interventions, demonstrating equivalence to other treatment modalities, and elucidating mechanisms of action has the potential to increase acceptance by users and clinicians and maximize reach.

AB  - Objective: Although Indigenous women are exposed to high rates of risk factors for perinatal mental health problems, the magnitude of their risk is not known. This lack of data impedes the development of appropriate screening and treatment protocols, as well as the proper allocation of resources for Indigenous women. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare rates of perinatal mental health problems among Indigenous and non-Indigenous women. Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science from their inceptions until February 2019. Studies were included if they assessed mental health in Indigenous women during pregnancy and/or up to 12 months postpartum. Results: Twenty-six articles met study inclusion criteria and 21 were eligible for meta-analysis. Indigenous identity was associated with higher odds of mental health problems (odds ratio [OR] 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 2.11). Odds were higher still when analyses were restricted to problems of greater severity (OR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.16) and young Indigenous women (OR 1.86; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.28). Conclusion: Indigenous women are at increased risk of mental health problems during the perinatal period, particularly depression, anxiety, and substance misuse. However, resiliency among Indigenous women, cultural teachings, and methodological issues may be affecting estimates. Future research should utilize more representative samples, adapt and validate diagnostic and symptom measures for Indigenous groups, and engage Indigenous actors, leaders, and related allies to help improve the accuracy of estimates, as well as the well-being of Indigenous mothers, their families, and future generations.

AB  - Different types of high-rise residential buildings have proliferated in different countries at least since the 1940s, for a range of reasons. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current state of evidence on how planning, urban design and architectural aspects of high-rise residential buildings may influence social well-being and mental health. A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Searches for peer-reviewed papers were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Scopus, SciELO, and Web of Science; 4100 papers were assessed. 23 empirical studies published between 1971 and 2016 were included. The review found that house type, floor level, as well as spaces intrinsic to high-rise residential buildings (e.g. shared stairwells) are associated with social well-being and mental health. However, conceptual gaps and methodological inconsistencies still characterise most of the research in this field. We expect that research about and policy attention to this subject may intensify due to its strategic relevance in the face of global challenges such as increasing urbanization and loneliness. This paper concludes by highlighting a number of recommendations for future research.

AB  - The role of nutrition in mental health is becoming increasingly acknowledged. Along with dietary intake, nutrition can also be obtained from "nutrient supplements", such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, amino acids and pre/probiotic supplements. Recently, a large number of meta-analyses have emerged examining nutrient supplements in the treatment of mental disorders. To produce a meta-review of this top-tier evidence, we identified, synthesized and appraised all meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy and safety of nutrient supplements in common and severe mental disorders. Our systematic search identified 33 meta-analyses of placebo-controlled RCTs, with primary analyses including outcome data from 10,951 individuals. The strongest evidence was found for PUFAs (particularly as eicosapentaenoic acid) as an adjunctive treatment for depression. More nascent evidence suggested that PUFAs may also be beneficial for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, whereas there was no evidence for schizophrenia. Folate-based supplements were widely researched as adjunctive treatments for depression and schizophrenia, with positive effects from RCTs of high-dose methylfolate in major depressive disorder. There was emergent evidence for N-acetylcysteine as a useful adjunctive treatment in mood disorders and schizophrenia. All nutrient supplements had good safety profiles, with no evidence of serious adverse effects or contraindications with psychiatric medications. In conclusion, clinicians should be informed of the nutrient supplements with established efficacy for certain conditions (such as eicosapentaenoic acid in depression), but also made aware of those currently lacking evidentiary support. Future research should aim to determine which individuals may benefit most from evidence-based supplements, to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Background Although many meta-analyses have examined the association between childhood sexual abuse and subsequent outcomes, the scope, validity, and quality of this evidence has not been comprehensively assessed. We aimed to systematically review existing meta-analyses on a wide range of long-term psychiatric, psychosocial, and physical health outcomes of childhood sexual abuse, and evaluate the quality of the literature.
   Methods In this umbrella review, we searched four databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Global Health) from inception to Dec 31,2018, to identify meta-analyses of observational studies that examined the association between childhood sexual abuse (before 18 years of age) and long-term consequences (after 18 years). We compared odds ratios (ORs) across different outcomes. We also examined measures of quality, including heterogeneity between studies and evidence for publication bias. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42016049701.
   Findings We identified 19 meta-analyses that included 559 primary studies, covering 28 outcomes in 4 089 547 participants. Childhood sexual abuse was associated with 26 of 28 specific outcomes: specifically, six of eight adult psychiatric diagnoses (ORs ranged from 2.2 [95% CI 1.8-2.8] to 3.3 [2.2-4. 8]), all studied negative psychosocial outcomes (ORs ranged from 1.2 [1.1-1.4] to 3.4 [2.3-4.8]), and all physical health conditions (ORs ranged from 1.4 [1.3-1.6] to 1.9 [1.4-2.8]). Strongest psychiatric associations with childhood sexual abuse were reported for conversion disorder (OR 3.3 [95% CI 2.2-4.8]), borderline personality disorder (2.9 [2.5-3.3]), anxiety (2.7 [2.5-2.8]), and depression (2.7 [2.4-3.0]). The systematic reviews for two psychiatric outcomes (post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia) and one psychosocial outcome (substance misuse) met high quality standards. Quality was low for meta-analyses on borderline personality disorder and anxiety, and moderate for conversion disorder. Assuming causality, population attributable risk fractions for outcomes ranged from 1.7% (95% CI 0.7-3.3) for unprotected sexual intercourse to 14.4% (8.8-19-9) for conversion disorder.
   Interpretation Although childhood sexual abuse was associated with a wide range of psychosocial and health outcomes, systematic reviews on only two psychiatric disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia) and one psychosocial outcome (substance misuse) were of a high quality. Whether services should prioritise interventions that mitigate developing certain psychiatric disorders following childhood abuse requires further review. Higher-quality meta-analyses for specific outcomes and more empirical studies on the developmental pathways from childhood sexual abuse to later outcomes are necessary. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background Co-occurring mental health or psychiatric conditions are common in autism, impairing quality of life. Reported prevalences of co-occurring mental health or psychiatric conditions in people with autism range widely. Improved prevalence estimates and identification of moderators are needed to enhance recognition and care, and to guide future research.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and grey literature for publications between Jan 1,1993, and Feb 1,2019, in English or French, that reported original research using an observational design on the prevalence of co-occurring mental health conditions in people with autism and reported confirmed clinical diagnoses of the co-occurring conditions and autism using DSM or ICD criteria. For co-occurring mental health conditions reported with at least 15 datapoints (studies), we assessed risk of bias and we determined pooled estimates of prevalence for different co-occurring conditions in autism using random-effects models, and descriptively compared these with prevalence estimates for the general population from the literature (post hoc). We investigated heterogeneity in prevalence estimates using random-effects meta-regression models. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018103176.
   Findings Of 9746 unique studies identified, 432 were selected for full-text review. 100 studies were eligible for inclusion in our qualitative synthesis, of which 96 were included in our meta-analyses. 11 categories of co-occurring conditions were investigated, of which eight conditions were included in the meta-analyses and three were descriptively synthesised (ie, trauma and stressor-related disorders, substance-related and addictive disorders, and gender dysphoria). From our meta-analyses, we found overall pooled prevalence estimates of 28% (95% CI 25-32) for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 20% (17-23) for anxiety disorders; 13% (9-17) for sleep-wake disorders; 12% (10-15) for disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders; 11% (9-13) for depressive disorders; 9% (7-10) for obsessive-compulsive disorder; 5% (3-6) for bipolar disorders; and 4% (3-5) for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Estimates in clinical sample-based studies were higher than in population-based and registry-based studies, and these estimates were mostly higher than those in the general population (post hoc). Age, gender, intellectual functioning, and country of study were associated with heterogeneity in prevalence estimates, yet remaining heterogeneity not explained was still substantial (all I-2 >95%).
   Interpretation Co-occurring mental health conditions are more prevalent in the autism population than in the general population. Careful assessment of mental health is an essential component of care for all people on the autism spectrum and should be integrated into clinical practice. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Endometriosis is a common gynecological condition associated with debilitaing pain and poor mental health. This review examines the evidence for psychological and mind-body (PMB) interventions to improve endometriosis pain, psychological distress, sleep and fatigue. Electronic databases searched included PsychINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and PubMed. Inclusion criteria were women with endometriosis, and interventions that used psychological or mind-body interventions; there were no exclusion criteria regarding study design. Studies were identified and coded using standard criteria, and risk of bias was assessed with established tools relevant to the study design. A total of 12 publications relating to 9 separate studies were identified:- 3 randomized controlled trials, 1 controlled trial, 2 single-arm studies, 1 retrospective cohort study, and 2 case series. Interventions included yoga, mindfulness, relaxation training, cognitive behavioural therapy combined with physical therapy, Chinese medicine combined with psychotherapy, and biofeedback. Results indicate that no studies have yet used gold-standard methodology and, thus, definitive conclusions cannot be offered about PMB efficacy. However, the results of these pilot studies suggest that PMB interventions show promise in alleviating pain, anxiety, depression, stress and fatigue in women with endometriosis, and future well-designed RCTs including active control groups are warranted.

AB  - Objective: Evidence-based therapies for posttraumatic stress disorder are underutilized and at times unavailable in specialty settings. We reviewed the literature on interventions to treat PTSD within primary care to make recommendations on their effectiveness as treatment modalities or ways to improve engagement in specialty care.
   Method: We searched PubMed, PsychInfo, CINHAL, and Cochrane Reviews databases using search terms related to PTSD and primary care. We excluded clinical guidelines and studies of screening only or subthreshold PTSD.
   Results: 524 articles were identified. Twenty-one papers on 15 interventions met review criteria. Seven interventions focus on individual therapies studied via small feasibility studies to prepare for full-scale intervention research. Eight describe treatment programs in primary care based on collaborative care that included medication management, tracking outcomes, referral services, and for some psychotherapy (versus psychotherapy referral). Ten interventions were feasibility studies which precludes meaningful comparison of effect sizes. Of the four RCTs of treatment programs, only two including some psychotherapy found improvements in PTSD symptoms.
   Conclusion: More research is needed to adapt treatment for PTSD to primary care. Collaborative care may be a promising framework for improving the reach of PTSD treatments when psychotherapy is offered within the collaborative care team.

AB  - Objective: We reviewed studies pertaining to randomized controlled universal/Tier 1, teacherled intervention trials in United States (US) schools, and their impact on anxiety in K-12 students. Methods: We searched 7 databases and one search engine. Anxiety was the main outcome measure. Studies published through July 5, 2018 were appraised using the Cochrane Collaborations tool. Results: We included 4 studies, all indicating efficacy for lowering anxiety symptoms. Internal bias was unclear for 3. Conclusion: Despite a call from the National Institute of Mental Health for population-based, upstream public health interventions, empirical evidence is scarce. Findings from this review are reflected by the absence of such studies from the Healthy People 2020 recommendations for evidence-based resources consumer page. There appears to be a need for development and testing of universal teacher-led anxiety interventions in US schools.
