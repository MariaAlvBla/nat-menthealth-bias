AB  - Purpose of review
   To review the rationale behind and the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Established as well as new candidate biomarkers will be covered.
   Recent findings
   AD is a complex disorder and the AD brain is characterized by multiple pathological processes, in addition to well-described plaque and tangle diseases. Recent studies have tried to address this by evaluating biomarkers related to features such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, microglial activation and synaptic degeneration, with some positive results.
   Summary
   The CSF biomarkers total tau, phosphorylated-tau and the 42 amino acid isoform of amyloid beta reflect core elements of AD, that is, axonal degeneration, tangle disease and senile plaques, have been thoroughly tested and provide high diagnostic accuracy in the discrimination of patients with AD as compared with cognitively normal controls. They are also highly predictive of AD with dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment, and have been included in new diagnostic criteria. New biomarkers may add to their diagnostic performance. Other potential fields of use include the monitoring of disease progression or pharmacodynamic drug effects. A common denominator for the candidate biomarkers is the need for validation in further studies to clarify their potential.

AB  - Aim: Conduct a systematic review for the effectiveness of school mental health literacy programs to enhance knowledge, reduce stigmatizing attitudes and improve help-seeking behaviours among youth (1225 years of age). Methods: Reviewers independently searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, ERIC, grey literature and reference lists of included studies. They reached a consensus on the included studies, and rated the risk of bias of each study. Studies that reported three outcomes: knowledge acquisition, stigmatizing attitudes and help-seeking behaviours; and were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi-experimental studies, and controlled-before-and-after studies, were eligible. Results: This review resulted in 27 articles including 5 RCTs, 13 quasi-experimental studies, and 9 controlled-before-and-after studies. Whereas most included studies claimed school-based mental health literacy programs improve knowledge, attitudes and help-seeking behaviour, 17 studies met criteria for high risk of bias, 10 studies for moderate risk of bias, and no studies for low risk of bias. Common limitations included the lack of randomization, control for confounding factors, validated measures and report on attrition in most studies. The overall quality of the evidence for knowledge and help-seeking behaviour outcomes was very low, and low for the attitude outcome. Conclusions: Research into school-based mental health literacy is still in its infancy and there is insufficient evidence to claim for positive impact of school mental health literacy programs on knowledge improvement, attitudinal change or help-seeking behaviour. Future research should focus on methods to appropriately determine the evidence of effectiveness on school-based mental health literacy programs, considering the values of both RCTs and other research designs in this approach. Educators should consider the strengths and weaknesses of current mental health literacy programs to inform decisions regarding possible implementation.

AB  - Sleep disorders are nearly ubiquitous among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and they manifest early in the disease process. While there are a number of possible mechanisms underlying these sleep disturbances, a primary dysfunction of the circadian system should be considered as a contributing factor. Our laboratory's behavioral phenotyping of a well-validated transgenic mouse model of PD reveals that the electrical activity of neurons within the master pacemaker of the circadian system, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), is already disrupted at the onset of motor symptoms, although the core features of the intrinsic molecular oscillations in the SCN remain functional. Our observations suggest that the fundamental circadian deficit in these mice lies in the signaling output from the SCN, which may be caused by known mechanisms in PD etiology: oxidative stress and mitochondrial disruption. Disruption of the circadian system is expected to have pervasive effects throughout the body and may itself lead to neurological and cardiovascular disorders. In fact, there is much overlap in the non-motor symptoms experienced by PD patients and in the consequences of circadian disruption. This raises the possibility that the sleep and circadian dysfunction experienced by PD patients may not merely be a subsidiary of the motor symptoms, but an integral part of the disease. Furthermore, we speculate that circadian dysfunction can even accelerate the pathology underlying PD. If these hypotheses are correct, more aggressive treatment of the circadian misalignment and sleep disruptions in PD patients early in the pathogenesis of the disease may be powerful positive modulators of disease progression and patient quality of life.

AB  - Adaptive behaviors increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction and improve the quality of life. However, it is often difficult to identify optimal behaviors in real life due to the complexity of the decision maker's environment and social dynamics. As a result, although many different brain areas and circuits are involved in decision making, evolutionary and learning solutions adopted by individual decision makers sometimes produce suboptimal outcomes. Although these problems are exacerbated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, their underlying neurobiological causes remain incompletely understood. In this review, theoretical frameworks in economics and machine learning and their applications in recent behavioral and neurobiological studies are summarized. Examples of such applications in clinical domains are also discussed for substance abuse, Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and autism. Findings from these studies have begun to lay the foundations necessary to improve diagnostics and treatment for various neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Episodic memory refers to the conscious recollection of a personal experience that contains information on what has happened and also where and when it happened. Recollection from episodic memory also implies a kind of first-person subjectivity that has been termed autonoetic consciousness. Episodic memory is extremely sensitive to cerebral aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease deficits in episodic memory function are among the first cognitive symptoms observed. Furthermore, impaired episodic memory function is also observed in a variety of other neuropsychiatric diseases including dissociative disorders, schizophrenia, and Parkinson disease. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to induce and measure episodic memories in the laboratory and it is even more difficult to measure it in clinical populations. Presently, the tests used to assess episodic memory function do not comply with even down-sized definitions of episodic-like memory as a memory for what happened, where, and when. They also require sophisticated verbal competences and are difficult to apply to patient populations. In this review, we will summarize the progress made in defining behavioral criteria of episodic-like memory in animals (and humans) as well as the perspectives in developing novel tests of human episodic memory which can also account for phenomenological aspects of episodic memory such as autonoetic awareness. We will also define basic behavioral, procedural, and phenomenological criteria which might be helpful for the development of a valid and reliable clinical test of human episodic memory.

AB  - Background: The rate of non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka has increased in recent years, with associated morbidity and economic cost to the country. This review examines the published literature for the characteristics and factors associated with non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka.
   Methods: Electronic searches were conducted in Psychinfo, Proquest, Medline and Cochrane databases from inception to October 2011.
   Results: 26 publications (representing 23 studies) were eligible to be included in the review. A majority of studies reported non-fatal self-poisoning to be more common among males, with a peak age range of 10-30 years. Pesticide ingestion was the most commonly used method of non-fatal self-poisoning. However three studies conducted within the last ten years, in urban areas of the country, reported non-fatal self-poisoning by medicinal overdose to be more common, and also reported non-fatal self-poisoning to be more common among females. Interpersonal conflict was the most commonly reported short-term stressor associated with self-poisoning. Alcohol misuse was reported among males who self-poisoned, and data regarding other psychiatric morbidity was limited.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that pesticide ingestion is the commonest method of non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka, and it is more common among young males, similar to other Asian countries. However there appears to be an emerging pattern of increasing medicinal overdoses, paralleled by a gender shift towards increased female non-fatal self-poisoning in urban areas.
   Many non-fatal self-poisoning attempts appear to occur in the context of acute interpersonal stress, with short premeditation, and associated with alcohol misuse in males. Similar to other Asian countries, strategies to reduce non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka require integrated intervention programs with several key aspects, including culturally appropriate interventions to develop interpersonal skills in young people, community based programs to reduce alcohol misuse, and screening for and specific management of those at high risk of repetition following an attempt of self-poisoning.

AB  - Objective: Technological advances in medicine have given rise to a dilemma concerning the use of new health technologies in a context of limited financial resources. In the field of psychiatry, health economic evaluation is a recent method that can assist in choosing interventions with different cost and/or effectiveness for specific populations or conditions. This article introduces clinicians to the fundamental concepts required for critical assessment of health economic evaluations.
   Methods: The authors conducted a review with systematic methods to assess the essential theoretical framework of health economic evaluation and mental health in Brazil through textbooks and studies indexed in the PubMed, Cochrane Central, LILACS, NHS CRD, and REBRATS databases. A total of 334 studies were found using the specified terms (MeSH - Mental Health AND Economic, Medical) and filters (Brazil AND Humans); however, only five Brazilian economic evaluations were found.
   Results and conclusions: Economic evaluation studies are growing exponentially in the medical literature. Publications focusing on health economics as applied to psychiatry are increasingly common, but Brazilian data are still very incipient. In a country where financial resources are so scarce, economic analyses are necessary to ensure better use of public resources and wider population access to effective health technologies.

AB  - Background: To date, research on mental health in HIV- affected children (children who have an HIV-positive caregiver or live with the virus themselves) has focused on risk factors associated with the disease. However, simultaneous identification of factors that contribute to resilience in the face of risks is also needed. A greater understanding of modifiable protective processes that contribute to resilience in the mental health of children affected by HIV can inform the design of interventions that bolster naturally occurring supports and contribute to early prevention or better management of risks. Methods: We reviewed the recent literature on mental health and resilience in children and adolescents affected by HIV/AIDS. Literature searches of PsycInfo and PubMed were conducted during JulyDecember 2011 consistent with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included for review if primary research questions pertained to mental health and coping or protective processes in children and families affected by HIV/AIDS. All studies subject to full review were evaluated for quality using a modified Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR) rating system. Results: One hundred and seventy one unique studies were returned from online searches of the literature and bibliography mining. Of these, 29 were evaluated as pertaining directly to mental health and resilience in families and children living with HIV/AIDS. Eight studies presented qualitative analyses. Ten quantitative studies examined individual resources contributing to child resilience and four quantitative studies looked at family-level resources. Ten studies also investigated community level interactions. Four presented findings from resilience-focused interventions. Conclusions: There is a clear need for rigorous research on mental health and resilience in HIV-affected children and adolescents. The evidence base would greatly benefit from more standardized and robust approaches to thinking about resilience from an ecological perspective inclusive of resources at multiple levels and their interactions.

AB  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the main intracellular pathway for modulated protein turnover, playing an important role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. It also exerts a protein quality control through degradation of oxidized, mutant, denatured, or misfolded proteins and is involved in many biological processes where protein level regulation is necessary. This system allows the cell to modulate its protein expression pattern in response to changing physiological conditions and provides a critical protective role in health and disease. Impairments of UPS function in the central nervous system (CNS) underlie an increasing number of genetic and idiopathic diseases, many of which affect the retina. Current knowledge on the UPS composition and function in this tissue, however, is scarce and dispersed. This review focuses on UPS elements reported in the retina, including ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), and alternative proteasome assemblies. Known and inferred roles of protein ubiquitination, and of the related, SUMO conjugation (SUMOylation) process, in normal retinal development and adult homeostasis are addressed, including modulation of the visual cycle and response to retinal stress and injury. Additionally, the relationship between UPS dysfunction and human neurodegenerative disorders affecting the retina, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, are dealt with, together with numerous instances of retina-specific illnesses with UPS involvement, such as retinitis pigmentosa, macular degenerations, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and aging-related impairments. This information, though still basic and limited, constitutes a suitable framework to be expanded in incoming years and should prove orientative toward future therapy design targeting sight-affecting diseases with a UPS underlying basis.

AB  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the primary proteolytic complex responsible for the elimination of damaged and misfolded intracellular proteins, often formed upon oxidative stress. Parkinson's disease (PD) is neuropathologically characterized by selective death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and accumulation of intracytoplasmic inclusions of aggregated proteins. Along with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, defects in the UPS have been implicated in PD. Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP) is a phase II detoxifying enzyme displaying important defensive roles against the accumulation of reactive metabolites that potentiate the aggression of SN neuronal cells, by regulating several processes including S-glutathionylation, modulation of glutathione levels and control of kinase-catalytic activities. In this work we used C57BL/6 wild-type and GSTP knockout mice to elucidate the effect of both MPTP and MG132 in the UPS function and to clarify if the absence of GSTP alters the response of this pathway to the neurotoxin and proteasome inhibitor insults. Our results demonstrate that different components of the UPS have different susceptibilities to oxidative stress. Importantly, when compared to the wild-type, GSTP knockout mice display decreased ubiquitination capacity and overall increased susceptibility to UPS damage and inactivation upon MPTP-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - A rapid response to a threatening face in a crowd is important to successfully interact in social environments. Visual search tasks have been employed to determine whether there is a processing advantage for detecting an angry face in a crowd, compared to a happy face. The empirical findings supporting the anger superiority effect (ASE), however, have been criticized on the basis of possible low-level visual confounds and because of the limited ecological validity of the stimuli. Moreover, a happiness superiority effect is usually found with more realistic stimuli. In the present study, we tested the ASE by using dynamic (and static) images of realistic human faces, with validated emotional expressions having similar intensities, after controlling the bottom-up visual saliency and the amount of image motion. In five experiments, we found strong evidence for an ASE when using dynamic displays of facial expressions, but not when the emotions were expressed by static face images.

AB  - The hypothesis that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disturbances are the hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), proposed by Ross and colleagues in 1989, has stimulated a wealth of clinical, preclinical, and animal studies on the role of sleep in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The present review revisits this influential hypothesis in light of clinical and experimental findings that have since accumulated. Polysomnographic studies conducted in adults with PTSD have yielded mixed findings regarding REM sleep disturbances, and they generally suggest modest and nonspecific sleep disruptions. Prospective and treatment studies have provided more robust evidence for the relationship between sleep disturbances and psychiatric outcomes and symptoms. Experimental animal and human studies that have probed the relationship between REM sleep and fear responses, as well as studies focused more broadly on sleep-dependent affective and memory processes, also provide strong support for the hypothesis that sleep plays an important role in PTSD-relevant processes. Overall, the literature suggests that disturbed REM or non-REM sleep can contribute to maladaptive stress and trauma responses and may constitute a modifiable risk factor for poor psychiatric outcomes. Clinicians need to consider that the chronic sleep disruption associated with nightmares may affect the efficacy of first-line PTSD treatments, but targeted sleep treatments may accelerate recovery from PTSD. The field is ripe for prospective and longitudinal studies in high-risk groups to clarify how changes in sleep physiology and neurobiology contribute to increased risk of poor psychiatric outcomes.

Their purpose is to supply a systematic overview of all scientific evidence pertaining to the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder in adults. Methods. Material used for these guidelines are based on a systematic literature search using various data bases. Their scientific rigor was categorised into six levels of evidence (A-F) and different grades of recommendation to ensure practicability were assigned. Results. Maintenance trial designs are complex and changed fundamentally over time; thus, it is not possible to give an overall recommendation for long-term treatment. Different scenarios have to be examined separately: Prevention of mania, depression, or an episode of any polarity, both in acute responders and in patients treated de novo. Treatment might differ in Bipolar II patients or Rapid cyclers, as well as in special subpopulations. We identified several medications preventive against new manic episodes, whereas the current state of research into the prevention of new depressive episodes is less satisfactory. Lithium continues to be the substance with the broadest base of evidence across treatment scenarios. Conclusions. Although major advances have been made since the first edition of this guideline in 2004, there are still areas of uncertainty, especially the prevention of depressive episodes and optimal long-term treatment of Bipolar II patients.

AB  - The toxicity of alpha-synuclein in the neuropathology of Parkinson's disease which includes its hallmark aggregation has been studied scrupulously in the last decade. Although little is known regarding the normal functions of alpha-synuclein, its association with membrane phospholipids suggests its potential role in signaling pathways. Following extensive evidences for its nuclear localization, we and others recently demonstrated DNA binding activity of alpha-synuclein that modulates its conformation as well as aggregation properties. Furthermore, we also underscored the similarities among various amyloidogenic proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases including amyloid beta peptides and tau. Our more recent studies show that alpha-synuclein is glycated and glycosylated both in vitro and in neurons, significantly affecting its folding, oligomeric, and DNA binding properties. Glycated alpha-synuclein causes increased genome damage both via its direct interaction with DNA and by increased generation of reactive oxygen species as glycation byproduct. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of glycation and other posttranslational modifications of alpha-synuclein, including phosphorylation and nitration, and their role in neuronal death in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Background Adaptation is key to survival. An organism must adapt to environmental challenges in order to be able to thrive in the environment in which they find themselves. Resilience can be thought of as a measure of the ability of an organism to adapt, and to withstand challenges to its stability. In higher animals, the brain is a key player in this process of adaptation and resilience, and through a process known as allostasis can obtain stability through change; protecting homeostasis in the face of stressors in the environment. Mediators of allostasis, such as glucocorticoids, can cause changes in the structure and function of neural circuits, clearly impacting behavior. How developmental stage interacts with stress and leads to long-lasting changes is a key question addressed in this review. Scope and Methods We discuss the concept of allostasis, its role in resilience, the neural and physiological systems mediating these responses, the modulatory role of development, and the consequences for adult functioning. We present this in the context of mediators the brain and body engage to protect against threats to homeostasis. The review has been informed by comprehensive searches on PubMed and Scopus through November 2012. Findings Stressors in the environment can have long lasting effects on development, depending upon the stage of life at which they are experienced. As such, adverse childhood experiences can alter resilience of individuals, making it more difficult for them to respond normally to adverse situations in adulthood, but the brain maintains the capacity to re-enter a more plastic state where such effects can be mitigated. Conclusions The brain regulates responses that allow for adaptation to challenges in the environment. The capacity of the brain and body to withstand challenges to stability can be considered as resilience. While adverse childhood experiences can have long-term negative consequences, under the right circumstances, the brain can re-enter plastic states, and negative outcomes may be mitigated, even later in life.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, defined by the presence of resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. PD is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. The neuropathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions, called Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs), containing alpha-synuclein, a small protein which is widely expressed in the brain. The alpha-synuclein gene, SNCA, is located on chromosome 4q22.1; SNCA-linked PD shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with a relatively early onset age, and it usually progresses rapidly. Three missense mutations, A53T, A30P, and E46K, in addition to gene multiplications of the SNCA have been described so far. Although it is clear that LBs and LNs contain mainly the alpha-synuclein protein, the mechanism(s) which leads alpha-synuclein to accumulate needs to be elucidated. The primary question in the molecular pathology of PD is how wild-type alpha-synuclein aggregates in PD, and which interacting partner(s) plays role(s) in the aggregation process. It is known that dopamine synthesis is a stressfull event, and alpha-synuclein expression somehow affects the dopamine synthesis. The aberrant interactions of alpha-synuclein with the proteins in the dopamine synthesis pathway may cause disturbances in cellular mechanisms. The normal physiological folding state of alpha-synuclein is also important for the understanding of pathological aggregates. Recent studies on the alpha-synuclein protein and genome-wide association studies of the alpha-synuclein gene show that PD has a strong genetic component, and both familial and idiopathic PD have a common denominator, alpha-synuclein, at the molecular level. It is clear that the disease process in Parkinson's disease, as in other neurodegenerative disorders, is very complicated; there can be several different molecular pathways which are responsible for diverse and possibly also unrelated functions inside the neuron, playing roles in PD pathogenesis.

AB  - Objectives We assessed the evidence relating preterm delivery (PTD), low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension to five occupational exposures (working hours, shift work, lifting, standing and physical workload). We conducted a systematic search in Medline and Embase (1966 to 2011), updating a previous search with a further 6 years of observations.
   Methods As before, combinations of keywords and medical subject headings were used. Each relevant paper was assessed for completeness of reporting and potential for important bias or confounding, and its effect estimates abstracted. Where similar definitions of exposure and outcome existed we calculated pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) in meta-analysis.
   Results Analysis was based on 86 reports (32 cohort investigations, 57 with usable data on PTD, 54 on birth weight and 11 on pre-eclampsia/gestational hypertension); 33 reports were new to this review. For PTD, findings across a substantial evidence base were generally consistent, effectively ruling out large effects (eg, RR>1.2). Larger and higher quality studies were less positive, while meta-estimates of risk were smaller than in previous analyses and best estimates pointed to modest or null effects (RR 1.04 to 1.18). For SGA, the position was similar but meta-estimates were even closer to the null (eight of nine RRs <= 1.07). For pre-eclampsia/gestational hypertension the evidence base remains insufficient.
   Conclusions The balance of evidence is against large effects for the associations investigated. As the evidence base has grown, estimates of risk in relation to these outcomes have become smaller.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a review of the literature on the possible neuropsychological deficits present in patients with panic disorder.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review and search of the PubMed, ISI and PsycInfo scientific databases, with no time limits, using the following key words: cognitive, function, panic, and disorder. Of the 971 articles found, 25 were selected and 17 were included in this review. The inclusion criterion was at least one neuropsychological assessment task in patients with panic disorder.
   Results: The number of publications has grown gradually, especially those assessing executive functions, corresponding to the neurobiological model most widely accepted. Of all the functions evaluated, these patients had lower performance in memory tasks and higher performance in affective processing tasks related to the disorder. However, these data require further investigation due to the high rate of comorbidities, the small sample sizes of the included studies and little standardization of instruments used.
   Conclusion: The results showed a greater occurrence of deficits in memory and enhanced affective processing related to panic disorder.

AB  - Importance: Untreated depression during pregnancy has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality for both mother and child and, as such, optimal treatment strategies are required for this population.
   Context: There are conflicting data regarding potential risks of prenatal antidepressant treatment.
   Objective: To determine whether prenatal antidepressant exposure is associated with risk for selected adverse pregnancy or delivery outcomes.
   Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched from their start dates to June 30, 2010.
   Study Selection: English-language studies reporting outcomes associated with pharmacologic treatment during pregnancy were included. We reviewed 3074 abstracts, retrieved 735 articles, and included 23 studies in this meta-analysis.
   Data Extraction: Study design, antidepressant exposure, adjustment for confounders, and study quality were extracted by 2 independent reviewers.
   Results: There was no significant association between antidepressant medication exposure and spontaneous abortion (odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.17; P=.055). Gestational age and preterm delivery were statistically significantly associated with antidepressant exposure (mean difference [MD] [weeks], -0.45; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.25; P<.001; and OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.74; P<.001, respectively), regardless of whether the comparison group consisted of all unexposed mothers or only depressed mothers without antidepressant exposure. Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy was significantly associated with lower birth weight (MD [grams], -74; 95% CI, -117 to -31; P=.001); when this comparison group was limited to depressed mothers without antidepressant exposure, there was no longer a significant association. Antidepressant exposure was significantly associated with lower Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, regardless of whether the comparison group was all mothers or only those who were depressed during pregnancy but not exposed to antidepressants.
   Conclusions and Relevance: Although statistically significant associations between antidepressant exposure and pregnancy and delivery outcomes were identified, group differences were small and scores in the exposed group were typically within the normal ranges, indicating the importance of considering clinical significance. Treatment decisions must weigh the effect of untreated maternal depression against the potential adverse effects of antidepressant exposure.

AB  - I Corticostriatal projections are essential components of forebrain circuits and are widely involved in motivated behaviour. These axonal projections are formed by two distinct classes of cortical neurons, intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Convergent evidence points to IT versus PT differentiation of the corticostriatal system at all levels of functional organization, from cellular signalling mechanisms to circuit topology. There is also growing evidence for IT/PT imbalance as an aetiological factor in neurodevetopmental, neuropsychiatric and movement disorders autism, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases and major depression are highlighted here.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurological condition that affects about 1 % of people older than 65 years of age. In PD, dopaminergic neurons in the mid-brain slowly accumulate cytoplasmic inclusions (Lewy bodies, LBs) of the protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and then gradually lose function and die off. Cell death is thought to be causally linked to the aggregation/fibrillization of alpha-syn. This review focuses on new findings about the structure of alpha-syn, about how alpha-syn cooperates with Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones to promote neurotransmitter release, and about cell-to-cell transfer of pathogenic forms of alpha-syn and how Hsp70 might protect against this disease process.

AB  - The physical demands and hazards associated with emergency service work place particular stress on responders' cardiovascular systems. Indeed, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant problem for emergency service personnel. Although it may be difficult to alter the cardiovascular health hazards associated with the work environment, it is possible for personnel to control their modifiable CVD risk factors, cardiovascular fitness levels and subsequently, reduce their CVD risk. This review aimed to determine the effectiveness and methodological quality of health interventions designed to mitigate CVD risk in emergency service personnel.
   A literature search of electronic journal databases was performed. Sixteen relevant studies were assessed for methodological quality using a standardised assessment tool. Data regarding the effectiveness of each intervention were extracted and synthesised in a narrative format.
   Fifteen studies were rated 'Weak' and one study was rated 'Strong'. Interventions which combined behavioural counselling, exercise and nutrition were more effective in improving cardiovascular health than nutrition, exercise or CVD risk factor assessment-based interventions alone. Further, CVD risk factor assessment in isolation proved to be an ineffective intervention type to reduce CVD risk.
   Combined interventions appear most effective in improving the cardiovascular health of emergency service personnel. Accordingly, fire and emergency service agencies should consider trialling multifaceted interventions to improve the cardiovascular health of personnel and avoid interventions focused only on one of nutrition, exercise or CVD risk factor assessment. However, as most studies were methodologically weak, further studies of a higher methodological quality are needed.

AB  - We reviewed existing and planned adaptation activities of federal, tribal, state, and local governments and the private sector in the United States (U.S.) to understand what types of adaptation activities are underway across different sectors and scales throughout the country. Primary sources of review included material officially submitted for consideration in the upcoming 2013 U.S. National Climate Assessment and supplemental peer-reviewed and grey literature. Although substantial adaptation planning is occurring in various sectors, levels of government, and the private sector, few measures have been implemented and even fewer have been evaluated. Most adaptation actions to date appear to be incremental changes, not the transformational changes that may be needed in certain cases to adapt to significant changes in climate. While there appear to be no one-size-fits-all adaptations, there are similarities in approaches across scales and sectors, including mainstreaming climate considerations into existing policies and plans, and pursuing no- and low-regrets strategies. Despite the positive momentum in recent years, barriers to implementation still impede action in all sectors and across scales. The most significant barriers include lack of funding, policy and institutional constraints, and difficulty in anticipating climate change given the current state of information on change. However, the practice of adaptation can advance through learning by doing, stakeholder engagements (including "listening sessions"), and sharing of best practices. Efforts to advance adaptation across the U.S. and globally will necessitate the reduction or elimination of barriers, the enhancement of information and best practice sharing mechanisms, and the creation of comprehensive adaptation evaluation metrics.

AB  - Boolean relations, such as and, or, and not, are a fundamental way to create new concepts out of old. Classic psychological studies showed that such concepts differed in how difficult they were to learn, but did not explain the source of these differences. Recent theories have reinvigorated the field with explanations ranging from the complexity of minimal descriptions of a concept to the relative invariance of its different instances. We review these theories and argue that the simplest explanation the number of mental models required to represent a concept provides a powerful account. However, no existing theory explains the process in full, such as how individuals spontaneously describe concepts.

AB  - The pathogenic mechanisms that underlie Parkinson's disease remain unknown. Here, we review evidence from both sporadic and genetic forms of Parkinson's disease that implicate both mitochondria and oxidative stress as central players in disease pathogenesis. A systemic deficiency in complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is evident in many patients with the disease. Oxidative stress caused by reactive metabolites of dopamine and alterations in the levels of iron and glutathione in the substantia nigra accompany this mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence from studies on the genetic forms of parkinsonism with particular stress on DJ-1, parkin, and PINK-1 also suggest the involvement of mitochondria and oxidative stress.

AB  - Objective In the past, the comparability of empirical studies that examined the course and outcome of schizophrenia was limited by their use of different diagnostic systems. Focussing on the psychopathological long-term outcome, the present article aims to review follow-up studies that used modern operationalized diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia (DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV and ICD-10). Method We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PsycINFO and PSYNDEX for relevant studies up to the year 2011. Twenty-one studies were included in the final analysis. Results The long-term outcome of schizophrenia was heterogeneous and included full remissions as well as severe chronic states. Schizophrenia, however, showed a considerably more unfavourable outcome than other diagnostic groups such as schizoaffective or affective disorders. Psychopathological symptoms remained relatively stable in the course of illness. Several predictors for a poor outcome were identified, such as male gender or pronounced negative symptoms. Conclusion Recent studies using modern diagnostic systems largely confirm the results of earlier studies. Current diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia identify a heterogeneous sample of patients. The influence of therapeutic interventions on long-term outcome remains unclear.

AB  - The study of cognition in anxious children (i.e., those with anxiety disorders and those with high trait anxiety) is a burgeoning field. Cognitive biases towards encoding threatening information, interpreting stimuli as threatening, and selecting avoidant responses have been found to affect these children, and in some cases their parents too. These biases as well as certain cognitive abilities and deficits have been related to childhood anxiety and its treatment. Given the plethora of recent findings, implications for the practicing clinician are not always obvious.
   Using a review of recent medical literature, this paper summarizes key findings and examines potential links to clinical practice.
   The need to appreciate the reciprocal relationship between anxiety and cognition is highlighted (i.e., anxiety can contribute to cognitive biases and deficits, but cognitive problems can also contribute to anxiety). Cognitive factors can also predict poor response to traditional treatments, and thus suggest modifications of treatment that may benefit some children. Treatments focused on cognitive biases are gaining popularity, but their role in the treatment of anxious children and in relation to other anxiety treatments merits further study.
   Recent cognitive findings enhance our clinical understanding of anxious children, and may suggest ways of tailoring evidence-based treatments to best meet the needs of children with diverse cognitive profiles and developmental needs.

AB  - Affective neuroscience is concerned with identifying the neural bases of emotion. For historical and methodological reasons, models describing the brain architecture that supports emotional processes in humans have tended to neglect the basal ganglia, focusing instead on cortical and amygdalar mechanisms. Now, however, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a neurosurgical treatment for Parkinson's disease and obsessive-compulsive disorder, is helping researchers explore the possible functional role of this particular basal ganglion in emotional processes. After reviewing studies that have used DBS in this way, we propose a model in which the STN plays a crucial role in producing temporally organized neural co-activation patterns at the cortical and subcortical levels that are essential for generating emotions and related feelings.

AB  - Objective: Despite the development of second-generation antipsychotic drugs, treatment-resistant symptoms still represent a serious problem in schizophrenia. The aim of the present article was to review studies with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for negative symptoms of schizophrenia and draw conclusions for clinical decision making.
   Method: Literature for this review was identified by searching MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science up to the year 2011.
   Results: Five open studies, 13 sham-controlled studies, and 2 metaanalysis and 2 review articles were included in the present paper. The effect size of the high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left prefrontal cortex in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia is thought to be mild to moderate (Cohen d = 0.43Y0.68).
   Conclusion: Despite the promising results of some rTMS studies, the potential of rTMS for the treatment of negative symptoms is currently relatively unclear. Large clinical studies are therefore needed, especially large multicentric studies such as depression rTMS studies.
   Clinical Recommendations:
   There is an evidence showing that rTMS can be considered the effective treatment option for negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
   Based on the results of current meta-analyses, the effect size of high-frequency rTMS in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia seems to be mild to moderate (Cohen d = 0.43Y0.63).
   Despite limited evidence base, the associations between efficacy and stimulation approaches (higher stimulation intensity, higher number of sessions or 10 Hz stimulus frequency) appear.
   Additional Comments:
   Neither the European Medicines Agency nor the Food and Drug Administration has approved rTMS for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
   Furthermore, large clinical studies are necessary to verify the natural benefit of rTMS for general clinical practice.

AB  - Background: A transient but robust increase in prolactin levels during and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been shown repeatedly. Reports on menstrual disturbances during a course of ECT are scarce.
   Methods: The case of a woman treated with ECT for depression that developed menstrual disturbances early in the course of the treatment is presented. We conducted a PubMed literature search, supplemented with an Internet (Google) search using the same strategy, and a hand search of the indexes of textbooks on ECT.
   Results: Publications on the emergence of menstrual disturbances during ECT are virtually nonexistent, although some textbooks mention amenorrhea as a possible adverse effect of ECT. The mechanism of ECT-related amenorrhea is unknown but is supposed to be related to the transient hyperprolactinemia.
   Conclusion: Electroconvulsive therapy can cause menstrual disturbances. These adverse effects are benign and transient. The exact mechanism remains unknown. More research could help to clarify the possible role of a transient but robust hyperprolactinemia.

AB  - Psychiatric diseases are multifaceted disorders with complex etiology, recognized to have strong heritable components. Despite intense research efforts, genetic loci that substantially account for disease heritability have not yet been identified. Over the last several years, epigenetic processes have emerged as important factors for many brain diseases, and the discovery of epigenetic processes in germ cells has raised the possibility that they may contribute to disease heritability and disease risk. This review examines epigenetic mechanisms in complex diseases and summarizes the most illustrative examples of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals and their relevance for brain function. Environmental factors that can affect molecular processes and behavior in exposed individuals and their offspring, and their potential epigenetic underpinnings, are described. Possible routes and mechanisms of transgenerational transmission are proposed, and the major questions and challenges raised by this emerging field of research are considered.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been suspected to play a key role in neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. PINK1 and Parkin, the products of two genes responsible for autosomal recessive Parkinsonian syndromes with early onset, act as a quality control system on the outer mitochondrial membrane to preserve mitochondrial integrity. While doing so, they interact with multiple molecular actors in processes regulating mitochondrial biology and cell survival. The physiological conditions that mobilize these processes in neurons, and the mechanisms underlying their integration and spatiotemporal coordination, remain to be elucidated. Understanding how dysfunction of these house-keeping pathways leads to the preferential degeneration of a specific neuronal population in Parkinson's disease is a major challenge for future research.

AB  - Objective: Despite previous intervention trials, it is unclear which psychological treatments are most effective for people with coronary heart disease (CHD). We have conducted a systematic review with meta-regression to identify the characteristics of psychological interventions that improve depression and depressive symptoms among people with CHD. Methods: Searches of multiple electronic databases up to March 2012 were conducted, supplemented by hand-searching of identified reviews and citation tracing of eligible studies. Studies were included if they reported a randomized controlled trial of a psychological intervention for people with CHD and included depression as an outcome. Data on main effects and characteristics of interventions were extracted from eligible studies. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for each study and pooled using random-effects models. Random-effects multivariate meta-regression was performed to identify treatment characteristics associated with improvements in depression. Results: Sixty-four independent treatment comparisons were identified. Psychological interventions improved depression, although the effect was small (SMD = 0.18, p < .001). Problem solving (SMD = 0.34), general education (SMD = 0.19), skills training (SMD = 0.25), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; SMD = 0.23), and relaxation (SMD = 0.15) had small effects on CHD patients who were recruited irrespective of their depression status. Among high-quality trials of depressed CHD patients, only CBT showed significant but small effects (SMD = 0.31). When entered into multivariable analysis, no individual treatment component significantly improved depression. Conclusions: CBT and problem solving should be considered for inclusion in future treatment developments and randomized controlled trials. However, the effects are small in magnitude, and there is room to develop new interventions that may be more effective.

AB  - Objective: People with schizophrenia show a high incidence of metabolic syndrome, which is associated with a high mortality from cardiovascular disease. The aetiology of the metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia is multi-factorial and may involve antipsychotic treatment, high levels of stress and unhealthy lifestyle, such as poor diet. As a poor diet can predispose to the development of metabolic abnormalities, the aims of this review are to clarify: 1) the dietary patterns of patients with schizophrenia, 2) the association of these dietary patterns with a worse metabolic profile, and 3) the possible factors influencing these dietary patterns.
   Methods: A search was conducted on Pubmed, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, Ovid, Psychoinfo and ISI web of Knowledge from 1950 to the 1st of November 2011. 783 articles were found through the investigation of such databases. After title, abstract or full-text reading and applying exclusion criteria we reviewed 31 studies on dietary patterns and their effects on metabolic parameters in schizophrenia.
   Results: Patients with schizophrenia have a poor diet, mainly characterized by a high intake of saturated fat and a low consumption of fibre and fruit. Such diet is more likely to increase the risk to develop metabolic abnormalities. Data about possible causes of poor diet in schizophrenia are still few and inconsistent.
   Conclusion: Subjects with schizophrenia show a poor diet that partly accounts for their higher incidence of metabolic abnormalities. Further studies are needed to clarify the causes of poor diet and the role of dietary intervention to improve their physical health. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Occupational impairment accounts for much of the burden and economic costs associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Many studies have documented neurocognitive deficits in MDD, and depression-associated cognitive dysfunction would be expected to have significant effects on occupational functioning. We systematically reviewed the literature for studies on neurocognition and occupational functioning in MDD. Electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, PsychInfo and Cochrane Clinical Trials) were searched using appropriate terms and bibliographies of relevant publications were scanned for additional citations. Two reviewers independently reviewed papers for inclusion and data extraction, with conflicts resolved by consensus. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of MDD using validated criteria (e.g., DSM-IV or ICD-10), use of objective neuropsychological tests and use of a specific measure of occupational functioning. Of 630 citations identified in the initial search, only two studies met inclusion criteria and were included in a qualitative review. Both had significant methodological limitations. Nonetheless, the depressed samples had significant neurocognitive deficits that were associated with employment status and work impairment. Neurocognitive dysfunction is probably associated with impairment in occupational functioning in individuals with MDD, but the evidence is limited. Further research should examine specific cognitive domains, and use validated measures of work functioning and productivity.

AB  - Realizing personalized medicine requires integrating diverse data types with bioinformatics. The most vital data are genomic information for individuals that are from advanced next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies at present. The technologies continue to advance in terms of both decreasing cost and sequencing speed with concomitant increase in the amount and complexity of the data. The prodigious data together with the requisite computational pipelines for data analysis and interpretation are stressors to IT infrastructure and the scientists conducting the work alike. Bioinformatics is increasingly becoming the rate-limiting step with numerous challenges to be overcome for translating NGS data for personalized medicine. We review some key bioinformatics tasks, issues, and challenges in contexts of IT requirements, data quality, analysis tools and pipelines, and validation of biomarkers.

AB  - Objective: To review published literature regarding the pharmacology and use of amantadine in child and adolescent psychiatry. Method: A literature search of several databases (PubMed, Psychinfo, CINAHL, Medline, PsycARTICLES, Biomedical Reference Collection and Academis Search Complete) was conducted with the search terms: ` amantadine' with limits: English language, Human trials, all child (aged 0-18 years). The search was later expanded to include 'Adults' and additional relevant articles were selected from reference lists. Results: The psychotropic effect of amantadine is related to its antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. It decreases the toxic effects of the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system which plays an important role in many psychiatric disorders. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of amantadine were identified in children and adolescents. One reported beneficial effects in controlling the symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity in autistic disorder and the other described a significant impact in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Two open label studies also reported positive effects in ADHD. A pilot study in children with enuresis reported significant reduction in wetting frequency. Studies in adults, with relevance to children and adolescents, reported effectiveness in resistant depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and in counteracting side effects of some psychotropic medications. RCTs found in traumatic brain injury indicated a neuroprotective effect and effectiveness in controlling agitation and aggression. Amantadine is well tolerated in children and adolescents, with an acceptable side effect profile, and considered safe for long term use. Conclusion: Amantadine shows potential for use as a safe alternative or as an augmenting agent for treating children with neuropsychiatric and various other disorders. Available data for such use, although promising, require further confirmation.

AB  - Neurodegeneration and depression are two common co-morbid conditions, particularly within the aging population. Research has linked neuroinflammation as a major contributing factor to both of these diseases. The key to neuroinflammation effects on neurodegeneration and depression appears to lie within the dysregulation of the control and release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This can come from an internal or external insult to the system, or from changes in the individual due to aging that culminate in immune dysregulation. The need to reduce neuroinflammation has led to extensive research into neuroprotectants. We discuss the efficacy found with nicotine, alcohol, resveratrol, curcumin, and ketamine. Our main focus will be on what research tells us about the connections between neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and depression, and the hope that neuroprotectants research gives people suffering from neurodegeneration and depression stemming from neuroinflammation. We will conclude by making suggestions for future research in this area.

AB  - To explore current evidence of the physiological embedding of stress to discuss whether adverse childhood experiences (ACE) causing chronic or acute stress responses may alter fundamental biological functions.
   A non-systematic review of the literature was carried out using keyword searches in Pubmed and the web of science from May to October 2011. In reference to the literature identified, we examine the potential biological pathways potentially linking exposure to ACE and cancer development and progression in adulthood.
   These mechanisms, in interaction with social position, and mediated by subsequent environmental exposures, may ultimately lead to the development of cancer. The experience of acute or chronic stressors during sensitive periods of childhood development which can induce several known biological responses, are likely to have an impact on subsequent biological and behavioural functions depending on the timing of initial exposures, and subsequently mediated by later exposures. For this reason, childhood exposure to adversity is a likely source of both acute and chronic stressors, and can be examined as an important initial exposure on a pathway towards adult ill health.
   Such pathways justify a life course approach to understanding cancer aetiology, which may have its origins early in life.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is considered a noninvasive and well-tolerated brain stimulation technique with very few adverse side effects. Importantly, tDCS does not directly evoke neuronal firing (as induced by electroconvulsive or transcranial magnetic stimulation), but instead alters the resting membrane potential of pre- and post-synaptic neurons dependent on the current polarity in the stimulated brain region. Animal studies suggest changes in long-term potentiation occur via glutamate release in response to anodal tDCS, thereby affecting learning and memory. In clinical studies, a current not exceeding 2 mA/cm(2) is applied for 20-30 min via sponge electrodes placed above the target brain region. To date, a number of clinical studies have reported some promising effects when treating patients with depression, chronic pain, schizophrenia, dementia, Parkinson's disease and cerebral stroke. However, appropriately designed randomized controlled clinical trials are scarce and reported intervention effect sizes only vary from small to moderate, with little evidence for sustained long-term effects.

AB  - Tensors provide a powerful language to describe physical phenomena. Consequently, they have a long tradition in physics and appear in various application areas, either as the final result of simulations or as intermediate product. Due to their complexity, tensors are hard to interpret. This motivates the development of well-conceived visualization methods. As a sub-branch of scientific visualization, tensor field visualization has been especially pushed forward by diffusion tensor imaging. In this review, we focus on second-order tensors that are not diffusion tensors. Until now, these tensors, which might be neither positive-definite nor symmetric, are under-represented in visualization and existing visualization tools are often not appropriate for these tensors. Hence, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods when dealing with such tensors as well as challenges introduced by them. The goal of this paper is to reveal the importance of the field and to encourage the development of new visualization methods for tensors from various application fields.

AB  - Objective: Catastrophizing is an exaggerated negative evaluation and attention to specific symptoms such as pain or fatigue. A number of studies consistently support the significant role of catastrophizing in pain. However, the role of catastrophizing in fatigue is less frequently investigated. This article provides a critical review of published studies investigating this association.
   Methods: Using the keyword "Fatigue AND Catastrophizing", we performed a search in PubMed, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, and EMBASE.
   Results: Fourteen studies were reviewed and all except one were found to provide empirical support for an association between high catastrophizing and high fatigue. Most of these reviewed articles also show the large impact of catastrophizing on fatigue severity. Two longitudinal studies found that fatigue catastrophizing level before cancer treatment is a significant predictor of post-treatment fatigue. Studies also demonstrated that persons who had higher scores for catastrophizing recalled fatigue more accurately than those with lower scores.
   Conclusion: In spite the differences of its definition and the measurements used, a similar significant association between catastrophizing and fatigue was reported. Because this observation was based on 14 studies with limited types of patients, further studies are recommended to examine the role of catastrophizing in fatigue from other clinical populations and to investigate its utility as a behavioral marker for central fatigue.

AB  - Little is known about the nutritional status of pregnant women with severe mental illness. We therefore carried out a systematic review to investigate whether pregnant women and childbearing aged women with severe mental illness have significantly greater nutritional deficiencies compared with pregnant women and childbearing aged women with no mental illness. We carried out a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO from January 1980 to January 2011 for studies on nutritional status of childbearing aged women with psychotic disorders. Identification of papers and quality rating of papers (using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale) was carried out by two reviewers independently. We identified and screened 4,130 potentially relevant studies from the electronic databases. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 587 women). There were no studies of pregnant women. There was some evidence of low serum folate and vitamin B-12 levels and elevated homocysteine levels in childbearing aged women with psychotic disorders. Further research into the nutritional status of childbearing aged women with severe mental illness is needed. Maternal nutrition has a profound impact on foetal outcome, is a modifiable risk factor and therefore needs prioritising in the care of all childbearing aged women with severe mental illness.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on obstetric factors at birth and their role as risk factors for a subsequent eating disorder (ED) and where possible to perform a meta-analysis of case-control studies of EDs and obstetric complications (OCs).
   Method: Studies were ascertained by computer searches of electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL), searches of reference lists and from raw data obtained upon request from the authors. A total of 14 studies were identified for the systematic review, of which 6 were eligible for the subsequent meta-analysis. Of the selected 6 studies, 5 reported on the same OCs, namely vaginal instrumental delivery and prematurity. Accordingly, meta-analyses were run on these two variables. Both analyses were conducted on anorexia nervosa (AN) patients.
   Results: Findings from the systematic review were conflicting, with some studies reporting a significant relationship between OCs and ED diagnoses and/or ED symptomatology and others refuting it. A non-significant association of instrumental delivery [pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95%CI: 0.69, 1.65] and prematurity [pooled OR 1.17, 95%CI: 0.91, 1.52] with AN was revealed in our meta-analysis.
   Conclusion: The current literature on OCs as risk factors for a later ED is contradictory. The range of different occurrences considered as OCs and methodological limitations hinder ultimate conclusions. Upcoming studies should pool datasets together to obtain sufficient power to assess OCs and EDs in combination. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) provides a cellular implementation of the Hebb postulate, which states that synapses, whose activity repeatedly drives action potential firing in target cells, are potentiated. At glutamatergic synapses onto hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal cells, synaptic activation followed by spike firing in the target cell causes long-term potentiation (LTP)-as predicted by Hebb-whereas excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked after a spike elicit long-term depression (LTD)-a phenomenon that was not specifically addressed by Hebb. In both instances the action potential in the postsynaptic target neuron is an instructive signal that is capable of supporting synaptic plasticity. STDP generally relies on the propagation of Na+ action potentials that are initiated in the axon hillhock back into the dendrite, where they cause depolarization and boost local calcium influx. However, recent studies in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons have suggested that local calcium spikes might provide a more efficient trigger for LTP induction than backpropagating action potentials. Dendritic calcium spikes also play a role in an entirely different type of STDP that can be observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. These neurons lack backpropagating Na+ spikes. Instead, plasticity at parallel fiber (PF) to Purkinje cell synapses depends on the relative timing of PF-EPSPs and activation of the glutamatergic climbing fiber (CF) input that causes dendritic calcium spikes. Thus, the instructive signal in this system is externalized. Importantly when EPSPs are elicited before CF activity, PF-LTD is induced rather than LTP. Thus, STDP in the cerebellum follows a timing rule that is opposite to its hippocampal/neocortical counterparts. Regardless, a common motif in plasticity is that LTD/LTP induction depends on the relative timing of synaptic activity and regenerative dendritic spikes which are driven by the instructive signal.

AB  - The cerebellum has a simple tri-laminar structure that is comprised of relatively few cell types. Yet, its internal micro-circuitry is anatomically, biochemically, and functionally complex. The most striking feature of cerebellar circuit complexity is its compartmentalized topography. Each cell type within the cerebellar cortex is organized into an exquisite map; molecular expression patterns, dendrite projections, and axon terminal fields divide the medial-lateral axis of the cerebellum into topographic sagittal zones. Here, we discuss the mechanisms that establish zones and highlight how gene expression and neural activity contribute to cerebellar pattern formation. We focus on the olivocerebellar system because its developmental mechanisms are becoming clear, its topographic termination patterns are very precise, and its contribution to zonal function is debated. This review deconstructs the architecture and development of the olivocerebellar pathway to provide an update on how brain circuit maps form and function.

KW  - myelination
AB  - Schizophrenia is a common, severe, and chronically disabling mental illness of unknown cause. Recent MRI studies have focused attention on white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Indices commonly derived from DTI include (1) mean diffusivity, independent of direction, (2) fractional anisotropy (FA) or relative anisotropy (RA), (3) axial diffusivity, and (4) radial diffusivity. In cerebral white matter, contributions to these indices come from fiber arrangements, degree of myelination, and axonal integrity. Relatively pure deficits in myelin result in a modest increase in radial diffusivity, without affecting axial diffusivity and with preservation of anisotropy. Although schizophrenia is not characterized by gross abnormalities of white matter, it does involve a profound dysregulation of myelin-associated gene expression, reductions in oligodendrocyte numbers, and marked abnormalities in the ultrastructure of myelin sheaths. Since each oligodendrocyte myelinates as many as 40 axon segments, changes in the number of oligodendrocytes (OLG), and/or in the integrity of myelin sheaths, and/or axoglial contacts can have a profound impact on signal propagation and the integrity of neuronal circuits. Whereas a number of studies have revealed inconsistent decreases in anisotropy in schizophrenia, we and others have found increased FA in key subcortical tracts associated with the circuits underlying symptom generation in schizophrenia. We review data revealing increased anisotropy in dopaminergic tracts in the mesencephalon of schizophrenics and their unaffected relatives, and discuss the possible biological underpinnings and physiological significance of this finding.

AB  - Nanoparticles (NP) are structures with at least one dimension of less than 100 nanometers (nnn) and unique properties. Silver nanoparticles (AgNP), due to their bactericidal action, have found practical applications in medicine, cosmetics, textiles, electronics, and other fields. Nevertheless, their less advantageous properties which make AgNP potentially harmful to public health or the environment should also be taken into consideration. These nanoparticles are cyto- and genotoxic and accumulate in the environment, where their antibacterial properties may be disadvantageous for agriculture and waste management. The presented study reviews data concerning the biological effects of AgNP in mammalian cells in vitro: cellular uptake and excretion, localization in cellular compartments, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. The mechanism of nanoparticle action consists on induction of the oxidative stress resulting in a further ROS generation, DNA damage and activation of signaling leading to various, cell type-specific pathways to inflammation, apoptotic or necrotic death. In order to assure a safe application of AgNP, further detailed studies are needed on the mechanisms of the action of AgNP on mammalian cells at the molecular level.

AB  - Aim. Despite the poor evidence supporting the use of coercive procedures in psychiatry wards and their "psychological damage" on patients, the practice of restraint is still frequent (6-17%) and varies 10-20 times among centers. Methods. We searched the Pub Med, Embase and Psych Info databases for papers published between January 1 1990 and March 31 2010 using the key words "restraint", "constraint", "in-patient" and "psychiatry wards" and the inclusion criteria of adult samples (studies of selected samples such as a specific psychiatric diagnosis other than psychosis, adolescence or the elderly, men/women only, personality disorders and mental retardation were excluded), the English, French, Italian or German languages, and an acute setting. Results. The prevalence of the use of restraint was 3.8-20% (not different from previous data), despite the attempts to reduce the use of restraint. The variables most frequently associated with the use of coercive measures in the 49 studies included in this review were male gender, young adult age classes, foreign ethnicity, schizophrenia, involuntary admission, aggression or trying to abscond, and the presence of male staff. Conclusions. Coercive measures are still widely used in many countries (albeit to a greater or lesser extent) despite attempts to introduce alternatives (introduction of special protocols and nurses' training courses) in some centers that should really be tested in large-scale multi-centre studies in order to verify their efficacy.

AB  - Objective: tDCS is a promising novel therapeutic intervention for major depression (MD). However, clinical trials to date have reported conflicting results concerning its efficacy, which likely resulted from low statistical power. Thus, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized, double-blind and controlled trials of tDCS in MD with a focus on clinically relevant outcomes, namely response and remission rates.
   Method: We searched the literature for English language randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) on tDCS for treating MD from 1998 through July 2012 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and SCOPUS. We also consulted the Web of Science's Citations Index Expanded for the selected RCTs up to July 2012. The main outcome measures were response and remission rates. We used a random-effects model and Odds Ratios (OR).
   Results: Data were obtained from 6 RCTs that included a total of 200 subjects with MD. After an average of 10.8 +/- 3.76 tDCS sessions, no significant difference was found between active and sham tDCS in terms of both response (23.3% [24/103] vs. 12.4% [12/97], respectively; OR = 1.97; 95% CI = 0.85-4.57; p = 0.11) and remission (12.2% [12/98] vs. 5.4% [5/92], respectively; OR = 2.13; 95% CI = 0.64-7.06; p = 0.22). Also, no differences between mean baseline depression scores and dropout rates in the active and sham tDCS groups were found. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs that involved less than 10 treatment sessions or stimulus intensity of less than 2 mA did not alter the findings. However, tDCS used as monotherapy was associated with higher response rates when compared to sham tDCS (p = 0.043). Finally, the risk of publication bias in this meta-analysis was found to be low.
   Conclusions: The clinical utility of tDCS as a treatment for MD remains unclear when clinically relevant outcomes such as response and remission rates are considered. Future studies should include larger and more representative samples, investigate how tDCS compares to other therapeutic neuromodulation techniques, as well as identify optimal stimulation parameters. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique of neuromodulation and neurostimulation based on the principle of electromagnetic induction of an electric field in the brain. The coil (H-coil) used in deep TMS is able to modulate cortical excitability up to a maximum depth of 6 cm and is therefore able not only to modulate the activity of the cerebral cortex but also the activity of deeper neural circuits. Deep TMS is largely used for the treatment of drug-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) and is being tested to treat a very wide range of neurological, psychiatric and medical conditions. The aim of this review is to illustrate the biophysical principles of deep TMS, to explain the pathophysiological basis for its utilization in each psychiatric disorder (major depression, autism, bipolar depression, auditory hallucinations, negative symptoms of schizophrenia), to summarize the results presented thus far in the international scientific literature regarding the use of deep TMS in psychiatry, its side effects and its effects on cognitive functions.

AB  - There is a plethora of recent publications on all aspects relevant to the toxicology of arsenic (As). Over centuries exposures to arsenic continue to be a major public health problem in many countries. In particular, the occurrence of high As concentrations in groundwater of Southeast Asia receives now much attention. Therefore, arsenic is a high-priority matter for toxicological research. Key exposure to As are (traditional) medicines, combustion of As-rich coal, presence of As in groundwater, and pollution due to mining activities. As-induced cardiovascular disorders and carcinogenesis present themselves as a major research focus. The high priority of this issue is now recognized politically in a number of countries, research funds have been made available. Also experimental research on toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics and on modes of toxic action is moving very rapidly. The matter is of high regulatory concern, and effective preventive measures are required in a number of countries.

AB  - Before the onset of the illness, future schizophrenia patients do not weigh more comparing to their peers. However, during the later course of the illness, obesity is twice as prevalent as in general public, afflicting the half of schizophrenia patient population. There is a list of potential factors that contribute to this, including lifestyle, dietary habits, unsatisfactory monitoring of physical health etc, but nowadays side effects of antipsychotic medication become the most prominent concern when weight gain and metabolic issues in psychosis are addressed.
   The fact is that second generation antipsychotics (SGA) are associated with weight gain and metabolic syndrome, but that might be the case with the first generation antipsychotics (FGA) too. Besides, obesity might be evident in patients before any exposure to medications, and all that bring lot of dilemmas into the field. This paper critically reviews available data on metabolic problems in patients with psychotic disorders, raging from genetic to molecular and environmental factors, and highlights the necessity of screening for the early signs of metabolic disturbances, as well as of multidisciplinary assessment of psychiatric and medical conditions from the first psychotic episode.

AB  - Seasonal fluctuations in food availability show a tight association with seasonal variations in body weight and food intake. Seasonal variations in food intake, energy storage, and expenditure appear to be a widespread phenomenon suggesting they may have evolved in anticipation for changing environmental demands. These cycles appear to be driven by changes in external daylength acting on neuroendocrine pathways. A number of neuroendocrine pathways, two of which are the endocrine mechanisms underlying feeding and stress, appear to show seasonal changes in both their circulating levels and reactivity. As such, variation in the level or reactivity to these hormones may be crucial factors in the control of seasonal variations in food-seeking behaviors. The present review examines the relationship between feeding behavior and seasonal changes in circulating hormones. We hypothesize that seasonal changes in circulating levels of glucocorticoids and the feeding-related hormones ghrelin and leptin contribute to seasonal fluctuations in feeding-related behaviors. This review will focus on the seasonal circulating levels of these hormones as well as sensitivity to these hormones in the modulation of food-seeking behaviors.

AB  - The role of cerebellar plasticity has been increasingly recognized in learning. The privileged relationship between the cerebellum and the inferior olive offers an ideal circuit for attempting to integrate the numerous evidences of neuronal plasticity into a translational perspective. The high learning capacity of the Purkinje cells specifically controlled by the climbing fiber represents a major element within the feed-forward and feedback loops of the cerebellar cortex. Reciprocally connected with the basal ganglia and multimodal cerebral domains, this cerebellar network may realize fundamental functions in a wide range of behaviors. This review will outline the current understanding of three main experimental paradigms largely used for revealing cerebellar functions in behavioral learning: (1) the vestibuloocular reflex and smooth pursuit control, (2) the eyeblink conditioning, and (3) the sensory envelope plasticity. For each of these experimental conditions, we have critically revisited the chain of causalities linking together neural circuits, neural signals, and plasticity mechanisms, giving preference to behaving or alert animal physiology. Namely, recent experimental approaches mixing neural units and local field potentials recordings have demonstrated a spike timing dependent plasticity by which the cerebellum remains at a strategic crossroad for deciphering fundamental and translational mechanisms from cellular to network levels.

KW  - Elder care
AB  - Purpose - With population projections indicating that the number of older adults in the UK (those aged 65 years and over) will increase from 9.6 million in 2005 to 12.7 million in 2021, the numbers of those growing older with a serious mental illness (SMI) is likely to rise. Currently there is a lacuna of both policy and quality research evidence on how to meet the needs of this vulnerable group of citizens. The purpose of this paper is to add to the emerging debate and discourse around current policy and practice in this field.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors have undertaken a general review of both the literature and current UK policy guidance to determine the current state of provision for people with a SMI.
   Findings - Much of the relevant literature the authors identified originates from the USA, with older adults with SMI perceived as an under-served population in need of urgent attention. Additionally, UK policy provision is patchy with very limited pockets of good practice currently available to guide clinicians and inform service users.
   Research limitations/implications - Clinicians, researchers and other stakeholders must engage with service users, their family and/or friends to produce quality and meaningful research to improve outcomes for this vulnerable group of citizens. Finally, the policy, practice and service user communities need to collaborate in a spirit of "boundary spanning" working across disciplines to generate practical policies which can be operationalised by organisations and individuals.
   Originality/value - This paper highlights the distinct lack of literature, evidence and policy which currently exists in the UK addressing the needs of older adults with a serious mental illness.

AB  - Background
   Although the association between depression and excess mortality has been well established, it is not clear whether this is greater in major depression than in subthreshold depression.
   Aims
   To compare excess mortality in major depression with that in subthreshold depression.
   Method
   We searched bibliographic databases and included prospective studies in which both major and subthreshold depression were examined at baseline and mortality was measured at follow-up.
   Results
   A total of 22 studies were included. People with major depression had a somewhat increased chance of dying earlier than people with subthreshold depression but this difference was not significant, although there was a trend (relative risk 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.30, P=0.1). The population attributable fraction was 7% for major depression and an additional 7% for subthreshold depression.
   Conclusions
   Although excess mortality may be somewhat higher in major than in subthreshold depression, the difference is small and the overall impact on excess mortality is comparable.

AB  - Objective: Acquired hand trauma is a significant event that often affects an individuals' life in diverse manners. The present paper aims to review the psychological issues in hand trauma along with factors that affect recovery from the same. Method: A relevant search for literature on psychological issues in hand trauma was made across search engines like Google Scholar, Medline and Pubmed and relevant studies were selected for this review. The studies include those on symptomatology, course as well as treatment. The studies were analyzed critically along with inputs of personal clinical experience of the authors. Results: Psychological symptoms that occur after hand trauma together with the treatment methods that provide relief from psychological symptoms are discussed. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), flashbacks, concerns with personal appearance, avoidance of reminders of the trauma and physiological arousal along with sleep issues have been discussed. The article also looks at the psychosocial effects of hand trauma including marital and sexual issues that may arise. Treatment interventions commonly used in the form of imagery and in vivo exposure with and without cognitive restructuring are explained along with psycho-education approaches that may benefit these patients. Conclusions: It is important that surgeons and professionals dealing with hand trauma are aware of the psychological issues in hand trauma and to take appropriate steps to deal with any such problems that ensue.

AB  - Oxidative stress plays an important role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Disruptions in the physiologic maintenance of the redox potential in neurons interfere with several biological processes, ultimately leading to cell death. Evidence has been developed for oxidative and nitrative damage to key cellular components in the PD substantia nigra. A number of sources and mechanisms for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are recognized including the metabolism of dopamine itself, mitochondrial dysfunction, iron, neuroinflammatory cells, calcium, and aging. PD causing gene products including DJ-1, PINK1, parkin, alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 also impact in complex ways mitochondrial function leading to exacerbation of ROS generation and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Additionally, cellular homeostatic processes including the ubiquitin-proteasome system and mitophagy are impacted by oxidative stress. It is apparent that the interplay between these various mechanisms contributes to neurodegeneration in PD as a feed forward scenario where primary insults lead to oxidative stress, which damages key cellular pathogenetic proteins that in turn cause more ROS production. Animal models of PD have yielded some insights into the molecular pathways of neuronal degeneration and highlighted previously unknown mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to PD. However, therapeutic attempts to target the general state of oxidative stress in clinical trials have failed to demonstrate an impact on disease progression. Recent knowledge gained about the specific mechanisms related to PD gene products that modulate ROS production and the response of neurons to stress may provide targeted new approaches towards neuroprotection.

AB  - Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) became an increasingly important component of environmental impact assessment (EIA; or simply environment assessment (EA)) shortly after formal processes for EIA were established in North America in the 1970s. Despite a growing body of literature addressing science requirements of exemplary EIA and CEA, practice remains contested. Our mission in preparing this review was to provide a critical update on progress in scientific developments associated with CEA and also to guide practitioners to a broad selection of the recent relevant peer-reviewed formal literature on CEA. In addition, we point to ways in which guidance for CEA practice could be improved. The study canvassed widely for refereed papers in journals and edited books as far back as 2000. On the matter of key concepts related to CEA, the paper addresses the definition of other activities to be assessed, establishment of time and space bounds, impact thresholds, methods for impact prediction, and stressor-based versus effect-based approaches. Definitions of cumulative effect are reviewed, with encouragement for continued work to elaborate the concept. Contributions from science to CEA practice are identified as follows: retrospective and prospective investigative protocols; basic ecological knowledge; effects knowledge; tools and methods; ecological grounds for threshold establishment; and analytically competent practitioners. We observe that the plethora of CEA frameworks populating the scientific literature offer practitioners helpful ways to think about the CEA process. CEA methods are then reviewed, with specific emphasis on geographic information systems, scenario-building, thresholds, indicators, simulation, and public engagement. Several case examples of CEA in practice are summarized, with the observation that none of the published case studies arises from work done to support CEA that is part of the regulated EIA process. The paper reflects on the role of CEA in project-specific EIA (or project EA) as well as class EA, strategic EA, and regional EA. CEA is needed in all forms of EA, but it seems to be particularly difficult to implement well in project-specific EIAs. Recommendations for improvements in guidance materials for practitioners address definitions, scenarios, analytical methods, collaborative methods, thresholds, knowledge accumulation, accidents and malfunctions, project scale, and knowledge integration. We conclude that competent CEA is a vital requirement for securing the sustainability of valued ecosystems and their components.

AB  - The Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus lives at low-light depths, in muddy substrata of high organic content where water salinities are high and fluctuations in temperature are moderate. In this environment, the lobsters are naturally exposed to a number of potential stressors, many of them as a result of the surficial breakdown of organic material in the sediment. This process (early diagenesis) creates a heterogeneous environment with temporal and spatial fluctuations in a number of compounds such as oxygen, ammonia, metals, and hydrogen sulphide. In addition to this, there are anthropogenically generated stressors, such as human-induced climate change (resulting in elevated temperature and ocean acidification), pollution and fishing. The lobsters are thus exposed to several stressors, which are strongly linked to the habitat in which the animals live. Here, the capacity of Nephrops to deal with these stressors is summarised. Eutrophication-induced hypoxia and subsequent metal remobilisation from the sediment is a well-documented effect found in some wild Nephrops populations. Compared to many other crustacean species, Nephrops is well adapted to tolerate periods of hypoxia, but prolonged or severe hypoxia, beyond their tolerance level, is common in some areas. When the oxygen concentration in the environment decreases, the bioavailability of redox-sensitive metals such as manganese increases. Manganese is an essential metal, which, taken up in excess, has a toxic effect on several internal systems such as chemosensitivity, nerve transmission and immune defence. Since sediment contains high concentrations of metals in comparison to sea water, lobsters may accumulate both essential and non-essential metals. Different metals have different target tissues, though the hepatopancreas, in general, accumulates high concentrations of most metals. The future scenario of increasing anthropogenic influences on Nephrops habitats may have adverse effects on the fitness of the animals.

AB  - For decades, the unnaturalness of the weak scale has been the dominant problem motivating new particle physics, and weak-scale supersymmetry has been the dominant proposed solution. This paradigm is now being challenged by a wealth of experimental data. In this review, we begin by recalling the theoretical motivations for weak-scale supersymmetry, including the gauge hierarchy problem, grand unification, and WIMP (weakly interactingmassive particle) dark matter, and their implications for superpartner masses. These are set against the leading constraints on supersymmetry from collider searches, the Higgs boson mass, and low-energy constraints on flavor and CP violation. We then critically examine attempts to quantify naturalness in supersymmetry, stressing the many subjective choices that influence the results both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we survey various proposals for natural supersymmetric models, including effective supersymmetry, focus point supersymmetry, compressed supersymmetry, and R-parity-violating supersymmetry, and summarize their key features, current status, and implications for future experiments.

AB  - Over the past 5 years numerous reports have confirmed and replicated the specific brain cooling and thermal window predictions derived from the thermoregulatory theory of yawning, and no study has found evidence contrary to these findings. Here we review the comparative research supporting this model of yawning among homeotherms, while highlighting a recent report showing how the expression of contagious yawning in humans is altered by seasonal climate variation. The fact that yawning is constrained to a thermal window of ambient temperature provides unique and compelling support in favor of this theory. Heretofore, no existing alternative hypothesis of yawning can explain these results, which have important implications for understanding the potential functional role of this behavior, both physiologically and socially, in humans and other animals. In discussion we stress the broader applications of this work in clinical settings, and counter the various criticisms of this theory.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are considered among the main molecular mechanisms implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Here, we focus on the deficiency of PARK2 and its product parkin, which is relevant to both familial and sporadic PD pathogenesis. Parkin emerges as an important regulator of processes that maintain mitochondrial quality. We focus on the parkin-dependent aspects of mitochondrial biogenesis, including mtDNA replication, transcription, mitophagy, mitochondrial fusion, fission, and transport. We discuss possible underlying molecular mechanisms, exerted by parkin in cooperation with other mitochondrial maintenance factors such as TFAM, PGC-1alpha, mortalin, HSP70/HSC70 and LRPPRC, all of them implicated in PD pathogenesis. We review numerous models of lipopolysaccharide toxicity that demonstrate how mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy are induced simultaneously to cope with mitochondrial dysfunction. The spatial and temporal interdependence of mitochondrial quality pathways underscores the importance of an integrative approach for future studies.

AB  - The identification of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) as the major disease protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions has defined a new class of neurodegenerative conditions: the TDP-43 proteinopathies. This breakthrough was quickly followed by mutation analysis of TARDBP, the gene encoding TDP-43. Herein, we provide a review of our previously published efforts that led to the identification of 3 TARDBP mutations (p.M337V, p.N345K, and p.I383V) in familial ALS patients, two of which were novel. With over 40 TARDBP mutations now discovered, there exists conclusive evidence that TDP-43 plays a direct role in neurodegeneration. The onus is now on researchers to elucidate the mechanisms by which mutant TDP-43 confers toxicity, and to exploit these findings to gain a better understanding of how TDP-43 contributes to the pathogenesis of disease. Our biochemical analysis of TDP-43 in ALS patient lymphoblastoid cell lines revealed a substantial increase in TDP-43 truncation products, including a similar to 25 kDa fragment, compared to control lymphoblastoid cell lines. We discuss the putative harmful consequence of abnormal TDP-43 fragmentation, as well as highlight additional mechanisms of toxicity associated with mutant TDP-43.

AB  - Adolescent behavior problems such as substance use, antisocial behavior problems, and mental health problems have extremely high social costs and lead to overburdened mental health and juvenile justice systems in the United States and Europe. The prevalence of these problems is substantial, and at-risk youth often present with a combination of concerns. An understanding of risk and protective factors at multiple levels, including the child, family, peer, school, and community, has influenced intervention development. At the individual and family levels, the most effective and cost-effective programs work intensively with youth and their families or use individual and group cognitive-behavioral approaches. However, there is a paucity of careful studies of effective policies and programs in the juvenile justice system. Research is needed that focuses on adoption, financing, implementation, and sustainable use of evidence-based programs in public service systems. In addition, the field needs to understand better for whom current programs are most effective to create the next generation of more effective and efficient programs.

AB  - Objectives: The lack of universal criteria makes diagnosing clinical depression in cancer patients a challenging task. We therefore review the current state of evidence regarding such diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a literature search for studies which compare two or more sets of diagnostic criteria for depression in cancer patients. The results were extracted and summarized. Results: Three original studies were included in this review. One study supported the use of substitutive (Endicott) criteria. Another study showed the potential of an increased threshold approach and one had no conclusive findings. Conclusion: There was no standard reference test and precise definition of alternative criteria in these studies. There are no recognized diagnostic criteria for depression in cancer patients despite an apparent need for such criteria.

AB  - The dorsomedial frontal part of the cerebral cortex is consistently activated when people read the mental states of others, such as their beliefs, desires, and intentions, the ability known as having a theory of mind (ToM) or mentalizing. This ubiquitous finding has led many researchers to conclude that the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) constitutes a core component in mentalizing networks. Despite this, it remains unclear why the DMFC becomes active during ToM tasks. We argue that key psychological and behavioral aspects in mentalizing are closely associated with DMFC functions. These include executive inhibition, distinction between self and others, prediction under uncertainty, and perception of intentions, all of which are important for predicting others' intention and behavior. We review the literature supporting this claim, ranging in fields from developmental psychology to human neuroimaging and macaque electrophysiology. Because perceiving intentions in others' actions initiates mentalizing and forms the basis of virtually all types of social interaction, the fundamental issue in social neuroscience is to determine the aspects of physical entities that make an observer perceive that they are intentional beings and to clarify the neurobiological underpinnings of the perception of intentionality in others' actions.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to present an overview of the current state of evidence on the effect of housing circumstances, and housing-related interventions, on adult mental health and well-being. It covers the entire range of health from chronic illness to positive thriving, and both individual and community-level/public health.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based upon a purposive review, commissioned originally for the UK Department of Health; and therefore is selective in giving priority to research relevant to public policy considerations, and to the UK context. Research with a variety of methodological foundations is considered, where robust enough by its own standards.
   Findings - The available evidence gives conditional support to policies accentuating empowerment at individual and community levels; early intervention; locality or place-based interventions; and integrated working practice. The complexity of methodological issues emerges as a key challenge for research in this field, and for the prospect of evidence-based national policy. Meanwhile local knowledge and interpretation of data in context may be more reliable than context-blind studies.
   Research limitations/implications -Where "hard evidence'' is unavailable, reports of the lived experience of individuals and in communities remain a legitimate basis for policy and commissioning.
   Originality/value - This appears to be the first attempt in print to cover such a wide canvas in one overview.

AB  - Nowadays a special attention is focused on prenatal and childhood exposures to a variety of contaminants in the environment, especially toxicants widely present in the environment and their impact on children's health and neurodevelopment. This article aims at evaluating the impact of exposure to several widespread toxicants including: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, bisphenol A, brominated flame retardants and gas cooking on children's cognitive development and behavioral problems by reviewing most recent published literature. Epidemiological studies focusing on exposure to widespread toxicants and children's development for the last eleven years were identified by a search of the PubMed, Medline, Ebsco and Toxnet literature bases. The combination of following key words was used: 1) referring to the exposure: pregnancy, prenatal exposure, postnatal exposure, gas cooking, exposure to phthalates, bisphenol A, brominated flame retardants, PAHs and 2) referring to outcome: neurodevelopment, neurobehavior, psychomotor development, behavioral problems, cognitive development, mental health, school achievements, learning abilities. The results from the presented studies suggest that there are strong and rather consistent indications that the developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable to insult from low levels of exposure to widespread environmental contaminants such as: phthalates, bisphenol A, brominated flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, gas cooking. Considering the suggested health effects, more epidemiologic data is urgently needed and, in the meantime, precautionary policies must be implemented.

AB  - Many cognitive screening instruments have been developed during the last decades to detect mild cognitive dysfunction and dementia, and there is an ongoing discussion as to which tool should be used in which setting and which challenges have to be considered. Among other aspects, dependence on age is a recognized problem in screening tools which still has not found its way into common scoring procedures. Another aspect which has been handled very heterogeneously is which domain is represented in which proportion in the total score. Furthermore, screening ethnic minority patients has been identified as an important but so far widely unresolved matter. In this review, four cognitive screening tools that all follow a common, stringent concept and pay regard to some critical aspects are described: the DemTect, a "generic" tool; the PANDA for Parkinson's disease patients; the EASY, a non-verbal, culture-fair screening test for patients with migration background; and the MUSIC for patients with multiple sclerosis. All of these screening instruments have an age-correction, provide a total score in which the different subtests are weighted according to their individual sensitivity and specificity, and include tasks that are specifically aligned to the cognitive profile of the target group, including the EASY with non-verbal, culture-fair tasks to overcome language and cultural barriers. The development, main characteristics, data, and limitations of these tools are presented and discussed against the background of the current landscape of cognitive screening tools.

AB  - Plant-bacteria partnerships have been extensively studied and applied to improve crop yield. In addition to their application in agriculture, a promising field to exploit plant-bacteria partnerships is the remediation of soil and water polluted with hydrocarbons. Application of effective plant-bacteria partnerships for the remediation of hydrocarbons depend mainly on the presence and metabolic activities of plant associated rhizo- and endophytic bacteria possessing specific genes required for the degradation of hydrocarbon pollutants. Plants and their associated bacteria interact with each other whereby plant supplies the bacteria with a special carbon source that stimulates the bacteria to degrade organic contaminants in the soil. In return, plant associated-bacteria can support their host plant to overcome contaminated-induced stress responses, and improve plant growth and development. In addition, plants further get benefits from their associated-bacteria possessing hydrocarbon-degradation potential, leading to enhanced hydrocarbon mineralization and lowering of both phytotoxicity and evapotranspiration of volatile hydrocarbons. A better understanding of plant-bacteria partnerships could be exploited to enhance the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils in conjunction with sustainable production of non-food crops for biomass and biofuel production.

Further, two unexplored research issues having a bearing on clinical psychology and psychiatry have been delineated. Firstly, a call for addressing the mental health problems of non-violent protesters numbering over one billion spread all over the world has been made. And secondly, there is a need for understanding the neurological basis of non-violent form of behavior, for example, the role of oxytocin, to increase the legitimacy of non-violence as adaptive behavior.

AB  - Conservation efforts to sustain water resources and aquatic biodiversity in boreal watersheds will require reliable information on the recent status of various indicator species and an improved understanding of the risks to aquatic biodiversity posed by resource development activities. We reviewed the recent state of knowledge on the responses of aquatic biodiversity to forest management, pulp and paper mill effluents, hydroelectric impoundments, mining of minerals and metals, oil sands extractions, and peat mining and offer a prognosis for aquatic biodiversity under each of these environmental stressors. Despite the prevalence of natural resource development in Canada's largest forest ecosystem, there was a limited amount of published literature on the effects of many of the disturbance types on various indicators of aquatic biodiversity, making it difficult to produce a current and reliable status assessment. Across most of the boreal zone, there is a lack of coordinated, consistent data collection for many of the bioindicators and disturbance types discussed in this review. Forecasting the future state of aquatic biodiversity across the boreal zone is challenged by increasing natural resource development and its interactions with other stressors, especially climate change. The cumulative effects of multiple stressors coupled with resource development activities in boreal watersheds remain largely unknown. More importantly, the ecological thresholds for these cumulative effects (that is, the point at which aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity cannot recover to a desired state within a reasonable time frame) are also unknown and remain gaps in our knowledge. The recent literature identifies a number of risks to aquatic biodiversity at local (tens of square kilometres) to regional (hundreds of square kilometres) scales associated with natural resource development. There are indications that many of these risks can be minimized by "greener" technologies for resource development and reclamation, practical conservation planning and regulation, and increased stewardship in watershed management, although the effectiveness of many of these measures cannot yet be assessed from the published literature.

AB  - For the last 20 years, the "amyloid cascade hypothesis" has dominated research aimed at understanding, preventing, and curing Alzheimer's disease (AD). During that time researchers have acquired an enormous amount of data and have been successful, more than 300 times, in curing the disease in animal model systems by treatments aimed at clearing amyloid deposits. However, to date similar strategies have not been successful in human AD patients. Hence, before rushing into further clinical trials with compounds that aim at lowering amyloid-beta (A beta) levels in increasingly younger people, it would be of highest priority to re-assess the initial assumption that accumulation of A beta in the brain is the primary pathological event driving AD. Here we question this assumption by highlighting experimental evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis suggesting that APP and A beta are part of a neuronal stress/injury system, which is up-regulated to counteract inflammation/oxidative stress-associated neurodegeneration that could be triggered by a brain injury, chronic infections, or a systemic disease. In AD, this protective program may be overridden by genetic and other risk factors, or its maintenance may become dysregulated during aging. Here, we provide a hypothetical example of a hypothesis-driven correlation between car accidents and airbag release in analogy to the evolution of the amyloid focus and as a way to offer a potential explanation for the failure of the AD field to translate the success of amyloid-related therapeutic strategies in experimental models to the clinic.

AB  - While the effects of reward, affect, and motivation on learning have each developed into their own fields of research, they largely have been investigated in isolation. As all three of these constructs are highly related, and use similar experimental procedures, an important advance in research would be to consider the interplay between these constructs. Here we first define each of the three constructs, and then discuss how they may influence each other within a common framework. Finally, we delineate several sources of evidence supporting the framework. By considering the constructs of reward, affect, and motivation within a single framework, we can develop a better understanding of the processes involved in learning and how they interplay, and work toward a comprehensive theory that encompasses reward, affect, and motivation.

AB  - Despite the high prevalence and potentially disabling consequences of mental disorders, specialized mental health services are extremely deficient, leading to the so-called 'Mental Health Gap'. Moreover, the services are concentrated in the urban areas, further worsening the rural-urban and tertiary primary care divide. Strengthening of and expanding the existing human resources and infrastructure, and integrating mental health into primary care appear to be the two major solutions. However, both the strategies are riddled with logistic difficulties and have a long gestation period. In such a scenario, telepsychiatry or e-mental health, defined as the use of information and communication technology to provide or support psychiatric services across distances, appears to be a promising answer. Due to its enormous potential, a review of the existing literature becomes imperative. An extensive search of literature was carried out and has been presented to delineate the modes of communication, acceptability and satisfaction, reliability, outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and legal and ethical challenges related to telepsychiatry. Telepsychiatry has been applied for direct patient care (diagnosis and management), consultation, and training, education, and research purposes. Both real-time, live interaction (synchronous) and store-forward (asynchronous) types of technologies have been used for these purposes. A growing amount of literature shows that training, supervision, and consultation by specialists to primary care physicians through telepsychiatry has several advantages. In this background, we have further focused on the models of telepsychiatry best suited for India, considering that mental health care can be integrated into primary care and taken to the doorstep of patients in the community.

AB  - Parasite location has been proposed as an important factor in the behavioural changes observed in rodents infected with the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. During the chronic stages of infection, encysted parasites are found in the brain but it remains unclear whether the parasite has tropism for specific brain regions. Parasite tissue cysts are found in all brain areas with some, but not all, prior studies reporting higher numbers located in the amygdala and frontal cortex. A stochastic process of parasite location does not, however, seem to explain the distinct and often subtle changes observed in rodent behaviour. One factor that could contribute to the specific changes is increased dopamine production by T. gondii. Recently, it was found that cells encysted with parasites in the brains of experimentally infected rodents have high levels of dopamine and that the parasite encodes a tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of this neurotransmitter. A mechanism is proposed that could explain the behaviour changes due to parasite regulation of dopamine. This could have important implications for T. gondii infections in humans.

AB  - In neurons, mitochondria are enriched to provide energy and calcium buffering required for synaptic transmission. Additionally, mitochondria localize to the synapse, where they are critical for the mobilization of reserve pool vesicles and for neurotransmitter release. Previously, functional defects in mitochondria were considered to be downstream effects of neurodegenerative diseases. However, more recent findings suggest mitochondria may serve as key mediators in the onset and progression of some types of neurodegeneration. In this review, we explore the possible roles of altered mitochondrial function and dynamics in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which have highlighted the important role of mitochondria in neurodegeneration. While inheritable diseases like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A are concretely linked to gene mutations affecting mitochondrial function, the cause of mitochondrial dysfunction in primarily sporadic diseases such as AD and PD is less clear. Neuronal death in PD is associated with defects in mitochondrial function and dynamics arising from mutations in proteins affecting these processes, including a-synuclein, DJ-1, LRRK2, Parkin and Pink1. In the case of AD, however, the connection between mitochondria and the onset of neurodegeneration has been less clear. Recent findings, however, have implicated altered function of ER-mitochondria contact sites and amyloid beta-and/or tau-induced defects in mitochondrial function and dynamics in the pathogenesis of AD, suggesting that mitochondrial defects may act as key mediators in the pathogenesis of AD as well. With recent findings at hand, it may be postulated that defects in mitochondrial processes comprise key events in the onset of neurodegeneration.

AB  - As the number of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise, the need for efficacious therapeutics is becoming more and more urgent. Understanding the molecular relationship and interactions between A beta and tau and their contribution to cognitive decline remain one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in the AD field. Likewise, elucidating the initial triggers of disease pathology, as well as the impact of various factors such as stress and inflammation on disease progression, are equally important to fully understand this devastating disorder. Here we discuss recent studies that have illuminated the importance of key facilitators of disease progression using the 3xTg-AD and CaM/Tet-DTA mouse models, and suggest viable targets for ameliorating both molecular pathology and cognitive decline.

Invasive work in animals and post-mortem investigations have revealed the rich cytoarchitectonics and functional specificity of the thalamus. Given current restrictions in the spatial resolution of non-invasive imaging modalities, there is, however, a translational gap between functional and structural information on these circuits in humans and animals as well as between histological and cellular evidence and their relationship to psychological functioning. With the advance of higher field strengths for MR approaches, better spatial resolution is now available promising to overcome this conceptual problem. We here review these two levels, which exist for both neuroscientific and clinical investigations, and then focus on current attempts to overcome conceptual boundaries of these observations with the help of ultra-high resolution imaging.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder, associated with rigidity, bradykinesia, and resting tremor, among other motor symptoms. In addition, patients with PD also show cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction, including dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), depression, hallucinations, among others. Interestingly, the occurrence of these symptoms motor, cognitive, and psychiatric vary among individuals, such that a subgroup of PD patients might show some of the symptoms, but another subgroup does not. This has prompted neurologists and scientists to subtype PD patients depending on the severity of symptoms they show. Neural studies have also mapped different motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms in PD to different brain networks. In this review, we discuss the neural and behavioral substrates of most common subtypes of PD patients, that are related to the occurrence of: (a) resting tremor (vs. nontremordominant); (b) MCI; (c) dementia; (d) impulse control disorders (ICD); (e) depression; and/or (f) hallucinations. We end by discussing the relationship among subtypes of PD subgroups, and the relationship among motor, cognitive, psychiatric factors in PD.

AB  - Impairments of hearing and balance are major problems in the field of occupational and environmental health. Such impairments have previously been reported to be caused by genetic and environmental factors. However, their mechanisms have not been fully clarified. On the other hand, the inner ear contains spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the organ of Corti, which serve as the primary carriers of auditory information from sensory cells to the auditory cortex in the cerebrum. Inner ears also contain a vestibule in the vicinity of the organ of Corti-one of the organs responsible for balance. Thus, inner ears could be a good target to clarify the pathogeneses of sensorineural hearing losses and impaired balance. In our previous studies with c-Ret knock-in mice and Endothelin receptor B (Ednrb) knock-out mice, it was found that syndromic hearing losses involved postnatal neurodegeneration of SGNs caused by impairments of c-Ret and Ednrb, which play important roles in neuronal development and maintenance of the enteric nervous system. The organ of Corti and the vestibule in inner ears also suffer from degeneration caused by environmental stresses including noise and heavy metals, resulting in impairments of hearing and balance. In this review, we introduce impairments of hearing and balance caused by genetic and environmental factors and focus on impairments of SGNs and the vestibule in inner ears as the pathogeneses caused by these factors.

AB  - Many of Shakespeare's plays contain characters who appear to be afflicted by neurological or psychiatric disorders. Shakespeare, in his descriptive analysis of his protagonists, was contributing to the understanding of these disorders. In fact, Charcot frequently used Shakespearean references in his neurological teaching sessions, stressing how acute objective insight is essential to achieving expert clinical diagnosis. Charcot found in Shakespeare the same rigorous observational techniques for which he himself became famous. This chapter describes many of Shakespearean characters suffering from varied neurological disorders, including Parkinsonism, epilepsy, sleeping disturbances, dementia, headache, prion disease, and paralyses.

AB  - The major molecules associated with Alzheimer's disease, the phosphorylated protein tau and the 42 amino acid peptide, amyloid-beta (A beta), have recently been analyzed in yeast. These yeast studies have provided major new insights into the effects of tau and A beta and, at the same time, offered new approaches to rapidly search for chemicals that may be involved in prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The following review summarizes the role of yeast and its contribution in Alzheimer's disease research, and highlights important studies that have been conducted in this model organism.

AB  - Nephrops norvegicus represents a very valuable fishery across Europe, and the species possesses a relatively complex life cycle and reproductive biology across spatial and temporal scales. Insights into embryonic and larval biology, and associated abiotic and biotic factors that influence recruitment, are important since this will affect population and species success. Much of the fishery, and indeed scientific sampling, is reliant on trawling, which is likely to cause direct and indirect stresses on adults and developing embryos. We have collated evidence, including that garnered from laboratory studies, to assess the likely effects on reproduction and population. Using know-how from hatchery operations in similar species such as Homarus sp., we also seek to optimise larviculture that could be commercialised to create a hatchery and thus assist stock remediation. This review chapter is therefore divided into three sections: (1) general N. norvegicus reproductive biology, (2) life cycle and larval biology and (3) a comprehensive review of all rearing attempts for this species to date, including a likely way forward for pilot scale and hence commercial restocking operations.

AB  - Assessment of soil contamination and its long-term monitoring are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of phytoremediation systems. Spectral sensing-based monitoring methods promise obvious benefits compared to field-based methods: lower cost, faster data acquisition and better spatio-temporal monitoring. This paper reviews the theoretical basis whereby proximal spectral sensing of soil and vegetation could be used to monitor phytoremediation of metal-contaminated soils, and the eventual upscaling to imaging sensing. Both laboratory and field spectroscopy have been applied to sense heavy metals in soils indirectly via their intercorrelations with soil constituents, and also through metal-induced vegetation stress. In soil, most predictions are based on intercorrelations of metals with spectrally-active soil constituents viz., Fe-oxides, organic carbon, and clays. Spectral variations in metal-stressed plants is particularly associated with changes in chlorophyll, other pigments, and cell structure, all of which can be investigated by vegetation indices and red edge position shifts. Key shortcomings in obtaining satisfactory calibration for monitoring the metals in soils or metal-related plant stress include: reduced prediction accuracy compared to chemical methods, complexity of spectra, no unique spectral features associated with metal-related plant stresses, and transfer of calibrations from laboratory to field to regional scale. Nonetheless, spectral sensing promises to be a time saving, non-destructive and cost-effective option for long-term monitoring especially over large phytoremediation areas, and it is well-suited to phytoremediation networks where monitoring is an integral part.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder that is estimated to affect at least 1 million individuals in the USA and over 10 million worldwide. It is thought that the loss of neurons and development of inclusion bodies occur gradually over decades until they progress to the point where similar to 60% of the dopamine neurons are lost and patients present with motor dysfunction. At present, it is not clear what causes this progression, and there are no current therapies that have been successful in preventing PD progression. Although there are many hypotheses regarding the mechanism of PD progression, neuroinflammation may be a major contributor to PD pathogenesis. Indeed, activated microglia and subsequent neuroinflammation have been consistently associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Thus, interference with this process could provide a means of neuroprotection in PD. This review will discuss the potential of targeting microglia to reduce neuroinflammation in PD. Further, we discuss the potential of microglial ion channels to serve as novel targets for neuroprotection in PD.

AB  - The mechanisms for pattern completion and pattern separation are described in the context of a theory of hippocampal function in which the hippocampal CA3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial, associations between any spatial location ( place in rodents, or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward, and to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The factors important in the pattern completion in CA3 together with a large number of independent memories stored in CA3 include a sparse distributed representation which is enhanced by the graded firing rates of CA3 neurons, representations that are independent due to the randomizing effect of the mossy fibers, heterosynaptic long-term depression as well as long- term potentiation in the recurrent collateral synapses, and diluted connectivity to minimize the number of multiple synapses between any pair of CA3 neurons which otherwise distort the basins of attraction. Recall of information from CA3 is implemented by the entorhinal cortex perforant path synapses to CA3 cells, which in acting as a pattern associator allow some pattern generalization. Pattern separation is performed in the dentate granule cells using competitive learning to convert grid-like entorhinal cortex firing to place-like fields. Pattern separation in CA3, which is important for completion of any one of the stored patterns from a fragment, is provided for by the randomizing effect of the mossy fiber synapses to which neurogenesis may contribute, by the large number of dentate granule cells each with a sparse representation, and by the sparse independent representations in CA3. Recall to the neocortex is achieved by a reverse hierarchical series of pattern association networks implemented by the hippocampo-cortical backprojections, each one of which performs some pattern generalization, to retrieve a complete pattern of cortical firing in higher-order cortical areas.

AB  - Over the last decades, studies from our laboratory and other groups using animal models have shown that iron overload, resulting in iron accumulation in the brain, produces significant cognitive deficits. Iron accumulation in the hippocampus and the basal ganglia has been related to impairments in spatial memory, aversive memory, and recognition memory in rodents. These results are corroborated by studies showing that the administration of iron chelators attenuates cognitive deficits in a variety of animal models of cognitive dysfunction, including aging and Alzheimer's disease models. Remarkably, recent human studies using magnetic resonance image techniques have also shown a consistent correlation between cognitive dysfunction and iron deposition, mostly in the hippocampus, cortical areas, and basal ganglia. These findings may have relevant implications in the light of the knowledge that iron accumulates in brain regions of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of the functional consequences of iron dysregulation in aging and neurological diseases may help to identify novel targets for treating memory problems that afflict a growing aging population.

AB  - Objective: A comprehensive treatment program for schizophrenia needs to include services to women of childbearing age that address contraception, pregnancy, and postpartum issues, as well as safe and effective parenting. To update knowledge in these areas, a summary of the recent qualitative and quantitative literature was undertaken. Method: The search terms sexuality,contraception,pregnancy,postpartum,custody, and parenting were entered into PubMed, PsycINFO, and SOCINDEX along with the terms schizophrenia and antipsychotic. Publications in English for all years subsequent to 2000 were retrieved and their reference lists further searched in an attempt to arrive at a distillation of useful clinical recommendations. Results: The main recommendations to care providers are as follows: take a sexual history and initiate discussion about intimate relationships and contraception with all women diagnosed with schizophrenia. During pregnancy, adjust antipsychotic dose to clinical status, link the patient with prenatal care services, and help her prepare for childbirth. There are pros and cons to breastfeeding while on medication, and these need thorough discussion. During the postpartum period, mental health home visits should be provided. Parenting support is critical. Conclusion: The comprehensive treatment of schizophrenia in women means remembering that all women of childbearing age are potential new mothers.

AB  - Purpose - There is ongoing discussion around how to structure psychiatric services to meet the needs of people with intellectual disability and co-morbid mental illness and several different models have been suggested. With research evidence lacking, there is a lack of consensus as to the best model of service provision. This paper aims to review the current knowledge in this area and discuss the salient issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a review article summarising the current debate. Evidence from original research is presented and combined with opinion from clinical experience.
   Findings - The authors find a lack of robust research evidence to support any particular model of service provision. However, it seems to be increasingly accepted that purely generic models of care for people with intellectual disabilities and co-morbid mental illness are not appropriate. Integration of the expertise from specialist services within mainstream services is presented as potentially the most advantageous approach.
   Originality/value - This article will be of benefit to clinicians working in the field of intellectual disability and mental illness, and to managers and commissioners with responsibility for providing services. It will also be useful for those new to the discipline to gain an overview of the current issues and debate within service planning for this population.

AB  - Aims: This article considers eudaimonic models of psychological well-being in relation to qualitative data previously gathered as part of Manchester Metropolitan University's Invest to Save Arts in Health programme (2004-07).
   Methods: The research draws from 21 interviews with participants involved in Invest to Save arts projects for older people and adults with a mental health diagnosis. Using a collaborative team approach, a hybrid thematic analysis was undertaken alongside an updated literature review framed by positive psychology and with a focus on well-being.
   Results: The analysis identified eudaimonic themes of autonomy/intrinsic motivation and challenge to be particularly pertinent to participants' experiences of the scheme. Findings suggest that the programme provided a sense of purposeful occupation, cognitive and creative challenge and opportunities for autonomous self-expression and heightened concentration (flow). Many participants identified with the arts activities on offer and, while not necessarily aspiring to achieve any particular status, were intrinsically motivated to develop what they considered to be their innate creative potential. Some also reported that sustained engagement was important to their continued psychological well-being.
   Conclusions: Arts and health researchers might usefully draw from theories of well-being from positive psychology. Both fields are compatible in that they share an interest in human flourishing and understanding of wellness as more than an absence of dysfunction or disease. Further research is needed to ascertain whether the limited results presented here are representative of other populations. What does seem evident is that arts projects have a broad appeal and can be highly inclusive, accommodating participants with diverse needs. More generally the investigation raises questions about the cultural scaffolds that are in place to support eudaimonic well-being across the lifespan, as well as the consequences of restricting such opportunities for individuals and communities.

AB  - Background: Pharmacotherapy is the first line of treatment for bipolar disorder, but many patients continue to experience persistent subthreshold symptoms. Alternative adjunct treatments, including nutritional therapies, may have the potential to alleviate residual symptoms and improve the outcomes of standard pharmacotherapy. The aim of this paper is to critically review the current clinical evidence and mechanisms of action of nutrient-based therapies alone or in combination with commonly used pharmacotherapies for mania and bipolar depression. Methods: We conducted a Medline search for clinical trials conducted with humans, published in English from 1960 to 2012 using nutritional supplements such as n-3, chromium, inositol, choline, magnesium, folate and tryptophan alone or in combination with pharmacotherapies for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Results: Preliminary data yields conflicting but mainly positive evidence for the use of n-3 fatty acids and chromium in the treatment of bipolar depression. Limited evidence found that inositol may be helpful for bipolar depression, but larger sample sizes are needed. Preliminary randomized, controlled trials suggest that choline, magnesium, folate and tryptophan may be beneficial for reducing symptoms of mania. Conclusions: Given the potential public health impact of identifying adjunct treatments that improve psychiatric as well as physical health outcomes, nutritional treatments appear promising for the management of bipolar disorder but require further study.

AB  - Seasonally breeding birds detect environmental signals, such as light, temperature, food availability, and presence of mates to time reproduction. Hypothalamic neurons integrate external and internal signals, and regulate reproduction by releasing neurohormones to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland synthesizes and releases gonadotropins which in turn act on the gonads to stimulate gametogenesis and sex steroid secretion. Accordingly, how gonadotropin secretion is controlled by the hypothalamus is key to our understanding of the mechanisms of seasonal reproduction. A hypothalamic neuropeptide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), activates reproduction by stimulating gonadotropin synthesis and release. Another hypothalamic neuropeptide, gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), inhibits gonadotropin synthesis and release directly by acting on the pituitary gland or indirectly by decreasing the activity of GnRH neurons. Therefore, the next step to understand seasonal reproduction is to investigate how the activities of GnRH and GnIH neurons in the hypothalamus and their receptors in the pituitary gland are regulated by external and internal signals. It is possible that locally-produced triiodothyronine resulting from the action of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase on thyroxine stimulates the release of gonadotropins, perhaps by action on GnRH neurons. The function of GnRH neurons is also regulated by transcription of the GnRH gene. Melatonin, a nocturnal hormone, stimulates the synthesis and release of GnIH and GnIH may therefore regulate a daily rhythm of gonadotropin secretion. GnIH may also temporally suppress gonadotropin secretion when environmental conditions are unfavorable. Environmental and social milieus fluctuate seasonally in the wild. Accordingly, complex interactions of various neuronal and hormonal systems need to be considered if we are to understand the mechanisms underlying seasonal reproduction.

   Objective: Quality of life, which consists of the physical, mental, and social domains, has been shown to be negatively affected by alcohol abuse and dependence. This review aims to examine QoL in alcohol abuse and dependence by reviewing the instruments used to measure it and by analyzing the impact of alcohol abuse and dependence and of treatment on QoL.
   Methods: Studies were identified using a database search of PubMed and PsycINFO from the past 40 years (1971-2011) using the following keywords: abuse OR dependence, OR use AND alcohol, AND Quality of Life, QoL, Health-related quality of life, HRQOL. Two authors agreed independently on including 50 studies that met specific selection criteria.
   Results: Although several global measures of QoL have established reliability and validity, many alcohol-specific measures of QoL have not yet been validated. Nevertheless, QoL has been shown to be significantly impaired in those with alcohol abuse and dependence, particularly in the domains of mental health and social functioning, the very areas that show the greatest improvement with abstinence and its maintenance. Moreover, the literature demonstrates the utility of using QoL measures throughout assessment and treatment as a motivational tool and as a marker for treatment efficacy.
   Conclusions: Measuring and monitoring QoL during assessment and treatment can add important value to patient recovery, for QoL improves with treatment and successful abstinence. Therefore, targeted, disease-specific assessments of QoL are warranted to address the impairments in the physical, mental, and social domains in alcohol abuse and dependence, thereby improving long-term outcomes.

KW  - Pre-menopausal disorder
KW  - Tailor-made medicine
AB  - A serious problem currently plaguing the medical field is the widening gap between academic medicine, which studies the features and causes of illness, and the medical care that patients desire. An example of this gap can be observed in the practice of psychotherapy, which is effective only for certain patients. Kampo medicine that combines the advantages of Western medicine with those of traditional Japanese medicine is currently undergoing a revival in the healthcare sector. The therapeutic policies underlying Kampo medicine are based on the physical constitution and current symptoms of each patient. For this reason, Kampo medicine is referred to as "tailor-made medicine" and has properties similar to "mind and body" or psychosomatic medicine. Some women exhibit multiple undefined stress-related symptoms during the peri-menopausal period. In order to accurately diagnose and provide patient-specific treatment, physicians should not only investigate the various stress factors in patients' lives but should also provide a Sho, or a Kampo diagnosis. The therapeutic approach in Kampo medicine is aimed at harmonizing the mind, body, and spirit; this practice involves the use of narrative and holistic medication that treats the entire being of the patient, resulting in an increased number of specialized treatment plans. There are many Kampo prescriptions tailored to treat women who exhibit various stress-related symptoms. Both Kampo and psychosomatic medicine are based on the principles of narrative-based medicine, and by integrating these two medical systems, an ideal system can be devised to better cope with the various needs of patients. This new medical system established by integrating and harmonizing Western and Eastern medicine can be used for the treatment of women with stress-related symptoms.

AB  - Background: The translocation of plants or animals between populations has been used in conservation to reinforce populations of threatened species, and may be used in the future to buffer species' ranges from the anticipated effects of environmental change. This population admixture can result in outbreeding, and the resulting "hybrid" offspring can be either fitter (heterosis) or less fit (outbreeding depression) than their parents. Outbreeding depression has the potential to undermine conservation plans that mix populations of declining or threatened species.
   Methods: We searched for literature documenting phenotypic responses to intraspecific outbreeding between natural populations of animal and plant species. Outbreeding responses were summarised as log-response ratios that compared hybrid with mid-parent phenotypes (528 effect sizes from 98 studies). These data included effect sizes from both fitness components (survival, viability and fecundity traits) and other traits (e.g. morphological, physiological, defence), and were pooled using Bayesian mixed-effects meta-analysis.
   Results: There was no overall effect of outbreeding on hybrid phenotypes (overall pooled effect = +2.61% phenotypic change relative to parents, 95% credible interval (CI) -1.03-6.60%). However, fitness component traits responded significantly more negatively to outbreeding than traits less directly linked with fitness. Our model predicted a significant 6.9% F1 generation benefit to outcrossing through non-fitness traits (CI 2.7-11.2%), but no significant benefit to these traits in the F2 (3.5%; CI -4.3-12.2%). Fitness component traits were predicted to suffer a cost (-8.8%) relative to parents in the F2 (CI -14.1- -2.5%), but not in the F1 (+1.3%; CI - 2.1-5.4%). Between-study variation accounted for 39.5% of heterogeneity in outbreeding responses, leaving 27.1% of heterogeneity between effect sizes within studies and 33.4% attributable to measurement error within effect sizes.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates consistent effects of trait type on responses to intraspecific outbreeding, and indicates the potential for outbreeding depression in the F2. However, our analyses also reveal significant heterogeneity in outbreeding responses within and among studies. Thus, outbreeding costs will not always occur. Conservation practitioners may be able to anticipate when such outbreeding depression should arise using an existing decision-making framework that takes into account the context of hybridising populations.

AB  - Human social interaction is essential in daily life and crucial for a promising life, especially in people who suffer from disease. Theory of Mind (ToM) is fundamental in social interaction and is described as the ability to impute the mental states of others in social situations. Studies have proposed that a complex neuroanatomical network that includes the frontal cortex mediates ToM. The primary neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the frontal-striatal system; therefore, patients with PD are expected to exhibit deficits in ToM. In this review, we summarize the current research with a particular focus on the patterns of impaired ToM, potential mediators of ToM, and the impact of ToM deficits on clinical disability in PD. Further studies to investigate the progression of ToM and its relationship with dementia in subjects in PD are needed.

The sympathetic nervous system promotes arterial hypertension and cardiovascular as well as renal damage, thus, providing a logical treatment target in these patients. Recent physiological studies suggest that baroreflex mechanisms contribute to long-term control of sympathetic activity and blood pressure providing an impetus for the development of electrical carotid sinus stimulators. The concept behind electrical stimulation of baroreceptors or baroreflex afferent nerves is that the stimulus is sensed by the brain as blood pressure increase. Then, baroreflex efferent structures are adjusted to counteract the perceived blood pressure increase. Electrical stimulators directly activating afferent baroreflex nerves were developed years earlier but failed for technical reasons. Recently, a novel implantable device was developed that produces an electrical field stimulation of the carotid sinus wall. Carefully conducted experiments in dogs provided important insight in mechanisms mediating the depressor response to electrical carotid sinus stimulation. Moreover, these studies showed that the treatment success may depend on the underlying pathophysiology of the hypertension. Clinical studies suggest that electrical carotid sinus stimulation attenuates sympathetic activation of vasculature, heart, and kidney while augmenting cardiac vagal regulation, thus lowering blood pressure. Yet, not all patients respond to treatment. Additional clinical trials are required. Patients equipped with an electrical carotid sinus stimulator provide a unique opportunity gaining insight in human baroreflex physiology. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Much of the literature to date concerning public attitudes towards people with severe mental illness (SMI) has focused on negative stereotypes and discriminatory behaviour. However, there also exists a tradition of volunteering with these people, implying a more positive attitude. Groups with positive attitudes and behaviours towards people with SMI have received relatively little attention in research. They merit further attention, as evidence on characteristics and experiences of volunteers may help to promote volunteering. The present paper aims to systematically review the literature reporting characteristics, motivations, experiences, and benefits of volunteers in the care of people with SMI.
   Methods: In November 2010, a systematic electronic search was carried out in BNI, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane Registers and Web of Science databases, using a combination of 'volunteer', 'mental health' and 'outcome' search terms. A secondary hand search was performed in relevant psychiatric journals, grey literature and references.
   Results: 14 papers met the inclusion criteria for the review, with data on a total of 540 volunteers. The results suggest that volunteers are a mostly female, but otherwise heterogeneous group. Motivations for volunteering are a combination of what they can 'give' to others and what they can 'get' for themselves. Overall volunteers report positive experiences. The main benefit to persons with a psychiatric illness is the gaining of a companion, who is non-stigmatizing and proactive in increasing their social-community involvement.
   Conclusions: The evidence base for volunteers in care of people with SMI is small and inconsistent. However there are potential implications for both current and future volunteering programmes from the data. As the data suggests that there is no 'typical' volunteer, volunteering programmes should recruit individuals from a variety of backgrounds. The act of volunteering can not only benefit people with SMI, but also the volunteers. Further research may specify methods of recruiting, training, supervising and using volunteers to maximise the benefit for all involved.

AB  - The cerebellum regulates complex movements and is also implicated in cognitive tasks, and cerebellar dysfunction is consequently associated not only with movement disorders, but also with conditions like autism and dyslexia. How information is encoded by specific cerebellar firing patterns remains debated, however. A central question is how the cerebellar cortex transmits its integrated output to the cerebellar nuclei via GABAergic synapses from Purkinje neurons. Possible answers come from accumulating evidence that subsets of Purkinje cells synchronize their firing during behaviors that require the cerebellum. Consistent with models predicting that coherent activity of inhibitory networks has the capacity to dictate firing patterns of target neurons, recent experimental work supports the idea that inhibitory synchrony may regulate the response of cerebellar nuclear cells to Purkinje inputs, owing to the interplay between unusually fast inhibitory synaptic responses and high rates of intrinsic activity. Data from multiple laboratories lead to a working hypothesis that synchronous inhibitory input from Purkinje cells can set the timing and rate of action potentials produced by cerebellar nuclear cells, thereby relaying information out of the cerebellum. If so, then changing spatiotemporal patterns of Purkinje activity would allow different subsets of inhibitory neurons to control cerebellar output at different times. Here we explore the evidence for and against the idea that a synchrony code defines, at least in part, the input-output function between the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. We consider the literature on the existence of simple spike synchrony, convergence of Purkinje neurons onto nuclear neurons, and intrinsic properties of nuclear neurons that contribute to responses to inhibition. Finally, we discuss factors that may disrupt or modulate a synchrony code and describe the potential contributions of inhibitory synchrony to other motor circuits.

AB  - CB1- and CB2-type cannabinoid receptors mediate effects of the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide in mammals. In canonical endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity, 2-AG is generated postsynaptically by diacylglycerol lipase alpha and acts via presynaptic CB1-type cannabinoid receptors to inhibit neurotransmitter release. Electrophysiological studies on lampreys indicate that this retrograde signalling mechanism occurs throughout the vertebrates, whereas system-level studies point to conserved roles for endocannabinoid signalling in neural mechanisms of learning and control of locomotor activity and feeding. CB1/CB2-type receptors originated in a common ancestor of extant chordates, and in the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis a CB1/CB2-type receptor is targeted to axons, indicative of an ancient role for cannabinoid receptors as axonal regulators of neuronal signalling. Although CB1/CB2-type receptors are unique to chordates, enzymes involved in biosynthesis/inactivation of endocannabinoids occur throughout the animal kingdom. Accordingly, non-CB1/CB2-mediated mechanisms of endocannabinoid signalling have been postulated. For example, there is evidence that 2-AG mediates retrograde signalling at synapses in the nervous system of the leech Hirudo medicinalis by activating presynaptic transient receptor potential vanilloid-type ion channels. Thus, postsynaptic synthesis of 2-AG or anandamide may be a phylogenetically widespread phenomenon, and a variety of proteins may have evolved as presynaptic (or postsynaptic) receptors for endocannabinoids.

AB  - Glia play an under-recognized role in epilepsy. This review examines the involvement of glial connexins (Cxs) and pannexins (Panxs), proteins which form gap junctions and membrane hemichannels (connexins) and hemichannels (pannexins), in epilepsy. These proteins, particularly glial Cx43, have been shown to be upregulated in epileptic brain tissue. In a cobalt model of in taro seizures, seizures increased Panxs1 and 2 and Cx43 expression, and remarkably reorganized the interrelationships between their mRNA levels (transcriptome) which then became statistically significant. Gap junctions are highly implicated in synchronous seizure activity. Blocking gap junctional communication (GJC) is often anticonvulsant, and assumed to be due to blocking gap junctionally-medicated electrotonic coupling between neurons. However, in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, connexin43 specific peptides, which attenuate GJC possibly by blocking connexon docking, diminished spontaneous seizures. Glia have many functions including extracellular potassium redistribution, in part via gap junctions, which if blocked, can be seizuregenic. Glial gap junctions are critical for the delivery of nutrients to neurons, which if interrupted, can depress seizure activity. Other functions of glia possibly related to epileptogenesis are mentioned including anatomic reorganization in chronic seizure models greatly increasing the overlapping domains of glial processes, changes in neurotransmitter re-uptake, and possible glial generation of currents and fields during seizure activity. Finally there is recent evidence for Cx43 hemichannels and Panx1 channels in glial membranes which could play a role in brain damage and seizure activity. Although glial Cxs and Panxs are increasingly recognized as contributing to fundamental mechanisms of epilepsy, the data are often contradictory and controversial, requiring much more research.

AB  - The field of non-pharmacological therapies for treatment resistant depression (TRD) is rapidly evolving and new somatic therapies are valuable options for patients who have failed numerous other treatments. A major challenge for clinicians ( and patients alike) is how to integrate the results from published clinical trials in the clinical decision-making process.
   We reviewed the literature for articles reporting results for clinical trials in particular efficacy data, contraindications and side effects of somatic therapies including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Each of these devices has an indication for patients with different level of treatment resistance, based on acuteness of illness, likelihood of response, costs and associated risks. ECT is widely available and its effects are relatively rapid in severe TRD, but its cognitive adverse effects may be cumbersome. TMS is safe and well tolerated, and it has been approved by FDA for adults who have failed to respond to one antidepressant, but its use in TRD is still controversial as it is not supported by rigorous double-blind randomized clinical trials. The options requiring surgical approach are VNS and DBS. VNS has been FDA-approved for TRD, however it is not indicated for management of acute illness. DBS for TRD is still an experimental area of investigation and double-blind clinical trials are underway.

In addition, we suggest that several traditional childhood Axis I conditions include a substantial trait component that may be responsible for the recurring finding that childhood Axis I disorders are predictive for adult Axis II disorders. Given the valuable information provided by a trait assessment, we further propose to integrate dimensional personality and personality pathology measures as standard tools in mental health assessments at a young age.

AB  - Objective: Many patients with anorexia nervosa develop an intractable and debilitating illness course. Our aims were to (i) conduct a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of treatment for chronic anorexia nervosa participants, and (ii) identify research informing novel therapeutic approaches for this group.
   Methods: Systematic search (SCOPUS plus previous reviews date 2011) of literature for (i) RCTs of treatment that included anorexia nervosa participants with a mean duration of illness of at least 3 years, (ii) studies reporting new treatments addressing factors associated with chronicity.
   Results: Evidence of efficacy for treatment approaches in severe and enduring anorexia nervosa is limited. Only one unpublished RCT designed to test a specific psychological approach for these patients was identified. There is a probable advantage for specialist psychotherapy over treatment as usual, and a promising study of relapse prevention with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for anorexia nervosa (CBT-AN). Open trials have, however, reported developments in psychological therapies that warrant further specific evaluation. These include forms of CBT modified for anorexia nervosa, cognitive remediation therapy with emotion skills training, the Maudsley Model for Treatment of Adults with Anorexia Nervosa, the Community Outreach Partnership Program, Specialist Supportive Clinical Management and the approach of Strober with its emphasis on therapeutic alliance and flexible goals.
   Conclusions: Treatment trials need to move beyond targeting core eating disorder pathology (primarily weight restoration) and examine efficacy and effectiveness in minimising harm and reducing personal and social costs of chronic illness. There is also a need to develop better definitions of chronicity, with or without treatment 'resistance' specifiers.

AB  - Bipolar disorder is a chronic, disabling, frequent and highly comorbid illness. It is often associated with addictive disorders (ADDs), another chronic and relapsing condition, with a lifetime prevalence three to five times higher than in the general population. However, knowledge is scarce about the possible mechanisms and the optimal treatment of this co-occurrence. Moreover, previous research has focused on separate ADDs, and few incidence data were available at the time. Our objective was, therefore, to evaluate the relevance of regrouping ADDs as classified in the preliminary version of the DSM-V in understanding the comorbidity of bipolar and ADDs. Using a comprehensive review of the existing literature, we report similar correlates across ADDs when comorbid with bipolar disorder and the theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. We also identified specific targets for new research in this field, which is urgent given the frequency of this comorbidity.

AB  - Chromium contaminants emanating from industrial activities pose a significant threat to human's well-being. Chromium (III) and Chromium (VI) are the forms in which they are commonly encountered, of which the trivalent form is relatively benign. Hence, biological reduction of hexavalent chromium has been widely explored by researchers, yielding fruitful outcomes, opening up exciting avenues and also throwing up new challenges. This article attempts to review this area of research. Microbes, especially bacteria capable of Chromium (VI) reduction, belonging to a heterogeneous group have been isolated from contaminated sites. They exhibit plasmid-mediated chromate resistance and the reduction is enzymatically mediated. Reduction studies have been carried out with free and immobilized enzymes as well as whole cells. Experiments have been carried out in specifically designed bioreactors operated in batch and continuous modes. Although significant progress has been made, much needs to be done for its successful in situ application as the organism may not withstand the Chromium concentration or may be impeded by the presence of other toxicants. With molecular engineering, it may be possible to derive strains with improved performance even under stressful field conditions.

AB  - Objective: Antidepressants (ADs) are the mainstay of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite their widespread usage, a consensus does not exist as to the timing of clinically significant symptomatic improvement during an AD trial. The objective of this review is to provide practitioners with empirically based recommendations pertaining to the optimal duration of index (initial) AD therapy before a clinical intervention is warranted.
   Methods: We conducted a nonsystematic review, using a combination of a MeSH key word search, Google Scholar, and the Scopus database. Our search strategy focused on research papers reporting on the early symptomatic response to AD therapy.
   Results: Available evidence suggests that there are several subpopulations that exist within whole-group data assigned to an AD treatment. Among the responder subgroups, an early responder group (that is, less than 3 weeks) and later responder group (that is, 3 weeks or more) are identified. People who exhibit early partial symptomatic improvement are more likely to respond to therapy thereafter. However, the interpretability of extant evidence is complicated by the use of disparate statistical approaches with differing computational complexity and sample heterogeneity.
   Conclusions: Response outcomes in MDD are heterogeneous. Available data suggest that people may respond early, late, and (or) continuously over time, and may represent distinct subpopulations that provide a proximate indication for treatment response outcomes. Notwithstanding, a pragmatic recommendation would be to consider a treatment intervention (for example, dosage optimization and [or] augmentation) if, after 3 to 4 weeks, symptomatic improvement is insufficient.

AB  - The study of the social brain offers a number of opportunities for enhancing classroom education. This review focuses on the mentalizing network, a set of brain regions that support thinking about the thoughts, feelings, and goals of others. This network typically competes with brain regions supporting analytical thought and memorization. Rather than treating classroom learning and socializing as antithetical to one another, this paper suggests our natural social tendencies can be leveraged to improve learning, by making the content and process of education more social. Recommendations are made for history and English classes, as well as for STEM fields. Finally, it is proposed that educating adolescents about the social brain itself will reap educational rewards.

AB  - Background Nearly 3 billion people live without electricity today. This energy poverty means that they have to resort to biomass fuels for their household energy needs. When burned, these fuels release a mixture of toxic chemicals in their smoke, which is often over twenty times greater than World Health Organization (WHO) and Environmental Protection Agency recommended guideline limits.
   Aim This review details factors that contribute to indoor air pollution, its effects on health, and discusses corrective measures to consider when planning intervention strategies to stem the high morbidity and mortality trend.
   Methods The term developing countries is defined using the 2008 United Nations Conferences on Trade and Development Handbook. PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases from 1990 to 2011 were searched using the key terms: indoor air pollution, biomass fuel, particulate matter, health risks, and developing countries. Bibliographies of all relevant articles were also screened to find further eligible articles. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed articles and technical reports from global health organizations such as the WHO and United Nations Development Program. Exclusion criteria were articles focused on modern energy, developed countries, and non-English publications.
   Results The review discusses the extent of indoor air pollution related to use of biomass for cooking and assesses its impact on various health and social problems, including lung diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes and human development, especially in vulnerable populations. It also offers strategies to mitigate problems related to indoor air pollution.
   Conclusions Biomass fuel is a major cause of indoor air pollution and is a significant health hazard in developing countries. A thorough understanding of the connection between choice of fuel for household needs and health impact of long-term exposure to pollutants from smoke generated during use of biomass for cooking is required so that appropriate intervention strategies and policies can be established to protect vulnerable populations.

AB  - Coralligenous habitat is one of the most important coastal systems of the Mediterranean Sea. This paper evaluates the main threats to macroalgal coralligenous habitats through a review of the relevant literature. Sedimentation, nutrient enrichment and biological invasions can cause severe alterations in the structure of coralligenous assemblages due to the regression of perennial structuring species and increases in populations of ephemeral algae. Under pristine conditions, mechanical disturbance seems to be easily mitigated by the recovery capability of coralligenous assemblages; however, such disturbances seriously affect coralligenous structure if they occur in concert with other stressors. Important synergetic effects among all the studied anthropogenic disturbances are also highlighted. The main consequences of the considered stressors are the loss of the complexity of macroalgal assemblages and the deterioration of both alpha and beta diversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The number of neuroimaging studies has grown exponentially in recent years and their results are not always consistent. Meta-analyses are helpful to summarize this vast literature and also offer insights that are not apparent from the individual studies. In this review, we describe the main methods used for meta-analyzing neuroimaging data, with special emphasis on their relative advantages and disadvantages. We describe and discuss meta-analytical methods for global brain volumes, methods based on regions of interest, label-based reviews, voxel-based meta-analytic methods and online databases. Regions of interest-based methods allow for optimal statistical analyses but are affected by a limited and potentially biased inclusion of brain regions, whilst voxel-based methods benefit from a more exhaustive and unbiased inclusion of studies but are statistically more limited. There are also relevant differences between the different available voxel-based meta-analytic methods, and the field is rapidly evolving to develop more accurate and robust methods. We suggest that in any meta-analysis of neuroimaging data, authors should aim to: only include studies exploring the whole brain; ensure that the same threshold throughout the whole brain is used within each included study; and explore the robustness of the findings via complementary analyses to minimize the risk of false positives.

AB  - Amyloid diseases display the presence, in targeted tissues and organs, of fibrillar deposits of specific peptides or proteins. Increasing efforts are presently spent in investigating the structural features and the structure-toxicity relation of the soluble oligomeric precursors arising in the path of fibrillization as well as the importance of surfaces as triggers of protein misfolding and aggregation and as possible responsible for amyloid polymorphism. Presently, it is recognized that the unstable, heterogeneous pre-fibrillar aggregates are the main responsible for amyloid toxicity. Conversely, mature fibrils are considered stable, harmless reservoirs of toxic species, although direct fibril toxicity has been reported. Recent studies show that mature fibrils grown at various conditions can display different structural features, stabilities and tendency to disassemble with leak of toxic oligomers. Fibril polymorphism can result from protein aggregation at differing conditions populating misfolded monomers and oligomers with distinct conformational characteristics. Recent research has started to unravel oligomer structural and biophysical features and their relation to cytotoxicity. Increasing information supports the notion that oligomer-membrane interaction, disruption of membrane integrity and cell impairment results from both oligomer and membrane biophysical features; accordingly, the formation of the oligomer-membrane complex, often the first step of amyloid toxicity, can be the result of the interplay of these events. This view can help explaining the variable vulnerability of different cell types to the same amyloids and the lack of relation between amyloid load and severity of clinical symptoms; it also stresses the importance, for cell/tissue impairment, of the presence of fibrils conformers of reduced stability as a possible source of oligomers resulting from leakage possibly favored by the interaction with suitable macromolecular/lipid surfaces or by other environmental conditions.

AB  - Over the past decade, neuroeconomics studies utilizing neurophysiology methods (fMRI or EEG) have flourished, revealing the neural basis of 'boundedly rational' or 'irrational' decision-making that violates normative theory. The next question is how modulatory neurotransmission is involved in these central processes. Here I focused on recent efforts to understand how central monoamine transmission is related to nonlinear probability weighting and loss aversion, central features of prospect theory, which is a leading alternative to normative theory for decision-making under risk. Circumstantial evidence suggests that dopamine tone might be related to distortion of subjective reward probability and noradrenaline and serotonin tone might influence aversive emotional reaction to potential loss.

AB  - A growing body of research documents that various forms of violence exposures are interrelated. This paper presents a conceptual model, which accounts for the relationship between youth witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV) at home and their subsequent engagement in bullying behaviors and victimization by peers. A comprehensive search of major databases was conducted within a 12-year period (1999-2011). Based on this review, we provide empirical evidence, which documents that youth who witness IPV are at increased risk for bullying behaviors and peer victimization. Next, we posit a mediational model, which suggests that the relationship between witnessing IPV and bullying behavior and peer victimization is mediated by psychological problem behaviors, lower school success, and problematic peer interactions. We also explore potential moderating factors that may exacerbate or buffer the effects of witnessing IPV, such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, parenting practices, and peer relationships. This overall conceptual model should be empirically tested and has important implications for guiding future research on the relationship between IPV and bullying behaviors and victimization among youth.

AB  - Recent recognition of colloid and colloida-ssociated transport of strongly sorbing contaminants in fractured rocks highlights the importance of exploring the transport behavior of colloids under conditions prevailing in the field. The rapid transport of colloids through fractured rocks-as affected by the hydraulic properties of the flow system, the properties of fracture surface and the geochemical conditions-has not been sufficiently elucidated, and predictions of colloid transport through fractures have encountered difficulties, particularly at the field scale. This article reviews the current understanding of the mechanisms and modeling of colloid transport and retention in fractured rocks. Commonly used experimental techniques and approaches for conducting colloid transport experiments at different scales, ranging from the laboratory to the field scale, are summarized and commented upon. The importance of various interactions (e.g., dissolution, colloid deposition, generation, mobilization and deposition of filling materials within fractures) between the flowing solution and the fracture walls (in many cases, with skin or coating on the host rock at the liquid - solid interface) has been stressed. Colloid transport through fractures of high heterogeneity has not yet been well understood and modeled at the field scale. Here, we summarize the current knowledge and understanding accumulated in the last two decades in regard to colloid and colloid-associated transport through fractures. Future research needs are also discussed.

AB  - Background: Maternity care providers, particularly midwives, have a window of opportunity to influence pregnant women about positive health choices. This aim of this paper is to identify evidence of effective public health interventions from good quality systematic reviews that could be conducted by midwives.
   Methods: Relevant databases including MEDLINE, Pubmed, EBSCO, CRD, MIDIRS, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and Econlit were searched to identify systematic reviews in October 2010. Quality assessment of all reviews was conducted.
   Results: Thirty-six good quality systematic reviews were identified which reported on effective interventions. The reviews were conducted on a diverse range of interventions across the reproductive continuum and were categorised under: screening; supplementation; support; education; mental health; birthing environment; clinical care in labour and breast feeding. The scope and strength of the review findings are discussed in relation to current practice. A logic model was developed to provide an overarching framework of midwifery public health roles to inform research policy and practice.
   Conclusions: This review provides a broad scope of high quality systematic review evidence and definitively highlights the challenge of knowledge transfer from research into practice. The review also identified gaps in knowledge around the impact of core midwifery practice on public health outcomes and the value of this contribution. This review provides evidence for researchers and funders as to the gaps in current knowledge and should be used to inform the strategic direction of the role of midwifery in public health in policy and practice.

AB  - Background: Given the high prevalence of depression in primary health care (PHC), the use of screening instruments has been recommended. Both brief and long depression screening instruments have been validated in low and middle income countries (LMIC), including within HIV care settings. However, it remains unknown whether the brief instruments validated in LMIC are as accurate as the long ones.
   Methods: We conducted a search of PUBMED, the COCHRANE library, AIDSLINE, and PSYCH-Info from their inception up to July 2011, for studies that validated depression screening instruments in LMIC. Data were extracted into tables and analyzed using RevMan 5.0 and STATA 11.2 for the presence of heterogeneity.
   Results: Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria. The reported prevalence of depression in LMIC ranged from 11.1 to 53%. The area under curve (AUC) scores of the validated instruments ranged from 0.69-0.99. Brief as well as long screening instruments showed acceptable accuracy (AUC >= 0.7). Five of the 19 instruments were validated within HIV settings. There was statistically significant heterogeneity between the studies, and hence a meta-analysis could not be conducted to completion. Heterogeneity chi-squared = 189.23 (d.f. = 18) p<.001.
   Conclusion: Brief depression screening instruments in both general and HIV-PHC are as accurate as the long ones. Brief scales may have an edge over the longer instruments since they can be administered in a much shorter time. However, because the ultra brief scales do not include the whole spectrum of depression symptoms including suicide, their use should be followed by a detailed diagnostic interview.

AB  - Caspase-3 has been identified as a key mediator of neuronal programmed cell death. This protease plays a central role in the developing nervous system and its activation is observed early in neural tube formation and persists during postnatal differentiation of the neural network. Caspase-3 activation, a crucial event of neuronal cell death program, is also a feature of many chronic neurodegenerative diseases. This traditional apoptotic function of caspase-3 is challenged by recent studies that reveal new cell death-independent roles for mitochondrial-activated caspase-3 in neurite pruning and synaptic plasticity. These findings underscore the need for further research into the mechanism of action and functions of caspase-3 that may prove useful in the development of novel pharmacological treatments for a diverse range of neurological disorders.

AB  - The present meta-analysis aimed to clarify whether deficits in emotion recognition in psychopathy are restricted to certain emotions and modalities or whether they are more pervasive. We also attempted to assess the influence of other important variables: age, and the affective factor of psychopathy. A systematic search of electronic databases and a subsequent manual search identified 26 studies that included 29 experiments (N=1376) involving six emotion categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) across three modalities (facial, vocal, postural). Meta-analyses found evidence of pervasive impairments across modalities (facial and vocal) with significant deficits evident for several emotions (i.e., not only fear and sadness) in both adults and children/adolescents. These results are consistent with recent theorizing that the amygdala, which is believed to be dysfunctional in psychopathy, has a broad role in emotion processing. We discuss limitations of the available data that restrict the ability of meta-analysis to consider the influence of age and separate the sub-factors of psychopathy, highlighting important directions for future research.

AB  - Dias VV, Balanza-Martinez V, Soeiro-de-Souza MG, Moreno RA, Figueira ML, Machado-Vieira R, Vieta E. Pharmacological approaches in bipolar disorders and the impact on cognition: a critical overview. Objective: Historically, pharmacological treatments for bipolar disorders (BD) have been associated with neurocognitive side-effects. We reviewed studies which assessed the impact of several psychopharmacological drugs on the neurocognitive function of BD patients. Method: The PubMed database was searched for studies published between January 1980 and February 2011, using the following terms: bipolar, bipolar disorder, mania, manic episode, or bipolar depression, cross-referenced with cognitive, neurocognitive, or neuropsychological, cross-referenced with treatment. Results: Despite methodological flaws in the older studies and insufficient research concerning the newer agents, some consistent findings emerged from the review; lithium appears to have definite, yet subtle, negative effects on psychomotor speed and verbal memory. Among the newer anticonvulsants, lamotrigine appears to have a better cognitive profile than carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, and zonisamide. More long-term studies are needed to better understand the impact of atypical antipsychotics on BD patients neurocognitive functioning, both in monotherapy and in association with other drugs. Other agents, like antidepressants and cognitive enhancers, have not been adequately studied in BD so far. Conclusion: Pharmacotherapies for BD should be chosen to minimize neurocognitive side-effects, which may already be compromised by the disease process itself. Neurocognitive evaluation should be considered in BD patients to better evaluate treatment impact on neurocognition. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation also addressing potential variables and key aspects such as more severe cognitive deficits, comorbidities, differential diagnosis, and evaluation of multiple cognitive domains in longitudinal follow-up studies are warranted.

AB  - Background: Factors that drive the use of urgent healthcare among people with chronic physical illness (i.e. long term conditions-LTCs) are poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review with meta analysis to examine the strength of association between depression and subsequent use of urgent healthcare among people with LTCs.
   Methods: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, CINAHL, the British Nursing Library and the Cochrane Library 2011 were conducted, supplemented by hand-searching bibliographies, citation tracing eligible studies and asking experts about relevant studies. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they: i)used prospective cohort design, ii)included patients with diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or coronary heart disease, iii)used a standardised measure of depression, and iv)assessed urgent healthcare utilisation prospectively. Data on the subjects recruited, methods used and the association between depression and subsequent urgent healthcare utilisation were extracted from eligible studies. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study and pooled using random effects models.
   Results: 16 independent studies were identified. Pooled effects indicated that depression was associated with a 49% increase in the odds of urgent healthcare utilisation (OR=1.49, p<.0005). This effect was not significantly affected by publication bias or inclusion of studies of low quality. Effects were much smaller and non-significant among the 3 studies that controlled for other covariates, including severity of illness (OR=1.13, p=.31).
   Conclusions: Depression was associated with increased urgent healthcare use, but not in the minority of studies that controlled for other covariates. This possibly suggests confounding, but the severity measures may themselves have been influenced by depression. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxidative damage is a common and early feature of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and other neurodegenerative disorders. Dr. Mark Smith and his colleagues have built the case for oxidative stress being a primary progenitor rather than a secondary end-stage epiphenomenon of neurodegeneration. They proposed that reactive oxygen species contribute to the "age-related cascade of neurodegeneration," whereby accumulative oxidative damage with age promotes other characteristic pathological changes in afflicted brain regions, including protein aggregation, metabolic deficiencies, and inflammation. Nitric oxide (NO) likely plays a critical role in this age-related cascade. NO is a major signaling molecule produced in the central nervous system to modulate neurological activity through stimulating cyclic GMP synthesis. However, the same physiological concentrations of NO, relevant in cellular signaling, may also initiate and amplify oxidative damage by diffusion-limited reactions with superoxide (O (2) (aEuro cent a') ) to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO (-) ). This is perhaps best illustrated in ALS where physiological levels of NO promote survival of motor neurons, but the same concentrations can stimulate motor neuron apoptosis and glial cell activation under pathological conditions. While these changes represent a complex mechanism involving multiple cell types in the pathogenesis of ALS, they also reveal general processes underlying neurodegeneration.

AB  - Suicide is a major cause of death among patients with schizophrenia. Suicide phenomenon's characterization is the best available approach for improved prediction and prevention of suicide. Patients at high risk for suicide need a more intensive monitoring and intervention. The aim of this review is to characterize, from a clinical-epidemiological point of view, the phenomenon of completed suicide in schizophrenia. We performed a systematic review to identify the most relevant studies published between 1994 and 2009, by searching on the international database Medline and among previous reviews references.
   Patients with schizophrenia experience higher mortality rates than the general population, especially due to the suicide. Most patients with schizophrenia who commit suicide are likely to be young and males, with a higher risk around illness onset and hospitalization periods. Previous suicide attempts are an important risk factor for completed suicide. Suicide risk is associated to psychotic positive symptoms, affective symptoms, depression and substance abuse. Treatment adherence is as protective factor. Patients with schizophrenia are likely to commit suicide by violent means.
   Suicide prevention should focus on treating affective symptoms and syndromes, improving treatment compliance and providing intensive monitoring to those patients at high risk of suicide, specially aroung hospitalization periods. Further studies are needed to clarify differential characteristics between suicide behaviour and completed suicide.

AB  - Zooxanthella symbioses are arguably the most important ecological interaction on coral reefs because they energetically subsidize the entire community, and enhance the calcification process that provides structure for all other organisms. While we have developed a detailed understanding of the diversity among and within the Symbiodinium clades, we currently lack a mechanistic explanation for which factors favoured zooxanthella invasion of the intracellular habitat in heterotrophic hosts, and for what molecular mechanisms permit residence within the cell. We propose two hypotheses that explain important evolutionary and ecological features of zooxanthella symbioses. The magnesium inhibition hypothesis (MIH) states that increases in the Mg/Ca ratio in sea water that occurred over the last 100 million years created a situation where Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ transport to zooxanthellae. The MIH predicts, among other things, that the intracellular niche was invaded as a response to this abiotic stressor. The arrested phagosome hypothesis (APH) states that Symbiodinium spp. mimic host cell endosomal digestive machinery via the symbiosome to appear like digesting prey through perpetual release of zooxanthella-derived compounds. The APH represents a subtle but important distinction from previous hypotheses regarding interactions between symbiont and host at the cellular level. The APH predicts that symbionts tune rates of material release to match expectations of host cellular machinery. An outcome of the APH is that intra-host residence time becomes a vital parameter to consider. Both hypotheses shift control of the symbiosis away from the host, and instead focus attention on the niche requirements of Symbiodinium spp.

AB  - In analogy with the accepted view that behaviour is shaped by gene x environment (G x E) interactions, G x E studies are exponentially increasing in the field of psychiatry. Whereas research was primarily driven by the premature view that negative environmental stimuli can trigger psychopathology in those subjects that are genetically predisposed, a closer look at the available data shows that G x E interactions are much more complex than initially thought. Here, we discuss G x E studies focussing on serotonin transporter (5-HTT, SERT, SLC6A4) gene variation in humans, monkeys, and rodents. Recent studies, across species, confirm the theorized 'for-better-and-for-worse' effect of low activity serotonin transporter genotypes. In addition, while 5-HTT x E interactions were thought to take place in early life, recent evidence illustrates that these interactions are also manifested in adulthood. Therefore, we discuss data based on 5-HTT x E interactions, and propose a model in which predictive adaptive responses (PARs), as shaped by early life 5-HTT x E interactions, shape responses to environmental challenges in later life, i.e. reflecting 5-HTT x E x E interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening toxic state caused by an adverse drug reaction that leads to excessive central and peripheral serotonergic activity. This excessive serotonin hyperstimulation may be secondary to 1 standard therapeutic dose of a single agent, inadvertent interactions between various drugs, intentionally or unintentionally excessive use of particular drugs, deliberate self-harm, or recreational use of certain drugs. This review article serves as an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, management, and prevention of SS.
   METHODS: The authors conducted a MEDLINE search for the period covering 1955 to 2011.
   RESULTS: SS commonly occurs after the use of serotonergic agents alone or in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. SS classically consists of a triad of signs and symptoms broadly characterized as alteration of mental status, abnormalities of neuromuscular tone, and autonomic hyperactivity. However, all 3 triads of SS may not occur simultaneously. Clinical manifestations are diverse and nonspecific, which may lead to misdiagnosis. SS can range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Most cases of SS are mild and resolve with prompt recognition and supportive care. Management of SS involves withdrawal of the offending agent(s), aggressive supportive care to treat hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction, and occasionally the administration of serotonin antagonists cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine. Patients with moderate and severe cases of SS require inpatient hospitalization.
   CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatrists, clinicians, and general practitioners must develop increased awareness of SS due to the current increase in the use of serotonergic agents in clinical practice. As SS is a manifestation of adverse pharmacology, it is not considered an idiosyncratic drug reaction, making it predictable and highly preventable. Most cases of SS are mild and easily managed. With prompt recognition and supportive care, more severe cases of SS have a favorable prognosis.

   Electromagnetic brain stimulation is performed in various ways in psychiatric settings for the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders.
   Recent findings
   Transcranial direct current stimulation is a comparatively simple procedure. The available results warrant optimism regarding the future of this therapeutic approach in psychiatry. Multicentre studies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrate a moderate treatment effect in depression. Theta burst stimulation and deep brain repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation represent innovative promising developments. The invasiveness of deep brain stimulation still causes this method to be one of the last resorts, even though promising results in severely disordered patients have been published.
   Summary
   In our view, the field of brain stimulation will be rapidly moving forward in the near future and will establish itself as one more of the 'tools of the trade' in psychiatric therapeutic practice.

AB  - Aging and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are characterized by tissue and mitochondrial changes that compromise brain function. Alterations can include increased reactive oxygen species production and impaired antioxidant capacity with a consequent increase in oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction that compromises brain ATP production, and ultimately increased apoptotic signaling and neuronal death. Among several non-pharmacological strategies to prevent brain degeneration, physical exercise is a surprisingly effective strategy, which antagonizes brain tissue and mitochondrial dysfunction. The present review aims to discuss the role of physical exercise in the modulation of the mechanisms involved in neuroprotection including the activation of signaling pathways underlying brain protection.

AB  - Many young athletes train and compete under conditions that put their body fluid balance at risk, and hypohydration is usually the major concern. Another less frequent condition is hyperhydration that-if accompanied by other risk factors-may cause hyponatremia. Water and electrolyte losses during physical activities occur primarily from sweat. Such losses have been identified mostly in active (but nonathletic) young populations under laboratory settings. Studies have been trying to estimate fluid losses in the athletic population under field conditions, taking into account the sport modality and environmental conditions. Besides these external conditions, young athletes adopt different drinking attitudes, which may depend on knowledge, education, and the opportunities to drink during the break periods as well as fluid availability. Focusing on the young athlete, this review will discuss water and sodium losses from sweat, the effects of hypohydration on performance, and fluid intake attitudes within and during practices and competitions. Some considerations related to the methods of identifying hydration status and guidelines are also given, with the understanding that they should be individually adapted for the athlete and activity. The young athlete, parents, coaches, and athletic/health professionals should be aware of such information to prevent fluid imbalances and the consequent hazardous effects on performance and health.

AB  - The loss or injury of neurons associated with oxidative and nitrosative redox stress plays an important role in the onset of various neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, nitric oxide (NO), can affect neuronal survival through a process called S-nitrosylation, by which the NO group undergoes a redox reaction with specific protein thiols. This in turn can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which generally form aggregates in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence suggests that S-nitrosylation can also impair mitochondrial function and lead to excessive fission of mitochondria and consequent bioenergetic compromise via effects on the activity of the fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). This insult leads to synaptic dysfunction and loss. Additionally, high levels of NO can S-nitrosylate a number of aberrant targets involved in neuronal survival pathways, including the antiapoptotic protein XIAP, inhibiting its ability to prevent apoptosis.

   In this article, we discuss new data on currently licensed drugs for dementia and novel developments in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia.
   Recent findings
   During the last years, a large body of evidence has been accumulated to support the use of antidementia medication in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease. Combination therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for Alzheimer's disease remains controversial, as controlled trials have yielded conflicting results. Memantine is not indicated in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Studies on memantine for Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies were inconclusive. In adult patients with dementia in the context of Down syndrome, memantine is not effective, and further studies on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are warranted. There is still no treatment established for patients with vascular or frontotemporal dementia. The efficacy of antidepressants to treat depression associated with dementia is not proven. Treatment of agitation and psychosis in patients with dementia remains a challenge.
   Summary
   Recent systematic clinical reviews and new research on currently available treatment options provide valuable assistance for clinicians to deal with frequent clinical problems in the context of dementia.

   To examine progress about relevant behavioural and psychiatric disorders in Parkinson's disease, such as depression, apathy, psychosis, and impulse control disorder.
   Recent findings
   Several recent studies have characterized the phenomenology of depression in Parkinson's disease, and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and psychotherapy for depression in Parkinson's disease. Apathy is a valid behavioural syndrome in Parkinson's disease and is associated with depression and cognitive deficits. Psychosis is highly prevalent in the late stages of the disease, but there are few effective therapeutic modalities for this psychiatric condition. Impulse control disorders are also relatively frequent in Parkinson's disease, and are associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders.
   Summary
   Standardized criteria should be used to diagnose depression and apathy in Parkinson's disease. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are useful treatment modalities for affective disorders in Parkinson's disease. Clozapine is still the most effective, albeit rarely used, treatment for psychosis in Parkinson's disease. Impulse control disorders are relatively frequent in Parkinson's disease and all patients should be screened for this complex disorder.

AB  - Objectives Studies about job strain and cardiovascular disease (CVD) have yielded inconsistent results, which hinders making a firm conclusion about the association. Inconsistent findings may be the result of methodological differences. If the relative CVD risk is influenced by methodological differences, these differences should be explored in more detail in future research to clarify which methodological characteristics are inherent to obtain the most accurate estimate between job strain and CVD risk. By assessing how study characteristics are associated with the outcome, we take the first step in unraveling this association. In this review, we explore the following research question: are study characteristics associated with the size of the reported relative CVD risk?
   Methods A systematic literature search yielded 71 studies about job stress, assessed with the demand control model, and CVD. Traditional meta-regression was extended enabling the use of correlated data to quantify heterogeneity within and between studies.
   Results Compared to studies that use the original Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), studies in which a more deviant form of the JCQ was used yielded, on average, 43% higher estimates. Studies conducted in the USA yielded about 26% lower estimates compared to studies conducted in Scandinavian countries.
   Conclusions Several study characteristics are associated with the size of the reported relative CVD risk. Many of these study features are related to the validity of the exposure and outcome assessment and are inherent to obtain an accurate estimate between work stress and CVD risk. More research is needed to clarify why these study features impact the average relative CVD risk.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Addressing issues in transitioning patients from inpatient to outpatient care is one of the most salient themes in mental healthcare. We review current models and initiatives in general and mental healthcare and propose an intervention framework.
   Recent findings
   Using search terms in online databases and archives, we identified two broad categories of care transition interventions: models that have been put forward and tested in the area of general medical care and have potential for adaptation in mental health; and a more limited set of models that have been put forward and, to some extent, tested in the mental health context. On the basis of these categorical summaries, we propose nine components as core elements for interventions to address transitions in the mental health population more effectively.
   Summary
   This review of intervention models identified multiple models, trials and initiatives for care transition interventions for general medical populations, but few targeted specifically for mental health populations. We believe that proposing a conceptual framework specifying a core set of care transition intervention components can stimulate the development of interventions that specifically address patients with serious mental illness.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Values-based practice (VBP) challenges traditions of clinical practice and moral decision-making and the literature published over the last 18 months demonstrates a growing momentum for its use.
   Recent findings
   The VBP model has become part of the narrative of health and social care practice. It features in a range of publications and has been subject to philosophical analysis in relation to its theoretical rigour, and applied to clinical practice through education and training, implementation in the field and policy development. From a philosophical perspective the model faces several challenges; from a practice perspective it is welcomed as a necessary partner to Evidence-Based Practice. Both perspectives suggest VBP requires significant adjustment to professional ideas of good practice, expectations of the clinician service user relationship and notions of what constitutes good care.
   Summary
   VBP is both a solution and a problem for clinicians. Whether VBP is seen as providing a much needed clinical skill for working with the complexity of mental health and psychiatry which is steeped in values or a solution to a dominant sociopolitical neoliberal ideology demand for choice and personalization of care, VBP will require clinicians to make personal changes to their values base that reach to the depths of their professional identity.

AB  - Objective: Somatic presentations of distress are common cross-culturally and are thought to predominate in Asian cultures such as that of China. From an etic perspective, researchers utilizing empirically validated standardized assessment measures find that somatic symptoms are no more common in individuals of Chinese descent than they are in individuals of European descent. In contrast, patient presentations are heavily influenced by culture and are associated with patterns of illness behavior. The objective of the current review is to determine the culture-specific factors contributing to somatic presentations and descriptions of distress in China.
   Method: The current review was based on a literature search of PubMed and PsychInfo using the terms 'China,' 'Asia,' 'somatoform,' 'somatization,' and 'psychogenic.'
   Results: Factors contributing to somatic presentations of distress in China include stigma and help-seeking behavior, and assessment approaches that ignore culture-specific patterns of symptom reporting, fail to incorporate somatic metaphor and Chinese conceptualizations of distress that emphasize bodily sensation, and ignore the role that culture-specific normative data and culture specific response patterns may produce on assessment results.
   Conclusions: From an emic perspective, there are numerous factors contributing to the appearance of a predominantly somatic presentation of distress in China. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.

AB  - Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a commonly diagnosed neuropsychiatric disorder in childhood, but the frequency of the condition is not well established in many countries. The aim of the present study was to quantify the overall prevalence of ADHD among children and adolescents in Spain by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, IME, IBECS and TESEO were comprehensively searched. Original reports were selected if they provided data on prevalence estimates of ADHD among people under 18 years old in Spain and were cross-sectional, observational epidemiological studies. Information from included studies was systematically extracted and evaluated. Overall pooled-prevalence estimates of ADHD were calculated using random-effects models. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by means sub-groups analyses and univariate meta-regressions.
   Results: Fourteen epidemiological studies (13,026 subjects) were selected. The overall pooled-prevalence of ADHD was estimated at 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9 - 8.8%] representing 361,580 (95% CI 260,550 - 467,927) children and adolescents in the community. There was significant heterogeneity (P < 0.001), which was incompletely explained by subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prevalence of ADHD among children and adolescents in Spain is consistent with previous studies conducted in other countries and regions. This study represents a first step in estimating the national burden of ADHD that will be essential to building evidence-based programs and services.

AB  - Unique mental abilities have been crucial for evolutionary success of Homo sapiens and for the development of his complex social organization. However, these abilities have also become a target for mental disorders which often result in a reduced fitness and in conflicts between the individual and the conventions of society. To account for this evolutionary maladaptation, we advance a new concept: that of "mis-exaptation", derived from SJ Gould and E Vrba's concept of exaptation. Mis-exaptation is a characteristic which, although it may confer positive effects in one field of activity, may reach an inappropriate degree of specialisation to have deleterious effects in that or in another field thereby leading to a decrease in fitness of the individual. This paper considers "inner speech" as an exaptation. Although inner speech is usually a positive aid to learning and reasoning, it may also favour the emergence of mental disturbances, such as the auditory hallucinations which are characteristic of schizophrenia. There is, nevertheless, a possible evolutionary value in mis-exaptational inner speech; two traits associated with the mis-exapted state would be altruistic behaviour and heightened creativity, the latter being over-expressed in relatives of schizophrenic patients. A possible solution for the evolutionary-genetic paradox posed by altruism and schizophrenia arising from mis-exaptation will be suggested in the light of a cryptic genetic repertoire. A selection of illustrative examples of each of these mental states is presented as they appear in the pages of the European literature.

AB  - Alpha-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein playing a key role in the regulation of several neuronal synaptic functions in physiological and pathological conditions. Many studies, over the past years, have shown that it is actively involved in PD pathophysiology. Alphasynuclein is integrated in a complex network of neuronal processes through the interaction with cytosolic and synaptic proteins. Hence, it is not the sole alpha-synuclein pathology but its effects on diverse protein partners and specific cellular pathways in the membrane and/or cytosolic districts such as endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi, axonal and synaptic compartments of dopaminergic neurons, that may cause the onset of neuronal cell dysfunction and degeneration which are among the key pathological features of the PD brain. Here we summarize a series of experimental data supporting that alpha-synuclein aggregation may induce dysfunction and degeneration of synapses via these multiple mechanisms. Taken together, these data add new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying synaptic derangement in PD and other alpha-synucleinopathies.

AB  - Mitochondria are critical for cell survival and normal development, as they provide energy to the cell, buffer intracellular calcium, and regulate apoptosis. They are also major targets of oxidative stress, which causes bioenergetics failure in astrocytes through the activation of different mechanisms and production of oxidative molecules. This review provides an insightful overview of the recent discoveries and strategies for mitochondrial protection in astrocytes. We also discuss the importance of rotenone as an experimental approach for assessing oxidative stress in the brain and delineate some molecular strategies that enhance mitochondrial function in astrocytes as a promising strategy against brain damage.

AB  - Objective: The authors performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of task-based functional MRI studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Method: The authors searched PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE, Web of Science, ERIC, CINAHAL, and NeuroSynth for studies published through June 30, 2011. Significant differences in brain region activation between individuals with ADHD and comparison subjects were detected using activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis. Dysfunctional regions in ADHD were related to seven reference neuronal systems. The authors performed a set of meta-analyses focused on age groups (children and adults), clinical characteristics (history of stimulant treatment and presence of psychiatric comorbidities), and specific neuropsychological tasks (inhibition, working memory, and vigilance/attention).
   Results: Fifty-five studies were included (39 for children and 16 tor adults). In children, hypoactivation in ADHD relative to comparison subjects was observed mostly in systems involved in executive function (frontoparietal network) and attention (ventral attentional network). Significant hyperactivation in ADHD relative to comparison subjects was observed predominantly in the default, ventral attention, and somatomotor networks. In adults, ADHD-related hypoactivation was predominant in the frontoparietal system, while ADHD-related hyperactivation was present in the visual, dorsal attention, and default networks. Significant ADHD-related dysfunction largely reflected task features and was detected even in the absence of comorbid mental disorders or a history of. stimulant treatment.
   Conclusions: A growing literature provides evidence of ADHD-related dysfunction in multiple neuronal systems involved in higher-level cognitive functions but also in sensorimotor processes, including the visual system, and in the default network. This meta-analytic evidence extends early models of ADHD pathophysiology that were focused on prefrontal-striatal circuits. (Am J Psychiatry 2012; /69:1038-1055)

AB  - Human beings seem to be able to recognize emotions from speech very well and information communication technology aims to implement machines and agents that can do the same. However, to be able to automatically recognize affective states from speech signals, it is necessary to solve two main technological problems. The former concerns the identification of effective and efficient processing algorithms capable of capturing emotional acoustic features from speech sentences. The latter focuses on finding computational models able to classify, with an approximation as good as human listeners, a given set of emotional states. This paper will survey these topics and provide some insights for a holistic approach to the automatic analysis, recognition and synthesis of affective states.

AB  - Currently, there is no effective treatment for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Thus, a major focus of neuroscience research is to examine the mechanisms involved in neuronal loss in order to identify potential drug targets. Recent results indicate that DNA damage and re-entry into the cell cycle may constitute a common pathway in apoptosis in neurological diseases. The role of the cell cycle in such disorders is supported by data on the brain of patients who showed an increase in cell-cycle protein expression. Indeed, studies performed in neuronal cell preparations indicate that oxidative stress could be the main mechanism responsible for cell cycle re-entry. DNA damage and repair after oxidative stress may activate the enzyme ataxia telangiectasia mutated, which is a cell-cycle regulator. Once the cell cycle is activated, the increase in the expression of transcription factor E2F-1 could induce neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the potential routes involved in E2F-1 induced apoptosis could be p53-dependent or p53-independent. Under this E2F-1 hypothesis of cell death, multiple mitochondria-dependent pathways may be activated, including caspase and caspase-independent signaling cascades. Finally, given that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory drugs have neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic effects in experimental models, their potential application for the treatment of neurological disorders should be taken into account.

AB  - Background: Depression is associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality in the general population and in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent evidence suggests that patients with new-onset depression post-CHD diagnosis have worse outcomes than do those who had previous or recurrent depression. This meta-analysis investigated the timing of depression onset in established CHD and CHD-free cohorts to determine what time frame is associated with greater mortality and cardiac morbidity. Methodology/Principal Findings: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched systematically to identify articles examining a depression time frame that specified an end point of all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, rehospitalization, or major adverse cardiac events. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate effect sizes by time frame of depression. Twenty-two prospective cohort studies were identified. Nine studies investigated premorbid depression in CHD-free cohorts in relation to cardiac death. Thirteen studies in patient samples with CHD examined new-onset depression in comparison with previous or recurrent depression. The pooled effect size (risk ratio) was 0.76 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.48-1.19) for history of depression only, 1.79 (95% CI = 1.45-2.21) for premorbid depression onset, 2.11(95% CI = 1.66-2.68) for postmorbid or new depression onset, and 1.59 (95% CI = 1.08-2.34) for recurrent depression. Conclusions/Significance: Both premorbid and postmorbid depression onsets are potentially hazardous, and the question of timing may be irrelevant with respect to adverse cardiac outcomes. However, the combination of premorbid depression with the absence of depression at the time of a cardiac event (i.e., historical depression only) is not associated with such outcomes and deserves further investigation.

AB  - Atypical visuospatial processing is commonly described in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however the specific neurobiological underpinnings of this phenomenon are poorly understood. Given the extensive evidence suggesting ASDs are characterized by abnormal neural connectivity, this study aimed to investigate network connectivity during visuospatial processing in ASD. Twenty-two males with ASD without intellectual disability and 22 individually matched controls performed a mental rotation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in which two rotated stimuli were judged to be same (Same Trials) or mirror-imaged (Mirror Trials). Behavioral results revealed a relative advantage of mental rotation in the ASD groupcontrols were slower responding to the more difficult Mirror Trials than Same Trials whereas the ASD group completed Mirror Trials and Same-trials at similar speeds. In the ASD group, brain activity was reduced in frontal, temporal, occipital, striatal, and cerebellar regions and, consistent with previous literature, functional connectivity between a number of brain regions was reduced. However, some connections appeared to be conserved and were recruited in a qualitatively different way by the two groups. As task difficulty increased (on Mirror Trials), controls tended to increase connections between certain brain regions, whereas the ASD group appeared to suppress connections between these regions. There was an interesting exception to this pattern in the visual cortex, a finding that may suggest an advantage in early visual perceptual processing in ASD. Overall, this study has identified a relative advantage in mental rotation in ASD that is associated with aberrant neural connectivity and that may stem from enhanced visual perceptual processing.

AB  - The emerging field of social signal processing can benefit from a theoretical framework to guide future research activities. The present article aims at drawing attention to two areas of research that devoted considerable efforts to the understanding of social behaviour: ethology and social psychology. With a long tradition in the study of animal signals, ethology and evolutionary biology have developed theoretical concepts to account for the functional significance of signalling. For example, the consideration of divergent selective pressures responsible for the evolution of signalling and social cognition emphasized the importance of two classes of indicators: informative cues and communicative signals. Social psychology, on the other hand, investigates emotional expression and interpersonal relationships, with a focus on the mechanisms underlying the production and interpretation of social signals and cues. Based on the theoretical considerations developed in these two fields, we propose a model that integrates the processing of perceivable individual features (social signals and cues) with contextual information, and we suggest that output of computer-based processing systems should be derived in terms of functional significance rather than in terms of absolute conceptual meaning.

AB  - An age-associated increase in oxidative damage to nucleic acids, predominantly to RNA, has been recently demonstrated in neurons of human and rodent brains, which may play a fundamental role in the development of age-associated neurodegeneration. Indeed, more prominent levels of neuronal RNA oxidation compared to normal aging have been described in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Moreover, oxidative damage to RNA has been found also in cellular and animal model of neurodegeneration. Oxidative RNA modification can occur not only in protein-coding RNAs but also in non-coding RNAs that are recently revealed to contribute towards the complexity of the mammalian brain. It has been hypothesized that RNA oxidation causes aberrant expression of microRNAs and proteins and subsequently initiates inappropriate cell fate pathways. While less lethal than mutations in the genome and not inheritable, such sublethal damage to cells might be associated with underlying mechanisms of degeneration, especially age-associated neurodegeneration. Of particular interest, the accumulating evidence obtained from studies on either human samples or experimental models coincidentally suggests that RNA oxidation is a feature in neurons of aging brain and more prominently observed in vulnerable neurons at early-stage of age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, indicating that RNA oxidation actively contributes to the background, the onset, and the development of the disorders. Further investigations aimed at understanding of the processing mechanisms related to oxidative RNA damage and its consequences may provide significant insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and lead to better therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Why should music be of interest to cognitive scientists, and what role does it play in human cognition? We review three factors that make music an important topic for cognitive scientific research. First, music is a universal human trait fulfilling crucial roles in everyday life. Second, music has an important part to play in ontogenetic development and human evolution. Third, appreciating and producing music simultaneously engage many complex perceptual, cognitive, and emotional processes, rendering music an ideal object for studying the mind. We propose an integrated status for music cognition in the Cognitive Sciences and conclude by reviewing challenges and big questions in the field and the way in which these reflect recent developments.

AB  - Background
   There are calls to use patient-reported outcomes (PROs) routinely across mental health services. However, the use of PROs in patients with psychosis has been questioned.
   Aims
   To examine the concepts and measures of four widely used PROs: treatment satisfaction, subjective quality of life, needs for care and the quality of the therapeutic relationship.
   Method
   We conducted a literature search of academic databases on concepts, characteristics and psychometric properties of the four PROs in patients with psychosis.
   Results
   Although numerous concepts and measures have been published, evidence on the methodological quality of existing PROs is limited. Measures designed to assess distinct PROs showed a considerable conceptual, operational and empirical overlap, and some of them also included specific aspects. The impact of symptoms and cognitive deficits appears unlikely to be of clinical significance.
   Conclusions
   The popularity of PROs has not been matched with progress in their conceptualisation and measurement. Based on current evidence, some recommendations can be made. Distinct and short measures with clinical relevance and sufficient psychometric properties should be preferred. Future research should optimise the validity and measurement precision of PROs, while reducing assessment burden.

AB  - Neurons are metabolically active cells with high energy demands. Thus, neurons are particularly reliant on mitochondrial function, especially on the homeostasis properties of mitochondria. This is reflected by the observation that mitochondrial abnormalities have been well recognized to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitochondria are highly complex and dynamic organelles continuously undergoing different alterations. The dynamic property of mitochondria is named as mitochondrial homeostasis. Imbalance of mitochondrial homeostasis is associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's diseases. Recently, the related genes of PD-familial, such as alpha-synuclein, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1 and LRRK2, are observed to be associated with mitochondria, and capable of modulating normal mitochondrial integrity and functions under certain conditions. Therefore, in this review, we will focus on the action of PD-related genes in mitochondrial homeostasis. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Persons with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) exhibit a range of cognitive deficits that hamper their quality of life, including difficulties involving communication, sociability, and perspective-taking. In recent years, a variety of studies in mice that model genetic syndromes with a high risk of PDD have provided insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with these disorders. What is less appreciated is how the molecular anomalies affect neuronal and circuit function to give rise to the cognitive deficits associated with PDD. In this review, we describe genetic mutations that cause PDD and discuss how they alter fundamental social and cognitive processes. We then describe efforts to correct cognitive impairments associated with these disorders and identify areas of further inquiry in the search for molecular targets for therapeutics for PDD.

AB  - As organizations become more complex and dynamic, individuals' ability to learn from experience becomes more important. Recently, the concept of learning agility has attracted considerable attention from human resource professionals and consultants interested in selecting on and developing employees' ability to learn from experience. However, the academic community has been largely absent from this discussion of learning agility, and the concept remains ill defined and poorly measured. This article presents a constructive critique of the existing literature on learning agility, seeks to clarify the definition and conceptualization of the construct, and situates learning agility within a broader nomological network of related constructs. We conclude by discussing several important directions for future research on learning agility.

AB  - A longstanding controversy in the field of emotion research has concerned whether emotions are better conceptualized in terms of discrete categories, such as fear and anger, or underlying dimensions, such as arousal and valence. In the domain of neuroimaging studies of emotion, the debate has centered on whether neuroimaging findings support characteristic and discriminable neural signatures for basic emotions or whether they favor competing dimensional and psychological construction accounts. This review highlights recent neuroimaging findings in this controversy, assesses what they have contributed to this debate, and offers some preliminary conclusions. Namely, although neuroimaging studies have identified consistent neural correlates associated with basic emotions and other emotion models, they have ruled out simple one-to-one mappings between emotions and brain regions, pointing to the need for more complex, network-based representations of emotion.

AB  - In the past decade, research has accumulated suggesting that excessive Internet use can lead to the development of a behavioral addiction. Internet addiction has been considered as a serious threat to mental health and the excessive use of the Internet has been linked to a variety of negative psychosocial consequences. The aim of this review is to identify all empirical studies to date that used neuroimaging techniques to shed light upon the emerging mental health problem of Internet and gaming addiction from a neuroscientific perspective. Neuroimaging studies offer an advantage over traditional survey and behavioral research because with this method, it is possible to distinguish particular brain areas that are involved in the development and maintenance of addiction. A systematic literature search was conducted, identifying 18 studies. These studies provide compelling evidence for the similarities between different types of addictions, notably substance-related addictions and Internet and gaming addiction, on a variety of levels. On the molecular level, Internet addiction is characterized by an overall reward deficiency that entails decreased dopaminergic activity. On the level of neural circuitry, Internet and gaming addiction led to neuroadaptation and structural changes that occur as a consequence of prolonged increased activity in brain areas associated with addiction. On a behavioral level, Internet and gaming addicts appear to be constricted with regards to their cognitive functioning in various domains. The paper shows that understanding the neuronal correlates associated with the development of Internet and gaming addiction will promote future research and will pave the way for the development of addiction treatment approaches.

AB  - The aim of this review is to bring the phenomenological sense of place approach together with current results from neuroscience. We searched in neuroscientific literature for ten dimensions which were beforehand identified to be important in a phenomenological sense of place/place identity model: behaviour, body, emotion, attention, perception, memory, orientation, spirituality, meaning/value and culture/sociality.
   Neuroscience has identified many neurobiological correlates of phenomenological observations concerning sense of place. The human brain comprises specific and specialised structures and processes to perceive, memorise, link, assess and use spatial information. Specific parts (hippocampus, entorhinal, parahippocampal and parietal cortex), subregions (parahippocampal place area, lingual landmark area), and cells (place cells, gridcells, bordercells, head direction cells) have been identified, their specific function could be understood and their interaction traced. Neuroscience has provided evidence that place constitutes a distinct dimension in neuronal processing. This reinforces the phenomenological argumentation of human geography and environmental psychology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study of emotion has gathered momentum in the field of environmental science, specifically in the context of community resource decision-making. Of particular interest in this review is the potential influence of emotion, risk and threat perception on individuals' decisions to acceptance and adopt decentralised water systems, such as rainwater tanks and greywater systems. The role of message framing is also considered in detail, as well as the influences that different types of framing can have on decision making. These factors are considered as possible predictors for analysing community acceptance of decentralised water in urban environments. Concepts believed to be influenced by emotion, such as trust and framing, are also discussed as potentially meaningful contributors to an overall model of community acceptance of decentralised water. Recommendations are made for how emotion-based concepts, such as risk and threat, can be targeted to facilitate widespread adoption of decentralised systems and how researchers can explore different types of emotions that influence decision making in distinct ways. This review is an important theoretical step in advancing the psycho-social understanding of acceptance and adoption of on-site water sources. Avenues for future research are recommended, including the need for greater theoretical development to encourage future social science research on decentralised systems.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to systematically review prospective cohort studies to gain insights into risk factors for the development of non-specific neck pain in office workers as well as to assess the strength of evidence. Publications were systematically searched from 1980 - March 2011 in several databases. The following key words were used: neck pain paired with risk or prognostic factors and office or computer or visual display unit or visual display terminal. Relevant studies were retrieved and assessed for methodological quality by two independent reviewers. The strength of the evidence was based on methodological quality and consistency of the results. Five high-quality and two low-quality prospective cohort studies investigating the predictive value of 47 individual, work-related physical and work-related psychosocial factors for the onset of non-specific neck pain in office workers were included in this review. Strong evidence was found for female gender and previous history of neck complaints to be predictors of the onset of neck pain. Interestingly, for a large number of factors that have been mentioned in the literature as risk factors for neck pain, such as high physical leisure activity, low social support, and high psychosocial stress, we found no predictive value for future neck pain in office workers. Literature with respect to the development of non-specific neck pain in office workers is scant. Only female gender and previous history of neck complaints have been identified as risk factors that predict the onset of neck pain.

AB  - Climate change is affecting and will increasingly influence human health and wellbeing. Children are particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. An extensive literature review regarding the impact of climate change on children's health was conducted in April 2012 by searching electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science, as well as relevant websites, such as IPCC and WHO. Climate change affects children's health through increased air pollution, more weather-related disasters, more frequent and intense heat waves, decreased water quality and quantity, food shortage and greater exposure to toxicants. As a result, children experience greater risk of mental disorders, malnutrition, infectious diseases, allergic diseases and respiratory diseases. Mitigation measures like reducing carbon pollution emissions, and adaptation measures such as early warning systems and post-disaster counseling are strongly needed. Future health research directions should focus on: (1) identifying whether climate change impacts on children will be modified by gender, age and socioeconomic status; (2) refining outcome measures of children's vulnerability to climate change; (3) projecting children's disease burden under climate change scenarios; (4) exploring children's disease burden related to climate change in low-income countries; and (5) identifying the most cost-effective mitigation and adaptation actions from a children's health perspective.

AB  - In spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), the order and precise temporal interval between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes determine the sign and magnitude of long-term potentiation (LIP) or depression (LTD). STDP is widely utilized in models of circuit-level plasticity, development, and learning. However, spike timing is just one of several factors (including firing rate, synaptic cooperativity, and depolarization) that govern plasticity induction, and its relative importance varies across synapses and activity regimes. This review summarizes this broader view of plasticity, including the forms and cellular mechanisms for the spike-timing dependence of plasticity, and, the evidence that spike timing is an important determinant of plasticity in vivo.

AB  - Objective: Early-intervention units have proliferated over the last decade, justified in terms of cost as well as treatment effect. Strong claims for extension of these programmes on economic grounds motivate a systematic review of economic evaluations of early-intervention programmes.
   Method: Searches were undertaken in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO with keywords including 'early intervention', 'ultra-high risk', 'prodrome', 'cost-effectiveness', 'psychosis', 'economic', and 'at-risk mental state'. Relevant journals, editorials, and the references of retrieved articles were hand-searched for appropriate research.
   Results: Eleven articles were included in the review. The more rigorous research (two randomized control trials and two quasi-experimental studies) suggested no difference in resource utilization or costs between early-intervention and treatment-as-usual groups. One small case-control study with evidence of significant bias concluded annual early-intervention costs were one-third of treatment-as-usual costs. Modelling studies projected reduced costs of early intervention but were based on assumptions since definitively revised. Cost-effectiveness analyses did not strongly support the cost-effectiveness of early intervention. No studies appropriately valued outpatient costs or addressed the feasibility of realizing reduced hospitalization in reduced costs.
   Conclusions: The published literature does not support the contention that early intervention for psychosis reduces costs or achieves cost-effectiveness. Past failed attempts to reduce health costs by reducing hospitalization, and increased outpatient costs in early-intervention programmes suggest such programmes may increase costs. Future economic evaluation of early-intervention programmes would need to correctly value outpatient costs and accommodate uncertainty regarding reduced hospitalization costs, perhaps by sensitivity analysis. The current research hints that cost differences may be greater early in treatment and in patients with more severe illness.

Methods: The literature in this field will be reviewed, and the highlighted risk factors explored in detail. Results: Reviewing the evidence base highlights the complex needs of this population, as the prevalence of mental health problems in both detained and community-based young offenders is high, with the presence of at least one mental health problem found in up to 92%. There is much data to suggest that young offenders have many of the risk indicators that would place them at risk of significant mental health problems according to previously identified criteria. Factors such as intellectual level, difficulties in school, substance abuse problems, exposure to trauma and problems understood within an attachment framework are explored. Conclusion: The main conclusion is that this population have many risk factors which increase the possibility of developing serious mental health problems, therefore highlighting the need for early intervention.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the long-term efficacy and potential risk of psychiatric side effects of varenicline for smoking cessation compared with placebo or nicotine replacement therapy.
   Subject and methods Systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register, SCI) up to March 2011. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of randomized controlled trials comparing varenicline with placebo, or nicotine replacement therapy with follow-up of at least 12 months. Information was independently extracted by 2 reviewers.
   Results Ten trials involving 6,375 smokers were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratios (RR) for continuous abstinence was 2.83 (95% CI: 2.20-3.63) at 52 weeks for varenicline (1 mg, twice per day) versus placebo. Varenicline seemed to be more effective in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR, 3.33) than smokers with cardiovascular diseases (RR, 2.64) or health smokers (RR, 2.52), non-Asian smokers than Asian smokers (2.98 vs. 1.94), elder smokers than younger smokers (2.87 vs. 2.52), female smokers than male smokers (2.98 vs. 1.94). The five predominant reported adverse events for varenicline compared to placebo were vomiting, nausea, abnormal dreams, constipation, and dysgeusia. There was no sufficient evidence that varenicline was associated with an increased risk of psychiatric side effects (RR, 1.45, 95% CI: 0.90-2.32).
   Conclusion Varenicline therapy compared with placebo is associated with a favorable effect on smoking cessation at the end of 52 weeks. However, the psychiatric adverse events related with varenicline should be further studied with larger qualified study. People with preexisting mental illnesses should be prudently treated with varenicline.

AB  - Infantile colic, the cause of 10-20% of all early paediatrician visits, can lead to parental exhaustion and stress. A systematic review was conducted to examine whether dietary change provides an effective therapy for infantile colic. Six databases were searched from 1960, and 24 studies selected for inclusion. In breastfed infants, evidence suggests that a hypoallergenic maternal diet may be beneficial for reducing symptoms of colic. In formula-fed infants, colic may improve after changing from a standard cow's milk formula to either a hydrolysed protein formula or a soy-based formula. Fibre-supplemented formulae had no effect. Removal of poorly digested carbohydrates from the infant's diet has promise, but additional clinical studies must be conducted before a recommendation can be made. Use of a universal definition to measure symptoms of infantile colic and consistent analysis of urine and faecal samples would improve the evidence in this area.

AB  - Simultaneous multisite recording using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) in cultured and acutely-dissociated brain slices and other tissues is an emerging technique in the field of network electrophysiology. Over the past 40 years, great efforts have been made by both scientists and commercial concerns, to advance this technique. The MEA technique has been widely applied to many regions of the brain, retina, heart and smooth muscle in various studies at the network level. The present review starts from the development of MEA techniques and their uses in brain preparations, and then specifically concentrates on the use of MEA recordings in studies of synaptic plasticity at the network level in both the temporal and spatial domains. Because the MEA technique helps bridge the gap between single-cell recordings and behavioral assays, its wide application will undoubtedly shed light on the mechanisms underlying brain functions and dysfunctions at the network level that remained largely unknown due to the technical difficulties before it matured.

AB  - Traditionally, higher-level cognition has been described as including processes such as attention, memory, language, and decision-making. However, motor processing and motor imagery are important aspects of cognition that have typically been considered outside of the traditional view. Recent research has demonstrated that there may be a critical functional relationship between motor imagery and other higher-level cognitive processes. Here we present a review of the extant literature on motor imagery and cognition, as well as outline four hurdles that must be addressed before the field investigating the influence of motor-based processes on higher-level cognition can be moved forward. These hurdles include problems distinguishing between visual and motor processes, addressing the differences in tasks and stimuli used to evoke motor imagery, accounting for individual differences in motor imagery ability, and identifying the appropriate neural correlates. It is important that these hurdles are addressed in future research so we can sprint forward and further our knowledge about this interesting relationship.

AB  - Dynamics of neuronal networks can be altered in at least two ways: by changes in connectivity, that is, the physical architecture of the network, or changes in the amplitudes and kinetics of the intrinsic and synaptic currents within and between the elements making up a network. We argue that the latter changes are often overlooked as sources of alterations in network behavior when there are also structural (connectivity) abnormalities present; indeed, they may even give rise to the structural changes observed in these states. Here we look at two clinically relevant states (Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia) and argue that non-structural changes are important in the development of abnormal dynamics within the networks known to be relevant to each disorder. We also discuss anesthesia, since it is entirely acute, thus illustrating the potent effects of changes in synaptic and intrinsic membrane currents in the absence of structural alteration. In each of these, we focus on the role of changes in GABAergic function within microcircuits, stressing literature within the last few years.

AB  - Background
   Clinicians have considerable difficulty identifying and helping those people with alcohol problems but no previous study has looked at this systematically.
   Aims
   To determine clinicians ability to routinely identify broadly defined alcohol problems.
   Method
   Data were extracted and rated by two authors, according to PRISMA standard and QUADAS criteria. Studies that examined the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians' opinion regarding the presence of alcohol problems as well as their written notation were evaluated.
   Results
   A comprehensive search identified 48 studies that looked at the routine ability of clinicians to identify alcohol problems (12 in primary care, 31 in general hospitals and 5 in psychiatric settings). A total of 39 examined alcohol use disorder, 5 alcohol dependence and 4 intoxication. We separated studies into those using self-report and those using interview. The diagnostic sensitivity of primary care physicians (general practitioners) in the identification of alcohol use disorder was 41.7% (95% CI 23.0-61.7) but alcohol problems were recorded correctly in only 27.3% (95% CI 16.9-39.1) of primary care records. Hospital staff identified 52.4% (95% CI 35.9-68.7) of cases and made correct notations in 37.2% (95% CI 28.4-46.4) of case notes. Mental health professionals were able to correctly identify alcohol use disorder in 54.7% (95% CI 16.8-89.6) of cases. There were limited data regarding alcohol dependency and intoxication. Hospital staff were able to detect 41.7% (95% CI 16.5-69.5) of people with alcohol dependency and 89.8% (95% CI 70.4-99.4) of those acutely intoxicated. Specificity data were sparse.
   Conclusions
   Clinicians may consider simple screening methods such as self-report tools rather than relying on unassisted clinical judgement but the added value of screening over and above clinical diagnosis remains unclear.

AB  - Aims: The Finnish Hospital Discharge Register (FHDR) is one of the oldest individual level hospital discharge registers and has been intensively used for research purposes. The aim of this study was to gather information concerning the quality of FHDR into one place in terms of a systematic review of validation studies that compare data to external information. Methods: Several reference databases were searched for validity articles published until January 2012. For each included study, focus of validation, register years examined, number of compared observations, external source(s) of data, summary of validation results, and conclusions concerning the validity of FHDR were extracted. Results: In total, 32 different studies comparing FHDR data to external information were identified. Most of the studies examined validity in the case of vascular disease, mental disorders or injuries. More than 95% of discharges could be identified from the register. Positive predictive value (PPV) for common diagnoses was between 75 and 99%. Conclusions: Completeness and accuracy in the register seem to vary from satisfactory to very good in the register as long as the recognised limitations are taking into account. Poor recording of subsidiary diagnoses and secondary operations and other rarely used items are the most obvious limitations in validity, but do not compromise the value of data in FHDR in being used in studies that are not feasible to conduct otherwise.

AB  - Intact social memory forms the basis of meaningful interactions between individuals. Many factors can modulate the quality of social memory, and these have been studied in detail in rodents. Social memory, however, cannot be considered a single entity. The term social memory reflects different processes, such as social recognition of a novel conspecific individual and social learning (or 'learning from others'). This review summarizes the findings obtained with behavioral paradigms that were developed for the study of memory formation by social recognition and social learning. In particular, we focus on studies that include tests for social habituation/discrimination paradigms, tests for memory of a previously established social hierarchy and the social transmission of the food preference test. The role of individual differences and the main neurobiological mechanisms (i.e., the brain regions and neurochemical systems involved) that have been implicated in each of these types of social-related memories are reviewed. In addition, we address the key modulatory influence of stress on the formation of these types of memories; discussing the contribution of central (corticotropin-releasing factor, CRF) and peripheral (glucocorticoids) stress systems and their interactions with the social neuropeptide systems. Overall, we present here a general overview of the current state of a thriving research area within the field of social neuroscience. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Complex molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) are gradually being elucidated. Accumulating genetic evidence implicates dysfunction of kinase activities and phosphorylation pathways in the pathogenesis of PD. Causative and risk gene products associated with PD include protein kinases (such as PINK1, LRRK2 and GAK) and proteins related phosphorylation signaling pathways (such as SNCA, DJ-1). PINK1, LRRK2 and several PD gene products have been associated with mitogen-activated protein (MAP) and protein kinase B (AKT) kinase signaling pathways. C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and p38, signaling pathways downstream of MAP, are particularly important in PD. JNK and p38 play an integral role in neuronal death. Targeting JNK or p38 signaling may offer an effective therapy for PD. Inhibitors of the ERK signaling pathway, which plays an important role in the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), have been shown to attenuate this condition in animal models. In this review, we summarize experimental evidence gathered over the last decade on the role of PINK1, LRRK2 and GAK and their related phosphorylation signaling pathways (JNK, ERR, p38 and P13K/AKT) in PD. It is speculated that improvement or modulation of these signaling pathways will reveal potential therapeutic targets for attenuation of the cardinal symptoms and motor complications in patients with PD in the future.

AB  - Human neuroscience has seen a recent boom in studies on reflective, controlled, explicit social cognitive functions like imitation, perspective-taking, and empathy. The relationship of these higher-level functions to lower-level, reflexive, automatic, implicit functions is an area of current research. As the field continues to address this relationship, we suggest that an evolutionary, comparative approach will be useful, even essential. There is a large body of research on reflexive, automatic, implicit processes in animals. A growing perspective sees social cognitive processes as phylogenically continuous, making findings in other species relevant for understanding our own. One of these phylogenically continuous processes appears to be self-other matching or simulation. Mice are more sensitive to pain after watching other mice experience pain; geese experience heart rate increases when seeing their mate in conflict; and infant macaques, chimpanzees, and humans automatically mimic adult facial expressions. In this article, we review findings in different species that illustrate how such reflexive processes are related to ("higher order") reflexive processes, such as cognitive empathy, theory of mind, and learning by imitation. We do so in the context of self-other matching in three different domains-in the motor domain (somatomotor movements), in the perceptual domain (eye movements and cognition about visual perception), and in the autonomic/emotional domain. We also review research on the developmental origin of these processes and their neural bases across species. We highlight gaps in existing knowledge and point out some questions for future research. We conclude that our understanding of the psychological and neural mechanisms of self-other mapping and other functions in our own species can be informed by considering the layered complexity these functions in other species.

AB  - The visual cortex has the capacity for experience-dependent change, or cortical plasticity, that is retained throughout life. Plasticity is invoked for encoding information during perceptual learning, by internally representing the regularities of the visual environment, which is useful for facilitating intermediate-level vision-contour integration and surface segmentation. The same mechanisms have adaptive value for functional recovery after CNS damage, such as that associated with stroke or neurodegenerative disease. A common feature to plasticity in primary visual cortex (V1) is an association field that links contour elements across the visual field. The circuitry underlying the association field includes a plexus of long-range horizontal connections formed by cortical pyramidal cells. These connections undergo rapid and exuberant sprouting and pruning in response to removal of sensory input, which can account for the topographic reorganization following retinal lesions. Similar alterations in cortical circuitry may be involved in perceptual learning, and the changes observed in V1 may be representative of how learned information is encoded throughout the cerebral cortex.

AB  - Orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex (VI) is a receptive field property that is at once simple enough to make it amenable to experimental and theoretical approaches and yet complex enough to represent a significant transformation in the representation of the visual image. As a result, V1 has become an area of choice for studying cortical computation and its underlying mechanisms. Here we consider the receptive field properties of the simple cells in cat V1-the cells that receive direct input from thalamic relay cells and explore how these properties, many of which are highly nonlinear, arise. We have found that many receptive field properties of V1 simple cells fall directly out of Hubei and Wiesel's feedforward model when the model incorporates realistic neuronal and synaptic mechanisms, including threshold, synaptic depression, response variability, and the membrane time constant.

AB  - Recent comparative evidence suggests that anthropoid primates are the only vertebrates to exhibit a quantitative relationship between relative brain size and social group size. In this paper, I attempt to explain this pattern with regard to facial expressivity and social bonding. I hypothesize that facial motor control increases as a secondary consequence of neocortical expansion owing to cortical innervation of the facial motor nucleus. This is supported by new analyses demonstrating correlated evolution between relative neocortex size and relative facial nucleus size. I also hypothesize that increased facial motor control correlates with enhanced emotional expressivity, which provides the opportunity for individuals to better gauge the trustworthiness of group members. This is supported by previous evidence from human psychology, as well as new analyses demonstrating a positive relationship between allogrooming and facial nucleus volume. I suggest new approaches to the study of primate facial expressivity in light of these hypotheses.

AB  - Social epidemiology is the field of study that attempts to understand the social determinants of health and the dynamics between societal settings and health. In the past 3 decades, large-scale studies in the West have accumulated a range of measures and methodologies to pursue this goal. We would like to suggest that there may be conceptual gaps in the science if Western research models are applied uncritically in East Asian studies of socioeconomic, gender, and ethnic inequalities in health. On one hand, there are common concerns, including population aging and gendered labor market participation. Further, international comparison must be built on shared concepts such as socioeconomic stratification in market economies. On the other hand, some aspects of health, such as common mental disorders, may have culturally specific manifestations that require development of perspectives (and perhaps novel measures) in order to reveal Eastern specifics. Exploring and debating commonalities and differences in the determinants of health in Oriental and Occidental cultures could offer fresh inspiration and insight for the next phase of social epidemiology in both regions.

AB  - Objective:A review of systematic reviews of the effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services for resource constrained environments was conducted. Specifically with the aim of producing an evidence-based review of the effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services in resource constrained countries like South Africa. Methods: Eight key questions on telepsychiatry effectiveness and feasibility were identified and inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed. Review of citations from 2000-2011 from CINAHL, Medline, Pubmed, PsycInfo, EBSCOhost, SABINET, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CCTR), Cochrane Controlled Trial Registry (CCTR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), unpublished abstracts through NEXUS and internet search engines (Google/Google scholar) was conducted. Results: Ten systematic reviews were included for review. Despite the methodological limitations and heterogeneity of the systematic reviews, there appears to be good evidence of effectiveness (reliability and improved outcomes) and feasibility (use, satisfaction, acceptability and cost) for videoconference-based telepsychiatry internationally The application of this evidence in lower middle income countries is dependent on the integration of telepsychiatry into local health system contexts. Conclusion: Based on the evidence, resource constrained countries such as South Africa should be encouraged to develop telepsychiatry programs along with rigorous evaluation methods.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this paper was to review all randomized published trials and unpublished conference presentations on the neurofeedback (NF) treatment of pediatric ADHD, and their relevance, strengths, and limitations. Method: Via PsychInfo and Medline searches and contacts with NF researchers 14 studies were identified and reviewed. Results: The majority were conducted from 1994 to 2010, with 5- to 15-year-olds, usually male and White with the combined type of ADHD. Most studies used theta/beta NF with a unipolar-electrode placement at Cz and demonstrated, where reported, an overall ADHD mean effect size of d = 0.69, a medium effect. Main study strengths, within some studies, include use of randomization, treatment control conditions, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, evidence-based assessment of ADHD, standard treatment outcome measures, multidomain assessment, and, for some studies, moderate sample size, some type of blind and the identification of medication as a concomitant treatment. Main study limitations (and directions for future research) include the lack of adequate blinding of participants, raters and NF trainers, a sham-NF/blinded control treatment condition, posttreatment follow-up, generalizability, specific details about delivery of NF, identification and control of comorbidity, and the identification, measurement, and control of concomitant treatments and potential side effects. Conclusion: Based on the results and methodologies of published studies, this review concludes that NF for pediatric ADHD can be currently considered as "probably efficacious.". (J. of Att.

AB  - This paper presents the findings from a review of the theoretical and empirical literature on the links between crime and fear of crime, the social and built environment, and health and wellbeing. A pragmatic approach was employed, with iterative stages of searching and synthesis. This produced a holistic causal framework of pathways to guide future research. The framework emphasises that crime and fear of crime may have substantial impacts on wellbeing, but the pathways are often highly indirect, mediated by environmental factors, difficult to disentangle and not always in the expected direction. The built environment, for example, may affect health via its impacts on health behaviours; via its effects on crime and fear of crime; or via the social environment. The framework also helps to identify unexpected factors which may affect intervention success, such as the risk of adverse effects from crime prevention interventions as a result of raising awareness of crime.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Supervision is accepted as a part of postgraduate psychiatric training programmes (at least in the western world). However, despite its ubiquity, it is little researched. The purpose of this review was to synthesize research on supervision in psychiatry in the last 3 years (2009-2011). Given the dearth of such research, the boundary was extended to include general medicine and other mental health professions.
   Recent findings
   The lack of research into supervision in psychiatry was confirmed by a comprehensive search of literature. The few articles published specific to psychiatry did, however, reflect the position of psychiatry, bridging medicine and the psychotherapies. Thus, they span from the impact of workplace-based assessments and reframing the theories of learning applicable to psychiatric training, through to the learning of psychotherapy by psychiatric trainees.
   The literature on supervision in general medicine is dominated by the impact of competency-based training, with its associated methods of assessment, and issues around the decision to entrust trainees with various professional activities.
   The psychotherapy supervision literature has been notable for two disparate themes: the centenary of psychotherapeutic supervision in 2009 prompted a number of scholars to write reflective pieces capturing advances and areas for further research; whereas the development of evidence-based clinical supervision has given rise to a considerable body of work.
   Summary
   Research into supervision in psychiatry remains largely a terra incognita. If supervision is to continue to occupy a role as a key component of psychiatric training, research to justify that is needed urgently.

AB  - Objective: South Africa has a shortage of facilities and psychiatrists to assess adjudicative competence of prisoners awaiting assessment under sections 77 to 79 of the Criminal Procedures Act of 1977. Various solutions have been proposed by the Department of Health. The recent linking of a Magistrate's court and a prison by videoconferencing offers the opportunity to implement a forensic telepsychiatry service. The literature on forensic telepsychiatry for assessment of adjudicative competence was reviewed. Method: The electronic databases, PubMed, Scopus, Cinahl and Google Scholar were searched for papers on forensic telepsychiatry. The inclusion criterion was papers reporting the use of videoconferencing for assessment of adjudicative competence or for assessment for referral out of the judicial system, by psychiatrists or psychologists. Results: 411 papers were found of which 13, published between 1997 and 2008 were relevant. The use of videoconferencing for forensic psychiatric assessment was reported from four countries. The courts in those jurisdictions have accepted the use of videoconferencing for assessment and no successful appeals have been mounted on the basis of the use of videoconferencing for assessment. User satisfaction has not been reported for assessing adjudicative competence. Forensic telepsychiatry has been found to be cost effective, improve access to scarce specialist skills and reduce transport of prisoners under guard to hospitals or psychiatrists to prisons. Conclusion: There is nothing in the literature to suggest that a forensic telepsychiatry service is not feasible in South Africa and a pilot project is being planned.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this review was to assess systematically the empirical evidence for associations between employee worktime control (WTC) and work non-work balance, health/well-being, and job-related outcomes (eg, job satisfaction, job performance).
   Method A systematic search of empirical studies published between 1995-2011 resulted in 63 relevant papers from 53 studies. Five different categories of WTC measurements were distinguished (global WTC, multidimensional WTC, flextime, leave control, and "other subdimensions of WTC"). For each WTC category, we examined the strength of evidence for an association with (i) work non-work balance, (ii) health/well-being, and (iii) job-related outcomes. We distinguished between cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention studies. Evidence strength was assessed based on the number of studies and their convergence in terms of study findings.
   Results (Moderately) strong cross-sectional evidence was found for positive associations between global WTC and both work non-work balance and job-related outcomes, whereas no consistent evidence was found regarding health/well-being. Intervention studies on global WTC found moderately strong evidence for a positive causal association with work non-work balance and no or insufficient evidence for health/well-being and job-related outcomes. Limited to moderately strong cross-sectional evidence was found for positive associations between multidimensional WTC and our outcome categories. Moderately strong cross-sectional evidence was found for positive associations between flextime and all outcome categories. The lack of intervention or longitudinal studies restricts clear causal inferences.
   Conclusions This review has shown that there are theoretical and empirical reasons to view WTC as a promising tool for the maintenance of employees' work non-work balance, health and well-being, and job-related outcomes. At the same time, however, the current state of evidence allows only very limited causal inferences to be made regarding the impact of enhanced WTC.

AB  - Background: Childhood and adolescence represent the periods during which hallucinatory experiences occur at the greatest prevalence, and also constitute a critical window of vulnerability for the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders. The longitudinal course of hallucinatory experiences during late childhood and adolescence, as well as their relationship to psychotic disorders, has never been the subject of review.
   Methods: We followed the PRISMA guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and combined the use of electronic and manual systematic search methods. Data were extracted upon pre-defined requested items and were analyzed using several epidemiological measures. The interpretation of the results was conducted in relation to the study design variables.
   Results: A total of 11 datasets (6 epidemiological and 5 clinical) were reviewed. The baseline prevalence of hallucinatory experiences ranged from 4.9% to 9%. Discontinuation occurred in between 58.7% and 94.5% of the cases, and person-year discontinuation rates ranged from 3% to 40.7% and appeared to be related to the duration of follow-up. Despite low person-year incidence rate, incident cases constituted between 27.7% and 83.3% of outcome samples. 2 of 3 studies showed evidence to predict transition to psychosis with likelihood ratios of 2.5 and 6.6.
   Conclusions: Hallucinatory experiences are a common experience during childhood and adolescence. A review of the current literature suggests that there is a considerable turnover of incident-discontinuing cases and that most cases discontinue in the short term. A subset of the cases was at risk for persistence or transition to psychosis, probably related to indicators of severity of the hallucinatory experience. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A three-dimensional groundwater flow model was used to evaluate the groundwater potential and assess the effects of groundwater withdrawal on the regional water level and flow direction in the central Beijing area. A program of groundwater modeling aimed at estimating current contaminant fluxes to the central area and site streams via groundwater was developed.
   The conceptual model developed for the site attempted to incorporate a complex stratigraphic profile in which groundwater flow and contaminant transport is strongly controlled by a shallow aquifer. Here, a conceptual model for groundwater flow and contaminant transport in central Beijing is presented.
   Model simulations indicated that a sharp drop in the hydraulic head occurs at the center of the model area, which generates a cone of depression and a continuous decline of head with respect to time as a result of heavy groundwater abstraction.

   To outline what is known about collaborative work between the main stakeholders in mental health and psychiatry (professionals, patients or service users and family members). To learn from recent practice what are the main areas of joint work, what is working well, what are the key issues and problems and what has been learned from doing it.
   Recent findings
   Service users and family members are valued in education and training. Service users as peer support workers have helped patients recover, and methods of participatory research can bring new insights. There is a need to support and build an evidence base for these new ways of working.
   Summary
   The run-down of institutions, the new paradigm of recovery and human rights laws have led to increased joint working in the field of law and policy, research, education and training, service provision and coercion. Joint working challenges the old ways of knowledge creation and practices such as coercive treatment. More work is needed to build on what is being learned and move to genuine equality and partnership.

AB  - While increasing numbers of patients are seeking acupuncture treatment for depression in recent years, there is limited evidence of the antidepressant (AD) effectiveness of acupuncture. Given the unsatisfactory response rates of many Food and Drug Administration-approved ADs, research on acupuncture remains of potential value. Therefore, we sought to review the efficacy and safety of acupuncture treatment for depression in clinical applications. We conducted a PubMed search for publications through 2011. We assessed the adequacy of each report and abstracted information on reported effectiveness or efficacy of acupuncture as monotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) and as augmentation of ADs. We also examined adverse events associated with acupuncture, and evidence for acupuncture as a means of reducing side effects of ADs. Published data suggest that acupuncture, including manual-, electrical-, and laser-based, is a generally beneficial, well-tolerated, and safe monotherapy for depression. However, acupuncture augmentation in AD partial responders and nonresponders is not as well studied as monotherapy; and available studies have only investigated MDD, but not other depressive spectrum disorders. Manual acupuncture reduced side effects of ADs in MDD. We found no data on depressive recurrence rates after recovery with acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture is a potential effective monotherapy for depression, and a safe, well-tolerated augmentation in AD partial responders and nonresponders. However, the body of evidence based on well-designed studies is limited, and further investigation is called for.

TI  - Cancer risk and the complexity of the interactions between environmental and host factors: HENVINET interactive diagrams as simple tools for exploring and understanding the scientific evidence
KW  - LUNG-CANCER
KW  - RADON
KW  - EXPOSURE
KW  - INDOOR
AB  - Background: Development of graphical/visual presentations of cancer etiology caused by environmental stressors is a process that requires combining the complex biological interactions between xenobiotics in living and occupational environment with genes (gene-environment interaction) and genomic and non-genomic based disease specific mechanisms in living organisms. Traditionally, presentation of causal relationships includes the statistical association between exposure to one xenobiotic and the disease corrected for the effect of potential confounders.
   Methods: Within the FP6 project HENVINET, we aimed at considering together all known agents and mechanisms involved in development of selected cancer types. Selection of cancer types for causal diagrams was based on the corpus of available data and reported relative risk (RR). In constructing causal diagrams the complexity of the interactions between xenobiotics was considered a priority in the interpretation of cancer risk. Additionally, gene-environment interactions were incorporated such as polymorphisms in genes for repair and for phase I and II enzymes involved in metabolism of xenobiotics and their elimination. Information on possible age or gender susceptibility is also included. Diagrams are user friendly thanks to multistep access to information packages and the possibility of referring to related literature and a glossary of terms. Diagrams cover both chemical and physical agents (ionizing and non-ionizing radiation) and provide basic information on the strength of the association between type of exposure and cancer risk reported by human studies and supported by mechanistic studies. Causal diagrams developed within HENVINET project represent a valuable source of information for professionals working in the field of environmental health and epidemiology, and as educational material for students.
   Introduction: Cancer risk results from a complex interaction of environmental exposures with inherited gene polymorphisms, genetic burden collected during development and non genomic capacity of response to environmental insults. In order to adopt effective preventive measures and the associated regulatory actions, a comprehensive investigation of cancer etiology is crucial. Variations and fluctuations of cancer incidence in human populations do not necessarily reflect environmental pollution policies or population distribution of polymorphisms of genes known to be associated with increased cancer risk. Tools which may be used in such a comprehensive research, including molecular biology applied to field studies, require a methodological shift from the reductionism that has been used until recently as a basic axiom in interpretation of data. The complexity of the interactions between cells, genes and the environment, i.e. the resonance of the living matter with the environment, can be synthesized by systems biology. Within the HENVINET project such philosophy was followed in order to develop interactive causal diagrams for the investigation of cancers with possible etiology in environmental exposure.
   Results: Causal diagrams represent integrated knowledge and seed tool for their future development and development of similar diagrams for other environmentally related diseases such as asthma or sterility. In this paper development and application of causal diagrams for cancer are presented and discussed.

AB  - Background: Chronic depression represents a substantial portion of depressive disorders and is associated with severe consequences. This review examined whether the combination of pharmacological treatments and psychotherapy is associated with higher effectiveness than pharmacotherapy alone via meta-analysis; and identified possible treatment effect modifiers via meta-regression-analysis.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Primary efficacy outcome was a response to treatment; primary acceptance outcome was dropping out of the study. Only randomized controlled trials were considered.
   Results: We identified 8 studies with a total of 9 relevant comparisons. Our analysis revealed small, but statistically not significant effects of combined therapies on outcomes directly related to depression (BR = 1.20) with substantial heterogeneity between studies (I-2 = 67%). Three treatment effect modifiers were identified: target disorders, the type of psychotherapy and the type of pharmacotherapy. Small but statistically significant effects of combined therapies on quality of life (SMD = 0.18) were revealed. No differences in acceptance rates and the long-term effects between combined treatments and pure pharmacological interventions were observed.
   Conclusions: This systematic review could not provide clear evidence for the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. However, due to the small amount of primary studies further research is needed for a conclusive decision.

AB  - Research involving animal models of drug addiction can be viewed as a sort of reverse psychiatry. Contrary to clinicians who seek to treat addicted people to become and remain abstinent, researchers seek to make drug-naive animals addicted to a drug with known addictive properties in humans. The goals of this research are to better understand the neuroscience of drug addiction and, ultimately, to translate this knowledge into effective treatments for people with addiction. The present review will not cover the vast literature that has accumulated over the past 50 years on animal models of drug addiction. It is instead more modestly devoted to recent research spanning the past decade on drug self-administration based models of addiction in the rat (the animal species most frequently used in the field), with a special focus on current efforts to model compulsive cocaine use as opposed to nonaddictive use. Surprisingly, it turns out that modeling compulsive cocaine use in rats is possible but more difficult than previously thought In fact, it appears that resilience to cocaine addiction is the norm in rats. As in human cocaine users, only few individual rats would be vulnerable. This conclusion has several important implications for future research on the neuroscience of cocaine addiction and on preclinical medication development.

AB  - Secondary injury is a term applied to the destructive and self-propagating biological changes in cells and tissues that lead to their dysfunction or death over hours to weeks after the initial insult (the "primary injury"). In most contexts, the initial injury is usually mechanical. The more destructive phase of secondary injury is, however, more responsible for cell death and functional deficits. This subject is described and reviewed differently in the literature. To biomedical researchers, systemic and tissue-level changes such as hemorrhage, edema, and ischemia usually define this subject. To cell and molecular biologists, "secondary injury" refers to a series of predominately molecular events and an increasingly restricted set of aberrant biochemical pathways and products. These biochemical and ionic changes are seen to lead to death of the initially compromised cells and "healthy" cells nearby through necrosis or apoptosis. This latter process is called "bystander damage." These viewpoints have largely dominated the recent literature, especially in studies of the central nervous system (CNS), often without attempts to place the molecular events in the context of progressive systemic and tissue-level changes. Here we provide a more comprehensive and inclusive discussion of this topic.

AB  - As part of a festschrift issue for Philip Teitelbaum, I offer here the thesis that Teitelbaum deserves to be viewed as an important forefather to the contemporary field of affective neuroscience (which studies motivation, emotion and affect in the brain). Teitelbaum's groundbreaking analyses of motivation deficits induced by lateral hypothalamic damage, of roles of food palatability in revealing residual function, and of recovery of 'lost' functions helped shape modern understanding of how motivation circuits operate within the brain. His redefinition of the minimum requirement for identifying motivation raised the conceptual bar for thinking about the topic among behavioral neuroscientists. His meticulous analyses of patterned stages induced by brain manipulations, life development and clinical disorders added new dimensions to our appreciation of how brain systems work. His steadfast highlighting of integrative functions and behavioral complexity helped provide a healthy functionalist counterbalance to reductionist trends in science of the late 20th century. In short, Philip Teitelbaum can be seen to have made remarkable contributions to several domains of psychology and neuroscience, including affective neuroscience. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Axonal degeneration is a major contributor to neuronal dysfunction in many neurological conditions and has additional roles in development. It can be triggered by divergent stimuli including mechanical, metabolic, infectious, toxic, hereditary and inflammatory stresses. Axonal mitochondria are an important convergence point as regulators of bioenergetic metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ homeostasis and protease activation. The challenges likely to render axonal mitochondria more vulnerable than their cellular counterparts are reviewed, including axonal transport, replenishing nuclear-encoded proteins and maintenance of quality control, fusion and fission in locations remote from the cell body. The potential for mitochondria to act as a decision node in axon loss is considered, highlighting the need to understand the biology of axonal mitochondria and their contributions to degenerative mechanisms for novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Olfactory dysfunction is an early 'pre-clinical' sign of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present review is a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of such dysfunction in PD and related disorders. The olfactory bulb is implicated in the dysfunction, since only those syndromes with olfactory bulb pathology exhibit significant smell loss. The role of dopamine in the production of olfactory system pathology is enigmatic, as overexpression of dopaminergic cells within the bulb's glomerular layer is a common feature of PD and most animal models of PD. Damage to cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems is likely involved, since such damage is most marked in those diseases with the most smell loss. When compromised, these systems, which regulate microglial activity, can influence the induction of localized brain inflammation, oxidative damage, and cytosolic disruption of cellular processes. In monogenetic forms of PD, olfactory dysfunction is rarely observed in asymptomatic gene carriers, but is present in many of those that exhibit the motor phenotype. This suggests that such gene-related influences on olfaction, when present, take time to develop and depend upon additional factors, such as those from aging, other genes, formation of et-synuclein- and tau-related pathology, or lowered thresholds to oxidative stress from toxic insults. The limited data available suggest that the physiological determinants of the early changes in PD-related olfactory function are likely multifactorial and may include the same determinants as those responsible for a number of other non-motor symptoms of PD, such as dysautonomia and sleep disturbances.

AB  - Genetic, neuropathological and biochemical evidence implicates alpha-synuclein, a 140 amino acid presynaptic neuronal protein, in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. The aggregated protein inclusions mainly containing aberrant alpha-synuclein are widely accepted as morphological hallmarks of alpha-synucleinopathies, but their composition and location vary between disorders along with neuronal networks affected. alpha-Synuclein exists physiologically in both soluble and membran-bound states, in unstructured and alpha-helical conformations, respectively, while posttranslational modifications due to proteostatic deficits are involved in beta-pleated aggregation resulting in formation of typical inclusions. The physiological function of alpha-synuclein and its role linked to neurodegeneration, however, are incompletely understood. Soluble oligomeric, not fully fibrillar alpha-synuclein is thought to be neurotoxic, main targets might be the synapse, axons and glia. The effects of aberrant alpha-synuclein include alterations of calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative and nitric injuries, cytoskeletal effects, and neuroinflammation. Proteasomal dysfunction might be a common mechanism in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration in alpha-synucleinopathies. However, how alpha-synuclein induces neurodegeneration remains elusive as its physiological function. Genome wide association studies demonstrated the important role for genetic variants of the SNCA gene encoding alpha-synuclein in the etiology of Parkinson's disease, possibly through effects on oxidation, mitochondria, autophagy, and lysosomal function. The neuropathology of synucleinopathies and the role of alpha-synuclein as a potential biomarker are briefly summarized. Although animal models provided new insights into the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy, most of them do not adequately reproduce the cardinal features of these disorders. Emerging evidence, in addition to synergistic interactions of alpha-synuclein with various pathogenic proteins, suggests that prionlike induction and seeding of alpha-synuclein could lead to the spread of the pathology and disease progression. Intervention in the early aggregation pathway, aberrant cellular effects, or secretion of alpha-synuclein might be targets for neuroprotection and disease-modifying therapy.

AB  - Parkinsons disease (PD) has for decades been considered a pure motor disorder and its cardinal motor symptoms have been attributed to the loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and to nigral Lewy body pathology. However, there has more recently been a shift in the conceptualization of the disease, and its pathological features have now been recognized as involving several other areas of the brain and indeed even outside the central nervous system. There are a corresponding variety of intrinsic non-motor symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances and neuropsychiatric problems, which cannot be explained exclusively by nigral pathology. In this review, we will focus on cognitive impairment and affective symptoms in PD, and we will consider whether, and how, these deficits can best be modelled in rodent models of the disorder. As only a few of the non-motor symptoms respond to standard DA replacement therapies, the quest for a broader therapeutic approach remains a major research effort, and success in this area in particular will be strongly dependent on appropriate rodent models. In addition, better understanding of the different models, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the available behavioural tasks, will result in better tools for evaluating new treatment strategies for PD patients suffering from these neuropsychological symptoms.

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorders are often associated with several non-psychiatric medical conditions. Among the clinical conditions found in association with anxiety stands out the joint hypermobility (JH). Objective: To carry out a systematic review of the clinical association between anxiety disorders and JH. Method: A survey was conducted in MEDLINE, PsychINFO, LILACS e SciELO databases up to December 2011. We searched for articles using the keywords 'anxiety', 'joint' and 'hypermobility' and Boolean operators. The review included articles describing empirical studies on the association between JH and anxiety. The reference lists of selected articles were systematically hand-searched for other publications relevant to the review. Results: Seventeen articles were included in the analysis and classified to better extract data. We found heterogeneity between the studies relate to the methodology used. Most of the studies found an association between anxiety features and JH. Panic disorder/agoraphobia was the anxiety disorder associated with JH in several studies. Etiological explanation of the relationship between anxiety and JH is still controversial. Conclusion: Future research in large samples from the community and clinical setting and longitudinal studies of the association between anxiety and HA and the underlying biological mechanisms involved in this association are welcome.

AB  - The search for genetic causes of intellectual disability has identified, over the past twenty years, numerous mutated genes that code for proteins concerned with synapse function. Functional studies have shown that these genes may be involved in synapse formation, the synthesis and degradation of specific synapse proteins, the regulation of dendritic spine morphology, or regulation of the synaptic cytoskeleton. It is now clear that even mild alterations in synapse morphology and function can give rise to intellectual disability, and pharmacological agents able to counteract these morphological and functional anomalies - and improve the symptoms of some of these conditions - now appear feasible. This paper reviews recent findings on the functions of some of the genes responsible for intellectual disability syndromes.

AB  - In recent years, novel model systems have made significant contributions to our understanding of the processes that control the ageing of whole organisms. However, there are limited data to show that the mechanisms that gerontologists have identified as having a role in organismal ageing contribute significantly to the ageing of the central nervous system. Two recent discoveries illustrate this particularly well. The first is the consistent failure of researchers to demonstrate a simple relationship between organismal ageing and oxidative stress - a mechanism often assumed to have a primary role in brain ageing. The second is the demonstration that senescent cells play a causal part in organismal ageing but remain essentially unstudied in a CNS context. We argue that the animal models now available (including rodents, flies, molluscs and worms), if properly applied, will allow a paradigm shift in our current understanding of the normal processes of brain ageing.

AB  - Effortful control (EC) and executive function (EF) are 2 constructs related to childrens self-regulation that have historically been the subject of research in separate fields, with EC primarily the focus of temperament research and EF the focus of cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology. This article selectively reviews and compares the EC and EF literature. The review indicates considerable similarities and overlaps in the definitions, core components, and measurement of EC and EF. Differences between the 2 literatures seem to primarily reflect differences in research focus as influenced by each fields tradition rather than real differences in EC and EF as developmental constructs. Thus, developing an integrated theory of self-regulation encompassing the EC and EF perspectives is critical for reducing overlap and confusion in future research. The article provides a number of recommendations on how to integrate the theory and methodology of EC and EF in future research for (a) the components and organization of self-regulation, (b) the relation of self-regulation to childrens adaptive functions, (c) the neurological basis of self-regulation and its development, and (d) the development and evaluation of interventions targeting childrens self-regulation.

AB  - Research has shown that the brain is constantly making predictions about future events. Theories of prediction in perception, action and learning suggest that the brain serves to reduce the discrepancies between expectation and actual experience, i.e., by reducing the prediction error. Forward models of action and perception propose the generation of a predictive internal representation of the expected sensory outcome, which is matched to the actual sensory feedback. Shared neural representations have been found when experiencing one's own and observing other's actions, rewards, errors, and emotions such as fear and pain. These general principles of the "predictive brain" are well established and have already be gun to be applied to social aspects of cognition. The application and relevance of these predictive principles to social cognition are discussed in this article. Evidence is presented to argue that simple non-social cognitive processes can be extended to explain complex cognitive processes required for social interaction, with common neural activity seen for both social and non social cognitions. A number of studies are included which demonstrate that bottom-up sensory input and top-down expectancies can be modulated by social information. The concept of competing social forward models and a partially distinct category of social prediction errors are introduced. The evolutionary implications of a "social predictive brain" are also mentioned, along with the implications on psychopathology. The review presents a number of test able hypotheses and novel comparisons that aim to stimulate further discussion and integration between currently disparate fields of research, with regard to computational models, behavioral and neurophysiological data. This promotes a relatively new platform for inquiry in social neuroscience with implications in social learning, theory of mind, empathy, the evolution of the social brain, and potential strategies for treating social cognitive deficits.

AB  - There is a substantial body of literature related to the effects of a single session of exercise on cognitive performance. The premise underlying this research is that physiological changes in response to exercise have implications for cognitive function. This literature has been reviewed both narratively and meta-analytically and, although the research findings are mixed, researchers have generally concluded that there is a small positive effect. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to provide an updated comprehensive analysis of the extant literature on acute exercise and cognitive performance and to explore the effects of moderators that have implications for mechanisms of the effects. Searches of electronic databases and examinations of reference lists from relevant studies resulted in 79 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Consistent with past findings, analyses indicated that the overall effect was positive and small (g = 0.097 n = 1034). Positive and small effects were also found in all three acute exercise paradigms: during exercise (g = 0.101; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.041-0.160), immediately following exercise (g = 0.108; 95% CI; 0.069-0.147), and after a delay (g = 0.103; 95% CI; 0.035-0.170). Examination of potential moderators indicated that exercise duration, exercise intensity, type of cognitive performance assessed, and participant fitness were significant moderators. In conclusion, the effects of acute exercise on cognitive performance are generally small; however, larger effects are possible for particular cognitive outcomes and when specific exercise parameters are used.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis - the formation of new neurons in adulthood - has been shown to be modulated by a variety of endogenous (e.g., trophic factors, neurotransmitters, and hormones) as well as exogenous (e.g., physical activity and environmental complexity) factors. Research on exogenous regulators of adult neurogenesis has focused primarily on the non-social environment. More recently, however, evidence has emerged suggesting that the social environment can also affect adult neurogenesis. The present review details the effects of adult-adult (e.g., mating and chemosensory interactions) and adult-offspring (e.g., gestation, parenthood, and exposure to offspring) interactions on adult neurogenesis. In addition, the effects of a stressful social environment (e.g., lack of social support and dominant-subordinate interactions) on adult neurogenesis are reviewed. The underlying hormonal mechanisms and potential functional significance of adult-generated neurons in mediating social behaviors are also discussed.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Clinical outcome after neurotrauma is considerably variable and can only partly be explained by known prognostic factors. There is converging evidence from genetic research that a number of genetic variants may contribute to this variability. This review provides recent data from human studies, published in the previous year, on genetic factors influencing outcome after neurotrauma. The bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched to identify relevant studies.
   Recent findings
   Genetic susceptibility to various aspects of clinical outcome after neurotrauma was reported in recent clinical studies. Genetic loci investigated include polymorphisms in APOE, MAO-A, BDNF, NOS3, IL-6, NEFH, SLC6A4, COMT, PPP3CC and KIBRA genes. The importance of these findings and future directions are discussed.
   Summary
   Recent genetic studies have revealed emerging aspects and extended the existing knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of neurotrauma and the genetic influence on phenotypic diversity. A better understanding of the underlying biological pathways and molecular mechanisms of an individual's response to neurotrauma may hold the promise of novel treatment strategies and improved clinical outcome.

AB  - Unilateral spatial neglect is a neurological disorder characterized by impaired orienting of attention to stimuli located in the contralesional space, typically following right-hemisphere damage. Neuropsychological investigations in the past two decades have demonstrated that neglect is caused by deficits affecting a widespread cortico-subcortical fronto-parietal network controlling spatial attention, but usually sparing early sensory pathways. As a consequence, certain residual abilities in sensory processing remain intact and still take place for stimuli in the neglected space, such as the extraction and organization of coherent or meaningful object features. Moreover, these residual abilities can alleviate inattention symptoms when contralesional stimuli are perceptually or biologically salient. Here we review recent studies suggesting that the emotional content of stimuli may also be processed despite impaired attention towards contralesional space, and that such processing may act to enhance attention and partly reduce neglect for these stimuli, relative to similar but emotionally neutral stimuli. For example, faces with emotional expressions, voices with emotional prosody, as well as pictures of scenes or even spiders have been found to be less severely extinguished from awareness in conditions of bilateral stimulations, and/or lead to fewer omissions in search tasks with multiple distracters. Gaze cues and reward learning might also produce similar effects. Altogether, these findings suggest that emotionally significant information is not only extracted from stimuli at neglected locations through spared pathways, but can also induce emotional biases in attention that partly counteract the abnormal spatial biases caused by fronto-parietal damage. We discuss results from neuropsychology and neuroimaging research suggesting that specific mechanisms for emotional attention might exist, centered on the amygdala and other limbic regions, and that these mechanisms can operate partly independent from other circuits controlling spatial and object-based attention. Although we are only beginning to understand these interactive effects of emotion and attention and to identify their neuroanatomical substrates, we believe that a deeper knowledge of such mechanisms and their conditions of optimal operation will help develop or improve therapeutic strategies in neglect patients.

AB  - Ageing leads to a functional deterioration of many brain systems, including the circadian clock - an internal time-keeping system that generates similar to 24-hour rhythms in physiology and behaviour. Numerous clinical studies have established a direct correlation between abnormal circadian clock functions and the severity of neurodegenerative and sleep disorders. Latest data from experiments in model organisms, gene expression studies and clinical trials imply that dysfunctions of the circadian clock contribute to ageing and age-associated pathologies, thereby suggesting a functional link between the circadian clock and age-associated decline of brain functions. Potential molecular mechanisms underlying this link include the circadian control of physiological processes such as brain metabolism, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, hormone secretion, autophagy and stem cell proliferation.

AB  - Background: This article presents an overview of the concept of social capital, reviews prospective multilevel analytic studies of the association between social capital and health, and discusses intervention strategies that enhance social capital.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search of published peer-reviewed literature on the PubMed database and categorized studies according to health outcome.
   Results: We identified 13 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria for the review. In general, both individual social capital and area/workplace social capital had positive effects on health outcomes, regardless of study design, setting, follow-up period, or type of health outcome. Prospective studies that used a multilevel approach were mainly conducted in Western countries. Although we identified some cross-sectional multilevel studies that were conducted in Asian countries, including japan, no prospective studies have been conducted in Asia.
   Conclusions: Prospective evidence from multilevel analytic studies of the effect of social capital on health is very limited at present. If epidemiologic findings on the association between social capital and health are to be put to practical use, we must gather additional evidence and explore the feasibility of interventions that build social capital as a means of promoting health.

AB  - The central aim of this review is to address the highly multidisciplinary topic of redox biology as related to exercise using an integrative and comparative approach rather than focusing on blood, skeletal muscle or humans. An attempt is also made to redefine 'oxidative stress' as well as to introduce the term 'alterations in redox homeostasis' to describe changes in redox homeostasis indicating oxidative stress, reductive stress or both. The literature analysis shows that the effects of non-muscle-damaging exercise and muscle-damaging exercise on redox homeostasis are completely different. Non-muscle-damaging exercise induces alterations in redox homeostasis that last a few hours post exercise, whereas muscle-damaging exercise causes alterations in redox homeostasis that may persist for and/or appear several days post exercise. Both exhaustive maximal exercise lasting only 30s and isometric exercise lasting 1-3 min (the latter activating in addition a small muscle mass) induce systemic oxidative stress. With the necessary modifications, exercise is capable of inducing redox homeostasis alterations in all fluids, cells, tissues and organs studied so far, irrespective of strains and species. More importantly, 'exercise-induced oxidative stress' is not an 'oddity' associated with a particular type of exercise, tissue or species. Rather, oxidative stress constitutes a ubiquitous fundamental biological response to the alteration of redox homeostasis imposed by exercise. The hormesis concept could provide an interpretative framework to reconcile differences that emerge among studies in the field of exercise redox biology. Integrative and comparative approaches can help determine the interactions of key redox responses at multiple levels of biological organization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serotonin syndrome (SS) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) are uncommon but potentially life-threatening adverse reactions associated with psychotropic medications. Polypharmacy and the similar presentation of SS and NMS make diagnosis of the 2 syndromes problematic.
   METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed for the period 1960 to 2011 for case reports, review articles, and studies pertaining to SS and NMS.
   RESULTS: The majority of available literature on SS and NMS consists of case reports, case-control studies, and retrospective reviews. In addition, diagnostic criteria have been developed to aid in the diagnosis and management of SS and NMS.
   CONCLUSIONS: SS presents as mental status changes, autonomic nervous system disturbances, neurologic manifestations, and hyperthermia. Similarly, NMS presents as muscle rigidity, hyperpyrexia, mental status changes, and autonomic instability. However, the clinical laboratory profile of elevations in creatine kinase, liver function tests (lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase), and white blood cell count, coupled with a low serum iron level, distinguishes NMS from SS among patients taking neuroleptic and serotonin agonist medications simultaneously. For both SS and NMS, immediate discontinuation of the causative agent is the primary treatment, along with supportive care. For NMS, dantrolene is the most effective evidence-based drug treatment whereas there are no evidence-based drug treatments for SS. A 2-week washout of neuroleptic medication minimizes the chance of recurrence.

AB  - Objective: The present review evaluates systematically the published quantitative studies of correlates of PA in patients with schizophrenia.
   Method: EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, CINAHL and PEDro were searched from their inception to 1 July 2011 combining the medical subject heading 'schizophrenia' with 'physical activity' or 'physical inactivity' or 'exercise' or 'health education' or 'health behaviour' or 'health promotion'.
   Results: Out of 68 potentially eligible studies, 25 papers (n = 25 013) evaluating 36 correlates were included. Correlates consistently associated with lower PA participation are the presence of negative symptoms and cardio-metabolic comorbidity. Also, side-effects of antipsychotic medication, lack of knowledge on cardiovascular disease risk factors, no belief in the health benefits, a lower self-efficacy, other unhealthy lifestyle habits and social isolation correlated with lower PA participation. The quality of the PA measurement was not related to the proportion of significant associations (chi(2) = 3.8, P = 0.07). Current gaps in literature that need to be examined more in detail are the role of environmental and policy-level factors on PA participation in patients with schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: All correlates should be confirmed in prospective studies, and interventions to improve the modifiable variables should be developed and evaluated.

AB  - This article reviews the potential utility of behavioral interventions in personalized depression treatment. The paper begins with a definition of personalized treatment, moves to current thinking regarding the various causes of depression, and proposes how those causes can be used to inform the selection of behavioral interventions. Two examples from the late-life depression field will illustrate how a team of researchers at Cornell University (NY, USA) and University of California, San Francisco (CA, USA) created a research partnership to select and study behavioral interventions for older adults with risk factors associated with poor response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications. The paper ends with a discussion of how the process used by the Cornell University University of California, San Francisco team can be applied to the selection and development of behavioral interventions for other psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Intrusive thoughts feature as a key factor in our current understanding of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Cognitive theories of OCD assume that the interpretation of normal intrusive thoughts leads to the development and maintenance of the disorder. Research that supports the role of beliefs and appraisals in maintaining distress in OCD is based on the supposition that clinical obsessions are comparable to normal intrusive thoughts. This paper reviews research investigating the occurrence of intrusive thoughts in a nonclinical population, in order assess if these thoughts are comparable to obsessions. The prevalence of intrusive thoughts with obsessive content is assessed, as well as other aspects of these thoughts, such as triggers, appraisals and response strategies. Through critique of literature in this field, this paper goes on to discuss the implications for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Moral dilemma tasks have been a much appreciated experimental paradigm in empirical studies on moral cognition for decades and have, more recently, also become a preferred paradigm in the field of cognitive neuroscience of moral decision-making. Yet, studies using moral dilemmas suffer from two main shortcomings: they lack methodological homogeneity which impedes reliable comparisons of results across studies, thus making a metaanalysis manifestly impossible; and second, they overlook control of relevant design parameters. In this paper, we review from a principled standpoint the studies that use moral dilemmas to approach the psychology of moral judgment and its neural underpinnings. We present a systematic review of 19 experimental design parameters that can be identified in moral dilemmas. Accordingly, our analysis establishes a methodological basis for the required homogeneity between studies and suggests the consideration of experimental aspects that have not yet received much attention despite their relevance.

   Method: A review of the literature from 2004 to 2011 was conducted using Medline and manual searching.
   Results: Eleven studies were identified as meeting inclusion criteria. Five studies demonstrated improved medication adherence. No characteristics of the interventions, clinical characteristics of the groups or methodological factors distinguished those psychosocial interventions that demonstrated improvement from those that did not.
   Conclusions: While only a few interventions improved adherence, most improved clinical outcomes. Issues were also identified about the way in which adherence is defined. It is proposed that incorporating patient preferences into measures of adherence within the context of a disorder-specific psychosocial intervention may provide an approach that demonstrates both improved adherence and improved clinical outcomes. However this requires further research.

   Late-life depression may differ from early-life depression in its phenomenology.
   Aims

   Method
   A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO for all studies examining the relation between age and phenomenology of major depression according to RDC, DSM and ICD criteria. Studies were included only if the age groups were compared at the single-item level using the 17-, 21- or 24-item versions of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; a meta-analysis was done for each item of the 17-item scale.
   Results
   Eleven papers met the inclusion criteria. Older depressed adults, compared with younger depressed adults, demonstrated more agitation, hypochondriasis and general as well as gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, but less guilt and loss of sexual interest.
   Conclusions
   The phenomenology of late-life depression differs only in part from that of early-life depression. Major depression in older people may have a more somatic presentation, whereas feelings of guilt and loss of sexual function may be more prevalent in younger people.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that p53, a tumor suppressor protein primarily involved in cancer biology, coordinates a wide range of novel functions in the CNS including the mediation of pathways underlying neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. Moreover, an evolving concept in cell and molecular neuroscience is that glial cells are far more fundamental to disease progression than previously thought, which may occur via a noncell-autonomous mechanism that is heavily dependent on p53 activities. As a crucial hub connecting many intracellular control pathways, including cell-cycle control and apoptosis, p53 is ideally placed to coordinate the cellular response to a range of stresses. Although neurodegenerative diseases each display a distinct and diverse molecular pathology, apoptosis is a widespread hallmark feature and the multimodal capacity of the p53 system to orchestrate apoptosis and glial cell behavior highlights p53 as a potential unifying target for therapeutic intervention in neurodegeneration.

AB  - Protein kinase CK2 is a highly conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase involved in cell cycle control, transcription, signal transduction and cell proliferation. It is upregulated in several diseases and by oxidative stress. CK2 is generally composed of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits and utilizes either ATP or GTP as a phosphate donor. CK2 was isolated from the sea mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, a biomarker of marine pollution, and the Mediterranean fly Ceratitis capitata, an insect capable of wreaking extensive damage to a wide range of fruit crops with great economical importance. The catalytic CK2 alpha and regulatory CK2 beta subunits of M. galloprovincialis and C. capitata show similar properties. The mussel and fly catalytic subunits and holoenzymes were capable of phosphorylating the recombinant ribosomal stalk P1 protein, implying functional conservation. They also demonstrate the characteristics of a typical CK2: use of ATP and GTP as phosphate donors, inhibition by known modulators of CK2 activity (like benzotriazole derivatives and heparin), and stimulation by polycations. Both organisms seem to be ideal models for the analysis of CK2 in the control of gene expression in response to cellular stress.

AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors that initiate innate immune responses by recognizing molecular structures shared by a wide range of pathogens, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). After tissue injury or cellular stress, TLRs also detect endogenous ligands known as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). TLRs are expressed in both non-neuronal and neuronal cell types in the central nervous system (CNS) and contribute to both infectious and non-infectious disorders in the CNS. Following tissue insult and nerve injury, TLRs (such as TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4) induce the activation of microglia and astrocytes and the production of the proinflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord, leading to the development and maintenance of inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. In particular, primary sensory neurons, such as nociceptors, express TLRs (e.g., TLR4 and TLR7) to sense exogenous PAMPs and endogenous DAMPs released after tissue injury and cellular stress. These neuronal TLRs are new players in the processing of pain and itch by increasing the excitability of primary sensory neurons. Given the prevalence of chronic pain and itch and the suffering of affected people, insights into TLR signaling in the nervous system will open a new avenue for the management of clinical pain and itch.

AB  - Standard univariate analysis of neuroimaging data has revealed a host of neuroanatomical and functional differences between healthy individuals and patients suffering a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Significant only at group level however these findings have had limited clinical translation, and recent attention has turned toward alternative forms of analysis, including Support-Vector-Machine (SVM). A type of machine learning, SVM allows categorisation of an individual's previously unseen data into a predefined group using a classification algorithm, developed on a training data set. In recent years, SVM has been successfully applied in the context of disease diagnosis, transition prediction and treatment prognosis, using both structural and functional neuroimaging data. Here we provide a brief overview of the method and review those studies that applied it to the investigation of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, presymptomatic Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and autistic spectrum disorder. We conclude by discussing the main theoretical and practical challenges associated with the implementation of this method into the clinic and possible future directions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Risks were categorized into: Work characteristics (n = 11), personal characteristics (n = 5), and psychosocial factors (n = 5). Spinal MSD risk factors include exposure to working in tree crops, vibration, postural load, being an owner operator, age, education beyond high school, suffering from asthma or depression, having < 8 hr nightly sleep, bad quality sleep, and geographic location. Upper extremity MSD risk factors include being an owner operator, dust with pig workers, numbness and coldness in younger milkers and numbness in milkers > 43 years, age, and body height in dairy farmers. Lower extremity MSD risk factors include, duration of farming >= 10 years, working > 5 hr daily in animal barns, milking > 40 cows, years as a dairy farmer, farm work, age, body mass, and female gender. Conclusions In exploring risk factors the spine was the most researched body region, followed by lower and upper extremity. Given the variance between studies, it is recommended that future studies focus on specific types of farmers and should explore specific exposures for specific body parts using standardized case definitions.

AB  - Objective: Suicide has been related to affective disorders. We hypothesized that suicide could be associated with cognitive inhibition deficit. Our study aimed to systematically review all published articles that examined the relation between cognitive inhibition deficit and suicidal behaviours (that is, suicide attempt or suicidal ideation) in patients with affective disorders.
   Method: We performed an English and French MEDLINE and EMBASE search, ranging from 1970 to 2010, indexed under the MeSH terms of suicide, neuropsychology, neuropsychological tests, and executive function, combined with the following title and abstract terms: neuropsychological functions, executive functioning, and executive performance.
   Results: Among the 164 selected studies, 9 observational studies met the selection criteria and were included in the final analysis. The number of participants ranged from 57 to 244 (28% to 66%, respectively, were men). Executive dysfunction was more frequently found among patients with suicidal behaviours. In particular, higher cognitive inhibition deficit was observed in depressed subjects with suicide behaviours, compared with depressed subjects without any suicidal behaviour. The results of the meta-analysis showed a higher impairment in inhibition score, according to the number of perseverations in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Cohen d = 0.68) than in inhibition according to the time needed to perform the Trail-Making Test part B (d = 0.01) among patients with suicidal behaviour, compared with patients with no suicidal behaviour..
   Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed a positive association between cognitive inhibition deficit and suicide attempts in patients with affective disorders. Future research should examine whether cognitive inhibition deficit precedes the suicidal behaviour.

AB  - We make a thermal analysis of the light scalar susceptibilities using SU(3)-chiral perturbation theory to one-loop order, taking into account the QCD source of isospin breaking (IB), i.e. corrections coming from m(u) not equal m(d). The value of the connected scalar susceptibility in the infrared regime, the one relevant when approaching chiral symmetry restoration, and below the critical temperature is found to be entirely dominated by the pi(0)-eta mixing, which leads to model-independent O(epsilon(0)) corrections, where epsilon similar to m(d) - m(u), in the combination chi(uu) - chi(ud) of flavour breaking susceptibilities. We also present preliminary results for the corrections to the real part of the pion self-energy at next-to-leading order in SU(2)chiral perturbation theory, taking into account electromagnetic interaction. The results for zero and finite temperature for the charged and neutral pions are given in terms of the 3-momentum of the external pion, and their difference is calculated to this order, stressing the fact that, at low and moderate temperature, the mass splitting M-pi +/- - M-pi 0 grows with temperature for, at least, non-zero charged pion mass running inside the loops.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely used group of antidepressants (ADS) with reported potential detrimental effects on bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. Here, a comprehensive review of the in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies to date was carried out using the medical search engines MEDLINE (1950 to September 2010) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2010). Serotonin (5-HT) receptors have been identified on osteoclast, osteoblast and osteocyte cell lines. The effect of SSRIs on bone formation and resorption appears to be governed by the activation of a number of 5-HT receptors on osteoblasts and osteoclasts via endocrine, autocrine/paracrine and neuronal pathways. In vitro, in vivo and clinical collective data appears to indicate that SSRIs have a negative effect on bone at the therapeutic dose levels widely used for the treatment of depression in current clinical practice. Caution may therefore have to be employed with the use of SSRIs in patients at an increased risk of falls and osteoporosis. Further studies are needed in order to fully elicit the role of SSRIs in bone formation and their effects in the low oestrogen state. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional addiction studies have focused specifically on the use of chemical substances, while more recent studies have begun to focus on behavioral processes. Process addiction is an addiction to a natural and in many cases essential behavior such as eating and sex. Acquired continued and compulsive overeating is one process addiction similar to other activities or behaviors, such as excessive video gaming, pathological gambling, hyper-sexuality or excessive internet use where the addict shows loss of control, an inability to stop or modify the activity, and a range of signs and symptoms that can be as debilitating as those associated with substance abuse or addiction. Individuals with process addiction would meet criteria for addiction if their substance of abuse was considered a drug. They present characteristics like other addicts, have a chronic and relapsing course and often the addiction leaves them with loss of health, happiness and a difficulty treating the disease. Gambling has been the least contentious process addiction and will appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Food and sex have been the most difficult for the field to consider as addictions. However, food may have the clearest, long-standing scientific research behind it. In this review, we provide a summary of the literature on process (behavior) addictions and a discussion of food addiction, as well as pathological gambling and internet addiction disorder.

AB  - Experience and environment can critically influence the risk and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as miRNA expression, DNA methylation, and histone modifications, readily respond to experience and environmental factors. Here we propose that epigenetic regulation of gene expression and environmental modulation thereof may play a key role in the onset and course of common neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. For example, epigenetic mechanisms may mediate long-term responses to adverse experience, such as stress, to affect disease susceptibility and the course of neurodegenerative events. This review introduces the epigenetic components and their possible role in mediating neuropathological processes in response to stress. We argue that epigenetic modifications will affect neurodegenerative events through altered gene function. The study of epigenetic states in neurodegenerative diseases presents an opportunity to gain new insights into risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms. Moreover, research into epigenetic regulation of disease may revolutionize health care by opening new avenues of personalized, preventive and curative medicine. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the study explores what characterizes an optimal RTW intervention and points to possible ways to improve future interventions for employees with CMD.
   Methods A systematic literature search was conducted, and eight qualitative studies of medium or high quality published between 1995-2011 were included in this systematic review. The eight studies were synthesized using the meta-ethnographic method.
   Results This meta-synthesis found that employees with CM D identify a number of obstacles to and facilitators of returning to work related to their own personality, social support at the workplace, and the social and rehabilitation systems. The employees found it difficult to decide when they were ready to resume work and experienced difficulties implementing RTW solutions at the workplace.
   Conclusions This study reveals that the RTW process should be seen as a continuous and coherent one where experiences of the past and present and anticipation of the future are dynamically interrelated and affect the success or failure of RTW. The meta-synthesis also illuminates insufficient coordination between the social and rehabilitation systems and suggests how an optimal RTW intervention could be designed.

AB  - A compelling association has been observed between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression, suggesting individuals with depression to be at significantly higher risk for CVD and CVD-related mortality. Systemic immune activation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction have been frequently implicated in this relationship. Although a differential epidemiological association between CVD and depression subtypes is evident, it has not been determined if this indicates subtype specific biological mechanisms. A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed and PsycINFO databases yielding 147 articles for this review. A complex pattern of systemic immune activation, endothelial dysfunction and HPA axis hyperactivity is suggestive of the biological relationship between CVD and depression subtypes. The findings of this review suggest that diagnostic subtypes rather than a unifying model of depression should be considered when investigating the bidirectional biological relationship between CVD and depression. The suggested model of a subtype-specific biological relationship between depression and CVDs has implications for future research and possibly for diagnostic and therapeutic processes.

AB  - Despite considerable progress in ecotoxicology, it has become clear that this discipline cannot answer its central questions, such as, "What are the effects of toxicants on biodiversity?" and "How the ecosystem functions and services are affected by the toxicants?". We argue that if such questions are to be answered, a paradigm shift is needed. The current bottom-up approach of ecotoxicology that implies the use of small-scale experiments to predict effects on the entire ecosystems and landscapes should be merged with a top-down macroecological approach that is directly focused on ecological effects at large spatial scales and consider ecological systems as integral entities. Analysis of the existing methods in ecotoxicology, ecology, and environmental chemistry shows that such integration is currently possible. Therefore, we conclude that to tackle the current pressing challenges, ecotoxicology has to progress using both the bottom-up and top-down approaches, similar to digging a tunnel from both ends at once.

AB  - Background: Structural language anomalies or impairments in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) are theoretically and practically important, although underrecognised as such. This review aims to highlight the ubiquitousness of structural language anomalies and impairments in ASD, and to stimulate investigation of their immediate causes and implications for intervention. Method: Studies of structural language in ASD are reviewed (based on a search of the literature and selected as meeting defined inclusion criteria), and explanatory hypotheses are discussed. Results: Some individuals with ASD never acquire language. Amongst those who do, language abilities range from clinically normal (ALN) to various degrees of impairment (ALI). Developmental trajectories and individual profiles are diverse, and minority subgroups have been identified. Specifically: language is commonly but not always delayed and delayed early language is always characterised by impaired comprehension and odd utterances, and sometimes by deviant articulation and grammar. Nevertheless, by school age an ` ASD- typical' language profile emerges from group studies, with articulation and syntax least affected, and comprehension, semantics and certain facets of morphology most affected. Thus, even individuals with ALN have poor comprehension relative to expressive language; also semantic- processing anomalies and idiosyncratic word usage. It is argued that impaired socio- emotional- communicative relating, atypical sensory- perceptual processing, and uneven memory/learning abilities may underlie shared language anomalies across the spectrum; and that varying combinations of low nonverbal intelligence, semantic memory impairment and comorbidities including specific language impairment (SLI), hearing impairment, and certain medical syndromes underlie ALI and variation in individual profiles. Conclusions: Structural language is universally affected in ASD, due to a complex of shared and unshared causal factors. There is an urgent need for more research especially into the characteristics and causes of clinically significant language impairments.

AB  - Objective: This article aims to review the clinical features and therapeutic characteristics that may predict treatment response in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Methods: A systematic review of trials identified through databases of ISI, Medline, PsycInfo, Cochrane, LILACS, Current Controlled Trials, and in references of previously selected articles published in English up to December 2010. In our literature search, we used the words prediction/predictors and social anxiety disorder or social phobia. Results: Early onset, greater disease severity, comorbidity with other anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety disorder and simple phobia), and high expectations about the role of the therapist emerged as potential predictors of less effective treatment in SAD. Conclusions: Knowledge of various clinical and treatment features may help professionals to predict possible responses to therapeutic interventions in patients with SAD. However, given the diversity of measures used to assess response, further studies should be performed with standardized methods to investigate the aspects related to treatment resistance in SAD.

AB  - Suicide in later life is a global public health problem. The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic analysis of studies with comparison groups that examined the associations between social factors and suicidal behavior (including ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, or deaths) among individuals aged 65 and older. Our search identified only 16 articles (across 14 independent samples) that met inclusion criteria. The limited number of studies points to the need for further research. Included studies were conducted in Canada (n = 2), Germany (n = 1), Hong Kong (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), Singapore (n = 1), Sweden (n = 2), Taiwan (n = 1), the U. K. (n = 2), and the U.S. (n = 3). The majority of the social factors examined in this review can be conceptualized as indices of positive social connectedness-the degree of positive involvement with family, friends, and social groups. Findings indicated that at least in industrialized countries, limited social connectedness is associated with suicidal ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, and suicide in later life. Primary prevention programs designed to enhance social connections as well as a sense of community could potentially decrease suicide risk, especially among men.

   Behavioral medicine is a vast field with an ever-increasing knowledge base. We review important findings over the last 18 months.
   Recent findings
   We organized advances in behavioral medicine into four main topic areas: the doctor and patient, health-related behavior, integration of behavioral medicine in primary care, and teaching and assessing behavioral medicine competencies in primary care. Section I reviews research on difficult encounters, delivering bad and sad news, and physician well being. Section II examines improvements in the treatment of obesity and tobacco abuse, as well as interventions which boost adherence. Section III discusses advancements in care management and collaborative care in the USA and resource-constrained settings. Finally, section IV deals with teaching and assessing communication skills, behavior change, and professionalism.
   Summary
   Physician skills such as communication, professionalism, behavior change, and self-care are not innate abilities, but teachable and learnable skills. Collaborative care and the integration of behavioral medicine with care for other conditions can benefit patients, and can be done effectively with case management and telemonitoring strategies. Future behavioral medicine research should include evaluation of implementation strategies so that we may incorporate principles of behavioral medicine more widely into clinical practice.

AB  - Objectives. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic, often severe, neuropsychiatric disorder leading to a dramatic impairment in interpersonal and occupational functions. rTMS has been tried out in several studies in patients with OCD with different characteristics. In this paper, we review the safety and efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of mostly severe resistant OCD. Methods. A review of the English literature from 1966 to 2010 pertaining to rTMS in the treatment of OCD was conducted using MEDLINE by selectively entering the search terms "transcranial magnetic stimulation", "repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation", "obsessive-compulsive disorder" and "OCD". Twelve studies including open and randomized, sham-controlled trials were included in this review. Results. Although available data about the use of rTMS in OCD treatment are quite heterogeneous in terms of sample size, study design, stimulus parameters used and stimulation areas targeted, promising findings regarding rTMS efficacy appeared for two structures based on recent controlled studies: the supplementary motor area and the orbitofrontal cortex. On the other hand, rTMS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is not significantly effective when compared to sham rTMS. Conclusions. Three target areas have already been selected of which the supplementary motor area in particular and the orbitofrontal cortex seem to be the most promising in terms of potential efficacy and could more accurately be targeted with the help of neuronavigational techniques. Larger randomized controlled trials should be conducted in order to better clarify the therapeutic role of rTMS in OCD.

AB  - The functional MRI (fMRI) community has zealously embraced resting state or intrinsic functional connectivity approaches to mapping brain organization. Having demonstrated their utility for charting the large-scale functional architecture of the brain, the field is now leveraging task-independent methods for the investigation of phenotypic variation and the identification of biomarkers for clinical conditions. Enthusiasm aside, questions regarding the significance and validity of intrinsic brain phenomena remain. Here, we discuss these challenges and outline current developments that, in moving the field toward discovery science, permit a shift from cartography toward a mechanistic understanding of the neural bases of variation in cognition, emotion and behavior.

AB  - Objective: Specific phobia (SP) is characterized by irrational fear associated with avoidance of specific stimuli. In recent years, neuroimaging techniques have been used in an attempt to better understand the neurobiology of anxiety disorders. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of articles that used neuroimaging techniques to study SP. Method: A literature search was conducted through electronic databases, using the keywords: imaging, neuroimaging, PET, spectroscopy, functional magnetic resonance, structural magnetic resonance, SPECT, MRI, DTI, and tractography, combined with simple phobia and specific phobia. One-hundred fifteen articles were found, of which 38 were selected for the present review. From these, 24 used fMRI, 11 used PET, 1 used SPECT, 2 used structural MRI, and none used spectroscopy. Result: The search showed that studies in this area were published recently and that the neuroanatomic substrate of SP has not yet been consolidated. Conclusion: In spite of methodological differences among studies, results converge to a greater activation in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex of patients exposed to phobia-related situations compared to controls. These findings support the hypotheses of the hyperactivation of a neuroanatomic structural network involved in SP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Editora Ltda. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives. We systematically reviewed the literature on the impact of returning to work on health among working-aged adults.
   Methods. We searched 6 electronic databases in 2005. We selected longitudinal studies that documented a transition from unemployment to employment and included a comparison group. Two reviewers independently appraised the retrieved literature for potential relevance and methodological quality.
   Results. Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria, including 1 randomized controlled trial. Fifteen studies revealed a beneficial effect of returning to work on health, either demonstrating a significant improvement in health after reemployment or a significant decline in health attributed to continued unemployment. We also found evidence for health selection, suggesting that poor health interferes with people's ability to go back to work. Some evidence suggested that earlier reemployment may be associated with better health.
   Conclusions. Beneficial health effects of returning to work have been documented in a variety of populations, times, and settings. Return-to-work programs may improve not only financial situations but also health. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:541-556. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300401)

AB  - Mitigating the situational factors that give rise to state boredom is a consistent challenge facing educators. Despite the growing amount of literature devoted to the construct, the field has yet to arrive at a consensus regarding a clear theoretical or operational definition. Subsequently, inconsistencies exist in the assessment methodologies, research findings lack generalizability, and strategies for mitigation in educational settings remain elusive. In this cross-disciplinary analysis, the extant literature on state boredom is critically reviewed and synthesized, and a two-dimensional definition of state boredom as an unpleasant (subjective), low-arousal (objective) experience is proposed. Findings from the technological advances of the last decade that allow for the objective measurement of physiological states are used to inform recommendations for empirically sound assessment methodologies. Finally, the proposed definition of state boredom and related assessment strategies are discussed with respect to implications for enhancing educational practices.

AB  - Resilience research has usually focused on identifying protective factors associated with specific stress conditions (e.g., war, trauma) or psychopathologies (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]). Implicit in this research is the concept that resilience is a global construct, invariant to the unfavorable circumstances or the psychopathologies that may develop (i.e., the mechanisms underlying the resilience of an individual in all cases are expected to be similar). Here we contribute to the understanding of resilience-and its counterpart, vulnerability-by employing an approach that makes use of this invariant quality. We outline two main characteristics that we would expect from indicators of a vulnerable state: that they should appear across disorders regardless of specific circumstances, and that they should appear much before the disorder is evident. Next, we identify two sets of factors that exhibit this pattern of association with psychopathological states. The first was a set of "low-level" sensory, motor and regulatory irregularities that have been reported across the clinical literature; we suggest that these can serve as behavioral indicators of a vulnerable state. The second was the set of aberrations in network metrics that have been reported in the field of systems neuroscience; we suggest that these can serve as network indicators of a vulnerable state. Finally, we explore how behavioral indicators may be related to network indicators and discuss the clinical and research related implications of our work.

AB  - The two autosomal dominantly inherited neurological diseases: familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2) and familial rapid-onset of dystonia-parkinsonism (Familial RDP) are caused by in vivo mutations of specific alpha subunits of the sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase). Intriguingly, patients with classical FHM2 and RDP symptoms additionally suffer from other manifestations, such as epilepsy/seizures and developmental disabilities. Recent studies of FHM2 and RDP mouse models provide valuable tools for dissecting the vital roles of the Na+/K+-ATPases, and we discuss their relevance to the complex patient symptoms and manifestations. Thus, it is interesting that mouse models targeting a specific alpha-isoform cause different, although still comparable, phenotypes consistent with classical symptoms and other manifestations observed in FHM2 and RDP patients. This review highlights that use of mouse models have broad potentials for future research concerning migraine and dystonia-related diseases, which will contribute towards understanding the, yet unknown, pathophysiologies.

AB  - Objective: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and suicidal behaviour are common conditions with significant social and emotional morbidity. Although completed suicide in ADHD has been assessed in a previous meta- analysis, other domains of suicidal behaviour such as attempts and ideation have been documented only in individual studies. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the relationship between attention- deficit and suicidality.
   Method: Electronic and manual literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCHINFO, using a range of search terms around suicidality, attention- deficit and hyperactivity.
   Results: Twenty five papers were identified describing a relationship between ADHD and suicide. ADHD occurred more frequently in suicidal groups than controls, with most differences being statistically significant. The direction of results was consistent, with only one sample showing equivocal findings and one showing a reverse pattern. Attempts and ideation were more common in prediagnosed ADHD samples than controls. Three studies showed significant results only for men. Comorbidity had a large influence including delinquency and substance misuse.
   Conclusion: There is a positive relationship between ADHD and risk to self. More focussed research needs to take place on younger populations and those without comorbidity. This review highlights the importance of thorough risk assessment in the attention- deficit population.

AB  - Background
   The efficacy of psychopharmacological treatments has been called into question. Psychiatrists are unfamiliar with the effectiveness of common medical drugs.
   Aims
   To put the efficacy of psychiatric drugs into the perspective of that of major medical drugs.
   Method
   We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library for systematic reviews on the efficacy of drugs compared with placebo for common medical and psychiatric disorders, and systematically presented the effect sizes for primary efficacy outcomes.
   Results
   We included 94 meta-analyses (48 drugs in 20 medical diseases, 16 drugs in 8 psychiatric disorders). There were some general medical drugs with clearly higher effect sizes than the psychotropic agents, but the psychiatric drugs were not generally less efficacious than other drugs.
   Conclusions
   Any comparison of different outcomes in different diseases can only serve the purpose of a qualitative perspective. The increment of improvement by drug over placebo must be viewed in the context of the disease's seriousness, suffering induced, natural course, duration, outcomes, adverse events and societal values.

AB  - For individuals with autism spectrum disorder or 'ASD' the ability to accurately process and interpret auditory information is often difficult. Here we review behavioural, neurophysiological and imaging literature pertaining to this field with the aim of providing a comprehensive account of auditory processing in ASD, and thus an effective tool to aid further research. Literature was sourced from peer-reviewed journals published over the last two decades which best represent research conducted in these areas. Findings show substantial evidence for atypical processing of auditory information in ASD at behavioural and neural levels. Abnormalities are diverse, ranging from atypical perception of various low-level perceptual features (i.e. pitch, loudness) to processing of more complex auditory information such as prosody. Trends across studies suggest auditory processing impairments in ASD are most likely to present during processing of complex auditory information and are more severe for speech than for non-speech stimuli. The interpretation of these findings with respect to various cognitive accounts of ASD is discussed and suggestions offered for further research. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Formally, incompetence implies that a patient cannot meet the legal requirements for informed consent. Our aim was to review the scientific literature on the relationship between competence and insight in patients with psychiatric disorders, how competence and insight are connected in these patients and whether there are differences in competence and insight among patients with different disorders.
   Method: A search in PubMed/Medline was performed. Articles were assessed on relevance criteria by two independent reviewers. Study design, population, variables, and outcomes were extracted.
   Results: Seven articles were included on studies of psychiatric inpatients and outpatients and of psychotic and non-psychotic patients. All studies used the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool (MacCAT). All studies but one found a strong correlation between poor insight and incompetence. Psychotic patients with poor insight are very likely to be incompetent, and psychotic patients with adequate insight are generally competent. One well-executed study showed that in non-psychotic disorders, however, another relationship emerges; competence and insight do not completely overlap in these patients.
   Conclusion: Most incompetent psychotic patients have poor insight, but non-psychotic patients with adequate insight were incompetent in a substantial number of cases. In sum: non-psychotic patients with adequate insight can be incompetent.

AB  - Objectives. Despite the fact that many studies have addressed the use of ECT in schizophrenia questions on clinical use remain poorly answered and clinical application is largely based on data originating from depressed patients. Methods. We review data on the use of ECT in schizophrenic patients drawn from original studies indicated by a Pubmed search and referenced in recent and older expert reviews with a specific focus on four issues: symptom response, technical application, continuation/maintenance ECT and combination with medication. Results. Catatonic patients are the most responsive. Positive symptoms such paranoid delusions and affective symptoms follow. There are indications that ECT may improve responsivity to medication. No particular technical features stand out in studies except lengthier courses, but not for catatonia. Combination with medication appears to be preferable over either treatment alone and effective combination particularly with clozapine is supported by data. Use of continuation and maintenance treatments in responders appears beneficial. Conclusion. Certain schizophrenic patients may benefit significantly from the use of ECT. More specific research is required to address particular questions.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons of the nigrostriatal system and by the presence of Lewy bodies (LB), proteinaceous inclusions mainly composed of filamentous alpha-synuclein aggregates. Alpha-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein which plays a central role in the control of dopaminergic neuronal functions and which is thought to be critically implicated in PD pathophysiology. Indeed, besides the fact that alpha-synuclein is the main protein component of LB, genetic studies showed that mutations and multiplications of the alpha-synuclein gene are responsible for the onset of familial forms of PD. A large body of evidence indicates that alpha-synuclein pathology at dopaminergic synapses may underlie the onset of neuronal cell dysfunction and degeneration in the PD brain. Thus, since the available therapeutic approaches to cure this disease are still limited, we hypothesized that the analysis of the alpha-synudein synaptic proteome/lipidome may represent a tool to identify novel potential therapeutic targets to cure this disorder. We thus performed a critical review of studies describing alpha-synuclein pathophysiology at synaptic sites in experimental models of PD and in this paper we outline the most relevant findings regarding the specific modulatory effects exerted by alpha-synuclein in the control of synaptic functions in physiological and pathological conditions. The conclusions of these studies allow to single out novel potential therapeutic targets among the alpha-synuclein synaptic partners. These targets may be considered for the development of new pharmacological and gene-based strategies to cure PD. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Love, attachment, and truth of human monogamy have become important research themes in neuroscience. After the introduction of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), neuroscientists have demonstrated increased interest in the neurobiology and neurochemistry of emotions, including love and affection. Neurobiologists have studied pair-bonding mechanisms in animal models of mate choice to elucidate neurochemical mechanisms underlying attachment and showed possible roles for oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine and their receptors in pair-bonding and monogamy. Unresolved is whether these substances are also critically involved in human attachment. The limited number of available imaging studies on love and affection is hampered by selection bias on gender, duration of a love affair, and cultural differences. Brain activity patterns associated with romantic love, shown with fMRI, overlapped with regions expressing oxytocin receptors in the animal models, but definite proof for a role of oxytocin in human attachment is still lacking. There is also evidence for a role of serotonin, cortisol, nerve growth factor, and testosterone in love and attachment. Changes in brain activity related to the various stages of a love affair, gender, and cultural differences are unresolved and will probably become important research themes in this field in the near future. In this review we give a resume of the current knowledge of the neurobiology of love and attachment and we discuss in brief the truth of human monogamy. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The last 40 years have witnessed a growing interest in the mechanisms underlying the visual identification of complex words. A large amount of experimental data has been amassed, but although a growing number of studies are proposing explicit theoretical models for their data, no comprehensive theory has gained substantial agreement among scholars in the field. We believe that this is due, at least in part, to the presence of several controversial pieces of evidence in the literature and, consequently, to the lack of a well-defined set of experimental facts that any theory should be able to explain. With this review, we aim to delineate the state of the art in the research on the visual identification of complex words. By reviewing major empirical evidences in a number of different paradigms such as lexical decision, word naming, and masked and unmasked priming, we were able to identify a series of effects that we judge as reliable or that were consistently replicated in different experiments, along with some more controversial data, which we have tried to resolve and explain. We concentrated on behavioral and electrophysiological studies on inflected, derived, and compound words, so as to span over all types of complex words. The outcome of this work is an analytical summary of well-established facts on the most relevant morphological issues, such as regularity, morpheme position coding, family size, semantic transparency, morpheme frequency, suffix allomorphy, and productivity, morphological entropy, and morpho-orthographic parsing. In discussing this set of benchmark effects, we have drawn some methodological considerations on why contrasting evidence might have emerged, and have tried to delineate a target list for the construction of a new all-inclusive model of the visual identification of morphologically complex words.

AB  - The universal failure of pharmacologic interventions against Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears largely due to their inability to get into neurons and the fact that most have a single mechanism-of-action. Anon-invasive, neuromodulatory approach against AD has consequently emerged: transcranial electromagnetic treatment (TEMT). In AD transgenic mice, long-term TEMT prevents and reverses both cognitive impairment and brain amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition, while TEMT even improves cognitive performance in normal mice. Three disease-modifying and inter-related mechanisms of TEMT action have been identified in the brain: 1) anti-A beta aggregation, both intraneuronally and extracellularly; 2) mitochondrial enhancement; and 3) increased neuronal activity. Long-term TEMT appears safe in that it does not impact brain temperature or oxidative stress levels, nor does it induce any abnormal histologic/anatomic changes in the brain or peripheral tissues. Future TEMT development in both AD mice and normal mice should involve head-only treatment to discover the most efficacious set of parameters for achieving faster and even greater cognitive benefit. Given the already extensive animal work completed, translational development of TEMT could occur relatively quickly to "proof of concept" AD clinical trials. TEMT's mechanisms of action provide extraordinary therapeutic potential against other neurologic disorders/injuries, such as Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and stroke.

AB  - Objective: Computer-assisted personal interviewing has been developed to help health care providers in gathering and processing information from the patients for diagnosis, treatment and intervention. Psychiatric service providers and patients, however, doubt this instrument in terms of the preciseness and reliability of the instruments because generally, psychiatric interviews rest on the interviewers' skills to create trust between patients and providers in order to go in-depth on sensitive issues. In this review, the existing literatures on the issue of reliability and precision of psychiatric computer interviews on patients' sensitive issues will be evaluated based on my work and experience in psychiatric care. Methods: Literature search on psychiatric computer interviews, which include patients and mental health professionals' attitude, which may include sensitive issue was conducted. Results: Patients prefer computer interviews rather than human interviews for revealing their sensitive issues while mental health professionals value human interviews and judgment more than computers. Computers have limitations in understanding human natural language, human interaction and non-verbal communication. Conclusion: It is recommended that the use of psychiatric computer interviews should be used under supervision of mental health professionals.

AB  - Purpose A systematic review was carried out to assess evidence for the association between different models of stress at work, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
   Methods A literature search was conducted using five databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PSYNDEX and PsycINFO). Inclusion criteria for studies were the following: self-reported stress for individual workplaces, prospective study design and incident disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, angina pectoris, high blood pressure). Evaluation, according to the criteria of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, was done by two readers. In case of disagreement, a third reader was involved. Results Twenty-six publications were included, describing 40 analyses out of 20 cohorts. The risk estimates for work stress were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of cardiovascular disease in 13 out of the 20 cohorts. Associations were significant for 7 out of 13 cohorts applying the demand-control model, all three cohorts using the effort-reward model and 3 out of 6 cohorts investigating other models. Most significant results came from analyses considering only men.
   Results for the association between job stress and cardiovascular diseases in women were not clear. Associations were weaker in participants above the age of 55.
   Conclusions In accordance with other systematic reviews, this review stresses the importance of psychosocial factors at work in the aetiology of cardiovascular diseases. Besides individual measures to manage stress and to cope with demanding work situations, organisational changes at the workplace need to be considered to find options to reduce occupational risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.

   Method: The literature between 2000 and 2009 was searched for randomized controlled trials which compared a psychosocial intervention with another intervention or with treatment as usual in patients with schizophrenia.
   Results: Fifteen studies were identified, with a large heterogeneity in design, adherence measures and outcome variables. Interventions that offered more sessions during a longer period of time, and especially those with a continuous focus on adherence, seem most likely to be successful, as well as pragmatic interventions that focus on attention and memory problems. The positive effects of adapted forms of Motivational Interviewing found in earlier studies, such as compliance therapy, have not been confirmed.
   Conclusion: Nonadherence remains a challenging problem in schizophrenia. The heterogeneity of factors related to nonadherence calls for individually tailored approaches to promote adherence. More evidence is required to determine the effects of specific interventions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Improving functional outcome, in addition to alleviating psychotic symptoms, is now a major treatment objective in schizophrenia research. Given the large body of evidence suggesting pharmacological treatments generally have minimal effects on indices of functioning, research has turned to psychosocial rehabilitation programs. Among these, neurocognitive and social cognitive interventions are at the forefront of this field and are argued to target core deficits inherent to the schizophrenia illness. However, to date, research trials have primarily focused on chronic schizophrenia populations, neglecting the early psychosis groups who are often as severely impaired in social and occupational functioning. This theoretical paper will outline the rationale for investigating adjunctive cognitive-based interventions in the early phases of psychotic illness, critically examine the current approach strategies used in these interventions, and assess the evidence supporting certain training programs for improving functional outcome in early psychosis. Potential pathways for future research will be discussed.

AB  - Objectives
   This review has the aim of improving early recognition and effective treatment of catatonia, critically going through its historical descriptions and revisiting its nosographical collocation in current classification systems.
   Methods
   A PubMed search was done using the keywords "catatonia", "catatonic schizophrenia", "stupor", "catalepsy" and "catatonia treatment" (until 2011).
   Results
   In 1874, Kahlbaum first described catatonia as a disease of its own, characterized by specific disturbances in motor and behavioural functioning; in contrast, Emil Kraepelin classified catatonic features as a clinical expression of dementia praecox, with a chronic course and poor prognosis. Catatonia occurs in children, adolescents and adults, and develops in association with a wide variety of psychiatric, neurologic and general medical conditions. The neurobiological pathways of catatonia are still unclear. In particular the role of GABA and other neurotrasmitters has been explored, but not completely defined. Nosological and diagnostic definition of disorder are still argued by clinicians and researchers. Although the main psychiatric classifications continue to sustain Krapelin's view of catatonia as a clinical subtype of schizophrenia, in a clinical setting, catatonic symptoms are more commonly observed in patients with mood disorders and general medical conditions. Symptomatology is characterized by a wide array of manifestations: negativism, mutacism and stupor represent the most common symptoms. The lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria often complicates recognition of catatonic symptoms. The issue in diagnostic assessment is to differentiate catatonia from other overlapping psychomotor disorders and to identify the underlying psychiatric and general medical disorders. Early and correct diagnosis is crucial to start effective treatments and avoid potentially severe (sometimes lethal) somatic complications. Benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy are the therapeutic mainstay for catatonia. Intravenous administration of BDZ is first-line treatment, where ECT is commonly used in non-responders to BDZ, malignant catatonia and malignant neuroleptic syndrome. Nonetheless, many authors suggest that ECT, preferably in combination with BDZ, should be considered in the early course of all types of catatonia to improve prognosis and avoid complications.
   Conclusions
   Further research should better define the neurobiological basis and improve clinical and nosographical collocation of catatonia; evidence-based therapeutic protocols are needed that would allow adequate and early treatment to prevent somatic complications of catatonia.

AB  - Objective. - Studies investigating indicators of recovery from schizophrenia yielded two concepts of recovery. The first is the reduction of psychiatric symptoms and functional disabilities ('clinical recovery'), while the second describes the individual adaptation process to the threat posed to the individual sense of self by the disorder and its negative consequences ('personal recovery'). Evidence suggests that both perceptions contribute substantially to the understanding of recovery and require specific assessment and therapy. While current reviews of measures of clinical recovery exist, measures of personal recovery have yet to be investigated. Considering the steadily growing literature on recovery, this article gives an update about existing measures assessing personal recovery.
   Method. - A literature search for instruments was performed using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO&P-SYNDEXPlus, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were: (1) quantitative self-report measures; (2) specifically developed for adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or at least applied to individuals suffering from severe mental illness; (3) empirically tested psychometric properties and/or published in a peer-reviewed, English-language journal. Instruments were evaluated with regard to psychometric properties (validity and reliability) and issues of application (user and administrator friendliness, translations).
   Results. - Thirteen instruments met the inclusion criteria. They were individually described and finally summarized in a table reflecting the pros and cons of each instrument. This may enable the reader to make an evidence-based choice for a questionnaire for a specific application.
   Conclusion. - The Recovery Assessment Scale is possibly the best currently available measure of personal recovery when all evaluation criteria are included. However, the ratings listed in the current paper depended on the availability of information and the quality of available reports of previous assessment of the measurement properties. Considering the significant amount of information lacking and inconsistent findings, further research on the reviewed measures is perhaps more important than the development of new measures of personal recovery.

AB  - The amygdala (AMG) has long been viewed as the gateway to sensory processing of emotions and is also known to play an important role at the interface between cognition and emotion. However, the debate continues on whether AMG activation is independent of attentional demands. Recently, researchers started exploring AMG functions using dynamic stimuli rather than the traditional pictures of facial expressions. Our present goal is to review some recent studies using dynamic stimuli to investigate AMG activation and discuss the impact of different viewing conditions, including oddball detection, explicit or implicit recognition, variable cognitive task load, and non-conscious perception. In the second part, we sketch a dynamic dual route perspective of affective perception and discuss the implications for AMG activity. We sketch a dynamic dual route perspective of affective perception. We argue that this allows for multiple AMG involvement in separate networks and at different times in the processing streams. Attention has a different impact on these separate but interacting networks. Route I is engaged in early emotion processing, is partly supported by AMG activity, and is possibly independent of attention, whereas activity related to late emotion processing is influenced by attention. Route II is a cortical-based network that underlies body recognition and action representation. The end result of route I and II is reflexive and voluntary behavior, respectively. We conclude that using dynamic emotion stimuli and a dynamic dual route model of affective perception can provide new insights into the varieties of AMG activation.

AB  - Studies on visually deprived individuals provide one of the most striking demonstrations that the brain is highly plastic and is able to rewire as a function of the sensory input it receives from the environment. In the current paper, we focus on spatial abilities that are typically related to the dorsal visual pathway (i.e., spatial/motion processing). Bringing together evidence from cataract-reversal individuals, early- and late-blind individuals and sight-recovery cases of long-standing blindness, we suggest that the dorsal "spatial" pathway is mostly plastic early in life and is then more resistant to subsequent experience once it is set, highlighting some limits of neuroplasticity.

AB  - Purpose - The subject of occupational safety and health (OSH) is increasingly gaining the interest of policy makers and researchers in European countries given that the economic and social losses from work-related injuries and diseases are quite substantial. Under this light, this paper aims to present an overview of the Greek legislation framework regarding OSH issues, and the current status of empirical research on the subject in Greece. In addition, the paper seeks to identify the knowledge gaps and methodological shortcomings of the existing literature in order to contribute towards future research in the OSH field in Greece.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an extensive literature review of numerous publications, reports and institutions' databases.
   Findings - The results suggest that empirical up to date research in Greece is rather inadequate, mainly because of the absence of econometric methods to validate the findings. The available Greek databases indicate that while the number of working accidents has decreased over time, the severity seems to be increasing. Males are more prone to accidents, diseases and negative working conditions. Work-related stress is an aspect of occupational problems that has been the subject of many Greek studies.
   Research limitations/implications - Although the legal framework is quite adequate, there is a need for both prevention strategies and enforcement of the existing safety regulations. Furthermore, a substantial research gap is observed in Greece. Therefore, more systematic research is needed on the determinants of injuries and on their effects on job participation and productivity.
   Originality/value - The paper presents a detailed review of the current state of research regarding OSH issues in Greece.

   Method: A systematic computerized search was performed in Medline complemented by a manual search of the literature for all studies published between 1981 and 2011. A total of 27 papers in English were reviewed for their methods, instruments used and results.
   Results: Comparisons were not easy due to methodological disparities in assessments. Levels of Expressed Emotion depend concurrently on parental characteristics (parent assessed, social status and psychological distress), patient characteristics (age, social adjustment) and Eating Disorders characteristics (type of Eating Disorders, duration and severity of illness and previous treatment). Expressed Emotion has a predictive value for patient outcome and for compliance with/and implication in treatment. Levels of Expressed Emotions vary with the parent assessed. The cross-cultural aspects of Expressed Emotion in Eating Disorders are not widely documented.
   Discussion: Both positive and negative aspects of Expressed Emotion are important therapeutic targets and further research on this topic is needed.

AB  - The presence of antimony in the human body is the result of exposure from many different sources, as is the case for any chemical element. The use of hair for diagnosing antimony exposure has become very popular because of the uncomplicated sampling and preservation, but the true utility of such studies remains uncertain. This review presents a critical discussion of the existing literature on antimony concentrations in hair, nails, and teeth, with three main objectives: (a) evaluating published data from the methodological point of view, (b) establishing a range of plausible values for antimony concentrations in these tissues, and (c) assessing statistically based correlations reported in case-control studies. From a methodological standpoint, existing data suffer from the lack of adequate certificate reference materials, low concentrations close to the detection limit of most analytical techniques and data acquisition through applying multielement techniques. These limitations are probably the underlying reason for the high dispersion of the published results and do not make it possible to establish a reliable background value for human hair from healthy, unexposed individuals. However, it is possible to estimate a concentration ceiling at 0.1 mu g(-1), with a probable value around 0.05 mu g(-1). Concerning the usefulness of antimony determinations in hair, existing results amply justify its use in occupational studies. On the other hand, the analysis of antimony concentrations in hair as an indicator of human health status does not seem to be based on any scientific evidence. The limited number of studies on human nails and teeth does not allow any conclusions to be drawn.

AB  - Objective: Increasing evidence suggests that one in four sign language interpreters (SLIs) may experience symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) severe enough to modify their activities. This systematic review examined published research on SLIs and the development of MSD pathology, seeking to identify injury pathways to MSDs and work-related factors with the largest impact in targeted MSD-reduction intervention.
   Methods: Embase and Medline electronic databases were searched from their inception until March 2009, finding 23 eligible peer-reviewed papers related to MSD pathology in SLIs, including narrative reviews, intervention studies, and qualitative and quantitative research.
   Results: Three factors were shown to have limited support as increasing the risk for MSD pathology in SLI: increased mechanical exposure, stress, and speaker's pace (a contributor to movement rate). Overall, the published literature was rated medium to low quality, with limited statistical methods and power, often lacking description of how dependent variables were measured, and how risk of biasing or confounding was minimized.
   Conclusions: A conceptual model was developed to integrate the multi-factorial elements of MSD pathology development among SLIs. However, to strengthen development of evidence-based practice and policy-driven initiatives, higher-quality research is warranted to examine MSD pathology amongst SLIs.

AB  - Introduction
   Young adults have the highest smoking rate of any age group in the United States and Canada, and recent data indicate that they often initiate smoking as young adults. The objective of this study was to systematically review peer-reviewed articles on cigarette smoking initiation and effective prevention efforts among young adults.
   Methods
   We searched 5 databases for research articles published in English between 1998 and 2010 on smoking initiation among young adults (aged 18-25) living in the United States or Canada. We extracted the following data from each study selected: the measure of initiation used, age range of initiation, age range of study population, data source, target population, sampling method, and sample size. We summarized the primary findings of each study according to 3 research questions and categories of data (eg, sociodemographic) that emerged during the data extraction process.
   Results
   Of 1,072 identified studies, we found 27 articles that met our search criteria, but several included a larger age range of initiation (eg, 18-30, 18-36) than we initially intended to include. Disparities in young adult smoking initiation existed according to sex, race, and educational attainment. The use of alcohol and illegal drugs was associated with smoking initiation. The risk of smoking initiation among young adults increased under the following circumstances: exposure to smoking, boredom or stress while serving in the military, attending tobacco-sponsored social events while in college, and exposure to social norms and perceptions that encourage smoking. Effective prevention efforts include exposure to counter-marketing, denormalization campaigns, taxation, and the presence of smoke-free policies.
   Conclusion
   Much remains to be learned about young adult smoking initiation, particularly among young adults in the straight-to-work population. Dissimilar measures of smoking initiation limit our knowledge about smoking initiation among young adults. We recommend developing a standardized measure of initiation that indicates progression to regular established smoking.

AB  - Members of the hemoglobin superfamily efficiently catalyze nitric-oxide dioxygenation, and when paired with native electron donors, function as NO dioxygenases (NODs). Indeed, the NOD function has emerged as a more common and ancient function than the well-known role in O-2 transport-storage. Novel hemoglobins possessing a NOD function continue to be discovered in diverse life forms. Unique hemoglobin structures evolved, in part, for catalysis with different electron donors. The mechanism of NOD catalysis by representative single domain hemoglobins and multidomain flavohemoglobin occurs through a multistep mechanism involving O-2 migration to the heme pocket, O-2 binding-reduction, NO migration, radical-radical coupling, O-atom rearrangement, nitrate release, and heme iron re-reduction. Unraveling the physiological functions of multiple NODs with varying expression in organisms and the complexity of NO as both a poison and signaling molecule remain grand challenges for the NO field. NOD knockout organisms and cells expressing recombinant NODs are helping to advance our understanding of NO actions in microbial infection, plant senescence, cancer, mitochondrial function, iron metabolism, and tissue O-2 homeostasis. NOD inhibitors are being pursued for therapeutic applications as antibiotics and antitumor agents. ransgenic NOD-expressing plants, fish, algae, and microbes are being developed for agriculture, aquaculture, and industry.

This paper is a survey of the statistical issues arising in these simulated trials, with particular emphasis on the design of such virtual experiments, stressing similarities and differences with the design of real trials. We discuss the aims and peculiarities of the simulation models used in this context, including a brief mention of metamodels, and different validating techniques. We illustrate each specific issue through one or more studies recently reported in the medical and/or pharmaceutical literature. We end the paper with some challenging questions on the scientific rigour, ethics and effectiveness of simulation in clinical research, and the interesting research problem of how to integrate virtual and physical experiments in a clinical context.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-associated neurodegenerative disorder. Motor symptoms are the cardinal component of PD, but non-motor symptoms, such as dementia, depression, and autonomic dysfunction are being increasingly recognized. Motor symptoms are primarily caused by selective degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine (SNDA) neurons in the midbrain; non-motor symptoms may be referable to well-described pathology at multiple levels of the neuraxis. Development of symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies is dependent on an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PD. Gene expression profiling has been recently employed to assess function on a broad level in the hopes of gaining greater knowledge concerning how individual mechanisms of disease fit together as a whole and to generate novel hypotheses concerning PD pathogenesis, diagnosis, and progression. So far, the majority of studies have been performed on postmortem brain samples from PD patients, but more recently, studies have targeted enriched populations of dopamine neurons and have begun to explore extra-nigral neurons and even peripheral tissues. This review will provide a brief synopsis of gene expression profiling in parkinsonism and its pitfalls to date and propose several potential future directions and uses for the technique. It will focus on the use of microarray experiments to stimulate hypotheses concerning mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD, since the majority of studies thus far have addressed that complicated issue.

AB  - Public policy scholars have stressed the importance and need for comparing since the 1970sincluding comparing different policies, inputs, outputs, and outcomes across institutional settings. Broken down into three categories, this research note highlights recent work in comparative public policy. The first type of research is characterized by its use of the comparative method to answer two primary research questions: How do policies differ across countries, and why do they diverge? To do this, scholars in this category borrow from a myriad of literatures including economics, risk analysis, and cultural theory. The second and third categories of research add to this long-existing stream of scholarly work by using the comparative method to advance our understanding of the policy process. To achieve this, research focusing on the theories of the policy process includes two emerging trends: comparing theories across institutional configurations (how differing institutional arrangements affect policies), and comparing theories to one another (how different theories of the policy process help explain certain issues). By highlighting these recent publications, the goal of this essay is to encourage scholars from all three categories to collaborate and provide a further impetus to the subfield of comparative public policy.

AB  - The second most serious neurodegenerative disease is Parkinson's disease (PD). Over the past several decades, a strong body of evidence suggests that PD can begin years before the hallmark clinical motor symptoms appear. Biomarkers for PD are urgently needed to differentiate between neurodegenerative disorders, screen novel therapeutics, and predict eventual clinical PD before the onset of symptoms. Some clinical evaluations and neuroimaging techniques have been developed in the last several years with some success in this area. Moreover, other strategies have been utilized to identify biochemical and genetic markers associated with PD leading to the examination of PD progression and pathogenesis in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or saliva. Finally, interesting results are surfacing from preliminary studies using known PD-associated genetic mutations to assess potential premotor PD biomarkers. The current review highlights recent advances and underscores areas of potential advancement.

AB  - Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental condition that occurs as a result of a contiguous deletion of similar to 26-28 genes on chromosome 7q11.23. WS is often associated with a distinctive social phenotype characterized by an increased affinity toward processing faces, reduced sensitivity to fear related social stimuli and a reduced ability to form concrete social relationships. Understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie the social phenotype in WS may elucidate genetic and neural factors influencing the typical development of the social brain. In this article, we review available studies investigating the social phenotype of WS throughout development and neuroimaging studies investigating brain structure and function as related to social and emotional functioning in this condition. This review makes an important contribution by highlighting several neuro-behavioral mechanisms that may be a cause or a consequence of atypical social development in WS. In particular, we discuss how distinctive social behaviors in WS may be associated with alterations or delays in the cortical representation of faces, connectivity within the ventral stream, structure and function of the amygdala and how long- and short-range connections develop within the brain. We integrate research on typical brain development and from existing behavioral and neuroimaging research on WS. We conclude with a discussion of how genetic and environmental factors might interact to influence social brain development in WS and how future neuroimaging and behavioral research can further elucidate social brain development in WS. Lastly, we describe how ongoing studies may translate to improved social developmental outcomes for individuals with WS.

AB  - The theory that many serious mental illnesses, in particular psychoses such as schizophrenia, may have a significant hormonal aetiological component is fast gaining popularity and the support of scientific evidence. Oestrogen in particular has been substantially investigated as a potential mediator of brain function in schizophrenia. Epidemiological and life-cycle data point to significant differences in the incidence and course of schizophrenia between men and women suggests a protective role of oestrogen. In vitro and in vivo preclinical research confirms oestradiol's interactions with central neurotransmitter systems implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, while results from randomised controlled trials investigating the antipsychotic potential of oestrogen have been positive. Research into other neuroactive hormones with possible effects on mental state is a rapidly evolving field that may hold new promise. Given that schizophrenia and related psychoses are pervasive and debilitating conditions for which currently available treatments are often only partially effective and entail a high risk of serious side-effects, novel therapeutic strategies are needed. The literature reviewed in this paper suggests that hormones such as oestrogen could be a viable option, and it is hoped that with further research and larger trials, the oestrogen hypothesis can be translated into effective clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose - Leave is an important part of life for both patients and clinicians in secure mental health and learning disability settings. Patients breaching leave conditions (i.e. absconding or failing to return) represent a small percentage of leave episodes; however when incidents occur there can be far reaching negative outcomes for potential victims, the patient and the service. The purpose of this paper is to devise a risk assessment specifically for leave decision making based on the literature available.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using the approach followed in the violence risk assessment field, a literature review was carried out of papers relating to absconding. The results were used to develop the leave/abscond risk assessment (LARA).
   Findings - There are a number of problems with the available literature: there is a dearth of research, definitions for absconding are varied (often including escape) making comparisons difficult and much of the literature focuses on psychiatric acute wards making it difficult to translate into secure environments. Characteristics of absconders vary and are not idiosyncratic enough from which to develop a risk assessment. Socio-environmental factors are perhaps more important and so the LARA was devised around assessment of these.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this paper are clear: a risk assessment tool is proposed that has not been evaluated or validated in any way. The authors feel that the process warrants publication and invite readers to use the tool for clinical and/or research purposes.
   Originality/value - The LARA is proposed as a specific leave-decision-making risk assessment tool for teams working in secure environments.

Due to a lack of suitable sources and detectors, the terahertz frequency range has not been investigated to the same amount as other frequencies. Even though early reports date back to the 1960s, thorough research has only been conducted during the last decade. The aim of this review is to give a summary of all available publications on this topic. A comprehensive literature research was conducted resulting in 37 identified publications. An overview of publication analysis is presented, followed by a detailed description of theoretical investigations. Subsequently all experimental investigations are described, including details on frequency, exposure time, power density, biological system, and outcome of the studies.

KW  - oxidative stress
KW  - neuroprotection
AB  - This review gives a brief insight into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the converging pathogenic processes involved in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitochondria provide cellular energy in the form of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, but as an integral part of this process, superoxides and other reactive oxygen species are also produced. Excessive free radical production contributes to oxidative stress. Cells have evolved to handle such stress via various endogenous anti-oxidant proteins. One such family of proteins is the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), which are anion carriers located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. There are five known homologues (UCP1 to 5), of which UCP4 and 5 are predominantly expressed in neural cells. In a series of previous publications, we have shown how these neuronal UCPs respond to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+; toxic metabolite of MPTP) and dopamine-induced toxicity to alleviate neuronal cell death by preserving ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential, and reducing oxidative stress. We also showed how their expression can be influenced by nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway specifically in UCP4. Furthermore, we previously reported an interesting link between PD and metabolic processes through the protective effects of leptin (hormone produced by adipocytes) acting via UCP2 against MPP+ induced toxicity. There is increasing evidence that these endogenous neuronal UCPs can play a vital role to protect neurons against various pathogenic stresses including those associated with PD. Their expression, which can be induced, may well be a potential therapeutic target for various drugs to alleviate the harmful effects of pathogenic processes in PD and hence modify the progression of this disease.

AB  - Climate change, fishing, and aquaculture have affected and will continue to influence Canadian marine biodiversity, albeit at different spatial scales. The Arctic is notably affected by reduced quality and quantity of sea ice caused by global warming, and by concomitant and forecasted changes in ocean productivity, species ecology, and human activity. The Atlantic has been especially impacted by severe overfishing and human-induced alterations to food webs. Climate change, fishing, and aquaculture have all affected, to varying degrees, biodiversity on Canada's Pacific coast. Past and projected trends in key biodiversity stressors reveal marked change. Oceanographic trends include increasing surface water temperatures, reduced salinity, increased acidity, and, in some areas, reduced oxygen. Reductions in Canada's fishery catches (those in 2009 were half those of the late 1980s), followed by reductions in fishing pressure, are associated with dramatic changes in the species composition of commercial catches in the Atlantic (formerly groundfish, now predominantly invertebrates and pelagic fish) and the Pacific (formerly salmon, now predominantly groundfish). Aquaculture, dominated by the farming of Atlantic salmon, grew rapidly from the early 1980s until 2002 and has since stabilized. Climate change is forecast to affect marine biodiversity by shifting species distributions, changing species community composition, decoupling the timing of species' resource requirements and resource availability, and reducing habitat quality. Harvest-related reductions in fish abundance, many by 80% or more, coupled with fishing-induced changes to food webs, are impairing the capacity of species to recover or even persist. Open-sea aquaculture net pens affect biodiversity by (i) habitat alteration resulting from organic wastes, chemical inputs, and use of nonnative species; (ii) exchange of pathogens between farmed and wild species; and (iii) interbreeding between wild fish and farmed escapees. Physical and biological changes in the oceans, along with direct anthropogenic impacts, are modifying Canadian marine biodiversity with implications for food security and the social and economic well-being of coastal communities. To assess the consequences of changes in biodiversity for Canada's oceans and society, it is necessary to understand the current state of marine biodiversity and how it might be affected by projected changes in climate and human uses.

AB  - Working around the clock is common for many occupations, as diverse as nurses, truck drivers, physicians, steel workers, and pilots. Each shift-work profession is individual in more aspects than just work hours and individual work scenarios, each posing a different impact on the health of workers. Related health problems in shift workers, therefore, are also diverse and encompass sleep problems, metabolic and cardiovascular system disturbances, as well as cancer. Little is known about how all these individual factors influence a shift worker's health status, partly because many shift-work studies show inconsistent results. In addition, these individual factors create many methodological difficulties for researchers who investigate such work scenarios. This chapter presents examples from our laboratory and field studies of shift workers, which emphasize the importance of taking individual circumstances into account. Both study approaches, laboratory and field based, are needed to fully account for the difficulties that shift-work studies pose on both workers and researchers. Finally, understanding the mechanisms that underpin interindividual differences in response to shift work will advance our understanding of how to design better and healthier shift-work schedules in the future.

AB  - The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are two parts of a broader brain network involved in the control of cognitive functions such as working-memory, spatial attention, and decision-making. The two areas share many functional properties and exhibit similar patterns of activation during the execution of mental operations. However, neurophysiological experiments in non-human primates have also documented subtle differences, revealing functional specialization within the fronto-parietal network. These differences include the ability of the PFC to influence memory performance, attention allocation, and motor responses to a greater extent, and to resist interference by distracting stimuli. In recent years, distinct cellular and anatomical differences have been identified, offering insights into how functional specialization is achieved. This article reviews the common functions and functional differences between the PFC and PPC, and their underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Alexithymia as a prognostic risk factor for health problems: a brief review of epidemiological studies
KW  - Systematic review
KW  - Prospective study
KW  - Epidemiology
AB  - The number of articles on alexithymia has been steadily increasing since the word "alexithymia" was coined in the 1970s to denote a common characteristic that is observed among classic psychosomatic patients in whom therapy was unsuccessful. Alexithymia, a disorder of affect regulation, has been suggested to be broadly associated with various mental and physical health problems. However, most available evidence is based on anecdotal reports or cross-sectional observations. To clarify the predictive value of alexithymia for health problems, a systematic review of prospective studies was conducted. A search of the PubMed database identified 1,507 articles on "alexithymia" that were published by July 31, 2011. Among them, only 7 studies examined the developmental risks of alexithymia for health problems among nonclinical populations and 38 studies examined the prognostic value of alexithymia among clinical populations. Approximately half of the studies reported statistically significant adverse effects, while 5 studies demonstrated favorable effects of alexithymia on health outcomes; four of them were associated with surgical interventions and two involved cancer patients. The studies that showed insignificant results tended to have a small sample size. In conclusion, epidemiological evidence regarding alexithymia as a prognostic risk factor for health problems remains un-established. Even though alexithymia is considered to be an unfavorable characteristic for disease control and health promotion overall, some beneficial aspects are suggested. More prospective studies with sufficient sample sizes and follow-up period, especially those involving life course analyses, are needed to confirm the contribution of alexithymia to health problems.

AB  - Background
   Self-help interventions for psychiatric disorders represent an increasingly popular alternative to therapist-administered psychological therapies, offering the potential of increased access to cost-effective treatment.
   Aims
   To determine the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of self-help interventions for anxiety disorders.
   Method
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of self-help interventions for anxiety disorders were identified by searching nine online databases. Studies were grouped according to disorder and meta-analyses were conducted where sufficient data were available. Overall meta-analyses of self-help v. waiting list and therapist-administered treatment were also undertaken. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two researchers according to criteria set out by the Cochrane Collaboration.
   Results
   Thirty-one RCTs met inclusion criteria for the review. Results of the overall meta-analysis comparing self-help with waiting list gave a significant effect size of 0.84 in favour of self-help. Comparison of self-help with therapist-administered treatments revealed a significant difference in favour of the latter with an effect size of 0.34. The addition of guidance and the presentation of multimedia or web-based self-help materials improved treatment outcome.
   Conclusions
   Self-help interventions appear to be an effective way of treating individuals diagnosed with social phobia and panic disorder. Further research is required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and acceptability of these interventions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to systematically review the scientific literature and search for indicators of healthy work environments. A number of major national and international databases for scientific publication were searched for research addressing indicators of healthy work environments. Altogether 19 768 publications were found. After excluding duplicates, non-relevant publications, or publications that did not comply with the inclusion criteria 24 peer-reviewed publications remained to be included in this systematic review. Only one study explicitly addressing indicators of healthy work environments was found. That study suggested that the presence of stress management programs in an organization might serve as indicator of a 'good place to work', as these organizations were more likely to offer programs that encouraged employee well-being, safety and skill development than those without stress management programs. The other 23 studies either investigated employee's views of what constitute a healthy workplace or were guidelines for how to create such a workplace. Summarizing, the nine most pronounced factors considered as important for a healthy workplace that emerged from these studies were, in descending order: collaboration/teamwork: growth and development of the individual; recognition; employee involvement; positive, accessible and fair leader; autonomy and empowerment; appropriate staffing; skilled communication; and safe physical work.

AB  - This paper contains a large literature review in the research field of Text Summarisation (TS) based on Human Language Technologies (HLT). TS helps users manage the vast amount of information available, by condensing documents' content and extracting the most relevant facts or topics included in them. The rapid development of emerging technologies poses new challenges to this research field, which still need to be solved. Therefore, it is essential to analyse its progress over the years, and provide an overview of the past, present and future directions, highlighting the main advances achieved and outlining remaining limitations. With this purpose, several important aspects are addressed within the scope of this survey. On the one hand, the paper aims at giving a general perspective on the state-ofthe- art, describing the main concepts, as well as different summarisation approaches, and relevant international forums. Furthermore, it is important to stress upon the fact that the birth of new requirements and scenarios has led to new types of summaries with specific purposes (e. g. sentiment-based summaries), and novel domains within which TS has proven to be also suitable for (e. g. blogs). In addition, TS is successfully combined with a number of intelligent systems based on HLT (e. g. information retrieval, question answering, and text classification). On the other hand, a deep study of the evaluation of summaries is also conducted in this paper, where the existing methodologies and systems are explained, as well as new research that has emerged concerning the automatic evaluation of summaries' quality. Finally, some thoughts about TS in general and its future will encourage the reader to think of novel approaches, applications and lines to conduct research in the next years. The analysis of these issues allows the reader to have a wide and useful background on the main important aspects of this research field.

AB  - A reduction in cerebral glucose utilization is one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease. Although the exact cause of this reduction is not known, gathering evidence suggests that it is part of a complex metabolic adaptation to oxidative stress during which glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation are turned down, glucose metabolism is shifted to the pentose phosphate pathway to generate antioxidant reducing factors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione, and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt is activated to provide glutamate as an alternate source of energy. In the face of these adaptive metabolic changes, the Alzheimer brain runs short of energy and begins to digest itself. The very early induction of macroautophagy attests to the search for nutrients. In clinical trials, antioxidants alone have not been effectively able to influence the course of the disease as these agents do not meet the energy and nutritional requirements of the brain. Evidence is presented that gammahydroxybutyrate, a natural product of the GABA shunt, can provide the necessary energy, carbon, and antioxidant power and that its use may be able to delay the onset and progress of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Purpose - This review seeks to provide an overview of the current research evidence on the use of restraint as an intervention in managing challenging behaviours in relation to children with intellectual disabilities. It also aims to discuss legal frameworks and ethical considerations that underpin the use of restraint in intellectually disabled children who present with challenging behaviours.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a search of existing literature primarily pertaining to the management of challenging behaviours in intellectual disability on PubMed, PsycInfo and Google Scholar using combinations of the following key words - children, intellectual disabilities, learning disability, mental retardation, challenging behaviour, restraint, seclusion, physical restraint, mechanical restraint, personal restraint, and chemical restraint. Since research on the use of such interventions in children has been hitherto scant, literature relating to their use in intellectually disabled adult populations as well as cognitively able children was also examined to ascertain whether the broad principles informing the use of restraint interventions could be generalised to their use in intellectually disabled children.
   Findings - The review finds evidence to suggest that restraint interventions in their myriad forms are widely used to manage challenging behaviours in children with intellectual disabilities and outlines the evidence base, clinical scope, and the risks associated with the use of such interventions in children. It also helps highlight the current absence of comprehensive evidence based guidance that incorporates clinical, ethical, and legal aspects of the use of restraint interventions in children with intellectual disabilities and raises relevant questions in relation to their judicious use in this patient group.
   Originality/value - The authors believe that the review completes the first in depth evaluation of the use of restraint interventions in children with intellectual disabilities and are confident that this would serve as useful guidance for professionals working with this patient group who may be considering using restraint interventions in their everyday clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Screening for clinical depression and bipolar disorder remains controversial. Screening is usually based on finding discriminating symptoms, but not all tools perform equally well. Clinicians should be able to assess the clinical utility of screening tests as well as their accuracy and acceptability.
   Recent findings
   Screening for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) has been extensively examined. Four main versions of scoring the PHQ exist. The two-item PHQ2, the nine-item PHQ9, the PHQ DSM-IV algorithm, and the two-step PHQ2 then PHQ9. Recent results suggest that the PHQ9 is more accurate than the PHQ2, and that the algorithm scoring method is preferred to the linear cut-off score. The two-step procedure has promise, but it has not been adequately tested. Two screening questions may be a useful compromise in medical settings, as they take less than 2 min, but about a quarter of patients do not receive screening even when implemented systematically. Alternative customized questionnaires have been developed in medical settings such as the Depression Screening in Parkinson's Disease DESPAR and Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E). Screening for bipolar disorders is an even greater challenge than screening for unipolar depression. Screening in primary care and the community has low positive predictive value. Screening in high-risk samples, such as those with known depression is somewhat more successful, but not yet sufficiently accurate to be used alone.
   Summary
   Screening for depression can bring added value to routine unassisted recognition, but only if followed by good-quality treatment. Screening for bipolar disorder is not yet sufficiently accurate to be used reliably in clinical practice.

AB  - Computational ideas pervade many areas of science and have an integrative explanatory role in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, computational depictions of cognitive function have had surprisingly little impact on the way we assess mental illness because diseases of the mind have not been systematically conceptualized in computational terms. Here, we outline goals and nascent efforts in the new field of computational psychiatry, which seeks to characterize mental dysfunction in terms of aberrant computations over multiple scales. We highlight early efforts in this area that employ reinforcement learning and game theoretic frameworks to elucidate decision-making in health and disease. Looking forwards, we emphasize a need for theory development and large-scale computational phenotyping in human subjects.

AB  - Purpose - The PAS-ADD assessments (Psychiatric Assessment Schedules for Adults with Developmental Disabilities) have their origins in work that was being conducted over 20 years ago on the health status of older people with intellectual disability. Since that time, the assessments have undergone continuous development and refinement, and now encompass children as well as adults. This paper seeks to discuss some of these fundamental issues and how the PAS-ADD instruments have attempted to meet these challenges.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper includes discussion of theoretical and practical issues that have shaped the development of the assessments.
   Findings - The fundamental aim of the modern PAS-ADD system is to improve case detection and assessment by supporting and enhancing the skills of clinical staff, rather than attempting to replace the need for those skills. The assessor makes the final judgement about diagnosis. The PAS-ADD assessments are based on existing psychiatric classification rules for the general population and are conceptually different from instruments derived from psychometric principles. These factors have major implications, both for instrument design and for the evaluation of effectiveness.
   Originality/value - The PAS-ADD assessments have become widely used in the field of intellectual disability mental health. The theoretical issues discussed here are a central part of the ongoing effort to understand and improve the mental health of people with intellectual disabilities.

AB  - Careful reviews and meta-analyses have made valuable contributions to understanding the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients. An important next step is to determine the mediators that explain the influence of efficacious interventions on outcomes. This systematic review summarizes tests of mediating variables from twenty-two projects conducted from 1989-2010. Although all authors provided some type of rationale for considering particular mediating relationships, the investigations varied widely with respect to the extent to which formal theoretical constructs were tested, the type and goals of the interventions studied, and the broad types of outcomes and potential mediators examined. Although there was some evidence supporting selected mediating relationships, with positive findings often found when mediating variables represented behaviors targeted by an intervention, the findings were mixed. Expanding the focus of research to include mechanisms in psychosocial oncology intervention research is necessary for providing a unified picture of how mediating relationships may be operating in this field.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, disabling neurodegenerative disorder with onset of motor and non-motor features. Both reduce quality of life of PD patients and cause caregiver burden. This review aims to provide a survey of possible therapeutic options for treatment of motor and non motor symptoms of PD and to discuss their relation to each other. MAO-B-Inhibitors, NMDA antagonists, dopamine agonists and levodopa with its various application modes mainly improve the dopamine associated motor symptoms in PD. This armentarium of PD drugs only partially influences the onset and occurrence of non motor symptoms. These PD features predominantly result from non dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Autonomic features, such as seborrhea, hyperhidrosis, orthostatic syndrome, salivation, bladder dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, sleep disorders, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction with impaired execution and impulse control may appear. Drug therapy of these non motor symptoms complicates long-term PD drug therapy due to possible occurrence of drug interactions, - side effects, and altered pharmacokinetic behaviour of applied compounds. Dopamine substituting compounds themselves may contribute to onset of these non motor symptoms. This complicates the differentiation from the disease process itself and influences therapeutic options, which are often limited because of additional morbidity with necessary concomitant drug therapy.

AB  - Objective: Because evidence-based psychotherapies of 12 to 20 sessions can be perceived as too lengthy and time intensive for the treatment of depression in primary care, a number of studies have examined abbreviated psychotherapy protocols. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of brief psychotherapy (i.e., <= 8 sessions) for depression. Methods: We used combined literature searches in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and an Internet-accessible database of clinical trials of psychotherapy to conduct two systematic searches: one for existing systematic reviews and another for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Included studies examined evidence-based psychotherapy(s) of eight or fewer sessions, focused on adults with depression, contained an acceptable control condition, were published in English, and used validated measures of depressive symptoms. Results: We retained 2 systematic reviews and 15 RCTs evaluating cognitive behavioral therapy, problem-solving therapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. The systematic reviews found brief psychotherapies to be more efficacious than control, with effect sizes ranging from -0.33 to -0.25. Our meta-analysis found six to eight sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy to be more efficacious than control (ES -0.42, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.10, I-2 = 56%). A sensitivity analysis controlled for statistical heterogeneity but showed smaller treatment effects (ES -0.24, 95% Cl -0.42 to -0.06, I-2 = 0%). Conclusions: Depression can be efficaciously treated with six to eight sessions of psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy. Access to non-pharmacologic treatments for depression could be improved by training healthcare providers to deliver brief psychotherapies. (Inn. J. Psychiatry in Medicine 2012;43:129-151)

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are both common neurological disorders. There has been much debate over whether an etiological link between these two diseases exists and whether they share a common pathophysiology. Evidence pointing towards a link includes response to dopaminergic agents in PD and RLS, suggestive of underlying dopamine dysfunction in both conditions. The extrastriatal dopaminergic system, in particular altered spinal dopaminergic modulation, may be variably involved in PD patients with RLS symptoms. In addition, there is now evidence that the nigrostriatal system, primarily involved in PD, is also affected in RLS. Furthermore, an association of RLS with the parkin mutation has been suggested. The prevalence of RLS has also been reported to be increased in other disorders of dopamine regulation. However, clinical association studies and functional imaging have produced mixed findings. Conflicting accounts of emergence of RLS and improvement in RLS symptoms after deep brain stimulation (DBS) also contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the issue. Among the strongest arguments against a common pathophysiology is the role of iron in RLS and PD. While elevated iron levels in the substantia nigra contribute to oxidative stress in PD, RLS is a disorder of relative iron deficiency, with symptoms responding to replacement therapy. Recent ultrasonography studies have suggested that, despite overlapping clinical features, the mechanisms underlying idiopathic RLS and RLS associated with PD may differ. In this review, we provide a concise summary of the clinical, imaging and genetic evidence exploring the link between RLS and PD.

AB  - Nrf2 (nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a basic region leucine-zipper transcription factor which binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and thereby regulates the expression of a large battery of genes involved in the cellular antioxidant and anti-inflammatory defence as well as mitochondrial protection. As oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions have been identified as important pathomechanisms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), this signaling cascade has gained interest both with respect to ALS pathogenesis and therapy. Nrf2 and Keap1 expressions are reduced in motor neurons in postmortem ALS tissue. Nrf2-activating compounds have shown therapeutic efficacy in the ALS mouse model and other neurodegenerative disease models. Alterations in Nrf2 and Keap1 expression and dysregulation of the Nrf2/ ARE signalling programcould contribute to the chronic motor neuron degeneration in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, Nrf2 emerges as a key neuroprotective molecule in neurodegenerative diseases. Our recent studies strongly support that the Nrf2/ARE signalling pathway is an important mediator of neuroprotection and therefore represents a promising target for development of novel therapies against ALS, Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

AB  - BACKGROUND: adolescent migrants are in a state of double vulnerability because of their age and migration experience. The purpose of this review was to identify risk and protective factors serving as a base for health promotion of young recent migrants.
   METHODS: we assessed 95 papers identified through a MEDLINE search. Thirty-five papers were retained for review and analysed within the following themes: general health, mental health, cigarette smoking and sexual health.
   RESULTS: young migrants' health was considered good at arrival, but deteriorated with length of stay due to factors linked to migration. Mental health was determined by pre-migration factors, such as violence, and was strongly related to post-migration factors, such as asylum procedures, discrimination and low socio-economic status. Social support and family cohesion were identified as protective factors. We found a lack in epidemiologic data about tobacco use and sexual health issues. Results from North America indicated less frequent smoking in certain groups of immigrants. Some data suggested more frequent teenage pregnancies and abortions in young refugee women as compared to the host population. We also found some evidence about increased risk of sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS in certain immigrant populations.
   CONCLUSIONS: migrant adolescents are generally healthy at arrival. The migration process and social inequalities after arrival influence their long-term health. A comprehensive approach to health promotion is necessary, taking into account risk and protective factors. More research is needed, in order to obtain more specific epidemiologic data about adolescent migrants, as well as longitudinal and qualitative data.

AB  - This review explores the possibility of a more collaborative approach between mental health clinicians and traditional healers, from a clinical psychology perspective, for clients with spiritual beliefs. Spiritual beliefs are incorporated into the identity and functioning of clients within a cultural context and prevalence rates reveal this is not uncommon. It is argued that working collaboratively would address many access difficulties to mental health services and support is generated through a number of studies and case reports in the United Kingdom, worldwide and across cultures. This approach appears to be in accordance with current theories of acculturation. The problems in the current system when working noncollaboratively are also explored. Counter arguments and pragmatic difficulties of collaboration have been discussed. Research in the United Kingdom is limited and it is suggested that more research is needed in the field. Pragmatic solutions are suggested to stimulate discussion.

KW  - Biological invasions
KW  - Ecosystem engineers
KW  - Biodiversity
KW  - Ecosystem functioning
AB  - Background: One of the most influential forms of biological invasions is that of invasive ecosystem engineers, species that affect other biota via alterations to the abiotic environment. Such species can have wide-reaching consequences because they alter ecosystems and essentially "change the rules of existence" for a broad suite of resident biota. They thus affect resources or stressors that affect other organisms. The objective of this systematic review will be to quantify the positive and negative impacts of invasive ecosystem engineers on ecosystem structure and functioning, and to identify factors that cause their effects to vary.
   Methods: We will search a number of online databases to gather empirical evidence from the literature on the impacts of invasive ecosystem engineers on: (1) species richness and other univariate and multivariate measures of biodiversity; (2) productivity and abundance of algae, and animals; and (3) biogeochemical cycling and other flows of energy and materials, including trophic interactions. Data from relevant studies will be extracted and used in a random effects meta-analysis in order to estimate the average effect size of invasive ecosystem engineers on each response of interest.

AB  - The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is solely based on movement disorders, but several non-motor deficits are common in PD. Depression often precedes the movement dysfunctions and continues to be a major concern during all stages of the disease. The pathophysiology of parkinsonian depression is largely unknown, but appears to partly differ from depression in patients without PD. Because of the increased awareness of the negative impact of depression on the quality of life of PD patients, there is a growing interest in developing animal models of parkinsonism that also recapitulate the depressive-like symptomatology. This review introduces paradigms for measurement of depression-like behaviors in rodents and summarizes data on behavioral, neurochemical and pharmacological changes in experimental PD models with relevance for depression-related states.

AB  - Background: The Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project at the Harvard South Shore Program (PAPHSS) has published evidence-supported algorithms for the pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder with psychotic features (psychotic depression) in 1998 and 2008. This article is an update for the 2008 algorithm.
   Method: Using similar methodology as with the 2008 update, PubMed and EMBASE searches were conducted to identity relevant literature in the English language from November 2007 through July 2012. Articles were evaluated for quality of the data and for whether they provided additional evidence support for previous recommendations or prompted changes to the prior algorithm.
   Results: Minor changes were made to the algorithm: most prior recommendations were upheld. The most effective treatment for hospitalized, severe psychotic depression patients remains electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The combination of an antidepressant (tricyclic [TCA], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI], or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [SNRI]) plus an antipsychotic continues to be the preferred pharmacological modality when ECT is an unavailable/deferred option. Since the last update, new evidence tends to support using venlafaxine ER, a SNRI, as the first choice antidepressant. Regarding the antipsychotic, both olanzapine and quetiapine have new data demonstrating efficacy. Nevertheless, it is suggested that it may be reasonable to try other atypical antipsychotics with more benign safety profiles (e.g. ziprasidone, aripiprazole) as the first choice antipsychotic. New data also suggest at least four months of maintenance therapy is effective. If the first antidepressant-antipsychotic combination produces an unsatisfactory outcome, and ECT is still not acceptable or appropriate, the second pharmacotherapy trial can be with a change in the antidepressant, as was recommended in the 2008 algorithm. After two trials of combination therapy have failed (and, again, ECT is not an option), the algorithm continues to recommend augmentation with lithium. Limited evidence also suggests consideration of a switch to clozapine monotherapy. Augmentation with methylphenidate is a newly mentioned possible option based on very small evidence. When combination therapy is deferred, evidence suggests monotherapy with a TCA may be more effective than an SNRI or SSRI. However, safety issues and possible increased risk of psychosis exacerbation are unfavorable factors for TCA monotherapy. ECT or addition of an antipsychotic should be reconsidered if antidepressant monotherapy failed.
   Conclusion: This heuristic further refines the previous PAPHSS analysis of the available evidence for pharmacological treatment of psychotic depression. The validity of the conclusions is limited by the quality and quantity of the literature available: the number of head-to-head prospective trials in psychotic depression is still relatively small. However, this algorithm may serve as a guide for clinicians in the management of psychotic depression.

AB  - A major challenge in neuroscience is to understand how universal behaviors, such as sensation, movement, cognition, and emotion, arise from the interactions of specific cells that are present within intricate neural networks in the brain. Dissection of such complex networks has typically relied on disturbing the activity of individual gene products, perturbing neuronal activities pharmacologically, or lesioning specific brain regions, to investigate the network's response in a behavioral output. Though informative for many kinds of studies, these approaches are not sufficiently fine-tuned for examining the functionality of specific cells or cell classes in a spatially or temporally restricted context. Recent advances in the field of optogenetics now enable researchers to monitor and manipulate the activity of genetically defined cell populations with the speed and precision uniquely afforded by light. Transgenic mice engineered to express optogenetic tools in a cell type-specific manner offer a powerful approach for examining the role of particular cells in discrete circuits in a defined and reproducible way. Not surprisingly then, recent years have seen substantial efforts directed toward generating transgenic mouse lines that express functionally relevant levels of optogenetic tools. In this chapter, we review the state of these efforts and consider aspects of the current technology that would benefit from additional improvement.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial syndrome involving a complex array of different, while related, factors in its progression. Accordingly, novel approaches that can simultaneously modulate several disease-related targets hold great promise for the effective treatment of AD. This review describes the development of novel hybrid molecules with multimodal activity, including: i) M30, the brain permeable selective monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and -B inhibitor with chelating and neuroprotective activity; ii) HLA20, a brain permeable metal chelator with neuroprotective activity; iii) HLA20A, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor with site-activated chelating and neuroprotective activity; iv) M30D, an AChE and MAO-A and -B inhibitor with site-activated chelating and neuroprotective activity; and v) analogs of the neuroprotective aminoacid peptide, NAPVSIPQ. HLA20A and M30D act as pro-chelators and can be activated to liberate their respective active chelators HLA20 and M30 through pseudo inhibition of AChE. We first discuss the knowledge and structure-based strategy for the rational design of these novel compounds. Then, we review our recent studies on these drug candidates, regarding their wide range in vitro and in vivo activities, with emphasis on antioxidant-chelating potency and AchE and MAO-A and -B inhibitory activity, as well as neuroprotective/neurorescue effects. Finally, we discuss the diverse molecular mechanisms of action of these compounds with relevance to AD, including modulation of amyloid-beta and amyloid-beta protein precursor expression/processing; induction of cell cycle arrest; inhibition of neuronal death markers; and upregulation of neurotrophic factors, as well as activation of protein kinase signaling pathways.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in developed countries. The core motor symptoms are attributable to the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Why these neurons succumb in PD is not clear. One potential clue has come from the observation that the engagement of L-type Ca2+ channels during autonomous pacemaking elevates the sensitivity of SNc DA neurons to mitochondrial toxins used to create animal models of PD, suggesting that Ca2+ entry is a factor in their selective vulnerability. Recent work has shown that this Ca2+ entry also elevates mitochondrial oxidant stress and that this stress is exacerbated by deletion of DJ-1, a gene associated with an early onset, recessive form of PD. Epidemiological data also support a linkage between L-type Ca2+ channels and the risk of developing PD. This review examines the hypothesis that the primary factor driving neurodegenerative changes in PD is the metabolic stress created by Ca2+ entry, particularly in the face of genetic or environmental factors that compromise oxidative defenses or proteostatic competence.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder that is characterized pathologically by a progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and by protein inclusions, designated Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. PD is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, affecting almost 1% of the population over 60 years old. Although the symptoms and neuropathology of PD have been well characterized, the underlying mechanisms and causes of the disease are still not clear. Genetic mutations can provide important clues to disease mechanism, but most PD cases are sporadic rather than familial; environmental factors have long been suspected to contribute to the disease. Although more than 90% of PD cases occur sporadically and are thought to be due, in part, to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, the study of genetic mutations has provided great insight into the molecular mechanisms of PD. Furthermore, rotenone, a widely used pesticide, and paraquat and maneb cause a syndrome in rats and mice that mimics, both behaviorally and neurologically, the symptoms of PD. In the current review, we will discuss various aspects of gene-environment interaction that lead to progressive dopaminergic neurodegenration, mainly focusing on our current finding based on stress-mediated parkin dysfunction.

AB  - The increasing incidence of depressive spectrum disorders worldwide, together with the failure of current medication to effectively treat a significant proportion of cases, calls for a better knowledge of the physiopathology of depression and of the therapeutic action of antidepressants. Recent research has unveiled an array of new mechanisms through which antidepressant drugs help restore neuronal plasticity and neurotransmission. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in the field, focusing on the effectors and molecular pathways that sustain the action of antidepressants. Grasping the overall brain response to antidepressants, with an integrated overview of the neurotransmitter systems, signaling cascades and neural circuits at play, should help to design more potent and selective therapies.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons associated with intracellular Lewy inclusion bodies. The result is poverty of movement, increased muscle rigidity, and tremor at rest and on posture. Midbrain/nigral structural abnormalities can be demonstrated in vivo with both transcranial sonography (TCS) and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) while positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ligands exist to demonstrate dopamine terminal dysfunction. These radiotracers are markers of dopamine storage capacity, vesicular monoamine and dopamine transporter availability. While loss of putamen dopaminergic function leads to motor disability, Lewy bodies not only target dopamine neurons but have also been observed in serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons. As a consequence, non-dopaminergic neurotransmission is also impaired resulting in non-motor symptoms including sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, dementia, and autonomic dysfunction. PET and SPECT ligands exist to interrogate the function of monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons. Cortical and limbic Lewy body disease is seen in more advanced PD and this can be detected with FDG PET as abnormal covariance between levels of resting brain metabolism in these regions. Additionally, widespread microglial activation can be detected in PD with PET. This review discusses the role of structural and functional imaging for understanding parkinsonian syndromes and aiding in their diagnosis and management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Vascular depression (VaD) hypothesis supports a bidirectional relationship between cerebrovascular risk factors (CRFs) and depression. We examined whether such concept is appropriate for clinical interventions; i.e., whether treating depressive symptoms has an impact on cerebrovascular risk and vice-versa. Method: Systematic review on interventional studies published from October-1997 to April-2010 on MEDLINE and other databases. Search terms were "depressive disorder" (MeSH), "cerebrovascular disorders" (MeSH), and a batch of highly accurate terms to search for experimental and quasi-experimental trials. We used a structured questionnaire to assess the adequacy of the VaD criteria used for vascular, depression, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological features, as well as the main results of each study. Results: Of the 357 retrieved studies, 12 met our eligibility criteria. These studies adequately reported depression criterion, moderately reported neuroimaging and neuropsychological criteria, and showed severe flaws in vascular assessment. Efficacy trials suggested that nimodipine, transcranial magnetic stimulation, carotid stent placement, and citalopram were effective for VaD. Exploratory studies suggested that white-matter hyperintensities and global vascular risk are predictors of poor response. Although the low quality of the studies hinders the findings' generalization, studies of higher validity support the VaD concept for interventions. Conclusion: VaD seems to be a useful concept for clinical interventions; however, further trials should refine CRFs criteria to assess its impact on antidepressant efficacy.

AB  - The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a very well-defined and genetically tractable nervous system which offers an effective model to explore basic mechanistic pathways that might be underpin complex human neurological diseases. Here, the role C. elegans is playing in understanding two neurodegenerative conditions, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a complex neurological condition, autism, is used as an exemplar of the utility of this model system. C. elegans is an imperfect model of Parkinson's disease because it lacks orthologues of the human disease-related genes PARK1 and LRRK2 which are linked to the autosomal dominant form of this disease. Despite this fact, the nematode is a good model because it allows transgenic expression of these human genes and the study of the impact on dopaminergic neurons in several genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. For AD, C. elegans has orthologues of the amyloid precursor protein and both human presenilins, PS1 and PS2. In addition, many of the neurotoxic properties linked with A beta amyloid and tau peptides can be studied in the nematode. Autism spectrum disorder is a complex neuro-developmental disorder characterised by impairments in human social interaction, difficulties in communication, and restrictive and repetitive behaviours. Establishing C. elegans as a model for this complex behavioural disorder is difficult; however, abnormalities in neuronal synaptic communication are implicated in the aetiology of the disorder. Numerous studies have associated autism with mutations in several genes involved in excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the mammalian brain, including neuroligin, neurexin and shank, for which there are C. elegans orthologues. Thus, several molecular pathways and behavioural phenotypes in C. elegans have been related to autism. In general, the nematode offers a series of advantages that combined with knowledge from other animal models and human research, provides a powerful complementary experimental approach for understanding the molecular mechanisms and underlying aetiology of complex neurological diseases.

AB  - Objective: The primary objectives were to review studies that used remifentanil in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and to determine whether remifentanil has potential advantages over other anesthetics.
   Materials and Methods: The author reviewed 12 original studies obtained through a MEDLINE database search that examined remifentanil as an anesthetic in patients receiving ECT.
   Results: Remifentanil was associated with longer seizure durations when used as the sole anesthetic or as an adjunct when the primary anesthetic dose was lowered. Individual studies reported higher postictal suppression index and lower initial seizure thresholds and less rise in seizure thresholds with remifentanil. Data on hemodynamic effects were mixed but suggested favorable effects with remifentanil when seizure duration was not prolonged.
   Conclusions: Studies support the use of remifentanil in ECT, particularly in patients with brief seizures, high seizure thresholds, and postictal hemodynamic instability. Broad variability in study design, selection and dosing of anesthetics, electrode placement, and limited examination of potentially relevant variables such as age, sex, concomitant medications; and stimulus parameters attenuate the certainty of these results. Advantages in safety and efficacy over other anesthetics remain undetermined. Further study of remifentanil in ECT is warranted, given the methodological limitations and exclusion of important outcomes in the current literature.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are progressive and disabling neurodegenerative disorders, in which signs and symptoms overlap with each other and with other neurodegenerative conditions. Currently, diagnosis, measurement of progression, and response to therapeutic intervention rely upon clinical observation. However, there remains a critical need for validated biomarkers in each of these areas. A definitive diagnostic test would improve clinical management and enrollment into clinical trials. An objective measure of progression is vitally important in identifying neuroprotective interventions. Biomarkers may also provide insight into pathogenesis, and might therefore suggest possible novel targets for therapeutic intervention. In addition, certain biomarkers might be of use in monitoring the biochemical and physiological effects of therapeutic interventions. Development of diagnostic biomarkers has focused until recently upon imaging techniques based upon measuring loss of dopamine neurons. Additionally, advances in understanding the genetic contribution to neurodegenerative disorders, in particular in PD, have identified multiple causative genes and risk factors that in some cases may help estimate PD risk. However, recent availability of increasingly sophisticated bioinformatics technology has rendered development of fluid biomarkers feasible, opening the possibility of generally accessible blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests that could impact upon diagnosis, management, and research in PD, PDD, and DLB.

AB  - Anhydrobiosis is a phenomenon related to the partial or total desiccation of living organisms, keeping their vital functions after rehydration. The desiccated state in prokaryotes has been widely studied, mainly due to the broad spectrum of the anhydrobiosis applications. In this review, we present the basic theoretical concepts related to anhydrobiosis, focusing on bacterial species. An update about desiccation tolerance in bacteria is given; and the general mechanisms of desiccation tolerance and desiccation damage are described. In addition, we show how the study of anhydrobiosis in prokaryotes has established the theoretical and practical basis for the development of the drying technologies. With regard to the desiccation tolerance in bacteria, although many mechanisms remain undiscovered at the molecular level, important research about the physiology of the anhydrobiotic state and its applications has been performed, and here we provide the most recent information about this subject. On the other hand, the most widely used drying technologies and their particular applications in several fields are described (e.g. medicine, agriculture and food industry). Finally, topics on the stability of desiccated bacterial cells are treated, concluding with the necessity of focusing the research on the mathematical modelling of the desiccated state in bacteria.

TI  - A 4-year review of psychiatrists' participation in prosecutorial workshops on criminal capacity
AB  - Objective. The objective was to review psychiatric involvement in seven prosecutorial workshops on criminal capacity between 2004 and 2009. The aim was to evaluate the changing role of the psychiatrists in the workshops in order to identify areas in forensic psychiatry where prosecutors have a specific need for training, and to identify more suitable methods of training.
   Method. The workshop programmes, copies of presentations, the number of attending prosecutors at each workshop, informal personal notes from the presenters, suggestions from meetings in preparation for workshops and formatted feedback reports were reviewed. Information from a total of seven workshops was reviewed and interpreted by 2 psychiatrists from Weskoppies Hospital Forensic Psychiatry Unit (WHFPU).
   Results. The psychiatrists' involvement increased over the years. Problematic topics that were identified include non-pathological criminal incapacity, child psychiatry and the different roles of the psychiatrist and the psychologist in court. Exposure to practical aspects, interactive workshops with case presentations, discussion groups and audience participation seemed to be the preferred method of training. Attitudes of prosecutors towards psychiatry improved with increased knowledge and understanding of the field, and overall the training was rated as relevant and enriching.
   Conclusion. Psychiatrists can offer valuable training opportunities to legal professionals about the major mental illnesses and how they can affect criminal capacity, but evaluation of the training should be an ongoing process to address changing needs. Training sessions provide an opportunity for reciprocal sensitisation between the different fields. The ultimate goal is to work towards improved association between the criminal justice and mental health systems.

AB  - (Schagatay E. Predicting performance in competitive apnea diving. Part III: depth. Diving Hyperb Med. 2011 December;41(4):2.16-228.)
   Part I described the physiological factors defining the limits of static apnea, while Part II examined performance in dynamic distance swimming. This paper reviews the factors determining performance in the depth disciplines, where hydrostatic pressure is added to the stressors associated with apnea duration and physical work. Apneic duration is essential for performance in all disciplines, and is prolonged by any means that increases gas storage or tolerance to asphyxia, or that reduces metabolic rate. For underwater distance swimming, the main challenge is to restrict metabolism despite the work of swimming, and to redirect blood flow to allow the most vital functions. Here, work economy, local tissue energy and oxygen stores, anaerobic capacity of the muscles, and possibly technical improvements will be essential for further development. In the depth disciplines, direct pressure effects causing barotrauma, the narcotic effects of gases, decompression sickness (DCS) and possibly air embolism during ascent need to be taken into account, as does the risk of hypoxia when the dive cannot be rapidly interrupted before the surface is reached again. While in most deep divers apneic duration is not the main limitation thus far, greater depths may call for exceptionally long apneas and slower ascents to avoid DCS. Narcotic effects may also affect the ultimate depth limit, which elite divers predict to he around 156 metres' sea water. for constant weight with tins. To reach these depths, serious physiological challenges have to be met, technical developments are likely to be needed and safety procedures must be developed concomitantly.

AB  - Integrative Body-Mind Training (IBMT) originates from ancient Eastern tradition. The method stresses no effort to control thoughts, but instead a state of restful alertness that allows a high degree of awareness of the body, breathing, and external instructions. A series of studies indicates that IBMT improves attention and self-regulation through interaction between the central (brain) and the autonomic (body) nervous systems. The present review mainly summarizes the recent results of IBMT studies and proposes how it changes the state of brain and body to lead to positive outcomes. Future directions in this field are also discussed.

TI  - The effectiveness of health appraisal processes currently in addressing health and wellbeing during spatial plan appraisal: a systematic review
KW  - STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
KW  - IMPACT ASSESSMENT
KW  - SAN-FRANCISCO
AB  - Background: Spatial planning affects the built environment, which in turn has the potential to have a significant impact on health, for good or ill. One way of ensuring that spatial plans take due account of health is through the inclusion of health considerations in the statutory and non statutory appraisal processes linked to plan-making processes.
   Methods: A systematic review to identify evaluation studies of appraisals or assessments of plans where health issues were considered from 1987 to 2010.
   Results: A total of 6161 citations were identified: 6069 from electronic databases, 57 fromwebsite searches, with a further 35 citations from grey literature, of which 20 met the inclusion criteria. These 20 citations reported on a total of 135 different case studies: 11 UK HIA; 11 non UK high income countries HIA, 5 UK SEA or other integrated appraisal; 108 non UK high income SEA or other integrated appraisal. All studies were in English. No relevant studies were identified reporting on low or middle income countries.
   The studies were limited by potential bias (no independent evaluation, with those undertaking the appraisal also responsible for reporting outcomes), lack of detail and a lack of triangulation of results. Health impact assessments generally covered the four specified health domains (physical activity, mental health and wellbeing, environmental health issues such as pollution and noise, injury) more comprehensively than SEA or other integrated appraisals, although mental health and wellbeing was an underdeveloped area. There was no evidence available on the incorporation of health in Sustainability Appraisal, limited evidence that the recommendations from any type of appraisal were implemented, and almost no evidence that the recommendations had led to the anticipated outcomes or improvements in health postulated.
   Conclusion: Research is needed to assess (i) the degree to which statutory plan appraisal processes (SA in the UK) incorporate health; (ii) whether recommendations arising from health appraisal translate into the development process and (iii) whether outcomes are as anticipated.

AB  - Based on behavioral studies, several relatively distinct perceptual and cognitive functions have been defined in cognitive psychology such as sensory memory, short-term memory, and selective attention. Here, we review evidence suggesting that some of these functions may be supported by shared underlying neuronal mechanisms. Specifically, we present, based on an integrative review of the literature, a hypothetical model wherein short-term plasticity, in the form of transient center-excitatory and surround-inhibitory modulations, constitutes a generic processing principle that supports sensory memory, short-term memory, involuntary attention, selective attention, and perceptual learning. In our model, the size and complexity of receptive fields/level of abstraction of neural representations, as well as the length of temporal receptive windows, increases as one steps up the cortical hierarchy. Consequently, the type of input (bottom-up vs. top down) and the level of cortical hierarchy that the inputs target, determine whether short-term plasticity supports purely sensory us. semantic short-term memory or attentional functions. Furthermore, we suggest that rather than discrete memory systems, there are continuums of memory representations from short-lived sensory ones to more abstract longer-duration representations, such as those tapped by behavioral studies of short-term memory.

AB  - Semantic memory includes all acquired knowledge about the world and is the basis for nearly all human activity, yet its neurobiological foundation is only now becoming clear. Recent neuroimaging studies demonstrate two striking results: the participation of modality-specific sensory, motor, and emotion systems in language comprehension, and the existence of large brain regions that participate in comprehension tasks but are not modality-specific. These latter regions, which include the inferior parietal lobe and much of the temporal lobe, lie at convergences of multiple perceptual processing streams. These convergences enable increasingly abstract, supramodal representations of perceptual experience that support a variety of conceptual functions including object recognition, social cognition, language, and the remarkable human capacity to remember the past and imagine the future.

AB  - Objective:
   To review the basic pharmacology and published literature regarding escitalopram and citalopram in child and adolescent depression.
   Methods:
   A literature review was conducted using the search terms: 'escitalopram', 'citalopram', 'depression', 'randomized controlled trial', 'open label trial' and limits set to: Human trials, English Language and All Child (Age 0-18). Additional articles were identified from reference information and poster presentation data.
   Results:
   Three prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCT) were found for escitalopram in pediatric depression, and two RCTs were found for citalopram. One RCT each for escitalopram and citalopram showed superiority over placebo on the primary out come measure. Adverse effects in escitalopram and citalopram trials were generally mild to moderate. Suicidality was not assessed systematically in all RCTs reviewed, but did not appear to be elevated over placebo in escitalopram RCTs. One trial reported numerically higher suicide related events for citalopram compared to placebo (14 vs. 5, p=0.06).
   Conclusion:
   At present, escitalopram and citalopram should be considered a second-line option for adolescent depression. The US Food and Drug Administration approval of escitalopram for treatment of adolescent depression was based on a single positive RCT. This is less evidence than typically required for approval of a drug for a new indication.

AB  - Introduction
   Whether routine screening for depression among nonpregnant women of reproductive age improves identification and treatment of the disorder remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to address 5 key questions specific to this population: 1) What are the current national clinical practice recommendations and guidelines for depression screening; 2) What are the prevalence and predictors of screening; 3) How well do screening tools detect depression; 4) Does screening lead to diagnosis, treatment, and improved outcomes; and 5) What are the most effective treatment methods?
   Methods
   We searched bibliographic databases for full-length articles published in English between 1990 and 2010 that addressed at least 1 of our key questions.
   Results
   We identified 5 clinical practice guidelines pertinent to question 1, and 12 systematic reviews or post-hoc analyses of pooled data that addressed questions 3 through 5. No systematic reviews addressed question 2; however, we identified 4 individual studies addressing this question. Current guidelines do not recommend universal screening for depression in adults, unless staff supports are in place to diagnose, treat, and follow up patients. Reported screening rates ranged from 33% to 84% among women. Several validated screening tools for depression exist; however, their performance among this population is unknown. Screening in high-risk populations may improve the patient's receipt of diagnosis and treatment. Effective treatments include exercise, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy.
   Conclusion
   More research is needed on whether routine screening for depression among women of reproductive age increases diagnosis and treatment of depression, improves preconception health, and reduces adverse outcomes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 3rd most costly disease and the leading cause of dementia. It can linger for many years, but ultimately is fatal, the 6th leading cause of death. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is fatal and affected individuals can sometimes linger many years. Current treatments are palliative and transient, not disease modifying. This article reviews progress in the search to identify the primary AD-causing toxins. We summarize the shift from an initial focus on amyloid plaques to the contemporary concept that AD memory failure is caused by small soluble oligomers of the A beta peptide, toxins that target and disrupt particular synapses. Evidence is presented that links A beta oligomers to pathogenesis in animal models and humans, with reference to seminal discoveries from cell biology and new ideas concerning pathogenic mechanisms, including relationships to diabetes and Fragile X. These findings have established the oligomer hypothesis as a new molecular basis for the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of AD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) refer to bodily symptoms without a physical health explanation. In the context of MUS, reattribution is a process of attributing physical symptoms to a psychological cause. We review the use of a consultation model which employs reattribution, and which has been extensively utilised in teaching and research in primary care.
   Methods: Literature search for studies utilising the reattribution model. Narrative review of the results.
   Results: Data was extracted from 25 publications from 13 studies. The model has been modified over time and comparison between studies is limited by differences in methodology. The skills of the model can be acquired by training, which also improves practitioners' attitudes to MUS. However impact on clinical outcomes has been mixed and this can be explained in part from the findings of nested qualitative studies.
   Conclusions: The reattribution model is too simplistic in its current form to address the needs of many people presenting with MUS in primary care. Reattribution of physical symptoms to psychological causes is often unnecessary. Further research is required into the effectiveness of stepped and collaborative care models in which education of primary care practitioners forms one part of a complex intervention. The consultation process is best seen as both a conversation and ongoing negotiation between doctor and patient in which there are no certainties about the presence or absence of organic pathology.

AB  - Aim: This paper provides a review of published qualitative research on children's experiences of parental mental illness.
   Methods: We undertook a comprehensive search of Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Sociological Abstracts and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts databases, as well as citation searches in Web of Science and manual searches of other relevant journals and reference lists of primary papers.
   Results: Although 20 studies met the search criteria, only 10 focused exclusively on children's descriptions of their experience - the remainder elicited adults' perspectives on children's experiences of parental mental illnesses. Findings are organized under three themes: the impact of illness on children's daily life, how children cope with their experiences and how children understand mental illness.
   Conclusions: Despite references to pervasive knowledge gaps in the literature, significant information has been accumulated about children's experiences of parental mental illness. Considerable variability in research findings and tensions remain unresolved. For example, evidence is mixed as to children's knowledge and understanding of mental illnesses and how best to deploy resources to help them acquire optimal information. Furthermore, children's desire to be recognized as important to their parents' well-being conflicted with adults' perceptions that children should be protected from too much responsibility. Nevertheless, the cumulative evidence remains a key reason for advocating for psychoeducation and peer-support group interventions for children, which are endorsed by child and adult study participants alike.

AB  - Noise and Health-Sleep Disturbance in Adults: Tomoyuki KAWADA, Department of Hygiene and Public Health, Nippon Medical School-Factors modifying the effect of environmental noise on sleep include sex, age, susceptibility, personality and the health status, including past and present history of disease. Objective: The effects of noise on sleep and habituation of sleep to noise were summarized. Results and conclusions: 1) The effect of noise on sleep is associated with physical changes, such as changes in heart rate, blood flow volume, breathing and the immune and neurocirculatory systems. During sleep, specific changes in these indicators are noted during different sleep stages. There are individual and sex differences, and it is important to understand the effects of noise on sleep considering several related factors. 2) Habituation to noise is also an important phenomenon that must be addressed while considering the effects of noise on sleep. Habituation is dependent on the type and sound level of the noise. In occupational fields, shift work and job stress should be considered to determine the association between noise and sleep, which is important to retaining a good quality of working life.

AB  - The function of the auditory cortex is dynamic. Although auditory cortical plasticity can be induced through various approaches such as learning, experience and sensory deprivation, a common property is the frequency-specificity; the change in neuronal receptive field or functional maps is highly specific to the frequency content of the acquired sound. This unique property suggests that precise frequency information must be relayed to the auditory cortex. It is well known that the auditory thalamocortical pathway is the only neural substrate that sends precise frequency information to the auditory cortex. This review addresses the impact of the auditory thalamocortical system on cortical plasticity. The frequency-specificity of auditory cortical plasticity and the tonotopic features of the auditory thalamocortical system are briefly presented. A discussion of the decisive role of thalamocortical system follows. After an exploration of a possible synaptic mechanism, a thalamocortical model is proposed to better interpret the neural mechanisms underlying frequency-specific plasticity of the auditory cortex.

AB  - During the last decades music neuroscience has become a rapidly growing field within the area of neuroscience. Music is particularly well suited for studying neuronal plasticity in the human brain because musical training is more complex and multimodal than most other daily life activities, and because prospective and professional musicians usually pursue the training with high and long-lasting commitment. Therefore, music has increasingly been used as a tool for the investigation of human cognition and its underlying brain mechanisms. Music relates to many brain functions like perception, action, cognition, emotion, learning and memory and therefore music is an ideal tool to investigate how the human brain is working and how different brain functions interact. Novel findings have been obtained in the field of induced cortical plasticity by musical training. The positive effects, which music in its various forms has in the healthy human brain are not only important in the framework of basic neuroscience, but they also will strongly affect the practices in neuro-rehabilitation.

AB  - Silent information regulator two proteins (sirtuins or SIRTs) are a group of histone deacetylases whose activities are dependent on and regulated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). They suppress genome-wide transcription, yet upregulate a select set of proteins related to energy metabolism and pro-survival mechanisms, and therefore play a key role in the longevity effects elicited by calorie restriction. Recently, a neuroprotective effect of sirtuins has been reported for both acute and chronic neurological diseases. The focus of this review is to summarize the latest progress regarding the protective effects of sirtuins, with a focus on SIRT1. We first introduce the distribution of sirtuins in the brain and how their expression and activity are regulated. We then highlight their protective effects against common neurological disorders, such as cerebral ischemia, axonal injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we analyze the mechanisms underlying sirtuin-mediated neuroprotection, centering on their non-histone substrates such as DNA repair enzymes, protein kinases, transcription factors, and coactivators. Collectively, the information compiled here will serve as a comprehensive reference for the actions of sirtuins in the nervous system to date, and will hopefully help to design further experimental research and expand sirtuins as therapeutic targets in the future.

AB  - Background: Objective of the study was to assess the effects of strategies to integrate targeted priority population, health and nutrition interventions into health systems on patient health outcomes and health system effectiveness and thus to compare integrated and non-integrated health programmes.
   Methods: Systematic review using Cochrane methodology of analysing randomised trials, controlled before-and-after and interrupted time series studies. We defined specific strategies to search PubMed, CENTRAL and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group register, considered studies published from January 1998 until September 2008, and tracked references and citations. Two reviewers independently agreed on eligibility, with an additional arbiter as needed, and extracted information on outcomes: primary (improved health, financial protection, and user satisfaction) and secondary (improved population coverage, access to health services, efficiency, and quality) using standardised, pre-piloted forms. Two reviewers in the final stage of selection jointly assessed quality of all selected studies using the GRADE criteria.
   Results: Of 8,274 citations identified 12 studies met inclusion criteria. Four studies compared the benefits of Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses in Tanzania and Bangladesh, showing improved care management and higher utilisation of health facilities at no additional cost. Eight studies focused on integrated delivery of mental health and substance abuse services in the United Kingdom and United States of America. Integrated service delivery resulted in better clinical outcomes and greater reduction of substance abuse in specific subgroups of patients, with no significant difference found overall. Quality of care, patient satisfaction, and treatment engagement were higher in integrated delivery models.
   Conclusions: Targeted priority population health interventions we identified led to improved health outcomes, quality of care, patient satisfaction and access to care. Limited evidence with inconsistent findings across varied interventions in different settings means no general conclusions can be drawn on the benefits or disadvantages of integrated service delivery.

AB  - Background: High-quality review evidence is useful for informing and influencing public health policy and practice decisions. However, certain topic areas lack representation in terms of the quantity and quality of review literature available. The objectives of this paper are to identify the quantity, as well as quality, of review-level evidence available on the effectiveness of public health interventions for public health decision makers.
   Methods: Searches conducted on http://www.health-evidence.ca produced an inventory of public health review literature in 21 topic areas. Gaps and areas of wealth in the review literature, as well as the proportion of reviews rated methodologically strong, moderate, or weak were identified. The top 10 topic areas of interest for registered users and visitors of http://www.health-evidence.ca were extracted from user profile data and Google Analytics.
   Results: Registered users' top three interests included: 1) healthy communities, 2) chronic diseases, and 3) nutrition. The top three preferences for visitors included: 1) chronic diseases, 2) physical activity, and 3) addiction/substance use. All of the topic areas with many (301+) available reviews were of interest to registered users and/or visitors (mental health, physical activity, addiction/substance use, adolescent health, child health, nutrition, adult health, and chronic diseases). Conversely, the majority of registered users and/or visitors did not have preference for topic areas with few (<= 150) available reviews (food safety and inspection, dental health, environmental health) with the exception of social determinants of health and healthy communities. Across registered users' and visitors' topic areas of preference, 80.2% of the reviews were of well-done methodological quality, with 43.5% of reviews having a strong quality rating and 36.7% a moderate review quality rating.
   Conclusions: In topic areas in which many reviews are available, higher level syntheses are needed to guide policy and practice. For other topic areas with few reviews, it is necessary to determine whether primary study evidence exists, or is needed, so that reviews can be conducted in the future. Considering that less than half of the reviews available on http://www.health-evidence.ca are of strong methodological quality, the quality of the review-level evidence needs to improve across the range of public health topic areas.

AB  - Purinergic neurotransmission, involving release of ATP as an efferent neurotransmitter was first proposed in 1972. Later, ATP was recognised as a cotransmitter in peripheral nerves and more recently as a cotransmitter with glutamate, noradrenaline, GABA, acetylcholine and dopamine in the CNS. Both ATP, together with some of its enzymatic breakdown products (ADP and adenosine) and uracil nucleotides are now recognised to act via P2X ion channels and P1 and P2Y G protein-coupled receptors, which are widely expressed in the brain. They mediate both fast signalling in neurotransmission and neuromodulation and long-term (trophic) signalling in cell proliferation, differentiation and death. Purinergic signalling is prominent in neurone-glial cell interactions. In this review we discuss first the evidence implicating purinergic signalling in normal behaviour, including learning and memory, sleep and arousal, locomotor activity and exploration, feeding behaviour and mood and motivation. Then we turn to the involvement of P1 and P2 receptors in pathological brain function; firstly in trauma, ischemia and stroke, then in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's, as well as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Finally, the role of purinergic signalling in neuropsychiatric diseases (including schizophrenia), epilepsy, migraine, cognitive impairment and neuropathic pain will be considered.

AB  - Objective School functioning is among the most important life domains impacted by chronic pain. This review provides a summary of the measures currently used by researchers to assess school functioning in children with chronic pain. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature on school absenteeism and school functioning in children and adolescents with pain. Searches were restricted to a time frame including January 1985 to December 2010. Results Fifty-three articles are reviewed: all include some form of assessment of school absenteeism or school functioning as part of the study outcome measures. Of the 53 articles, 26 assessed school absenteeism and 27 assessed an aspect of school functioning; 14 of these 27 articles assessed both. Conclusions Understanding the comprehensive impact of pain on school functioning will require improvements in our current assessment methods.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a frequently fatal motor neuron disease without any cure. To find molecular therapeutic targets, several studies crossed transgenic ALS murine models with animals transgenic for some ALS target genes. We aimed to revise the new discoveries and new works in this field. We selected the 10 most promising genes, according to their capability when down-regulated or up-regulated in ALS animal models, for increasing life span and mitigating disease progression: XBP-1, NogoA and NogoB, dynein, heavy and medium neurofilament, NOX1 and NOX2, MLC-mIGF-1, NSE-VEGF, and MMP-9. Interestingly, some crucial modifier genes have been described as being involved in common pathways, the most significant of which are inflammation and cytoskeletal activities. The endoplasmic reticulum also seems to play an important role in ALS pathogenesis, as it is involved in different selected gene pathways. In addition, these genes have evident links to each other, introducing the hypothesis of a single unknown, common pathway involving all of these identified genes and others to be discovered.

AB  - Play behavior is a fundamental and intrinsic neurobehavioral process in the mammalian brain. Using rough-and-tumble play in the juvenile rat as a model system to study mammalian playfulness, some of the relevant neurobiological substrates for this behavior have been identified, and in this review this progress. A primary-process executive circuit for play in the rat that includes thalamic intralaminar nuclei, frontal cortex and striatum can be gleaned from these data. Other neural areas that may interact with this putative circuit include amygdala, ventral hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray (PAG), and deep tectum, as well as ascending dopamine systems which participate in all types of seeking urges. At the neurochemical level, considerable evidence points to specific cholinergic and dopaminergic controls, but also endogenous opioids and cannabinoids as having a positive modulatory influence over playfulness, with all neuropeptides known to have aversive effects to reduce play. Monoamines such as norepinephrine and serotonin certainly modulate play, but they influence all psychobehavioral systems, suggesting nonspecific effects. We proceed to discuss how increased insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of play can inform our understanding of normal and abnormal childhood development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a novel neurobiological model of theory of mind (ToM) that incorporates both neuroanatomical and neurochemical levels of specificity. Within this model, cortical and subcortical regions are functionally organized into networks that subserve the ability to represent cognitive and affective mental states to both self and other. The model maintains that (1) cognitive and affective aspects of ToM are subserved by dissociable, yet interacting, prefrontal networks. The cognitive ToM network primarily engages the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsal striatum; and the affective ToM network primarily engages the ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortices, the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, the amygdala and the ventral striatum; (2) self and other mental-state representation is processed by distinct brain regions within the mentalizing network, and that the ability to distinguish between self and other mental states is modulated by a functionally interactive dorsal and ventral attention/selection systems at the temporoparietal junction and the anterior cingulate cortex; and (3) ToM functioning is dependent on the integrity of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems which are primarily engaged in the maintenance and application processes of represented mental states. In addition to discussing the mechanisms involved in mentalizing in terms of its component processes, we discuss the model's implications to pathologies that variably impact one's ability to represent, attribute and apply mental states.

AB  - Background Remote and mobile workers (RMWs), people who spend the majority of work time away from a home or office base, are estimated to number 1 million in the UK and Ireland. A number of advantages and challenges have been identified with this way of working but little is known about the impact of this type of work on the health and well-being of RMWs.
   Aims To identify any potential health or psychosocial effects associated with remote and mobile working, identify ergonomic factors that impact on this group and ascertain the effect of organizational or management factors that influence this occupational group.
   Methods A systematic review methodology was used and a search strategy developed including keywords, which were used to search electronic databases and websites. Data were then extracted from included papers and quality assessed.
   Results Initial searches identified 280 references but only 11 papers reached the inclusion criteria. Health effects identified included musculoskeletal symptoms associated with higher mileage and more time in a vehicle but a number of vehicle design issues were found to improve symptoms. Psychosocial factors including high demands were also found but better mental health was associated with higher mileage and more time with clients. There was a lack of substantive evidence in relation to managing this group.
   Conclusions There is little research currently available on the general health of RMWs and future research should examine this further and focus on general health and access to support services.

AB  - Background
   Psychiatric patients have increased comorbid physical illness. There is less information concerning dental disease in this population in spite of risk factors including diet and psychotropic side-effects (such as xerostomia).
   Aims
   To compare the oral health of people with severe mental illness with that of the general population.
   Method
   A systematic search for studies from the past 20 years was conducted using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and article bibliographies. Papers were independently assessed. The primary outcome was total tooth loss (edentulousness), the end-stage of both untreated caries and periodontal disease. We also assessed dental decay through standardised measures: the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) or surfaces (DMFS). For studies lacking a control group we used controls of similar ages from a community survey within 10 years of the study.
   Results
   We identified 21 papers of which 14 had sufficient data (n=2784 psychiatric patients) and suitable controls (n=31 084) for a random effects meta-analysis. People with severe mental illness had 3.4 times the odds of having lost all their teeth than the general community (95% CI 1.6-7.2). They also had significantly higher scores for DMFT (mean difference 6.2, 95% CI 0.6-11.8) and DMFS (mean difference 14.6, 95% CI 4.1-25.1). Fluoridated water reduced the gap in oral health between psychiatric patients and the general population.
   Conclusions
   Psychiatric patients have not shared in the improving oral health of the general population. Management should include oral health assessment using standard checklists that can be completed by non-dental personnel. Interventions include oral hygiene and management of xerostomia.

AB  - There is consensus that amelioration of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease is most effective with L-DOPA (levodopa). However, this necessary therapeutic step is biased by an enduring belief that L-DOPA is toxic to the remaining substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons by itself, or by specific metabolites such as dopamine. The concept of L-DOPA toxicity originated from pre-clinical studies conducted mainly in cell culture, demonstrating that L-DOPA or its derivatives damage dopaminergic neurons due to oxidative stress and other mechanisms. However, the in vitro data remain controversial as some studies showed neuroprotective, rather than toxic action of the drug. The relevance of this debate needs to be considered in the context of the studies conducted on animals and in clinical trials that do not provide convincing evidence for L-DOPA toxicity in vivo. This review presents the current views on the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, focusing on mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative/proteolytic stress, the factors that can be affected by L-DOPA or its metabolites. We then critically discuss the evidence supporting the two opposing views on the effects of L-DOPA in vitro, as well as the animal and human data. We also address the problem of inadequate experimental models used in these studies. L-DOPA remains the symptomatic 'hero' of Parkinson's disease. Whether it contributes to degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, or is a 'scapegoat' for explaining undesirable or unexpected effects of the treatment, remains a hotly debated topic.

AB  - Objective: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for severe major depressive disorder. However, after acute-phase treatment and initial remission, relapse rates are significant. Strategies to prolong remission include continuation phase ECT, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or their combinations. This systematic review synthesizes extant data regarding the combined use of psychotherapy with ECT for the treatment of patients with severe major depressive disorder and offers the hypothesis that augmenting ECT with depression-specific psychotherapy represents a promising strategy for future investigation.
   Methods: The authors performed 2 independent searches in PsychInfo (1806-2009) and MEDLINE (1948-2009) using combinations of the following search terms: Electroconvulsive Therapy (including ECT, ECT therapy, electroshock therapy, EST, and shock therapy) and Psychotherapy (including cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, group, psychodynamic, psychoanalytic, individual, eclectic, and supportive). We included in this review a total of 6 articles (English language) that mentioned ECT and psychotherapy in the abstract and provided a case report, series, or clinical trial. We examined the articles for data related to ECT and psychotherapy treatment characteristics, cohort characteristics, and therapeutic outcome.
   Results: Although research over the past 7 decades documenting the combined use of ECT and psychotherapy is limited, the available evidence suggests that testing this combination has promise and may confer additional, positive functional outcomes.
   Conclusions: Significant methodological variability in ECT and psychotherapy procedures, heterogeneous patient cohorts, and inconsistent outcome measures prevent strong conclusions; however, existing research supports the need for future investigations of combined ECT and psychotherapy in well-designed, controlled clinical studies. Depression-specific psychotherapy approaches may need special adaptations in view of the cognitive effects of ECT.

AB  - Although fairly frequent in psychiatric in-patient, episodes of aggression/violence are mainly limited to verbal aggression, but the level of general health is significantly lower in nurses who report 'frequent' exposure to violent incidents, and there is disagreement between patients and staff concerning predictors of these episodes. We searched the Pubmed, Embase and PsychInfo databases for English, Italian, French or German language papers published between 1 January 1990 and 31 March 2010 using the key words "aggress*" (aggression or aggressive) "violen*" (violence or violent) and "in-patient" or "psychiatric wards", and the inclusion criterion of an adult population (excluding all studies of selected samples such as a specific psychiatric diagnosis other than psychosis, adolescents or the elderly, men/women only, personality disorders and mental retardation). The variables that were most frequently associated with aggression or violence in the 66 identified studies of unselected psychiatric populations were the existence of previous episodes, the presence of impulsiveness/hostility, a longer period of hospitalisation, non-voluntary admission, and aggressor and victim of the same gender; weaker evidence indicated alcohol/drug misuse, a diagnosis of psychosis, a younger age and the risk of suicide. Alcohol/drug misuse, hostility, paranoid thoughts and acute psychosis were the factors most frequently involved in 12 studies of psychotic patients. Harmony among staff (a good working climate) seems to be more useful in preventing aggression than some of the other strategies used in psychiatric wards, such as the presence of male nurses.

AB  - Ecological approaches to community assembly have emphasized the interplay between neutral processes, niche-based environmental filtering and niche-based species sorting in an interactive milieu. Recently, progress has been made in terms of aligning our vocabulary with conceptual advances, assessing how trait-based community functional parameters differ from neutral expectation and assessing how traits vary along environmental gradients. Experiments have confirmed the influence of these processes on assembly and have addressed the role of dispersal in shaping local assemblages. Community phylogenetics has forged common ground between ecologists and biogeographers, but it is not a proxy for trait-based approaches. Community assembly theory is in need of a comparative synthesis that addresses how the relative importance of niche and neutral processes varies among taxa, along environmental gradients, and across scales. Towards that goal, we suggest a set of traits that probably confer increasing community neutrality and regionality and review the influences of stress, disturbance and scale on the importance of niche assembly. We advocate increasing the complexity of experiments in order to assess the relative importance of multiple processes. As an example, we provide evidence that dispersal, niche processes and trait interdependencies have about equal influence on trait-based assembly in an experimental grassland.

AB  - Background: Targeting social isolation in older people is a growing public health concern. The proportion of older people in society has increased in recent decades, and it is estimated that approximately 25% of the population will be aged 60 or above within the next 20 to 40 years. Social isolation is prevalent amongst older people and evidence indicates the detrimental effect that it can have on health and wellbeing. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to alleviate social isolation and loneliness in older people.
   Methods: Relevant electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ASSIA, IBSS, PsycINFO, PubMed, DARE, Social Care Online, the Cochrane Library and CINAHL) were systematically searched using an extensive search strategy, for randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies published in English before May 2009. Additional articles were identified through citation tracking. Studies were included if they related to older people, if the intervention aimed to alleviate social isolation and loneliness, if intervention participants were compared against inactive controls and, if treatment effects were reported. Two independent reviewers extracted data using a standardised form. Narrative synthesis and vote-counting methods were used to summarise and interpret study data.
   Results: Thirty two studies were included in the review. There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the interventions delivered and the overall quality of included studies indicated a medium to high risk of bias. Across the three domains of social, mental and physical health, 79% of group-based interventions and 55% of one-to-one interventions reported at least one improved participant outcome. Over 80% of participatory interventions produced beneficial effects across the same domains, compared with 44% of those categorised as non-participatory. Of interventions categorised as having a theoretical basis, 87% reported beneficial effects across the three domains compared with 59% of interventions with no evident theoretical foundation. Regarding intervention type, 86% of those providing activities and 80% of those providing support resulted in improved participant outcomes, compared with 60% of home visiting and 25% of internet training interventions. Fifty eight percent of interventions that explicitly targeted socially isolated or lonely older people reported positive outcomes, compared with 80% of studies with no explicit targeting.
   Conclusions: More, well-conducted studies of the effectiveness of social interventions for alleviating social isolation are needed to improve the evidence base. However, it appeared that common characteristics of effective interventions were those developed within the context of a theoretical basis, and those offering social activity and/or support within a group format. Interventions in which older people are active participants also appeared more likely to be effective. Future interventions incorporating all of these characteristics may therefore be more successful in targeting social isolation in older people.

AB  - Background: Research on interventions to positively impact health and housing status of people who are homeless has received substantially increased attention over the past 5 years. This rapid review examines recent evidence regarding interventions that have been shown to improve the health of homeless people, with particular focus on the effect of these interventions on housing status.
   Methods: A total of 1,546 articles were identified by a structured search of five electronic databases, a hand search of grey literature and relevant journals, and contact with experts. Two reviewers independently screened the first 10% of titles and abstracts for relevance. Inter-rater reliability was high and as a result only one reviewer screened the remaining titles and abstracts. Articles were included if they were published between January 2004 and December 2009 and examined the effectiveness of an intervention to improve the health or healthcare utilization of people who were homeless, marginally housed, or at risk of homelessness. Two reviewers independently scored all relevant articles for quality.
   Results: Eighty-four relevant studies were identified; none were of strong quality while ten were rated of moderate quality. For homeless people with mental illness, provision of housing upon hospital discharge was effective in improving sustained housing. For homeless people with substance abuse issues or concurrent disorders, provision of housing was associated with decreased substance use, relapses from periods of substance abstinence, and health services utilization, and increased housing tenure. Abstinent dependent housing was more effective in supporting housing status, substance abstinence, and improved psychiatric outcomes than non-abstinence dependent housing or no housing. Provision of housing also improved health outcomes among homeless populations with HIV. Health promotion programs can decrease risk behaviours among homeless populations.
   Conclusions: These studies provide important new evidence regarding interventions to improve health, housing status, and access to healthcare for homeless populations. The additional studies included in this current review provide further support for earlier evidence which found that coordinated treatment programs for homeless persons with concurrent mental illness and substance misuse issues usually result in better health and access to healthcare than usual care. This review also provides a synthesis of existing evidence regarding interventions that specifically support homeless populations with HIV.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder that affects 2% of the general population. Despite optimal cognitive-behavioral and pharmacologic therapy, approximately 10% of patients remain treatment resistant. Currently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is being investigated as an experimental therapy for treatment-refractory OCD. This review focuses on the efficacy and adverse events of all published DBS targets for OCD: anterior limb of the internal capsule, ventral striatum/ventral capsule, nucleus accumbens, nucleus subthalamicus, and inferior thalamic peduncle. Small studies with various designs indicate an overall average Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score decrease ranging from 6.8 to 31 points. The average overall responder rate is +/- 50%. The frequency of adverse events seems to be limited. Larger prospective studies including neuroimaging are needed to estimate adequately the true potential of DBS in treatment of OCD and to elucidate its underlying mechanism of action and optimal brain target. We conclude that DBS may be a promising and safe therapy for treatment-resistant OCD.

AB  - Aim: High-risk studies provide the opportunity to describe the early natural history of bipolar disorder (BD); however, findings have varied substantially. In this review, we compare different methods of ascertainment and assessment, and their impact on study findings.
   Methods: Through a literature search, we identified 11 high-risk studies meeting inclusion criteria for this review. Studies included were those that focused on lifetime psychopathology in the offspring as the main outcome and provided adequate information on the methods of family ascertainment, as well as on parent and offspring assessment. We compared and contrasted psychopathological outcomes in the offspring among the studies using different methods.
   Results: High-risk studies that identified affected parents through their involvement in neurobiological research and confirmed diagnosis in the parent and offspring through best estimate procedures tended to report lower rates of co-morbidity in the proband parent, lower rates of psychopathology in the non-proband parent, lower rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and externalizing disorders, and older ages of onset of major mood disorders in the offspring compared with studies that identified affected parents through self-referral and confirmed diagnosis in the parent and offspring through structured research interviews. Studies that identified severely ill parents and used semi-structured assessments tended to have an intermediate position in terms of outcomes.
   Conclusions: This review indicates that different methods of family ascertainment and of assessment of parent and offspring impact the findings pertaining to lifetime psychopathology and clinical course of BD in high-risk studies. The implications of this finding for mapping the natural history of BD are discussed.

AB  - Gene regulation is a major source of phenotypic diversity between and within species. This aspect of evolution has long been addressed from the sole point of view of the genome sequence. The incredible development of transcriptomics approaches now allows one to actually study the topology and the properties of regulatory networks on an evolutionary perspective. This new discipline is called comparative functional genomics or comparative transcriptomics. This article reviews some of the main advances made in this field, using yeast species, and especially the species sequenced in the frame of the Genolevures program, as a model.

AB  - The relationship between depression and coronary heart disease is well-established, but causal mechanisms are poorly understood. The aim of this review is to stimulate different ways of viewing the relationship between depression and adverse outcomes following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patients. We present an argument for depression in ACS and CABG patients being a qualitatively distinct form from that observed in psychiatric populations. This is based on three features: (1) depression developing after cardiac events has been linked in many studies to poorer outcomes than recurrent depression; (2) somatic symptoms of depression following cardiac events are particularly cardiotoxic; (3) depression following an ACS does not respond well to antidepressant treatments. We propose that inflammation is a common causal process responsible in part both for the development of depressive symptoms and for adverse cardiac outcomes, and we draw parallels with inflammation-induced sickness behaviour. Clinical implications of our observations are discussed along with suggestions for further work to advance the field. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dysfunctional homeostasis of transition metals is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although questioned by some, brain copper, zinc, and particularly iron overload are widely accepted features of AD which have led to the hypothesis that oxidative stress generated from aberrant homeostasis of these transition metals might be a pathogenic mechanism behind AD. This meta-analysis compiled and critically assessed available quantitative data on brain iron, zinc and copper levels in AD patients compared to aged controls. The results were very heterogeneous. A series of heavily cited articles from one laboratory reported a large increase in iron in AD neocortex compared to age-matched controls (p < 0.0001) while seven laboratories failed to reproduce these findings reporting no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.76). A more than three-fold citation bias was found to favor outlier studies reporting increases in iron and this bias was particularly prominent among narrative review articles. Additionally, while zinc was not significantly changed in the neocortex (p = 0.29), copper was significantly depleted in AD (p = 0.0003). In light of these findings, it will be important to re-evaluate the hypothesis that transition metal overload accounts for oxidative injury noted in AD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A major objective of many healthcare providers is to increase patients' participation in their own care. The introduction of electronic personal health records (ePHRs) may help to achieve this. An ePHR is an electronic database of an individual's health information, accessible to and maintained by the patient. ePHRs are very much in vogue, with an increasing number of studies reporting their potential utility as well as cost. However, the vast majority of these studies focus on general healthcare. Little attempt has been made to document the specific problems which might occur throughout the implementation of ePHRs in mental health. This review identifies such concerns through an electronic search of the literature. Several potential difficulties are highlighted and addressed, including access to information technology, identifying relevant populations and the handling of sensitive information. Special attention is paid to the concept of 'empowerment' and what this means in relation to ePHRs.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases selectively target subpopulations of neurons, leading to the progressive failure of defined brain systems, but the basis of such selective neuronal vulnerability has remained elusive. Here, we discuss how a stressor-threshold model of how particular neurons and circuits are selectively vulnerable to disease may underly the etiology of familial and sporadic forms of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and ALS. According to this model, the intrinsic vulnerabilities of neuronal subpopulations to stressors and specific disease-related misfolding proteins determine neuronal morbidity. Neurodegenerative diseases then involve specific combinations of genetic predispositions and environmental stressors, triggering increasing age-related stress and proteostasis dysfunction in affected vulnerable neurons. Damage to vasculature, immune system, and local glial cells mediates environmental stress, which could drive disease at all stages.

AB  - Background: Outdoor air pollution, given its demonstrated negative effects on the respiratory system, is a growing public health concern worldwide, particularly in urban cities. Human exposure to pollutants such as ozone, nitrogen oxides, combustion-related particulate matter and oxides of sulfur is responsible for significant cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality in both adults and children. Several antioxidants have shown an ability to partially attenuate the negative physiological and functional impacts of air pollutants. This study systematically presents current data on the potential benefits of antioxidant supplementation on lung function outcomes associated with air pollutant exposures in intact humans.
   Methods: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS Previews, Web of Sciences, Environmental Sciences & Pollution Management and TOXNET) were systematically searched for all studies published up to April 2009. Search terms relating to the concepts of respiratory tract diseases, respiratory function tests, air pollution, and antioxidants were used. Data was systematically abstracted from original articles that satisfied selection criteria for inclusion. For inclusion, the studies needed to have evaluated human subjects, given supplemental antioxidants, under conditions of known levels of air pollutants with measured lung function before and after antioxidant administration and/or air pollution exposure. Selected studies were summarized and conclusions presented.
   Results: Eight studies investigated the role of antioxidant supplementation on measured lung function outcomes after subject exposure to air pollutants under controlled conditions; 5 of these studies concluded that pollutant-induced airway hyper-responsiveness and diminution in lung function measurements were attenuated by antioxidant supplementation. The remaining five studies took place under ambient (uncontrolled) exposures and unanimously concluded that antioxidant supplementations attenuate the negative effects of urban air pollution on lung function.
   Conclusions: The data evaluating modification of changes in lung function associated with air pollutant exposure by antioxidant supplementation, in intact humans, is limited. Of 13 studies dedicated to this concern, ten demonstrated an attenuation of pollution-associated decrements. There is growing evidence for the benefit of antioxidant supplementation in moderating the effects of air pollution on lung function, but more research on human participants is needed to inform this topic.

AB  - Background: The rapid emergence of social media, including Facebook and You Tube, have added a new dimension to defining, teaching, and role modeling professionalism in the medical field. Explicit and consistent role modeling of professional behaviors are needed to encourage the development of professional physicians. Objective: The purpose of this article is to investigate the challenges and opportunities at the interface of professionalism and social media or physicians. Method: The medical literature via PubMed was reviewed with key words including "Facebook," "YouTube," "social media," "digital media," and key issues are discussed. Our residency program was surveyed regarding their experiences with digital media in medical practice and the findings are discussed. Sample topics and relevant, thought provoking questions generated from our practices are outlined Results: Case vignettes are offered to exemplify issues with regard to professionalism raised by digital and social media in medical practice. Conclusion: Social media sites offer great opportunity to widely distribute valuable health care information as well as provide physicians with a venue to de-stress. In this new digital age, trainees and lifelong learners must learn to be mindful of professionalism while using social media in order to protect their privacy as well as the image of physicians.

AB  - Background: The universal occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was queried about twenty-six years ago. It was thought to occur only in western industrialized countries with high technological development. Over the last decade, knowledge about ASD and its prevalence has been documented as being on the rise in different regions of the world, with most literature coming from the western world - the situation in Africa on aspects of ASD remain unclear. Methods: Literature cited in Pubmed over the last decade on aspects of epidemiology diagnosis, aetiology and knowledge of ASD in the African context were assessed. Keywords: autism, diagnosis, aetiology knowledge and Africa were variously combined in the literature search. Results: No study specifically addressed the epidemiology of ASD in Africa. One of the two studies that were relevant addressed epidemiology of ASD in Arab countries, though included two Northern African countries. A higher proportion of non-verbal cases of ASD compared to verbal cases was documented in literature coming from Africa. Associated co-morbid disorders included intellectual disability, epilepsy and oculo-cutaneous albinism. Aetiological factors postulated included post-encephalitic infection, genetic and auto-immune factors, and vitamin D deficiency Knowledge about ASD in Africa was noted to be low Conclusion: There is a need for epidemiological studies in Africa to define the magnitude of the problem of ASD and the characteristics of children affected by ASD in this region. This would help in planning and might be helpful in answering the question of aetiology of ASD. Policy making needs to be directed at issues of childhood developmental disorders in Africa.

AB  - Objective: The authors systematically reviewed the management of treatment-refractory depression in older people (defined as age 55 or older).
   Method: The authors conducted an electronic database search and reviewed the 14 articles that fit predetermined criteria. Refractory depression was defined as failure to respond to at least one course of treatment for depression during the current illness episode. The authors rated the validity of studies using a standard checklist and calculated the pooled proportion of response to any treatment reported by at least three studies.
   Results: All the studies that met inclusion criteria investigated pharmacological treatment. Most were open-label studies, and the authors found no double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials. The overall response rate for all active treatments investigated was 52% (95% Cl= 4262; N= 381). Only lithium augmentation was assessed in more than two trials, and the response rate was 42% (95% Cl= 21-65; N= 57). Only two studies included comparison groups receiving no additional treatment, and none of the participants in these groups responded. In single randomized studies, extended-release venlafaxine was more efficacious than paroxetine, lithium augmentation more than phenelzine, and selegiline more than placebo.
   Conclusions: Half of the participants responded to pharmacological treatments, indicating the importance of managing treatment-refractory depression actively in older people. The only treatment for which there was replicated evidence was lithium augmentation. Double-blind randomized controlled trials for management of treatment-refractory depression in older people, encompassing pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies and populations that reflect the levels of physical and cognitive impairment present in the general older population with depression, are needed.

AB  - Misfolded TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and Fused-In-Sarcoma (FUS) protein have recently been identified as pathological hallmarks of the neurodegenerative disorders amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) characterized by the presence of ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). Although TDP-43 and FUS are normally located predominantly in the nucleus, pathological TDP-43 and FUS inclusions are mostly found in the cytosol. Cytosolic deposition is paralleled by a striking nuclear depletion of either protein. Based on a number of recent findings, we postulate that defects in nuclear import are an important step towards TDP-43 and FUS dysfunction. Failure of nuclear transport can arise from mutations within a nuclear localization signal or from age-related decline of nuclear import mechanisms. We propose that nuclear import defects in combination with additional hits, for example cellular stress and genetic risk factors, may be a central underlying cause of ALS and FTLD-U pathology.

AB  - Introduction: Diabetes is a growing worldwide problem, characterized by considerable ethnic variation and being particularly common in modernizing populations. Modernization is accompanied by a variety of stressful sociocultural changes that are believed to increase the risk of diabetes. Unfortunately, there is little accurate knowledge about impact of stress on the risk of diabetes in the US-Mexico border area.
   Methods: Literature searches were performed in PubMed and Google Scholar to identify anthropological studies on stress and diabetes. Snowball and opportunistic sampling were used to expand the identified literature. In total, 30 anthropological studies were identified concerning the role of stress and modernization on diabetes among Indigenous peoples. This article reviews the available information regarding stress and diabetes in different populations from various anthropological perspectives.
   Results: Four different concepts of stress were indentified: physiological, psychological, psychosocial and nutritional stress. Unlike physiological and nutritional theories of diabetes, psychological and psychosocial theories of stress and disease lack etiological specificity. No study addressed all four concepts of stress and few studies addressed more than two concepts. Most studies concerned nutritional stress and the developmental origins of diabetes. Most studies were conducted on the Pima Indians of Arizona and Mexico. All four stress concepts have some evidence as determinants of diabetes.
   Conclusion: These theoretical concepts and ethnographic results can provide the basis for developing comprehensive research protocols and public health intervention targeted at diabetes. A comprehensive view of stress can potentially explain the high prevalence of diabetes in developing countries and among Indigenous peoples. These results can be used to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing diabetes in the US-Mexico border region or similar areas, help identify at-risk individuals, and guide health education and promotion.

AB  - Objective: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis on the risk of repeat offending in individuals with psychosis and to assess the effect of potential moderating characteristics on risk estimates. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in 6 bibliographic databases from January 1966 to January 2009, supplemented with correspondence with authors. Studies that reported risks of repeat offending in individuals with psychotic disorders (n = 3511) compared with individuals with other psychiatric disorders (n = 5446) and healthy individuals (n = 71 552) were included. Risks of repeat offending were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted to examine how risk estimates were affected by various study characteristics including mean sample age, study location, sample size, study period, outcome measure, duration of follow-up, and diagnostic criteria. Results: Twenty-seven studies, which included 3511 individuals with psychosis, were identified. Compared with individuals without any psychiatric disorders, there was a significantly increased risk of repeat offending in individuals with psychosis (pooled OR = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-1.8), although this was only based on 4 studies. In contrast, there was no association when individuals with other psychiatric disorders were used as the comparison group (pooled OR = 1.0, 95% Cl = 0.7-1.3), although there was substantial heterogeneity. Higher risk estimates were found in female-only samples with psychosis and in studies conducted in the United States. Conclusions: The association between psychosis and repeat offending differed depending on the comparison group. Despite this, we found no support for the findings of previous reviews that psychosis is associated with a lower risk of repeat offending.

AB  - The proteasome, which identifies and destroys unwanted proteins rapidly, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery. However, when the proteasome becomes compromised in its function, it is attractive to think that the cell may switch to an alternative, non-proteolytic form of ubiquitination that could help divert cargo proteins away from an otherwise overloaded proteasome. Of the several types of ubiquitin chain topologies, K63-linked ubiquitination is the only one known to fulfil diverse proteasome-independent roles, including DNA repair, endocytosis and NF kappa B signaling. By virtue of its apparent dissociation from the proteasome, we have originally proposed that K63-linked ubiquitination may be involved in cargo diversion during proteasomal stress and accordingly, in the biogenesis of inclusion bodies associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we provide an overview of this non-classic form of ubiquitin modification, and discuss current evidence and controversies surrounding our proposed role for K63 polyubiquitin as a key regulator of inclusion dynamics that is relevant to neurodegeneration.

AB  - Aim Addictive behavior is a group of behavioral patterns that are auto-destructive; they are on the increase, have an obsessive-compulsive quality and significant physiological or biological components, and include a lack of ability or an inability to control craving. Health promotion has emerged as a viable approach and a tool for comprehensive and equitable health development. The intention of this paper was to show parts of orientations for health promotion related to prevention and control of drug addiction and drug abuse in theory and practice in the non-health profession and to emphasize the role of psychologists and the psychological profession.
   Subject and methods Statistical analysis of patients treated for addiction at health institutions in the Republic of Croatia from 2000 to 2007 published by the Croatian National Institute of Public Health and different methods of addiction prevention are presented in this paper.
   Results Status analysis indicates an increasing number of persons treated for addiction from 2000 to 2007 in Croatia, lowering of the age limit of the first addictive substance intake, as well as an overly long average period since the first intake to the first visit for treatment or commencing therapy. The need for prevention of addiction has been determined by the extent of its incidence. Modern studies of addiction have indicated two levels of preventive interventions: general, or psychosocial, prevention and the prevention of relapse or recidivism. Recent developments are based on the importance of social context recognition and this is the approach currently referred to as the ecological model.
   Conclusion Considering the fact that psychologists, as experts in the field of mental health protection, mostly practice in health care institutions, there is an emerging need for hiring more psychologists in primary prevention, i.e., at the level of primary health care, particularly in family and school medicine and within the entire education system. The concepts of lifelong learning and continuing professional development are a sine qua non of highly professional work of psychologists.

AB  - The past decade in Parkinson's disease (PD) research has been punctuated by numerous advances in understanding genetic factors that contribute to the disease. Common to most of the genetic models of Parkinsonian neurodegeneration are pathologic mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction, secretory vesicle dysfunction and oxidative stress that likely trigger common cell death mechanisms. Whereas presynaptic function is implicated in the function/dysfunction of a-synuclein, the first gene shown to contribute to PD, synaptic function has not comprised a major focus in most other genetic models. However, recent advances in understanding the impact of mutations in parkin and LRRK2 have also yielded insights into synaptic dysfunction as a possible early pathogenic mechanism. Autophagy is a common neuronal response in each of these genetic models of PD, participating in the clearance of protein aggregates and injured mitochondria. However, the potential consequences of autophagy upregulation on synaptic structure and function remain unknown. In this review, we discuss the evidence that supports a role for synaptic dysfunction in the neurodegenerative cascade in PD, and highlight unresolved questions concerning a potential role for autophagy in either pathological or compensatory synaptic remodeling.

AB  - Mind wandering (i.e. engaging in cognitions unrelated to the current demands of the external environment) reflects the cyclic activity of two core processes: the capacity to disengage attention from perception (known as perceptual decoupling) and the ability to take explicit note of the current contents of consciousness (known as meta-awareness). Research on perceptual decoupling demonstrates that mental events that arise without any external precedent (known as stimulus independent thoughts) often interfere with the online processing of sensory information. Findings regarding meta-awareness reveal that the mind is only intermittently aware of engaging in mind wandering. These basic aspects of mind wandering are considered with respect to the activity of the default network, the role of executive processes, the contributions of meta-awareness and the functionality of mind wandering.

AB  - In recent years much has been learned about how a single computational processing step is implemented in the brain. By contrast, we still have surprisingly little knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms by which multiple such operations are sequentially assembled into mental algorithms. We outline a theory of how individual neural processing steps might be combined into serial programs. We propose a hybrid neuronal device: each step involves massively parallel computation that feeds a slow and serial production system. Production selection is mediated by a system of competing accumulator neurons that extends the role of these neurons beyond the selection of a motor action. Productions change the state of sensory and mnemonic neurons and iteration of such cycles provides a basis for mental programs.

AB  - Neuronal dysfunctions and neurodegeneration are often associated with defects in membrane transport. Synucleinopathies are a diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders that share a common pathological feature - insoluble aggregates composed largely of the protein alpha-synuclein in certain populations of neurons and glia. The actual physiological function of the brain-enriched alpha-synuclein is still not particularly clear. What is obvious is that when the protein is present in pathologically high amounts, or in mutant forms with enhanced membrane association and oligomerization, it causes neuronal demise with manifestations of impaired neuronal traffic, heightened oxidative stress, mitochondrial degeneration and defects in lipid metabolism. alpha-synuclein's direct association with the activities of key components of the eukaryotic membrane traffic machinery, namely Rabs and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), has highlighted a key role for membrane transport defects in alpha-synuclein-mediated pathology. Here, we summarize and discuss recent findings in this regard, and their implications in the molecular aspects of synucleinopathy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, areflexia, loss of vibratory and position sense, and a progressive motor weakness of central origin. Additional features include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and diabetes. Large GAA repeat expansions in the first intron of the FXN gene are the most common mutation underlying FRDA. Patients show severely reduced levels of a FXN-encoded mitochondrial protein called frataxin. Frataxin deficiency is associated with abnormalities of iron metabolism: decreased iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis, accumulation of iron in mitochondria and depletion in the cytosol, enhanced cellular iron uptake. Some models have also shown reduced heme synthesis. Evidence for oxidative stress has been reported. Respiratory chain dysfunction aggravates oxidative stress by increasing leakage of electrons and the formation of superoxide. In vitro studies have demonstrated that Frataxin deficient cells not only generate more free radicals, but also show a reduced capacity to mobilize antioxidant defenses. The search for experimental drugs increasing the amount of frataxin is a very active and timely area of investigation. In cellular and in animal model systems, the replacement of frataxin function seems to alleviate the symptoms or even completely reverse the phenotype. Therefore, drugs increasing the amount of frataxin are attractive candidates for novel therapies. This review will discuss recent findings on FRDA pathogenesis, frataxin function, new treatments, as well as recent animal and cellular models. Controversial aspects are also discussed.

AB  - Almost a quarter of a century ago, interleukin-6 (IL-6) was discovered as an inflammatory cytokine involved in B cell differentiation. Today, IL-6 is recognized to be a highly versatile cytokine, with pleiotropic actions not only in immune cells, but also in other cell types, such as cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The first evidence implicating IL-6 in brain-related processes originated from its dysregulated expression in several neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In addition, IL-6 was shown to be involved in multiple physiological CNS processes such as neuron homeostasis, astrogliogenesis and neuronal differentiation. The molecular mechanisms underlying IL-6 functions in the brain have only recently started to emerge. In this review, an overview of the latest discoveries concerning the actions of IL-6 in the nervous system is provided. The central position of IL-6 in the neuroinflammatory reaction pattern, and more specifically, the role of IL-6 in specific neurodegenerative processes, which accompany Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and excitotoxicity, are discussed. It is evident that IL-6 has a dichotomic action in the CNS, displaying neurotrophic properties on the one hand, and detrimental actions on the other. This is in agreement with its central role in neuroinflammation, which evolved as a beneficial process, aimed at maintaining tissue homeostasis, but which can become malignant when exaggerated. In this perspective, it is not surprising that 'well-meant' actions of IL-6 are often causing harm instead of leading to recovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cognitive neuroscience research on facial expression recognition and face evaluation has proliferated over the past 15 years. Nevertheless, large questions remain unanswered. In this overview, we discuss the current understanding in the field, and describe what is known and what remains unknown. In 2, we describe three types of behavioural evidence that the perception of traits in neutral faces is related to the perception of facial expressions, and may rely on the same mechanisms. In 3, we discuss cortical systems for the perception of facial expressions, and argue for a partial segregation of function in the superior temporal sulcus and the fusiform gyrus. In 4, we describe the current understanding of how the brain responds to emotionally neutral faces. To resolve some of the inconsistencies in the literature, we perform a large group analysis across three different studies, and argue that one parsimonious explanation of prior findings is that faces are coded in terms of their typicality. In 5, we discuss how these two lines of research-perception of emotional expressions and face evaluation-could be integrated into a common, cognitive neuroscience framework.

AB  - Ethanol intake causes gene expression changes resulting in cellular and molecular adaptations that could be associated with a predisposition to alcohol dependence. Recently, several research groups have used high-throughput gene expression profiling to search for alcohol-responsive genes in Drosophila melanogaster. Comparison of data from these studies highlights the functional similarities in their results despite differences in their experimental approach and selection cases. Notably, alcohol-responsive gene sets associated with stress response, olfaction, metabolism, proteases, transcriptional regulation, regulation of signal transduction, nucleic acid binding and cytoskeletal organisation were markedly common to these studies. These data support the view that changes in gene expression in alcoholics are associated with widespread cellular functions.

AB  - In a recent paper, Chiarello, Welcome, Halderman, and Leonard (2009) reported positive correlations between word-related visual field asymmetries and reading performance. They argued that strong word processing lateralization represents a more optimal brain organization for reading acquisition. Their empirical results contrasted sharply with those of another such large-scale study, by Boles, Barth, and Merrill (2008). We reported negative correlations between asymmetry and performance when both were measured using the same visual lexical tasks. Most recently, within-task negative correlations were also reported by Hirnstein, Leask, Rose, and Hausmann (2010). Here two major differences between studies are explored. Task purity refers to the influence of the same mental processes on both the asymmetry and performance measures, and is arguably maximal in studies measuring both within the same task. The other difference concerns the measurement of asymmetry. Linear corrections for ceiling and floor effects were used by Chiarello et al. and Hirnstein et al., while we used a more appropriate nonlinear one. Their results are difficult to interpret for those reasons. The operation of a third variable to which both asymmetry and performance are positively correlated could also be a factor in the Chiarello et al. findings. The Boles et al. findings reflect a negative correlation between an asymmetric visual lexical process and performance measured within the same task. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heavy metals have become one of the most serious anthropogenic stressors for plants and other living organisms. Having efficient and feasible bioassays available to assess the ecotoxicological risks deriving from soil pollution is necessary. This work determines pollution by Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V and Zn in two soils used for growing rice from the Albufera Natural Park in Valencia (Spain). Both were submitted to a different degree of anthropic activity, and their ecotoxicological risk was assessed by four ecotoxicity tests to compare their effectiveness: Microtox (R) test, Zucconi test, pot bioassay (PB) and soil plate bioassay (SPB). The sensitivity of three plant species (barley, cress and lettuce) was also assessed. The results reveal a different degree of effectiveness and level of inhibition in the target organisms' growth depending on the test applied, to such an extent that the one-way analysis of variance showed significant differences only for the plate bioassay results, with considerable inhibition of root and shoot elongation in seedlings. Of the three plant species selected, lettuce was the most sensitive species to toxic effects, followed by cress and barley. Finally, the results also indicate that the SPB is an efficient, simple and economic alternative to other ecotoxicological assays to assess toxicity risks deriving from soil pollution.

AB  - Objectives. The lack of a suitable sham condition for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) research may compromise the success of blinding procedures. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the reporting of blinding success in randomised sham-controlled trials (RCTs) of rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Methods. A literature search using Pubmed and Web of Science was conducted to identify RCTs of rTMS. Regression analyses were used to investigate whether participants in the real and sham rTMS groups differed in (1) their ability to correctly guess to which intervention they had been randomised, and (2) how likely they were to think they had received real rTMS. Results. Thirteen out of 96 (13.5%) RCTs reported blinding success. Available data from 9/13 studies showed that participants in real and sham rTMS groups were not significantly different in their ability to correctly guess their intervention allocation, but with a trend for participants in the real group to more often guess correctly. However, people in the real rTMS groups were significantly more likely to think they had received real rTMS compared with those in sham rTMS groups. Conclusions. Few RCTs in rTMS report on blinding success. As current sham methods may inadequately mimic real rTMS, this could result in only partial success of blinding and bias estimations of treatment effects.

AB  - Background A number of prospective cohort studies have examined the association between intelligence in childhood or youth and life expectancy in adulthood; however, the effect size of this association is yet to be quantified and previous reviews require updating.
   Methods The systematic review included an electronic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE and PSYCHINFO databases. This yielded 16 unrelated studies that met inclusion criteria, comprising 22 453 deaths among 1 107 022 participants. Heterogeneity was assessed, and fixed effects models were applied to the aggregate data. Publication bias was evaluated, and sensitivity analyses were conducted.
   Results A 1-standard deviation (SD) advantage in cognitive test scores was associated with a 24% (95% confidence interval 23-25) lower risk of death, during a 17- to 69-year follow-up. There was little evidence of publication bias (Egger's intercept = 0.10, P = 0.81), and the intelligence-mortality association was similar for men and women. Adjustment for childhood socio-economic status (SES) in the nine studies containing these data had almost no impact on this relationship, suggesting that this is not a confounder of the intelligence-mortality association. Controlling for adult SES in five studies and for education in six studies attenuated the intelligence-mortality hazard ratios by 34 and 54%, respectively.
   Conclusions Future investigations should address the extent to which attenuation of the intelligence-mortality link by adult SES indicators is due to mediation, over-adjustment and/or confounding. The explanation(s) for association between higher early-life intelligence and lower risk of adult mortality require further elucidation.

AB  - Ageing is the greatest risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease. However, the current dogma holds that cellular mechanisms that are associated with ageing of midbrain dopamine neurons and those that are related to dopamine neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease are unrelated. We propose, based on evidence from studies of non-human primates, that normal ageing and the degeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease are linked by the same cellular mechanisms and, therefore, that markers of cellular risk factors accumulate with age in a pattern that mimics the pattern of degeneration observed in Parkinson's disease. We contend that ageing induces a pre-parkinsonian state, and that the cellular mechanisms of dopamine neuron demise during normal ageing are accelerated or exaggerated in Parkinson's disease through a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

AB  - This paper presents the Adaptive Calibration Model (ACM), an evolutionary-developmental theory of individual differences in the functioning of the stress response system. The stress response system has three main biological functions: (1) to coordinate the organism's allostatic response to physical and psychosocial challenges; (2) to encode and filter information about the organism's social and physical environment, mediating the organism's openness to environmental inputs; and (3) to regulate the organism's physiology and behavior in a broad range of fitness-relevant areas including defensive behaviors, competitive risk-taking, learning, attachment, affiliation and reproductive functioning. The information encoded by the system during development feeds back on the long-term calibration of the system itself, resulting in adaptive patterns of responsivity and individual differences in behavior. Drawing on evolutionary life history theory, we build a model of the development of stress responsivity across life stages, describe four prototypical responsivity patterns, and discuss the emergence and meaning of sex differences. The ACM extends the theory of biological sensitivity to context (BSC) and provides an integrative framework for future research in the field. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The treatment of a quantized field in a curved spacetime requires the study of backreaction of the field on the spacetime via the semiclassical Einstein equation. We consider a free scalar field in spatially flat Robertson-Walker spacetime. We require the state of the field to allow for a renormalized semiclassical stress tensor. We calculate the singularities of the stress tensor restricted to equal times in agreement with the usual renormalization prescription for Hadamard states to perform an explicit renormalization. The dynamical system for the Robertson-Walker scale parameter a(t) coupled to the scalar field is finally derived for the case of conformal and also general coupling.

AB  - Context: A number of studies have found that the use of cannabis and other psychoactive substances is associated with an earlier onset of psychotic illness.
   Objective: To establish the extent to which use of cannabis, alcohol, and other psychoactive substances affects the age at onset of psychosis by meta-analysis.
   Data Sources: Peer-reviewed publications in English reporting age at onset of psychotic illness in substance-using and non-substance-using groups were located using searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and ISI Web of Science.
   Study Selection: Studies in English comparing the age at onset of psychosis in cohorts of patients who use substances with age at onset of psychosis in non-substance-using patients. The searches yielded 443 articles, from which 83 studies met the inclusion criteria.
   Data Extraction: Information on study design, study population, and effect size were extracted independently by 2 of us.
   Data Synthesis: Meta-analysis found that the age at onset of psychosis for cannabis users was 2.70 years younger (standardized mean difference=-0.414) than for nonusers; for those with broadly defined substance use, the age at onset of psychosis was 2.00 years younger (standardized mean difference=-0.315) than for nonusers. Alcohol use was not associated with a significantly earlier age at onset of psychosis. Differences in the proportion of cannabis users in the substance-using group made a significant contribution to the heterogeneity in the effect sizes between studies, confirming an association between cannabis use and earlier mean age at onset of psychotic illness.
   Conclusions: The results of meta-analysis provide evidence for a relationship between cannabis use and earlier onset of psychotic illness, and they support the hypothesis that cannabis use plays a causal role in the development of psychosis in some patients. The results suggest the need for renewed warnings about the potentially harmful effects of cannabis.

AB  - Little is known about the use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) among refugees, despite the common practice of CAM in many non-Western countries. We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature using nine electronic databases. We included articles pertaining to refugees and CAM (whole medical systems, mind body medicine, herbal remedies, manipulative therapies, energy medicine). Qualitative and quantitative data were compiled and analyzed through descriptive statistics and chi square distribution tables. We reviewed 237 abstracts, and 47 publications met our inclusion criteria. Twenty-six papers documented whole medical systems; 11 mind-body medicine; 5 biologically based practices; 4 manipulative and body-based therapies; and 1 study documented the use of energy medicine. There were 3 clinical trials, 20 surveys, 12 case reports, 2 participant-observer qualitative papers, and 10 review papers. Most studies focused on Asian refugee populations (66%; n = 31). Mental problems related to trauma accounted for 36% of CAM use (17). Among included articles, methodological quality was extremely low. Our results show evidence that type of CAM used by refugees may vary based on ethnicity, yet this is most likely due to a bias in the medical literature. Efforts are needed to further explore these results and expand research within this field.

AB  - Background
   High levels of comorbid physical illness and excess mortality rates have been previously documented in people with severe mental illness, but outcomes following myocardial infarction and other acute coronary syndromes are less clear.
   Aims
   To examine inequalities in the provision of invasive coronary procedures (revascularisation, angiography, angioplasty and bypass grafting) and subsequent mortality in people with mental illness and in those with schizophrenia, compared with those without mental ill health.
   Method
   Systematic search and random effects meta-analysis were used according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies of mental health and cardiovascular procedures following cardiac events were eligible but we required a minimum of three independent studies to warrant pooling by procedure type. We searched Medline/PubMed and EMBASE abstract databases and Science Direct, Ingenta Select, Springer Link and Online Wiley Library full text databases.
   Results
   We identified 22 analyses of possible inequalities in coronary procedures in those with defined mental disorder, of which 10 also reported results in schizophrenia or related psychosis. All studies following acute coronary syndrome originated in the USA. The total sample size was 825754 individuals. Those with mental disorders received 0.86 (relative risk, RR: 95% CI 0.80-0.92, P<0.0001) of comparable procedures with significantly lower receipt of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; RR=0.85, 95% CI 0.72-1.00), cardiac catheterisation (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.95) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or percutaneous coronary intervention (PTCA/PCI; RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.72-1.05). People with a diagnosis of schizophrenia received only 0.53 (95% CI 0.44-0.64, P<0.0001) of the usual procedure rate with significantly lower receipt of CABG (RR=0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.85) and PTCA/PCI (RR=0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.75). We identified 6 related studies examining mortality following cardiac events: for those with mental illness there was a 1.11 relative risk of mortality up to 1 year (95% CI 1.00-1.24, P=0.05) but there was insufficient evidence to examine mortality rates in schizophrenia alone.
   Conclusions
   Following cardiac events, individuals with mental illness experience a 14% lower rate of invasive coronary interventions (47% in the case of schizophrenia) and they have an 11% increased mortality rate. Further work is required to explore whether these factors are causally linked and whether improvements in medical care might improve survival in those with mental ill health.

AB  - Neuroscience has increasingly explored the neural mechanisms underlying our sense of self. Recent studies have demonstrated the recruitment of regions like the ventral tegmental area, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the ventral striatum to self-specific stimuli-regions typically associated with reward-related processing. This raises the question of whether there is a relationship between self and reward and, if so, how these different fields can be linked. Three relationship models that aim to explore the relationship between self and reward are discussed here: integration, segregation, and parallel processing. Their pros and cons are reviewed in light of the most recent findings. The conclusion is that both the fields of self and reward may benefit from increased interaction. This interaction may help to fill in some of the missing pieces regarding reward-related processing, as well as illuminate how brain function can bring forward the philosophical concept and psychological reality of self.

AB  - This commentary on ideas about neural mechanisms underlying pain is aimed at providing perspective for a reader who does not work in the field of mammalian somatic sensation. It is not a comprehensive review of the literature. The organization is historical to chronicle the evolution of ideas. The aim is to call attention to source of concepts and how various ideas have fared over time.
   One difficulty in relating concepts about pain is that the term is used to refer to human and animal reactions ranging from protective spinal reflexes to complex affective behaviors. As a result, the spectrum of "pain"-related neural organization extends to operation of multiple neuronal arrangements.
   Thinking about pain has shadowed progress in understanding biological mechanisms, in particular the manner of function of nervous systems. This essay concentrates on the evolution of information and concepts from the early 19th century to the present. Topics include the assumptions underlying currently active theories about pain mechanisms. At the end, brief consideration is given to present-day issues, e.g., chronic pain, central pain, and the view of pain as an emotion rather than a sensation. The conceptual progression shows that current controversies have old roots and that failed percepts often resurface after seemingly having been put to rest by argument and evidence.

AB  - The ability to infer other people's mental states (i.e. Theory of Mind, TOM) is a major topic of interest in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, it is only recently that there has been an assessment of cognitive and affective components of ToM ability in neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we examine studies investigating the ToM ability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Taken together, these studies provide preliminary evidence that ToM difficulties may occur in PD patients. In particular, these difficulties principally involve the cognitive component of ToM in the early stages of the disease. The spatio-temporal progression of dopamine depletion supports the hypothesis that the affective component may only be affected in the advanced stages of the disease. The relationships between executive functioning, dopaminergic therapies, and ToM in PD as well as the relationships between frontostriatal circuits and ToM processing are discussed.

Results and Discussion: Spontaneously hypertensive rats, in addition to expressing the main features of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder 9impulsivity, hyperactivity, and attention deficit), appear to be more sensitive to psychostimulants, cannabinoids, and opioids and drink large amounts of alcohol. Repeated treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with methylphenidate 9a firstchoice drug for the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) or exposure to an enriched environment during adolescence resulted in an increase or decrease, respectively, in alcohol consumption in adulthood. These results suggest that environmental factors can either favor or confer resistance to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders comorbidity. Although research is at the very early stage in this field, spontaneously hypertensive rats appear to be a useful animal model for the study of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders comorbidity.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in bipolar disorder (BPD).
   Methods: Clinical trials on the treatment of BPD with ECT were systematically reviewed. A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and ISI Web of Science databases was conducted in March 2010.
   Results: A total of 51 articles met our selection criteria. Only 3 controlled or comparative prospective trials addressed the treatment of mania with ECT. In these studies, which had small samples, ECT was superior to simulated ECT, lithium, or the combination of lithium and haloperidol. We did not find any controlled or comparative prospective trial on the efficacy of ECT in bipolar depression. In the 4 retrospective studies that compared ECT with antidepressants, no difference was observed between them. In 9 of 10 trials that compared bipolar with unipolar depressed patients, ECT was equally efficacious for both groups of patients. Of the 6 studies of patients with BPD that performed a comparison between pre-ECT versus post-ECT, only 1 study showed a worsening in cognition after the treatment.
   Conclusions: There are no studies with adequate methodology on the treatment of BPD with ECT. The lack of scientific evidence contrasts with broad anecdotal clinical experience that suggests that ECT is an important tool in the treatment of BPD, especially in more severe or refractory cases. The marked stigma associated with ECT and the lack of large financial support may account for the paucity of ECT research.

AB  - Objective:
   Psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been associated with problematically low treatment completion rates.
   Method:
   PsycInfo and Medline were systematically searched to identify studies providing information on treatment completion in psychotherapy models that have been shown to be effective for BPD. A meta-analysis of treatment completion rates and a narrative analysis of factors predicting dropout were conducted.
   Results:
   Forty-one studies were included, with completion rates ranging from 36% to 100%- a substantial between-study heterogeneity. Random effects meta-analyses yielded an overall completion rate of 75% (95% CI: 68-82%) for interventions of < 12 months duration, and 71% (95% CI: 65-76%) for longer interventions. Egger's test for publication bias was significant for both analyses (P < 0.01). Study characteristics such as treatment model and treatment setting did not explain between-study heterogeneity. In individual studies, factors predicting dropout status included commitment to change, the therapeutic relationship and impulsivity, whilst sociodemographics were consistently non-predictive.
   Conclusion:
   Borderline personality disorder should no longer be associated with high rates of dropout from treatment. However, the substantial variation in completion rates between studies remains unexplained. Research on the psychological processes involved in dropping out of treatment could further improve dropout rates.

AB  - The development of trait markers of schizophrenia would represent an important advance in understanding the genetic architecture of the disease. To date, no candidate markers have satisfied all of the trait marker criteria, and many are not specific to the schizophrenia spectrum. Abnormalities in visual scanpaths are frequently reported in patients with schizophrenia and are emerging as a novel candidate for a schizophrenia biomarker. Here we review the suitability of scanpath measures as a target for trait marker research in schizophrenia. Papers reporting scanpath patterns in patients with schizophrenia were identified by PubMed and Google Scholar searches and by scanning reference lists in relevant articles. Search terms included "schizophrenia," "psychosis," "scanpath," "scan path," "fixation," "saccade" and "eye movement." Scanpath abnormalities afford impressive sensitivity and specificity and appear largely independent of psychotropic medications. Scanpaths may demonstrate some fluctuation with symptomatology and may be useful in illuminating illness state or subtypes. However, there is evidence that viewing behaviours remain atypical regardless of symptom remission and may be present in unaffected relatives of individuals with schizophrenia. This research is in its early stages, and further investigation regarding patterns of inheritance is required. Our findings support scanpath measures as a favourable topic for further investigation as a trait marker.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia affecting the elderly population today; however, there is currently no accurate description of the etiology of this devastating disorder. No single factor has been demonstrated as being causative; however, an alternative co-factors theory suggests that the interaction of multiple risk factors is responsible for AD. We have used this model, in combination with the original cholinergic hypothesis of AD to propose a "new" cholinergic hypothesis that we present in this review. This new version takes into account recent findings from the literature and our reports of removal of medial septum cholinergic projections to the hippocampus reduces both behavioural and anatomical plasticity, resulting in greater cognitive impairment in response to secondary insults (stress, injury, disease, etc.). We will first summarize the experimental results and discuss some potential mechanisms that could explain our results. We will then present our 'new' version of the cholinergic hypothesis and how it relates to the field of AD research today. Finally we will discuss some of the implications for treatment that arise from this model and present directions for future study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cannabis is currently the most widely consumed illegal drug in both Europe and the United States. Cannabis dependence criteria are defined by the principal diagnostic manuals (DSM-IV and ICD-10), but not cannabis withdrawal syndrome, although cannabis withdrawal produces certain significant symptoms that are beginning to be typified by research. While not all cannabis users present mental health problems, recent reviews point to a greater risk of various mental disorders in cannabis users. The risks are associated with younger age at first use, greater frequency of use or certain personal predispositions. Research has revealed not only alterations in both the psychotic and affective spectra, but also cognitive deterioration and associations between cannabis use and antisocial behavior, use of other illegal drugs and other health risks. Although contaminating factors and the difficulty of accurately assessing the extent and history of cannabis use represent considerable obstacles to progress in this research field, studies carried out in recent years have contributed conclusive findings on the potential risks of cannabis use. The present article reviews the main scientific findings and conclusions with respect to the association between cannabis use and mental health.

AB  - Amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) varies in size from 39 to 43 amino acids and arises from sequential beta- and gamma-secretase processing of the amyloid precursor protein. Whereas the non-pathological role for A beta is yet to be established, there is no disputing that A beta is now widely regarded as central to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The so named "amyloid cascade hypothesis" states that disease progression is the result of an increased A beta burden in affected areas of the brain. To elucidate the Ab role in AD, many analytical approaches have been proposed as suitable tools to investigate not only the total A beta load but also many other issues that are considered crucial for AD, such as: (i) the aggregation state in which A beta is present; (ii) its interaction with other species or metals; (iii) its ability to induce oxidative stress; and (iv) its degradative pathways. This review provides an insight into the use of mass spectrometry (MS) in the field of A beta investigation aimed to assess its role in AD. In particular, the different MS-based approaches applied in vitro and in vivo that can provide detailed information on the above-mentioned issues are reviewed. Moreover, the advantages offered by the MS methods over all the other techniques are highlighted, together with the recent developments and uses of combined analytical approaches to detect and characterize A beta.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An epidemic of overweight and obesity in the United States has had profound effects on the health of the general population, with consequent development of metabolic syndrome and related morbidity and mortality. However, these effects have been more widespread among adults with serious and persistent mental illness.
   METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Ovid databases. Terms used, in varying combinations, were schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, obesity, atypical antipsychotic, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. Of 103 articles generated, 71 were deemed pertinent to the current study. One reference was decided upon based on personal communication.
   RESULTS: Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic factors contribute to obesity development in adults with serious and persistent mental illness. Consequently, similarly targeted nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions have been used to mitigate against body weight gain. Although the results obtained thus far are promising, effect sizes only in the low to medium range have been realized, with nonpharmacologic interventions demonstrating slight superiority.
   CONCLUSIONS: Improved therapeutic methods are needed to address the effects of obesity on individuals with serious and persistent mental illness. Factors that will likely contribute to such advancement are a better understanding of the mechanisms involved, earlier intervention, and adequately powered, randomized controlled trials of sufficient duration, with baseline body weight as a covariate.

AB  - Objective: To review the state of the art of the scientific literature on binge eating disorder in Latin America. Method: A literature search of studies conducted in Latin American countries using the term "binge eating" was performed in the following electronic databases: PubMed, LILACS, SciELO and PsycINFO. Selected articles described studies developed with Latin American samples that met partial or complete DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder. Results: 8,123 articles were screened and 30 studies met the inclusion criteria (18 cross-sectional studies, 5 clinical trials, 4 case reports, 2 validity studies, and 1 cohort study). Most of the studies were conducted in Brazil (27), One in Argentina, one in Colombia, and one in Venezuela. The prevalence of binge eating disorder among obese people attending weight loss programs ranged between 16% and 51.6%. The comparison between obese people with and without binge eating disorder showed a tendency of higher weight, longer history of weight fluctuation. more concern about shape and weight, and association with psychiatric comorbidity in those with binge eating disorder Conclusion: Binge eating disorder is a detectable phenomenon in Latin America with clinical features similar to those found in the international literature. This review provides support for the consideration of binge eating disorder as a distinct eating disorder in the International Classification of Diseases - 11th edition.

AB  - Objective In order to devise effective preventive strategies, it is important to study workplace stressors that might increase the risk of workplace accidents both affecting workers themselves as well as causing harm to third-parties. The aim of this report is to provide a systematic, updated overview and scientific review of empirical research regarding accidents in relation to long work hours and shift work, primarily based on epidemiological studies.
   Methods The search for articles was part of a large review study on the effects of work hours on various health outcomes, safety, and performance. The search strategy included 5 international scientific databases, and nearly 7000 articles were initially identified using our search string. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 443 publications were found and evaluated using a pre-defined scoring system. Of these, 43 concerned safety and accidents but only 14 were considered to be of high quality (total score 2 or 3 on a scale from 0-3) and therefore used for this study.
   Results Both shift work and long working hours present a substantial and well-documented detrimental effect on safety all the studies that are included in this review have one or more significant findings in this respect. The trends are quite coherent although the increases in accident rates are mostly from 50% to 100%. In epidemiological terms, these may be considered rather small differences. The use of such data is therefore only of importance if the accident incidence is high or if accidents may have large effects.
   Conclusions The findings are most relevant to safety-critical activities such as the transport and health sectors. Work periods >8 hours carry an increased risk of accidents that cumulates, so that the increased risk of accidents at around 12 hours is twice the risk at 8 hours. Shift work including nights carries a substantial increased risk of accidents, whereas "pure" night work may bring some protection against this effect due to resynchronization. The evaluated studies give no clear indications of any age or gender being specifically susceptible to or protected against the effects of work times scheduling on accident risk.

AB  - Background: The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize existing evidence about treatment satisfaction among clients with substance misuse and mental health co-morbidity (dual diagnoses, DD).
   Methods: We examined satisfaction with treatment received, variations in satisfaction levels by type of treatment intervention and by diagnosis (i.e. DD clients vs. single diagnosis clients), and the influence of factors other than treatment type on satisfaction. Peer-reviewed studies published in English since 1970 were identified by searching electronic databases using pre-defined search strings.
   Results: Across the 27 studies that met inclusion criteria, high average satisfaction scores were found. In most studies, integrated DD treatment yielded greater client satisfaction than standard treatment without explicit DD focus. In standard treatment without DD focus, DD clients tended to be less satisfied than single diagnosis clients. Whilst the evidence base on client and treatment variables related to satisfaction is small, it suggested client demographics and symptom severity to be unrelated to treatment satisfaction. However, satisfaction tended to be linked to other treatment process and outcome variables. Findings are limited in that many studies had very small sample sizes, did not use validated satisfaction instruments and may not have controlled for potential confounders. A framework for further research in this important area is discussed.
   Conclusions: High satisfaction levels with current treatment provision, especially among those in integrated treatment, should enhance therapeutic optimism among practitioners dealing with DD clients.

AB  - Cholinergic neurons and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain participate in diverse functions: reward, learning and memory, mood, sensory processing, pain, and neuroprotection. Nicotinic systems also have well-known roles in drug abuse. Here, we review recent insights into nicotinic function, linking exogenous and endogenous manipulations of nAChRs to alterations in synapses, circuits, and behavior. We also discuss how these contemporary advances can motivate attempts to exploit nicotinic systems therapeutically in Parkinson's disease, cognitive decline, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.

KW  - PEOPLE
AB  - Object: The concept of recovery has been recognized as important in the treatment of mental illness. A number of specific instruments exist which are designed to: (i) measure recovery at an individual level; and (ii) assess the recovery orientation of services. The current review aimed to identify these and evaluate their potential for routine use in Australian public sector mental health services.
   Method: We identified potential instruments by drawing on existing reviews, searching MEDLINE and PsycINFO, and consulting with experts. We used a hierarchical criterion-based approach to assess whether given instruments might be candidates for measuring recovery in the Australian context.
   Results: We identified 33 instruments: 22 designed to measure individuals' recovery and 11 designed to assess the recovery orientation of services (or providers). Four of the former (Recovery Assessment Scale; Illness Management and Recovery Scales; Stages of Recovery Instrument; Recovery Process Inventory) and four of the latter (Recovery Oriented Systems Indicators Measure; Recovery Self Assessment; Recovery Oriented Practices Index; Recovery Promotion Fidelity Scale) were identified as promising candidates for routine use in Australian public sector mental health services.
   Conclusions: Further work is required, however, to determine which, if any, might best be used for this purpose; the possibility that modifications to existing instruments or the development of new instruments might be required should not be ruled out. It might be desirable to invest in two instruments: one designed to measure individuals' recovery and one designed to measure the recovery orientation of services. If Australia were to go down this path, it would make sense to align indicators in each as far as possible, and to ensure that they were consistent with existing endeavours aimed at monitoring and improving recovery-focused aspects of service quality.

AB  - Surprisingly little headway has been made towards understanding how brain growth maps onto mental growth during child development. This review aims at bridging and integrating recent human neuroscientific brain maturation findings with the conceptual thinking of theorists in the behavioural tradition of studying cognitive development. Developmental research in the field of internal control and self-regulation serves as a reference point for understanding the relation between brain maturation and mental growth. Using several recent neuroimaging findings as points in case, we show how a deeper appreciation of structural and functional neural development can be obtained from considering the traditional conceptual frameworks, and vice versa. We conclude that paradigmatic progress in developmental neuroscience can rely more on knowledge from developmental experimental psychology, and that developmental models of cognitive development can be constrained and articulated with more precision on the basis of knowledge of differential structural and functional brain maturation.

AB  - Postpartum psychosis is a serious disorder that can cause negative consequences for the mother, infant, and entire family. While reports of this condition date back for centuries, little is known about what interventions are most effective for this population. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the research evidence on interventions for the prevention and treatment of postpartum psychosis. Studies were searched using CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases. All primary research studies published in English since 1970 that explored interventions for the prevention or treatment of postpartum psychosis were included. The search resulted in 26 studies on interventions for postpartum psychosis, with 10 focusing on prevention and 17 focusing on treatment. Studies on the prevention of postpartum psychosis have examined the effects of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and hormone therapy, while those examining treatment have included electroconvulsive therapy, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, hormones, and the beta blocker propranolol. Only preliminary evidence suggests which interventions may be effective strategies to prevent (e.g., lithium) and treat (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy) postpartum psychosis. Due to methodological limitations in the studies reviewed, extensive evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum psychosis cannot be made. The known risk factors and negative consequences of postpartum psychosis point to the importance of preventative and acute treatment measures. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to determine the efficacy of prevention and treatment interventions for women who experience postpartum psychosis.

AB  - The search for fast-acting antidepressants has been a major challenge in neuropsychopharmacology for many years. Although the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in the mechanisms of action of classical antidepressants has been clearly established, the delayed onset of action of these drugs prompted several authors to propose alternative targets in order to achieve a more rapid relief of symptoms in depressed patients. However, recent studies indicate that it may be possible to elaborate fast-acting antidepressant strategies based on 5-HT, provided that such strategies would directly target 5-HT neuron electrical activity. Furthermore, glutamatergic pyramidal neurons projecting from the medial prefrontal cortex to the dorsal raphe appear to play a critical role. This article presents some of the data that support this hypothesis, including results from medial prefrontal cortex deep-brain stimulation studies, as well as those related to treatments with 5-HT4 agonists and 5-HT7 antagonists.

AB  - Objective. - Schizoaffective disorder is a common diagnosis in mental health services. The present article aims to provide an overview of diagnostic reliability, symptomatology, outcome, neurobiology and treatment of schizoaffective disorder.
   Method. - Literature was identified by searches in "Medline" and "Cochrane Library".
   Results. - The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder has a low reliability. There are marked differences between the current diagnostic systems. With respect to psychopathological symptoms, no clear boundaries were found between schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and affective disorders. Common neurobiological factors were found across the traditional diagnostic categories. Schizoaffective disorder according to ICD-10 criteria, but not to DSM-IV criteria, shows a more favorable outcome than schizophrenia. With regard to treatment, only a small and heterogeneous database exists.
   Conclusion. - Due to the low reliability and questionable validity there is a substantial need for revision and unification of the current diagnostic concepts of schizoaffective disorder. If future diagnostic systems return to Kraepelin's dichotomous classification of non-organic psychosis or adopt a dimensional diagnostic approach, schizoaffective disorder will disappear from the psychiatric nomenclature. A nosological model with multiple diagnostic entities, however, would be compatible with retaining the diagnostic category of schizoaffective disorder. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Objectives. In a 2-part series, the current literature with respect to adherence to tuberculosis care among Canadian Aboriginal populations is reviewed. In the current paper, which comprises part 1 of this review, adherence is defined, and methods of measurement, issues of responsibility and potential barriers to adherence are explored.
   Study design. Literature review.
   Methods. A systematic search and analytic review of relevant studies was undertaken, including an online search of electronic databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Native Health Database, Scopus, Social Science Citation Index) and publications by governmental and non-governmental agencies.
   Results. Poor adherence to therapy for TB disease is the most common cause of initial treatment failure and of disease relapse worldwide. Adherence to care for TB disease is necessary for the health of both the affected individual and society as a whole. Adherence is a task-specific behaviour that is not inherent to ethnic identity. The term applies only when common agreement over a care plan has been reached between patient and provider. The International Standards for Tuberculosis Care and the Patients Charter outline the responsibilities for adherence on the part of both patients and providers. For Canadian Aboriginals, barriers to adherence may derive from a complex interaction between the health system, personal factors and social factors, which may include dysfunctional acute and public health systems, dissonant (between health care provider and patient) belief systems, concurrent co-morbidities and life stressors, poverty and social stigma.
   Conclusions. Adherence is a task-specific behaviour, not a personality trait. It is influenced by the interaction of systemic, personal and societal factors. These factors must be understood within the historical experience of TB and the cultural meaning of health and illness among Indigenous Canadians. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2011; 70(2):113-127)

AB  - Paleolithic stone tools provide concrete evidence of major developments in human behavioural and cognitive evolution. Of particular interest are evolving cognitive mechanisms implied by the cultural transmission of increasingly complex prehistoric technologies, hypothetically including motor resonance, causal reasoning and mentalizing. To test the relevance of these mechanisms to specific Paleolithic technologies, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of Naive, Trained and Expert subjects observing two toolmaking methods of differing complexity and antiquity: the simple 'Oldowan' method documented by the earliest tools 2.5 million years ago; and the more complex 'Acheulean' method used to produce refined tools 0.5 million years ago. Subjects observed 20-s video clips of an expert demonstrator, followed by behavioural tasks designed to maintain attention. Results show that observational understanding of Acheulean toolmaking involves increased demands for the recognition of abstract technological intentions. Across subject groups, Acheulean compared with Oldowan toolmaking was associated with activation of left anterior intraparietal and inferior frontal sulci, indicating the relevance of resonance mechanisms. Between groups, Naive subjects relied on bottom-up kinematic simulation in the premotor cortex to reconstruct unfamiliar intentions, and Experts employed a combination of familiarity-based sensorimotor matching in the posterior parietal cortex and top-down mentalizing involving the medial prefrontal cortex. While no specific differences between toolmaking technologies were found for Trained subjects, both produced frontal activation relative to Control, suggesting focused engagement with toolmaking stimuli. These findings support motor resonance hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of human social cognition and cumulative culture, directly linking these hypotheses with archaeologically observable behaviours in prehistory.

AB  - Aim: The primary purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore, clarify and report the strength of the relationship between alexithymia, as measured by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and parenting style as measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument (FBI).
   Methods: Web of Science, PsycInfo, PubMed and ProQuest: Dissertations and Theses searches were undertaken, yielding nine samples with sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis.
   Results: Evidence indicated moderate to strong relationships between maternal care and alexithymia, and between maternal care and two of the three TAS-20 alexithymia facets (Difficulties Describing Feelings and Difficulties Identifying Feelings, but not Externally Oriented Thinking). Moderate relationships were observed for both maternal- and paternal-overprotection and alexithymia respectively, and for overprotection (both maternal and paternal) and Difficulties Describing Feelings.
   Conclusion: This study is the first meta-analysis of the relationship between parenting styles and alexithymia, and findings confirm an especially strong association between maternal care and key elements of alexithymia. This review highlights the issues that still remain to be addressed in exploring the link between parenting style and alexithymia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

KW  - PEER
AB  - Background: There are high levels of concern about childhood obesity, with obese children being at higher risk of poorer health both in the short and longer terms. Children's attitudes to, and beliefs about, their bodies have also raised concern. Children themselves have a stake in this debate; their perspectives on this issue can inform the ways in which interventions aim to work. This systematic review of qualitative and quantitative research aimed to explore the views of UK children about the meanings of obesity and body size, shape or weight and their own experiences of these issues.
   Methods: We conducted sensitive searches of electronic databases and specialist websites, and contacted experts. We included studies published from the start of 1997 which reported the perspectives of UK children aged 4-11 about obesity or body size, shape or weight, and which described key aspects of their methods. Included studies were coded and quality-assessed by two reviewers independently. Findings were synthesised in two analyses: i) an interpretive synthesis of findings from open-ended questions; and ii) an aggregative synthesis of findings from closed questions. We juxtaposed the findings from the two syntheses. The effect of excluding the lowest quality studies was explored. We also consulted young people to explore the credibility of a subset of findings.
   Results: We included 28 studies. Instead of a focus on health, children emphasised the social impact of body size, describing experiences and awareness of abuse and isolation for children with a greater weight. Body size was seen as under the individual's control and children attributed negative characteristics to overweight people. Children actively assessed their own size; many wished their bodies were different and some were anxious about their shape. Reviewers judged that children's engagement and participation in discussion had only rarely been supported in the included studies, and few study findings had depth or breadth.
   Conclusions: Initiatives need to consider the social aspects of obesity, in particular unhelpful beliefs, attitudes and discriminatory behaviours around body size. Researchers and policy-makers should involve children actively and seek their views on appropriate forms of support around this issue.

AB  - Outcome evaluation is an important stage in the pediatric hearing aid fitting process, however a systematic way of evaluating outcome in the pediatric audiology population is lacking. This is in part due to the need for an evidence-based outcome evaluation guideline for infants and children with hearing loss who wear hearing aids. As part of the development of a guideline, a critical review of the existing pediatric audiology outcome evaluation tools was conducted. Subjective outcome evaluation tools that measure auditory-related behaviors in children from birth to 6 years of age were critically appraised using a published grading system (Andresen, 2000). Of the tools that exist, 12 were appraised because they met initial criteria outlined by the Network of Pediatric Audiologists of Canada as being appropriate for children birth to 6 years of age who wear hearing aids. Tools that were considered for the guideline scored high in both statistical and feasibility criteria. The subjective outcome evaluation tools that were ultimately chosen to be included in the guideline were the LittlEARS Auditory Questionnaire (Tsiakpini et al., 2004) and the Parents' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (PEACH) Rating Scale (Ching & Hill, 2005b) due to the high grades they received in the critical review and their target age ranges. Following this critical review of pediatric outcome evaluation tools, the next step was for the Network Clinicians to evaluate the guideline (Moodie et al., 2011b).

AB  - Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among young adults. Both genetic and personality factors plausibly have a role on suicidal behavior. We focused on the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) and we performed: a review of studies investigating the association between COMT and both suicidal behavior and personality; a meta-analysis of studies investigating the association between suicidal behavior and COMT rs4680 polymorphism: an association study investigating the link between seven COMT polymorphisms (rs737865, rs5844402, rs5993883, rs4680, rs4633, rs165599 and rs9332377) and both personality traits and suicidal behavior. For the review and the meta-analysis we performed an electronic search to identify studies focused on the association between COMT and both suicidal behavior and personality. The sample of the association study was composed of three groups: 289 German healthy controls, 111 German suicide attempters and 70 Italian mood disorder patients. From the review, the meta-analysis and the association study no relationship emerged between COMT and suicidal behavior. Nevertheless, from both review and association study several links were found between COMT and personality traits. In particular, in the association study we found a significant correlation between rs4633 and Reward Dependence (Temperament and Character Inventory). As secondary results we found an association between rs737865 and Angry Reaction (State Trait Anger Expression Inventory) and between rs9332377 and Irritability (Questionnaire for Measuring Factors of Aggression). Our findings suggested that COMT variants may not be directly implicated in suicidal behavior, however evidence of a COMT role in the modulation of personality traits has been found.

AB  - There is an expanding field of research investigating the benefits of alternatives to current pharmacological therapies in psychiatry. N-acetylcysteine (NAG) is emerging as a useful agent in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Like many therapies, the clinical origins of NAC are far removed from its current use in psychiatry. Whereas the mechanisms of NAG are only beginning to be understood, it is likely that NAG is exerting benefits beyond being a precursor to the antioxidant, glutathione, modulating glutamatergic, neurotropic and inflammatory pathways. This review outlines the current literature regarding the use of NAG in disorders including addiction, compulsive and grooming disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. N-acetylcysteine has shown promising results in populations with these disorders, including those in whom treatment efficacy has previously been limited. The therapeutic potential of this acetylated amino acid is beginning to emerge in the field of psychiatric research.

AB  - Objective: The relationship of religion and schizophrenia is widely acknowledged, but often minimized by practitioners and under investigated by researchers. In striving to help fill this gap, this paper focuses on examining four aims: 1) how research has investigated the association between religiosity and schizophrenia; 2) how is religiosity associated with delusions and hallucinations; 3) what are the risk and protective factors associated with religiosity and schizophrenia; and 4) does religion influence treatment adherence with individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.
   Methods: A systematic literature search of PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases from January 1, 1980 through January 1, 2010 was conducted using the terms schizophrenia, schizoaffective, schizophreniform, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) and religion, religiosity, spirituality, or faith. Seventy (n = 70) original research studies were identified.
   Results: Religion can act as both a risk and protective factor as it interacts with the schizophrenia symptoms of hallucination and delusions. Cultural influences tend to confound the association of religion and schizophrenia. Adherence to treatment has a mixed association with religiosity.
   Conclusion: The relationship between religion and schizophrenia may be of benefit to both clinicians and researchers through enhancing adherence to treatment, and enhancement of the protective aspects while minimizing associated risk. The relationship of religion and schizophrenia needs further research that is more nuanced and methodologically rigorous, specifically concerning its influence on engagement and adherence to treatment.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) specifies that attention to the spiritual needs of the elderly with mental health problems is essential to good patient care, yet little evidence-based practice is documented in this field. This paper reviews the literature on the provision of pastoral care services (PCS) to elderly people with mental impairment. Integration of Pastoral Care Practitioners (PCPs) into the multidisciplinary team is rare. Research into mental health clinicians' attitudes to addressing patients' spiritual needs, and the integration of PCPs into multidisciplinary teams in aged mental health are reported and discussed. The contextual needs of PCPs in aged mental health, and options for qualitative and quantitative research are explored. Further research is needed to guide the integration of PCS into multidisciplinary teams in aged persons' mental health services.

AB  - Introduction. The available studies on the treatment of mental disorders in the Arab world are uncommon. Methods. A literature review was conducted aiming at identifying studies related to the rate and type of treatment of mental disorders in Arab countries from the Middle Eastern Mediterranean region. Results. A total of 23 articles were included in this review. These articles focused mainly on type of services used and/ or the rate of treatment. Findings from several articles showed a paucity of treatment of mental disorders, and when present, individuals were more likely to receive it from the general medical than from the mental health sector. Only two studies have assessed patterns of treatment of mental disorders on a national level from the Arab Middle Eastern countries (Lebanon and Iraq). Conclusion. The need for national studies on mental disorders in this part of the world and the improvement of public awareness in this field were highlighted.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the complex somatic symptom disorder, proposed by the DSM-V Somatic Symptom Disorders Workgroup, in classifying children and adolescents who suffer severely from medically unexplained symptoms. Methods: The existing knowledge about somatoform disorders (SDs) in children and adolescents was delineated by means of a comprehensive search in the psychological, psychiatric, and pediatric literature. It was analyzed to assess whether children and adolescents suffer from SDs according to DSM-IV-TR (prevalence, developmental course, comorbidity, risk factors, and impact on daily functioning). Subsequently, each criterion of the complex somatic symptom disorder was outlined and discussed with respect to its suitability in classifying children and adolescents. The suitability of the DSM-IV-TR criteria of SDs and that of the criteria of the complex somatic symptom disorder were compared. Results: Current data of sufficient quality are limited but indicate that the DSM-IV-TR criteria are inappropriate for classifying most children and adolescents suffering from somatoform symptoms. The criteria for complex somatic symptom disorder are more appropriate. Nevertheless, it is recommended to include two additional parameters: "parental excessive concern and preoccupation with the child's symptoms" and "high parental health anxieties." Conclusions: The criteria for complex somatic symptom disorder are more appropriate for children and adolescents than the current DSM-IV-TR criteria; they should be better adapted to the special situation of children and adolescents.

   Aims To examine evidence related to efficacy, tolerability and safety of antidepressants for people with depression and with chronic physical health problems.
   Method Meta-analyses of randomised controlled efficacy trials of antidepressants in depression in chronic physical health conditions. Systematic review of safety studies.
   Results Sixty-three studies met inclusion criteria (5794 participants). In placebo-controlled studies, antidepressants showed a significant advantage in respect to remission and/or response: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) risk ratio (RR)=0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.91) for remission, RR=0.83 (95% CI 0.71-0.97) for response; tricyclics RR=0.70 (95% CI 0.40-1.25 (not significant)) for remission, RR=0.55 (95% 0.43-0.70) for response. Both groups of drugs were less well tolerated than placebo (leaving study early due to adverse effects) for SSRIs RR=1.80 (95% CI 1.16-2.78), for tricyclics RR=2.00 (95% CI 0.99-3.57). Only SSRIs were shown to improve quality of life. Direct comparisons of SSRIs and tricyclics revealed no advantage for either group for remission, response, effect size or tolerability. Effectiveness studies suggest a neutral or beneficial effect on mortality for antidepressants in participants with recent myocardial infarction.
   Conclusions Antidepressants are efficacious and safe in the treatment of depression occurring in the context of chronic physical health problems. The SSRIs are probably the antidepressants of first choice given their demonstrable effect on quality of life and their apparent safety in cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a complex, genetically-determined process involved in the development and maintenance of homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Dysregulation of apoptosis has been implicated in a number of diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disease. Thus, the investigation of apoptotic regulation has evoked considerable interest. Many apoptotic proteins have been shown to be post-translationally modulated, such as by protein cleavage, translocation, protein-protein interaction, and various post-translational modifications, which fall precisely within the range of proteomic analysis. Recently, contemporary proteomic technologies have achieved significant advances and have accelerated research in functional and chemical proteomics, which have been applied to the field of apoptosis research and have the potential to be a driving force for the field. This review highlights some of the major achievements in the application of proteomics in apoptosis research and discusses new directions and challenges for the near future.

AB  - An understanding of the neurocognitive and neurobiological underpinnings of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is important in differentiating BDD from related disorders, namely obsessive-compulsive disorder and psychotic disorders. Similar cognitive anomalies in executive function, spatial visual processing and memory (bias to process detailed visual information) have been found in BDD and obsessive-compulsive disorder samples, while schizophrenia patients display more pervasive cognitive deficits. Emotional hyperactivity and misinterpretation of emotion in others have been found in BDD, with similar results to obsessive compulsive disorder samples. Neuroimaging has shown abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, visual cortex, caudate nucleus and right amygdala in BDD patients. These findings are consistent with the neurocognitive profile. This field of research is in its infancy. However, the bias towards detailed visual analysis may be an important clue when investigating the neurobiological basis of BDD, and could explain why individuals exhibit focused attention on one aspect of their own appearance. Emotional hyperarousal caused by amygdala pathology may reinforce a perception of negative physical appearance.

AB  - This work reviews the evidence of the mechanism of neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the neuroprotective effect of lipoic acid and its use in the treatment of PD. PD is characterized by slow and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to reduction of the striatal dopaminergic terminals. It is known that several factors influence neuronal damage. Among these factors, oxidative stress, immune system activity, microglial cells, and apoptotic mechanisms are of major importance. Currently, several antioxidants have been studied with the aim of reducing/slowing the progression of neurodegenerative processes. Lipoic acid is considered a universal antioxidant because it is an amphipathic substance. Lipoic acid and its reduced form, dihidrolipoic acid, act against reactive oxygen species, reducing oxidative stress. Therefore, this antioxidant has been used in the treatment of many diseases, including a new perspective for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Objective: To summarize the literature investigating changes in emotional expression (EE) as a function of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of ADHD and to differentiate emotional effects related to ADHD pharmacotherapy from emotional effects related to ADHD as a disorder. Method: English language articles published from January 1, 1988, through August 31, 2008 were identified through a PubMed literature search using the search terms attention, ADHD, hyperactive, hyperkinesis, and ADD cross-referenced with medication terms amphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, guanfacine, atomoxetine, and clonidine. The search was limited to randomized, controlled trials. Abstracts from all identified articles were selected for further review if they met criteria including (a) presence of a placebo arm, (b) children <= 18 years of age, (c) >= 20 participants, and (b) study design elements that would allow reviewers to determine whether EE phenomena were specifically attributable to medication effects versus alternative explanations (e.g., time, maturation, baseline comorbidity, selection artifacts, or treatments other than the medication-placebo contrast). Qualifying full-text articles were reviewed for prespecified EE terms. Results: Of 148 articles that met selection criteria, 47 reported varying types of EE. Eight of these included two active treatment arms. Hence, 55 data sets were identified. Patterns of change in EE in studies meeting search criteria are discussed. Data sets that reported accounts of EE by the percentage of patients were compiled and further analyzed for specific medication classes. The changes in EE are further discussed as (a) salutary or detrimental, (b) associated with time of day or circumscribed, and (c) presumed to be caused by pharmacological effects. Conclusions: Definitive methodologies for assessing the presence of changes in EE in clinical trials and guidelines for the evaluation of EE in clinical practice are yet to be established and are needed. Such guidelines could be used by clinicians to monitor positive and negative changes in emotion when patients are taking medications for their ADHD. (I. of Att. Dis. 2011;15(2)101-112)

TI  - Systemic Vulnerabilities to Suicide among Veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan Conflicts: Review of Case Reports from a National Veterans Affairs Database
KW  - MENTAL-HEALTH
KW  - RISK
KW  - WAR
AB  - While suicide among recently returned veterans is of great concern, it is a relatively rare occurrence within individual hospitals and clinics. Root cause analysis (RCA) generates a detailed case report that can be used to identify system-based vulnerabilities following an adverse event. Review of a national database of RCA reports may identify common vulnerabilities and assist in the development of more robust prevention strategies. Our objective was to identify and compare common themes among reports of suicide among veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) in the Veterans Affairs system. Common themes among root causes of suicide as identified in RCA reports were collected and compared as the primary outcome systematic vulnerabilities. Actions recommended within the reports were coded as the secondary outcome prevention strategies. Fifty-one RCA reports of OIF/OEF suicides were identified by our search. Coding generated 16 common categories among 132 root causes, and 13 categories among 108 recommended actions. Assessment of suicidal risk, coordination of care, timely access to care, and communication among providers were the most common root causes. Actions identified by RCA teams to reduce suicide included improving referral processes, staff education in suicide assessment, and follow-up with suicidal veterans. Review of multiple RCA reports can identify organizational vulnerabilities detected at the local level that may be applicable system wide. Attention to improving suicide assessment, coordination of care, and timely access may have the largest impact on reducing suicide among OIF/OEF veterans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Guilt appears to be a factor that may increase the severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and negatively impact treatment outcomes. However, researchers and clinicians have paid little attention to addressing guilt in OCD treatment. Because guilt is an important perpetuating and mediating factor for OCD symptoms and the development of guilt-specific strategies may yield improved treatment outcomes, we hypothesized that a review of the relevant literature may provide important guidance for the field.
   METHODS: To identify existing scientific contributions across psychological, biologic, and theological disciplines, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the topic of pathological guilt (PG) in OCD.
   RESULTS: Fourteen studies focusing on both PG and OCD were identified. The content of these papers consistently reflected the theme that guilt plays a significant role in OCD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: The potential influence and moderating effects of guilt require more focused attention in the clinical management of OCD. Development of routine standardized measures and treatment protocols targeting the role of guilt in OCD, in addition to consultation with clergy or other appropriate community resources, would provide valuable contributions to the literature. Addressing this affective component related to OCD may lead to improved treatment outcomes and fewer relapses for this debilitating and frequently chronic illness.

AB  - There is an increasing incidence of military traumatic brain injury (TBI), and similar injuries are seen in civilians in war zones or terrorist incidents. Indeed, blast-induced mild TBI has been referred to as the signature injury of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Assessment involves schemes that are common in civilcian practice but, in common with civilian TBI, takes little account of information available from modern imaging (particularly diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging) and emerging biomarkers. The efficient logistics of clinical care delivery in the field may have a role in optimizing outcome. Clinical care has much in common with civilian TBI, but intracranial pressure monitoring is not always available, and protocols need to be modified to take account of this. In addition, severe early oedema has led to increasing use of decompressive craniectomy, and blast TBI may be associated with a higher incidence of vasospasm and pseudoaneurysm formation. Visual and/or auditory deficits are common, and there is a significant risk of post-traumatic epilepsy. TBI is rarely an isolated finding in this setting, and persistent post-concussive symptoms are commonly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain, a constellation of findings that has been called the polytrauma clinical triad.

Easy access to these data, and their computational analysis, is of great importance in order to pinpoint the causes and effects of ageing. Here, we provide a description of the existing databases and computational tools on ageing that are available for researchers. We also describe the computational approaches to data interpretation in the field of ageing including gene expression, comparative and pathway analyses, and highlight the challenges for future developments. We review recent biological insights gained from applying bioinformatics methods to analyse and interpret ageing data in different organisms, tissues and conditions.

AB  - Background: Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a scoring system for the severity of illness in psychiatry. It is used clinically in many countries, as well as in research, but studies have shown several problems with GAF, for example concerning its validity and reliability. Guidelines for rating are important. The present study aimed to identify the current status of guidelines for rating GAF, and relevant factors and gaps in knowledge for the development of improved guidelines.
   Methods: A thorough literature search was conducted.
   Results: Few studies of existing guidelines have been conducted; existing guidelines are short; and rating has a subjective element. Seven main categories were identified as being important in relation to further development of guidelines: (1) general points about guidelines for rating GAF; (2) introduction to guidelines, with ground rules; (3) starting scoring at the top, middle or bottom level of the scale; (4) scoring for different time periods and of different values (highest, lowest or average); (5) the finer grading of the scale; (6) different guidelines for different conditions; and (7) different languages and cultures. Little information is available about how rules for rating are understood by different raters: the final score may be affected by whether the rater starts at the top, middle or bottom of the scale; there is little data on which value/combination of GAF values to record; guidelines for scoring within 10-point intervals are limited; there is little empirical information concerning the suitability of existing guidelines for different conditions and patient characteristics; and little is known about the effects of translation into different languages or of different cultural understanding.
   Conclusions: Few studies have dealt specifically with guidelines for rating GAF. Current guidelines for rating GAF are not comprehensive, and relevant points for new guidelines are presented. Theoretical and empirical studies, and international expert panels would be valuable, as well as production of a manual with more information about scoring. Computerised assessment may well be the future.

AB  - In the 1980s, the terms "cognitive unconscious" were invented to denominate a perspective on unconscious mental processes independent from the psychoanalytical views. For several reasons, the two approaches to unconscious are generally conceived as irreducible. Nowadays, we are witnessing a certain convergence between both fields. The aim of this paper consists in examining the four basic postulates of Freudian unconscious at the light of neurocognitive sciences. They posit: (1) that some psychological processes are unconsciously performed and causally determine conscious processes, (2) that they are governed by their own cognitive rules, (3) that they set out their own intentions, (4) and that they lead to a conflicting organization of psyche. We show that each of these postulates is the subject of empirical and theoretical works. If the two fields refer to more or less similar mechanisms, we propose that their opposition rests on an epistemological misunderstanding. As a conclusion, we promote a conservative reunification of the two perspectives.

AB  - Female mammals have long been neglected in biomedical research. The NIH mandated enrollment of women in human clinical trials in 1993, but no similar initiatives exist to foster research on female animals. We reviewed sex bias in research on mammals in 10 biological fields for 2009 and their historical precedents. Male bias was evident in 8 disciplines and most prominent in neuroscience, with single-sex studies of male animals outnumbering those of females 5.5 to 1. In the past half-century, male bias in non-human studies has increased while declining in human studies. Studies of both sexes frequently fail to analyze results by sex. Underrepresentation of females in animal models of disease is also commonplace, and our understanding of female biology is compromised by these deficiencies. The majority of articles in several journals are conducted on rats and mice to the exclusion of other useful animal models. The belief that non-human female mammals are intrinsically more variable than males and too troublesome for routine inclusion in research protocols is without foundation. We recommend that when only one sex is studied, this should be indicated in article titles, and that funding agencies favor proposals that investigate both sexes and analyze data by sex.

   To present the technique of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and to evaluate the studies conducted on DBS in the treatment of therapy-refractory major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Method:
   A review of the literature on DBS in the treatment of MDD was conducted.
   Results:
   The results of DBS in MDD have been presented in 2 case reports and 3 studies of 47 patients operated upon in 5 different target areas. Positive effects have been presented in all studies and side effects have been minor. DBS in the nucleus accumbens resulted in a mean reduction of Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) of 36% after 1 year and 30% of the 10 patients achieved remission. DBS in the internal capsule/ventral striatum resulted in a reduction of 44% after 1 year, and at the last evaluation after in mean 2 years, 40% of the 15 patients were in remission. The 20 patients with subcallosal cingulated gyrus DBS had a reduction of HDRS of 52% after 1 year, and 35% were within 1 point from remission or in remission.
   Conclusion:
   DBS is a promising treatment for therapy-refractory MDD. The published experience is, however, limited, and the method is at present an experimental therapy.

AB  - Background Knowledge was gathered on occupational demands and health effects of two occupations in the construction industry, bricklayers and supervisors, in order to design a job-specific workers' health surveillance (WHS) for construction workers.
   Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, HSELINE, NIOSHTIC-2, and Picarta up to December 2008.
   Results A total of 60 articles were included. Evidence was found for the following demands for bricklayers: energetic load (exceeding 25% heart rate reserve), load on the lower back (exceeding the NIOSH-threshold value of 3.4 kN), repetitive force exertions of the upper extremities, frequent bending with trunk flexion exceeding 60 degrees and working with the arms more than 608 elevated. Environmental demands include: dust and quartz exposure (exceeding the limit values of 3.0 and 0.05 mg/m(3), respectively), vibration and noise (exceeding the limit value of 80 dBA). Bricklayers are at increased risk of lung cancer, low back pain, complaints of arms and legs and getting injuries. Among construction supervisors are walking and standing common physically demanding activities. Psychosocial demands with evidence for supervisors were mental demands, workload, time pressure, working long hours, and social-organizational factors. Supervisors are at increased risk of lung cancer and injuries.
   Conclusions For bricklayers evidence was found for physical demands and risk on low back pain and complaints of arms and legs, for construction supervisors on psychosocial demands. Both occupations are at increased risk of lung cancer and injuries. Job-specific demands and health effects should be incorporated in WHS for construction workers. Am. J. Ind. Med. 54: 55-77, 2011.

AB  - Background: Dissociative identity disorder (DID) remains a controversial diagnosis due to conflicting views on its etiology. Some attribute DID to childhood trauma and others attribute it to iatrogenesis. The purpose of this article is to review the published cases of childhood DID in order to evaluate its scientific status, and to answer research questions related to the etiological models. Methods: I searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO records for studies published since 1980 on DID/multiple personality disorder in children. For each study I coded information regarding the origin of samples and diagnostic methods. Results: The review produced a total of 255 cases of childhood DID reported as individual case studies (44) or aggregated into empirical studies (211). Nearly all cases (93%) emerged from samples of children in treatment, and multiple personalities was the presenting problem in 23% of the case studies. Four US research groups accounted for 65% of all 255 cases. Diagnostic methods typically included clinical evaluation based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder criteria, but hypnosis, structured interviews, and multiple raters were rarely used in diagnoses. Conclusion: Despite continuing research on the related concepts of trauma and dissociation, childhood DID itself appears to be an extremely rare phenomenon that few researchers have studied in depth. Nearly all of the research that does exist on childhood DID is from the 1980s and 1990s and does not resolve the ongoing controversies surrounding the disorder. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - In the present article the putative role of environmental factors in schizophrenia is reviewed and synthesized. Accumulating evidence from recent studies suggests that environmental exposures may play a more significant role in the etiopathogenesis of this disorder than previously thought. This expanding knowledge base is largely a consequence of refinements in the methodology of epidemiologic studies, including birth cohort investigations, and in preclinical research that has been inspired by the evolving literature on animal models of environmental exposures. This paper is divided into four sections. In the first, the descriptive epidemiology of schizophrenia is reviewed. This includes general studies on incidence, prevalence, and differences in these measures by urban-rural, neighborhood, migrant, and season of birth status, as well as time trends. In the second section, we discuss the contribution of environmental risk factors acting during fetal and perinatal life; these include infections [e.g. rubella, influenza, Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)], nutritional deficiencies (e.g., famine, folic acid, iron, vitamin D), paternal age, fetal/neonatal hypoxic and other obstetric insults and complications, maternal stress and other exposures [e.g. lead, rhesus (Rh) incompatibility, maternal stress]. Other putative neurodevelopmental determinants, including cannabis, socioeconomic status, trauma, and infections during childhood and adolescence are also covered. In the third section, these findings are synthesized and their implications for prevention and uncovering biological mechanisms, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, are discussed. Animal models, including maternal immune activation, have yielded evidence suggesting that these exposures cause brain and behavioral phenotypes that are analogous to findings observed in patients with schizophrenia. In the final section, future studies including new, larger, and more rigorous epidemiologic investigations, and research on translational and clinical neuroscience, gene-environment interactions, epigenetics, developmental trajectories and windows of vulnerability, are elaborated upon. These studies are aimed at confirming observed risk factors, identifying new environmental exposures, elucidating developmental mechanisms, and shedding further light on genes and exposures that may not be identified in the absence of these integrated approaches. The study of environmental factors in schizophrenia may have important implications for the identification of causes and prevention of this disorder, and offers the potential to complement, and refine, existing efforts on explanatory neurodevelopmental models.

AB  - Suicide has long been associated with serious illness generally and HIV specifically. New treatments have affected prognosis in HIV positively, but it is unclear how they impact on suicidal burden (thoughts, self-harm and completions). This review examines all published suicide and HIV data for a definitive account of (1) prevalence of HIV-related suicidality, (2) measurement within studies and (3) effectiveness of interventions. Standard systematic research methods were used to gather quality published papers on HIV and suicide, searching published databases according to quality inclusion criteria. From the search, 332 papers were generated and hand searched resulting in 66 studies for analysis. Of these, 75% were American/European, but there was representation from developing countries. The breakdown of papers provided 12, which measured completed suicides (death records), five reporting suicide as a cause of attrition. Deliberate self-harm was measured in 21, using 22 instruments; 16 studies measured suicidal ideation using 14 instruments, suicidal thoughts were measured in 17, using 15 instruments. Navigating the diverse range of studies clearly points to a high-suicidal burden among people with HIV. The overview shows that autopsy studies reveal 9.4% of deceased HIV + individuals had committed suicide; 2.4% HIV + study participants commit suicide; approximately 20% of HIV + people studied had deliberately harmed themselves; 26.9% reported suicidal ideation, 28.5% during the past week and 6.5% reported ideation as a side effect to medication; 22.2% had a suicide plan; 19.7% were generally "suicidal'' (11.7% of people with AIDS, 15.3% at other stages of HIV); 23.1% reported thoughts of ending their own life; and 14.4% expressed a desire for death. Only three studies recruited over 70% female participants (39 studies recruited over 70% men), and six focussed on injecting drug users. Only three studies looked at interventions - predominantly indirect. Our detailed data suggest that all aspects of suicide are elevated and urgently require routine monitoring and tracking as a standard component of clinical care. There is scant evidence of direct interventions to reduce any aspect of suicidality, which needs urgent redress.

AB  - This chapter has carried out a review of the literature and combined this with the results of in-house studies to identify candidate blood-based biomarkers for schizophrenia and antipsychotic drug response. Literature searches retrieved 185 publications describing a total of 273 schizophrenia biomarkers identified in serum and/or plasma. Examination of seven in-house multicenter studies resulted in the identification of 137 serum/plasma biomarkers. Taken together, the findings suggested an ongoing immunological and inflammatory process in schizophrenia. This was accompanied by altered cortisol levels which suggested activated stress response and altered hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function in these patients. The authors conclude that such biomarkers may prove useful as additional parameters for characterizing specific immune and/or metabolic or hormonal subsystems in schizophrenia and might, therefore, facilitate the development of future patient stratification and personalized medicine strategies.

AB  - The mood stabilizer lithium inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) directly or indirectly by enhancing serine phosphorylation of both alpha and beta isoforms. Lithium robustly protected primary brain neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity; these actions were mimicked by other GSK-3 inhibitors or silencing/inhibiting GSK-3 alpha and/or beta isoforms. Lithium rapidly activated Akt to enhance GSK-3 serine phosphorylation and to block glutamate-induced Akt inactivation. Lithium also up-regulated Bcl-2 and suppressed glutamate-induced p53 and Bax. Induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was required for lithium's neuroprotection to occur. BDNF promoter IV was activated by GSK-3 inhibition using lithium or other drugs, or through gene silencing/inactivation of either isoform. Further, lithium's neuroprotective effects were associated with inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx and down-stream signaling. In rodent ischemic models, post-insult treatment with lithium decreased infarct volume, ameliorated neurological deficits, and improved functional recovery. Up-regulation of heat-shock protein 70 and Bcl-2 as well as down-regulation of p53 likely contributed to lithium's protective effects. Delayed treatment with lithium improved functional MRI responses, which was accompanied by enhanced angiogenesis. Two GSK-3-regulated pro-angiogenic factors, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor were induced by lithium. Finally, lithium promoted migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by up-regulation of MMP-9 through GSK-3 beta inhibition. Notably, transplantation of lithium-primed MSCs into ischemic rats enhanced MSC migration to the injured brain regions and improved the neurological performance. Several other GSK-3 inhibitors have also been reported to be beneficial in rodent ischemic models. Together, GSK-3 inhibition is a rational strategy to combat ischemic stroke and other excitotoxicity-related brain disorders.

AB  - There is now an abundance of research which has demonstrated that military personnel who deploy on operations are at increased risk of suffering a variety of mental health difficulties in the immediate and long-term post-deployment period. One consequence of these research findings has been the development of a variety of programmes which attempt to mitigate the increased psychological risk and to assist personnel who are returning from a deployment to make a smooth transition home. Using a three-tiered prevention model, this article reviews some of the key post-deployment issues facing the UK Armed Forces and highlights the recent interventions which have been put in place to promote successful adjustment in the early post-deployment period. The paper is based upon research identified through a thorough literature search for studies which focused on this area and included a recognized measure of mental health as an outcome. The paper focuses on three main areas; psychological decompression, psycho-education and screening. The current philosophical approaches to post-deployment mental health problems of some of the UK's coalition partners are also discussed.

AB  - The current systematic review and meta-analysis provides an extended and comprehensive overview of the associations between neurocognitive and social cognitive functioning and different types of functional outcome. Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE and PsycINFO and reference lists from identified articles to retrieve relevant studies on cross-sectional associations between neurocognition, social cognition and functional outcome in individuals with non-affective psychosis. Of 285 studies identified, 52 studies comprising 2692 subjects met all inclusion criteria. Pearson correlations between cognition and outcome, demographic data, sample sizes and potential moderator variables were extracted. Forty-eight independent meta-analyses, on associations between 12 a priori identified neurocognitive and social cognitive domains and 4 domains of functional outcome yielded a number of 25 significant mean correlations. Overall, social cognition was more strongly associated with community functioning than neurocognition, with the strongest associations being between theory of mind and functional outcomes. However, as three-quarters of variance in outcome were left unexplained, cognitive remediation approaches need to be combined with therapies targeting other factors impacting on outcome.

AB  - Background: Oxytocin is associated with the establishment and quality of maternal behavior in animal models. Parallel investigations in humans are now under way. This article reviews the current research examining the role of oxytocin in mother-infant relations, attachment, and bonding in humans. Methods: A systematic search was made of three electronic databases and other bibliographic sources for published research studies that examined oxytocin and mother-infant relations in humans, including attachment, maternal behavior, parenting, and mother-infant relations. Results: Eight studies were identified, all of which were unique in their methodologies, populations studied, and measures used. Seven studies found significant and strong associations between levels or patterns of oxytocin and aspects of mother-infant relations or attachment. Conclusions: Oxytocin appears to be of crucial importance for understanding mother-infant relationships. The findings of this review suggest that the pioneering, but preliminary, research undertaken to date is promising and that replication with larger samples is needed. Research that draws on more robust measures of attachment and bonding, as well as improved measures of oxytocin that include both central and peripheral levels, will elucidate the role of oxytocin in human mother-infant relationships. As the production of oxytocin is by no means restricted to mothers, the extension of the oxytocin studies to fathering, as well as to alloparental caregiving, would be an intriguing next step.

AB  - As new treatments enhance mortality, and infection rates continue to grow in many communities, the concept of "living well'' with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is essential. The concept of coping has been well-articulated in the HIV literature and the public health argument for enhanced coping is crucial to reduce the burden of disease and health service use. This systematic review aimed to systematically identify and appraise the evidence for effectiveness in HIV coping interventions. A detailed search strategy was implemented and the retained papers entered into common tables for comparative analysis. Interventions were organised into models and data extracted on population, intervention description, tools and outcomes. Following review of all search returns against the included/excluded criteria of the search strategy, 28 peer review papers were retained. Models were psychological (n = 21), drug therapy (n = 3), spiritual (n = 1), diet and exercise (n = 1), mixed models (n = 1) and information management (n = 1). Sixteen of the 28 controlled studies found a significant intervention effect, and cognitive behaviour and stress management interventions offer particular effectiveness. Despite a lack of common outcome tolls, there are useful data that demonstrate effectiveness. Further studies must address outcomes for women and children.

AB  - Within neuroscience and biobehavioral research, the pig (Sus scrofus) is increasingly being acknowledged as a valuable large animal species. Compared to the rodent brain, the pig brain more closely resembles the human brain in terms of both anatomy and biochemistry, which associates the pig with a higher translational value. Several brain disorders have been fully or partially modeled in the pig and this has further spurred an interest in having access to behavioral tasks for pigs, and in particular to cognitive tasks. Cognitive testing of pigs has been conducted for several years by a small group of farm animal welfare researchers, but it has only recently received interest in the wider neuroscience community. Several behavioral tasks have successfully been adapted to the pig, and valuable results have been produced. However, most tasks have only been established at a single research facility, and would benefit from further validation. This review presents the cognitive tasks that have been developed for pigs, their validation, and their current use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is general consensus that solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) negatively impacts many marine species. Echinoderms are ubiquitous within the marine environment, with members of the phyla often long-lived and numerically dominant within the benthic macrofauna, consequently the impact of UVR on the population dynamics of these organisms will influence marine communities and ecosystems. Research to date has shown that exposure of echinoderms to solar UVR can, affect reproduction and development, change behaviour, cause numerous biochemical and physiological changes and potentially cause increased mutation rates, by causing DNA damage. There is also considerable evidence that echinoderms utilise several different mechanisms to protect themselves against excessive UVR and subsequent UVR-induced damage. However, these protective mechanisms may pose conflicting selection pressures on echinoderms, as UVR is an additional stressor in oceans subjected to anthropogenic-induced climate change. This review summarises our knowledge of the effects of UVR on the Echinodermata. We outline the research conducted to date, highlight key studies on UVR that have utilised echinoderms and look to the future of UVR research in a rapidly changing ocean.

AB  - Background: Suicide rates are highest among the elderly, yet research on suicide prevention in old age remains a much-neglected area. Aims: We carried out a systematic review to examine the results of interventions aimed at suicidal elderly persons and to identify successful strategies and areas needing further exploration. Methods: Searches through various electronic databases yielded 19 studies with an empirical evaluation of a suicide prevention or intervention program designed especially for adults aged 60 years and older. Results: Most studies were centered on the reduction of risk factors (depression screening and treatment, and decreasing isolation), but when gender was considered, programs were mostly efficient for women. The empirical evaluations of programs attending to the needs of high-risk older adults seemed positive; most studies showed a reduction in the level of suicidal ideation of patients or in the suicide rate of the participating communities. However, not all studies used measures of suicidality to evaluate the outcome of the intervention, and rarely did they aim at improving protective factors. Conclusions: Innovative strategies should improve resilience and positive aging, engage family and community gatekeepers, use telecommunications to reach vulnerable older adult, and evaluate the effects of means restriction and physicians education on elderly suicide.

KW  - dopaminergic neurons
KW  - tyramine
KW  - beta-phenylethylamine
KW  - trace amine receptor 1
KW  - neuropsychiatric disorders
AB  - Trace amines (TAs) are a class of endogenous compounds strictly related to classic monoamine neurotransmitters with regard to their structure, metabolism, and tissue distribution. Although the presence of TAs in mammalian brain has been recognized for decades, until recently they were considered to be by-products of amino acid metabolism or as "false" neurotransmitters. The discovery in 2001 of a new family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), namely trace amines receptors, has re-ignited interest in TAs. In particular, two members of the family, trace amine receptor 1 (TA(1)) and trace amine receptor 2 (TA(2)), were shown to be highly sensitive to these endogenous compounds. Experimental evidence suggests that TAs modulate the activity of catecholaminergic neurons and that TA dysregulation may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression and Parkinson's disease, all of which are characterized by altered monoaminergic networks. Here we review recent data concerning the electrophysiological effects of TAs on the activity of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. In the context of recent data obtained with TA1 receptor knockout mice, we also discuss the mechanisms by which the activation of these receptors modulates the activity of these neurons. Three important new aspects of TAs action have recently emerged: (a) inhibition of firing due to increased release of dopamine; (b) reduction of D2 and GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibitory responses (excitatory effects due to disinhibition); and (c) a direct TA1 receptor-mediated activation of GIRK channels which produce cell membrane hyperpolarization. While the first two effects have been well documented in our laboratory, the direct activation of GIRK channels by TA1 receptors has been reported by others, but has not been seen in our laboratory (Geracitano et al., 2004). Further research is needed to address this point, and to further characterize the mechanism of action of TAs on dopaminergic neurons.

AB  - Due to the relative success of therapeutic interventions aimed at treating the overt motor symptoms evident in Parkinson's disease (PD), a greater appreciation of the non-motor aspects of the disease has emerged in recent time. Indeed, evidence suggests that impairments in emotional processing, behavioural control and cognitive function may emerge early in the onset of the disease. Decades of experimental research have seen the development of diverse animal models, all of which have aimed to mimic the characteristic features of the disease process including the dopaminergic neural cell loss, the molecular neuropathology and the concomitant behavioural impairments. The following review provides an overview of the use of animal, particularly rodent, models in the quest to obtain a greater understanding of the role of corticostriatal dopamine in cognitive and neuropsychiatric functions. Given the limitations of using the available rodent models of PD, including altered motor and motivational function, it has become necessary to employ a range of techniques to eke out the precise function of this neurotransmitter in corticostriatal function. Combinations of lesion and pharmacological studies have allowed the assessment of dopamine depletion and precise receptor populations in the learning or expression of a range of executive functions, which has gained us considerable insight into the relationship between the neuropathology that occurs in PD and the resulting impairments in cognitive and neuropsychiatric function.

AB  - Most brain diseases arise from interactions between complex genetic and environmental risk factors. Finding biomarkers for brain diseases will require appropriate cellular models to identify dysregulated cell functions and disease-associated biochemistries. Patient-derived stem cells hold great potential as models of brain diseases. Stem cells can proliferate and can be banked, stored, and thawed for genomic, proteomic, and functional studies. Patient-derived, induced pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells from the olfactory organ in the nose are already giving novel insights into a number of brain diseases, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Biomarker discovery may be possible from investigating disease-associated cell biologies in patient-derived stem cells.

AB  - During the last century, the world population has shown a staggering increase in its proportion of elderly members and thus, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD, respectively) are becoming an increasing burden. Brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly are characterized by oxidative damage, dysregulation of redox metals homeostasis and inflammation, supporting a therapeutic use of antioxidants. Natural plant polyphenols (flavonoids and non-flavonoids) are the most abundant antioxidants in the diet and as such, are ideal nutraceuticals for neutralizing stress-induced free radicals and inflammation. Human epidemiological and new animal data suggest that green and black tea drinking (enriched in a class of flavonoids named catechins) may help protecting the aging brain and reduce the incidence of dementia, AD, and PD. Mechanistic studies on the neuroprotective/neuroregenerative effects of green tea catechins revealed that they act not only as antioxidants metal chelators, but also as modulators of intracellular neuronal signaling and metabolism, cell survival/death genes, and mitochondrial function. Thus, these dietary compounds are receiving significant attention as therapeutic multifunctional cytoprotective agents that simultaneously manipulate various brain targets. The scope of this review is to assess and put into perspective salient features of the beneficial brain action of natural, non-toxic green tea catechins in aging-impaired cognition and neurodegenerative diseases and to discuss a scenario concerning their potential, in drug combination, to target distinct pathologies, in the quest for a disease modifying therapy.

TI  - Clearance of fear memory from the hippocampus through neurogenesis by omega-3 fatty acids: a novel preventive strategy for posttraumatic stress disorder?
AB  - Not only has accidental injury been shown to account for a significant health burden on all populations, regardless of age, sex and geographic region, but patients with accidental injury frequently present with the psychiatric condition of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prevention of accident-related PTSD thus represents a potentially important goal. Physicians in the field of psychosomatic medicine and critical care medicine have the opportunity to see injured patients in the immediate aftermath of an accident. This article first briefly reviews the prevalence and associated factors of accident-related PTSD, then focuses on a conceptual model of fear memory and proposes a new, rationally hypothesized translational preventive intervention for PTSD through promoting hippocampal neurogenesis by omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. The results of an open-label pilot trial of injured patients admitted to the intensive care unit suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation immediately after accidental injury can reduce subsequent PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Most psychiatric disorders begin during adolescence and manifest in early adulthood. One important barrier to mental health treatment for adolescents is the associated stigma. Not receiving psychiatric help during adulthood because of stigma can contribute to the development of chronic mental disorders and a negative prognosis. Education programs on the issue of stigma would ensure the community is better informed about mental disorders. Empirical studies of anti-stigma interventions among young people show that education programs can help to decrease stigma. The purpose of this study was to review and discuss the effects of education aimed at informing young people about mental disorders on social distance and attitude in national and international dimensions. The key words "stigmatization", "adolescent", "education", "social distance" and "attitude" were searched in PubMed and Turk Psikiyatri Dizini, and a total of 26 research articles were evaluated.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with multiple etiologies. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in the aging brain and could be one of the reasons for age-related diseases like PD. Oxidative stress also leads to the formation of AGEs and may be involved in neurodegeneration by altering the properties of proteins. alpha-Synuclein is involved in pathogenesis of PD and there are limited studies on the role of AGE-alpha-synuclein in neurodegeneration. We studied the aggregation and DNA binding ability of AGE-alpha-synuclein in vitro. alpha-Synuclein is glycated using methylglyoxal and formation of AGE-alpha-synuclein is characterized using fluorescence studies, intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence, and fructosamine estimation. The results indicated that AGE-alpha-synuclein aggregates into smaller globular-like aggregates compared to fibrils formed with native alpha-synuclein. Further, it is found that AGE-alpha-synuclein induced conformational changes in scDNA from B-form to B-C-A mixed conformation. Additionally, AGE-alpha-synuclein altered DNA integrity as evidenced by the melting temperature, ethidium bromide, and DNAse I sensitivity studies. AGE-alpha-synuclein converted biphasic T-m to higher monophasic T-m. The T-m of AGE-alpha synuclein-scDNA complex is more than that of native alpha-synuclein-scDNA complex, indicating that AGE-alpha-synuclein stabilized the uncoiled scDNA. AGE-alpha-synuclein could stabilize the uncoiled scDNA, as shown by the decrease in the number of ethidium bromide binding molecules per base pair of DNA. DNAse I sensitive studies indicated that both AGE-alpha-synuclein-scDNA and alpha-synuclein-scDNA are resistant to DNAse I digestion. The relevance of these findings to neuronal cell death is discussed.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder associated with dementia as a main feature. Despite decades of thorough research in the field of AD, the pathomechanism is still not fully understood. The development of novel experimental models can help us in the discovery of both genetic and non-genetic components of disease pathogenesis. As currently available therapies in AD can provide merely moderate or only temporary symptomatic relief, there is a great demand for the development of new drugs with higher therapeutic potential. Some of the candidates would be those targeting the kynurenine pathway, the neuroactive metabolites of which are surely involved in both neurodegeneration and neuroprotection, mainly in relation with glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Both analogs of the neuroprotective kynurenic acid and small molecule enzyme inhibitors preventing the formation of neurotoxic compounds may have potential therapeutic significance. However, there is a great need for new strategies to improve efficacy, transport across the blood-brain barrier and bioavailability, naturally with simultaneous minimization of the adverse side-effects.

AB  - Dreaming is still a mystery of human cognition, although it has been studied experimentally for more than a century. Experimental psychology first investigated dream content and frequency. The neuroscientific approach to dreaming arose at the end of the 1950s and soon proposed a physiological substrate of dreaming: rapid eye movement sleep. Fifty years later, this hypothesis was challenged because it could not explain all of the characteristics of dream reports. Therefore, the neurophysiological correlates of dreaming are still unclear, and many questions remain unresolved. Do the representations that constitute the dream emerge randomly from the brain, or do they surface according to certain parameters? Is the organization of the dream's representations chaotic or is it determined by rules? Does dreaming have a meaning? What is/are the function(s) of dreaming? Psychoanalysis provides hypotheses to address these questions. Until now, these hypotheses have received minimal attention in cognitive neuroscience, but the recent development of neuropsychoanalysis brings new hopes of interaction between the two fields. Considering the psychoanalytical perspective in cognitive neuroscience would provide new directions and leads for dream research and would help to achieve a comprehensive understanding of dreaming. Notably, several subjective issues at the core of the psychoanalytic approach, such as the concept of personal meaning, the concept of unconscious episodic memory and the subject's history, are not addressed or considered in cognitive neuroscience. This paper argues that the focus on singularity and personal meaning in psychoanalysis is needed to successfully address these issues in cognitive neuroscience and to progress in the understanding of dreaming and the psyche.

AB  - The phytoplankton are key members of marine ecosystems, generating about half of global primary productivity, supporting valuable fisheries and regulating global biogeochemical cycles. Marine phytoplankton are phylogenetically diverse and are comprised of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. In the last decade, new insights have been gained into the ecology and evolution of these important organisms through whole genome sequencing projects and more recently, through both transcriptomics and targeted metagenomics approaches. Sequenced genomes of cyanobacteria are generally small, ranging in size from 1.8 to 9 million base pairs (Mbp). Eukaryotic genomes, in general, have a much larger size range and those that have been sequenced range from 12 to 57 Mbp. Whole genome sequencing projects have revealed key features of the evolutionary history of marine phytoplankton, their varied responses to environmental stress, their ability to scavenge and store nutrients and their unique ability to form elaborate cellular coverings. We have begun to learn how to read the 'language' of marine phytoplankton, as written in their DNA. Here, we review the ecological and evolutionary insights gained from whole genome sequencing projects, illustrate how these genomes are yielding information on marine natural products and informing nanotechnology as well as make suggestions for future directions in the field of marine phytoplankton genomics.

AB  - Overview: Kava (Piper methysticum) is a South Pacific psychotropic plant medicine that has anxiolytic activity. This effect is achieved from modulation of GABA activity via alteration of lipid membrane structure and sodium channel function, monoamine oxidase B inhibition, and noradrenaline and dopamine re-uptake inhibition. Kava is available over the counter in jurisdictions such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand. Due to this, a review of efficacy, safety and clinical recommendations is advised.
   Objective: To conduct a comprehensive review of kava, in respect to efficacy, psychopharmacology, and safety, and to provide clinical recommendations for use in psychiatry to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
   Methods: A review was conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library during mid 2010 of search terms relating to kava and GAD. A subsequent forward search was conducted of key papers using Web of Science cited reference search.
   Results: The current weight of evidence supports the use of kava in treatment of anxiety with a significant result occurring in four out of six studies reviewed (mean Cohen's d = 1.1). Safety issues should however be considered. Use of traditional water soluble extracts of the rhizome (root) of appropriate kava cultivars is advised, in addition to avoidance of use with alcohol and caution with other psychotropic medications. Avoidance of high doses if driving or operating heavy machinery should be mandatory. For regular users routine liver function tests are advised.
   Conclusions: While current evidence supports kava for generalized anxiety, more studies are required to assess comparative efficacy and safety (on the liver, cognition, driving, and sexual effects) versus established pharmaceutical comparators.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently used to treat neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, and is explored as an experimental treatment for psychiatric disorders like major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. This mini review discusses ethical issues in DBS treatment and research, as they have been discussed in the medical and ethical literature. With regard to DBS treatment, the most important issues are balancing risks and benefits and ensuring respect for the autonomous wish of the patient. This implies special attention to patient selection, psycho-social impact of treatment, effects on personal identity, and treatment of children. Moreover, it implies a careful informed consent process in which unrealistic expectations of patients and their families are addressed and in which special attention is given to competence. In the context of research, the fundamental ethical challenge is to promote high-quality scientific research in the interest of future patients, while at the same time safeguarding the rights and interests of vulnerable research subjects. Several guidelines have been proposed to ensure this. One of the preconditions to further development of responsible and transparent research practices is the establishment of a comprehensive registry.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the present review is to summarize available evidence about the efficacy and side effects of novel antidepressants for the treatment of panic disorder. Methods: A literature search was undertaken using MEDLINE, ISI web of knowledge and references of retrieved articles. The search included articles published in English up to September 2009. Both controlled and uncontrolled trials were included. The quality of the reviewed articles was also assessed. Results: Fourteen mainly poor-quality studies were included. Mirtazapine showed some efficacy in reducing the number and the severity of panic symptoms in many uncontrolled studies and was comparable to selective serotonin reputake inhibitors (SSRIs) in direct-comparison studies. Reboxetine was significantly more efficacious than placebo but less effective than SSRIs. Further uncontrolled studies suggested preliminary evidence for the use of milnacipran and duloxetine as well. All drugs were usually well tolerated. Discussion: Current studies do not yet provide convincing evidence supporting the efficacy of mirtazapine, reboxetine, milnacipran and duloxetine for the treatment of panic disorder patients. However, on account of positive preliminary results, further research is warranted. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - This paper briefly describes how the electrical stimulation, used since antiquity to modulate the nervous system, has been a fundamental tool of neurophysiologic investigation in the second half of the eighteenth century and was subsequently used by the early twentieth century, even for therapeutic purposes. In mid-twentieth century the advent of stereotactic procedures has allowed the drift from lesional to stimulating technique of deep nuclei of the brain for therapeutic purposes. In this way, deep brain stimulation (DBS) was born, that, over the last two decades, has led to positive results for the treatment of medically refractory Parkinsons disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. In recent years, the indications for therapeutic use of DBS have been extended to epilepsy, Tourettes syndrome, psychiatric diseases (depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), some kinds of headache, eating disorders, and the minimally conscious state. The potentials of the DBS for therapeutic use are fascinating, but there are still many unresolved technical and ethical problems, concerning the identification of the targets for each disease, the selection of the patients and the evaluation of the results.

AB  - Objective: The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine the effectiveness of suicide postvention programs on suicide attempts and suicide as well as grief symptoms, mental distress, and mental health broadly defined; and 2) to investigate their cost-effectiveness.
   Methods: Computerized database searches (PubMed, PsycINFO, Cinahl, Cochrane Database, Crisis and Suicide & Life-Threatening Behavior) were performed in September 2009 to obtain evaluations of suicide postvention programs and in February 2010 (Centre for Research and Dissemination Database, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cinahl) to obtain cost-effectiveness analyses of bereavement programs. Hand searches of relevant articles and reviews were also conducted. Publications were included in the analysis if they described an evaluation/cost-effectiveness analysis of a suicide postvention program, provided data, and were published in English-language peer-reviewed journals. There was no restriction on publication date. Studies were excluded if they were narrative systematic reviews or dissertations or if they described a postvention program but provided no evaluation. Because very few cost-effectiveness analyses were identified, articles describing "costs" of bereavement programs were also included. Studies were evaluated for quality using Centres for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence, and for program effectiveness using Office of justice Programs "What Works Repository" Analytic Framework.
   Results: Of the 49 studies of suicide postvention programs retrieved, 16 met inclusion criteria for evaluation of study quality and evidence of effectiveness. Three target populations for postvention programs were identified: school-based, family-focused, and community-based. No protective effect of any postvention program could be determined for number of suicide deaths or suicide attempts from the available studies. Few positive effects of school-based postvention programs were found. One study reported negative effects of a suicide postvention. Gatekeeper training for proactive postvention was effective in increasing knowledge pertaining to crisis intervention among school personnel. Outreach at the scene of suicide was found to be helpful in encouraging survivors to attend a support group at a crisis centre and seek help in dealing with their loss. Contact with a counseling postvention for familial survivors (spouses, parents, children) of suicide generally helped reduce psychological distress in the short term. There was no statistical analysis of community-based suicide postvention programs; however media guidelines for reporting of suicide and suicide attempts have been adopted by mental health organizations in numerous countries. No analyses of cost-effectiveness of suicide postvention programs were found.
   Conclusion: Recommendations to provide guidance to policy-makers, administrators and clinicians are presented and directions for future research are outlined.

AB  - Catha edulis (khat) is a plant grown commonly in the horn of Africa. Its leaves are chewed by the local people for their stimulant action. The purpose of this review was to summarize the psychopharmacologic aspects of Catha edulis (khat) and consequences of long term use. I collected data from scientific journals. The databases such as Pubmed, Medline, Hinary, Google search, Cochrane, and Embase were searched for literature on the different aspects of Catha edulis (khat) including central nervous system effects, pharmacological effects and long term consequences of khat use. Different research findings from various sources showed that Catha edulis (khat) causes schizophreniform psychotic illness, mania, and more rarely, depression and also has negative impact on health and socio-economic conditions. Most of the effects of chewing khat come from two phenylalkylamines; cathinone and cathine which are structurally related to amphetamine. On occasion these presentations are associated with episodes of self-harm or harm to others. Owing to the mode of consumption, the dose of khat tends to be self-limiting, unlike amphetamines. Therefore toxic psychosis as a result of excessive use is much less frequent with khat than with amphetamines. Frequent khat chewing is responsible for different disorders including psychotic illness and has harmful socioeconomic consequences. It is important for clinicians to increase awareness of their patients and the general public about the harmful effects of khat-chewing.

AB  - Stress regimes defined as the synchronous or sequential action of abiotic and biotic stresses determine the performance and distribution of species. The natural patterns of stress to which species are more or less well adapted have recently started to shift and alter under the influence of global change. This was the motivation to review our knowledge on the stress ecology of a benthic key player, the macroalgal genus Fucus. We first provide a comprehensive review of the genus as an ecological model including what is currently known about the major lineages of Fucus species with respect to hybridization, ecotypic differentiation and speciation; as well as life history, population structure and geographic distribution. We then review our current understanding of both extrinsic (abiotic/biotic) and intrinsic (genetic) stress(es) on Fucus species and how they interact with each other.
   It is concluded that (i) interactive stress effects appear to be equally distributed over additive, antagonistic and synergistic categories at the level of single experiments, but are predominantly additive when averaged over all studies in a meta-analysis of 41 experiments; (ii) juvenile and adult responses to stress frequently differ and (iii) several species or particular populations of Fucus may be relatively unaffected by climate change as a consequence of pre-adapted ecotypes that collectively express wide physiological tolerences.
   Future research on Fucus should (i) include additional species, (ii) include marginal populations as models for responses to environmental stress; (iii) assess a wider range of stress combinations, including their temporal fluctuations; (iv) better differentiate between stress sensitivity of juvenile versus adult stages; (v) include a functional genomic component in order to better integrate Fucus' ecological and evolutionary responses to stress regimes and (vi) utilize a multivariate modelling approach in order to develop and understand interaction networks.

AB  - The human p53 tumour suppressor protein is inactivated in many cancers and is also a major player in apoptotic responses to cellular stress. The p53 protein and the two other members of this protein family (p63, p73) are encoded by distinct genes and their functions have been extensively documented for humans and some other vertebrates. The structure and relative expression levels for members of the p53 superfamily have also been reported for most major invertebrate taxa. The functions of homologous proteins have been investigated for only a few invertebrates (specifically, p53 in flies, nematodes and recently a sea anemone). These studies of classical model organisms all suggest that the gene family originally evolved to mediate apoptosis of damaged germ cells or to protect germ cells from genotoxic stress. Here, we have correlated data from a number of molluscan and other invertebrate sequencing projects to provide a framework for understanding p53 signalling pathways in marine bivalve cancer and stress biology. These data suggest that (a) the two identified p53 and p63/73-like proteins in soft shell clam (Mya arenaria), blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and Northern European squid (Loligo forbesi) have identical core sequences and may be splice variants of a single gene, while some molluscs and most other invertebrates have two or more distinct genes expressing different p53 family members; (b) transcriptional activation domains (TADs) in bivalve p53 and p63/73-like protein sequences are 67-69% conserved with human p53, while those in ecdysozoan, cnidarian, placozoan and choanozoan eukaryotes are <= 33% conserved; (c) the Mdm2 binding site in the transcriptional activation domain is 100% conserved in all sequenced bivalve p53 proteins (e.g. Mya, Mytilus, Crassostrea and Spisula) but is not present in other non-deuterostome invertebrates; (d) an Mdm2 homologue has been cloned for Mytilus trossulus; (e) homologues for both human p53 upstream regulatory and transcriptional target genes exist in molluscan genomes (missing are ARF, CIP1 and BH3 only proteins) and (f) p53 is demonstrably involved in bivalve haemocyte and germinoma cancers. We usually do not know enough about the molecular biology of marine invertebrates to address molecular mechanisms that characterize particular diseases. Understanding the molecular basis of naturally occurring diseases in marine bivalves is a virtually unexplored aspect of toxicoproteomics and genomics and related drug discovery. Additionally, increases in coastal development and concomitant increases in aquatic pollutants have driven interest in developing models appropriate for evaluating potential hazardous compounds or conditions found in the aquatic environment. Data reviewed in this study are coupled with recent developments in our understanding the molecular biology of the marine bivalve p53 superfamily. Taken together, they suggest that both structurally and functionally, bivalve p53 family proteins are the most highly conserved members of this gene superfamily so far identified outside of higher vertebrates and invertebrate chordates. Marine bivalves provide some of the most relevant and best understood models currently available for experimental studies by biomedical and marine environmental researchers.

AB  - The aim of this review is to evaluate what is known about the impact on children of parental deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. We searched for relevant studies with a minimum sample size of 50 which were published between 2003 and 2010 using Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were also searched. Nine US-based studies were identified for inclusion in the review, five were cross-sectional, two were longitudinal and two were analyses of routinely collected data. Researchers found an increase in emotional and behavioral problems in children when a parent was deployed. Several mediating factors were identified, such as the family demographics and the number and duration of parental deployments. Parental psychopathology was most consistently identified as a risk factor for childhood emotional and behavioral disorders in the research. Limitations of the current research and subsequent recommendations for future research are also outlined.

AB  - There are great expectations for the personalized medicine approach to address the therapeutic needs of patients in the twenty-first century Advances in human genome science and molecular innovations in neuroscience have encouraged the pharmaceutical industry to focus beyond broad spectrum population therapeutics-the driving force behind the "blockbuster" product concept-to personalized medicine. For central nervous system (CNS) therapeutics, repeated failures in converting scientific discoveries to clinical trial successes and regulatory approvals have precipitated a drug pipeline crisis and eroded confidence in the industry This chapter describes how innovations in genomics and translational medicine can impact the future of neuropsychiatry and deconvolute the complexity of psychiatric diseases from symptoms biology A targeted and consistent investment is needed to restore confidence in translating science into clinical success.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review systematically the available literature relating to the implementation of peer education to promote health and healthy behaviour in prisons.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors undertook a narrative systematic review of Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Psychinfo, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Relevant journals and reference lists were hand searched for relevant articles to be included in the review. Of the abstracts found, full-text papers were retrieved for those papers deemed as possibly fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the review.
   Findings - A total of 3,033 abstracts were identified leading to 46 full-text articles being retrieved, of which ten were included in the review. Peer education in prisons can have an impact on attitudes, knowledge, and behaviour intention regarding HIV risk behaviour. The research findings were inconclusive for the impact of peer education upon illicit drug use and injecting practice. There was a paucity of research evaluating the impact of peer education upon mental ill health, obesity, diet, smoking, or self-management of chronic physical diseases.
   Originality/value - Peer education is effective in reducing risk of HIV transmission. It is possible that peer education for mental health issues is stigmatising, presenting an opportunity for further research activity. The impact of peer education upon illicit drug use practice, obesity, diet, smoking, and self-management of chronic physical diseases also presents further research opportunities. Research evaluating models of active peer educator involvement in health service delivery and organisation is also lacking.

To gain insight into iron biogeochemistry and its environmental impacts in freshwater lakes, we collected and reviewed numerous studies on iron in combination with our own work. Our review reports iron sources, iron speciation, iron cycle and iron uptake mechanisms as well as impacts of iron on physiology and ecology of phytoplankton and aquatic plants in freshwater lakes. We also proposed some suggestions for further studies.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that appears essentially as a sporadic condition. PD is well known to be a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease produced by a selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The main clinical features of PD include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. Most insights into pathogenesis of PD come from investigations performed in experimental models of PD, especially those produced by neurotoxins. The biochemical and cellular alterations that occur after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment are remarkably similar to that observed in idiopathic PD. Furthermore, it is well known that acute treatment with MPTP can cause a severe loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter protein levels and dopamine contents in the striatum of mice, as compared to continuous MPTP treatment. Thus these findings may support the validity of acute MPTP treatment model for unraveling in the neurodegenerative processes in PD. In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective effects of various compounds against neuronal cell loss in an MPTP model of PD. This review may lead to a much better understanding of PD as well as provide novel clues to new targets for therapeutic interventions in PD patients.

AB  - Background: Depression after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with worse cardiac outcomes. This systematic review evaluated whether depressed ACS patients are at differential risk depending on the recurrence and timing of onset of depressive episodes. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched from inception to 11 April 2009. Additionally, reference lists and recent tables of contents of 34 selected journals were manually searched. Eligible studies evaluated cardiovascular outcomes for subgroups of ACS patients with depression or depressive symptoms according to recurrence or onset. Results: Six studies were included that reported outcomes for subgroups of ACS patients with first-ever versus recurrent depression. Four of these reported also outcomes for post-ACS onset versus pre-ACS onset depression, and incident versus nonincident depression. Worse outcomes (odds ratio >1.4) were reported for ACS patients with first-ever depression in 3 of 6 studies (1 study p < 0.05), for patients with post-ACS onset depression in 3 of 4 studies (1 study p < 0.05, but better outcomes in one study) and for patients with incident depression in 2 of 4 studies (no studies p < 0.05). Conclusions: Although it is still suggested that ACS patients with first and new-onset depression are at particularly increased risk of worse prognosis, the inconsistent results from the studies included in this systematic review show that there is no consistent evidence to support such statements.

AB  - Background: Adolescents and young adults frequently experience mental disorders, yet tend not to seek help. This systematic review aims to summarise reported barriers and facilitators of help-seeking in young people using both qualitative research from surveys, focus groups, and interviews and quantitative data from published surveys. It extends previous reviews through its systematic research methodology and by the inclusion of published studies describing what young people themselves perceive are the barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for common mental health problems.
   Methods: Twenty two published studies of perceived barriers or facilitators in adolescents or young adults were identified through searches of PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane database. A thematic analysis was undertaken on the results reported in the qualitative literature and quantitative literature.
   Results: Fifteen qualitative and seven quantitative studies were identified. Young people perceived stigma and embarrassment, problems recognising symptoms (poor mental health literacy), and a preference for self-reliance as the most important barriers to help-seeking. Facilitators were comparatively under-researched. However, there was evidence that young people perceived positive past experiences, and social support and encouragement from others as aids to the help-seeking process.
   Conclusions: Strategies for improving help-seeking by adolescents and young adults should focus on improving mental health literacy, reducing stigma, and taking into account the desire of young people for self-reliance.

AB  - Body energy reserves and metabolic state are relevant modifiers of puberty onset and fertility forms of metabolic stress ranging from persistent energy insufficiency to morbid obesity are frequently linked to reproductive disorders The mechanisms for such a close connection between energy balance and reproduction have been the subject of considerable attention however our understanding of the neurobiological basis for this phenomenon is still incomplete In mid 1990s the adipose hormone leptin was proven as an essential signal for transmitting metabolic information onto the centers governing puberty and reproduction yet, the ultimate mode of action of leptin on GnRH neurons has remained contentious for years More recently kisspeptins a family of neuropeptides encoded by the Kiss1 gene, have emerged as conduits for the metabolic regulation of reproduction and putative effectors of leptin actions on GnRH neurons This review recapitulates the experimental evidence obtained to date mostly in laboratory rodents, supporting the function of kisspeptins in bridging energy balance and reproduction, with special emphasis on recent developments in this field, such as the recognition of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and Crtc1 (Creb1 regulated transcripton coactivator 1) as putative mediators for leptin regulation of Kiss1 expression as well as the identification of other potential metabolic modulators of kisspeptin signaling such as ghrelin, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - Objective: In recent years, there has been a plethora of cancer mortality and incidence data reported in schizophrenia. Despite this, there has been little focus on cancer in schizophrenia guidelines. Additionally, there have been suggestions that schizophrenia may provide inherent protection against cancer. The goal of this review is to establish, using recent data, the incidence and mortality rates for cancer in schizophrenia.
   Method: We identified systematic reviews and meta-analyses and undertook a search using the Medical Subject Headings' entry terms schizophrenia and neoplasm.
   Results: Incidence and mortality rates for cancer in schizophrenia are increased, compared with relevant general populations. Data are not uniformly reported and cohort ages tend to be young for expected cancer incidence. Despite the young cohort ages, the incidence of the major cancers-lung and breast-are substantially increased. Confounders are often not measured in the epidemiologic databases. When lung cancer is adjusted for smoking rates, there appears to be a lower risk of lung cancer than expected providing some basis to support an inherently reduced risk of cancer. There may also be a dissonance between incidence and mortality rates that suggest a prejudice against either diagnosis or treatment of these vulnerable patients.
   Conclusion: A single definitive study of schizophrenia and cancer is unfeasible, and future research will lean heavily on systematic review and meta-analysis. Researchers should report cancer data to include age and follow-up data and cohort overlap. Cancer accounts for almost an equivalent mortality as cardiovascular disease.

Methods: A literature search was conducted using Medline to collect data from studies on heat waves, temperature-health impacts curve, risk factors, and preventive measures. All the data collected was published in English and available up to December 2009. Results: Numerous studies carried out in Europe following the 2003 heat wave, as well as those conducted prior to this date in Europe and North America, showed an increase in heat wave-related excess mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated that a forward shift of deaths may only explain a very limited quantity of the excess mortality observed (up to 15%) during major heat waves. Moreover, the results seem to exclude that ozone acts as a confounding variable, whilst it remains a potential effect modifier. Conclusions: Future research needs to explore the consistency of results in new settings, to quantify the burden of heat-related morbidity and in particular to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented preventive measures.

AB  - The production of biodiesel from waste vegetable oil offers a triple-facet solution: economic, environmental and waste management. The new process technologies developed during the last years made it possible to produce biodiesel from recycled frying oils comparable in quality to that of virgin vegetable oil biodiesel with an added attractive advantage of being lower in price. Thus, biodiesel produced from recycled frying oils has the same possibilities to be utilized. While transesterification is well-established and becoming increasingly important, there remains considerable inefficiencies in existing transesterification processes. There is an imperative need to improve the existing biodiesel production methods from both economic and environmental viewpoints and to investigate alternative and innovative production processes. This study highlights the main changes occurring in the oil during frying in order to identify the characteristics of oil after frying and the anticipated effects of the products formed in the frying process on biodiesel quality and attempts to review the different techniques used in the production of biodiesel from recycled oils, stressing the advantages and limitations of each technique and the optimization conditions for each process. The emerging technologies which can be utilized in this field are also investigated. The quality of biodiesel produced from waste vegetable oil in previous studies is also reviewed and the performance of engines fueled with this biodiesel and the characteristics of the exhaust emissions resulting from it are highlighted. The overarching goal is to stimulate further activities in the field.

AB  - Aims and method The evidence of the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural interventions is well established. Despite this, clinicians often face a consistent number of not attended appointments or early treatment discontinuation rates. This paper reviews the literature to date regarding the possible causes of early termination of cognitive-behavioural interventions. A literature search was done using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and the Cochrane Library.
   Results We reviewed 14 articles. Out of these, two were randomised controlled trials, one was a controlled trial and the rest were cohort studies. Drop-out was defined differently across papers. There are many factors that may affect early treatment discontinuation rates and they are described individually.
   Clinical implications There does not appear to be a single strong predictor of early treatment discontinuation. Specific literature relating to cognitive-behavioural therapy is scarce. However, some factors such as young age, education level and psychopathology appear to be more strongly associated with early treatment discontinuation than others.

AB  - alpha-Synuclein is central to the Lewy body neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by numerous motor and non-motor manifestations. The cardinal motor symptoms are linked to death of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Here we ask why these neurons are preferentially susceptible to neurodegeneration in PD and how alpha-synuclein is involved. To address these questions we bring together recent findings from genome-wide association studies, which reveal the involvement of alpha-synuclein gene variants in sporadic PD, with recent studies highlighting important roles for alpha-synuclein in synaptic transmission and dopaminergic neuron physiology. These latest advances add to our understanding of PD etiology and provide a central link between the genetic findings and neurodegeneration observed in sporadic PD.

AB  - In the field of cortical cellular physiology, much effort has been invested in understanding thick apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons and the regenerative sodium and calcium spikes that take place in the apical trunk. Here we focus on thin dendrites of pyramidal cells (basal, oblique, and tuft dendrites), and we discuss one relatively novel form of an electrical signal ("NMDA spike") that is specific for these branches. Basal, oblique, and apical tuft dendrites receive a high density of glutamatergic synaptic contacts. Synchronous activation of 10-50 neighboring glutamatergic synapses triggers a local dendritic regenerative potential, NMDA spike/plateau, which is characterized by significant local amplitude (40-50 mV) and an extraordinary duration (up to several hundred milliseconds). The NMDA plateau potential, when it is initiated in an apical tuft dendrite, is able to maintain a good portion of that tuft in a sustained depolarized state. However, if NMDA-dominated plateau potentials originate in proximal segments of basal dendrites, they regularly bring the neuronal cell body into a sustained depolarized state, which resembles a cortical Up state. At each dendritic initiation site (basal, oblique, and tuft) an NMDA spike creates favorable conditions for causal interactions of active synaptic inputs, including the spatial or temporal binding of information, as well as processes of short-term and long-term synaptic modifications (e.g., long-term potentiation or long-term depression). Because of their strong amplitudes and durations, local dendritic NMDA spikes make up the cellular substrate for multisite independent subunit computations that enrich the computational power and repertoire of cortical pyramidal cells. We propose that NMDA spikes are likely to play significant roles in cortical information processing in awake animals (spatiotemporal binding, working memory) and during slow-wave sleep (neuronal Up states, consolidation of memories).

AB  - Twelve years on from Suddendorf and Corballis's mental time travel (MTT) hypothesis, the debate as to whether episodic cognition is unique to humans remains unresolved. In this article, we review the evidence for mental time travel in nonhuman animals and the empirical methods used in this field. Investigation of episodic-likememory has been dominated by 'What-Where-When' paradigms, with limited success outside of food-caching corvids, and with only scrub-jays meeting Clayton and colleagues' more specific description of the underlying mnemonics. The recent emergence of an 'unexpected question' paradigm tapping recall of unattended aspects of episodes provides a promising new avenue for future studies. Falsification of the Bischof-Kohler hypothesis, that acting to satisfy a future motivational state is beyond the scope of nonhuman animals, has been the 'holy grail' of animal future planning research, spawning a plethora of studies. We argue that although the criterion proposed by this hypothesis provides a test for an explicit representation of a future time, it does nothing to get at whether planning for this future is mediated by semantic or episodic processes.

AB  - Delusions are the false and often incorrigible beliefs that can cause severe suffering in mental illness. We cannot yet explain them in terms of underlying neurobiological abnormalities. However, by drawing on recent advances in the biological, computational and psychological processes of reinforcement learning, memory, and perception it may be feasible to account for delusions in terms of cognition and brain function. The account focuses on a particular parameter, prediction error - the mismatch between expectation and experience - that provides a computational mechanism common to cortical hierarchies, fronto-striatal circuits and the amygdala as well as parietal cortices. We suggest that delusions result from aberrations in how brain circuits specify hierarchical predictions, and how they compute and respond to prediction errors. Defects in these fundamental brain mechanisms can vitiate perception, memory, bodily agency and social learning such that individuals with delusions experience an internal and external world that healthy individuals would find difficult to comprehend. The present model attempts to provide a framework through which we can build a mechanistic and translational understanding of these puzzling symptoms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electroporation is a widely used technique for enhancing the efficiency of DNA delivery into cells. Application of electric pulses after local injection of DNA temporarily opens cell membranes and facilitates DNA uptake. Delivery of plasmid DNA by electroporation to alter gene expression in tissue has also been explored in vivo. This approach may constitute an alternative to viral gene transfer, or to transgenic or knock-out animals. Among the most frequently electroporated target tissues are skin, muscle, eye, and tumors. Moreover, different regions in the central nervous system (CNS), including the developing neural tube and the spinal cord, as well as prenatal and postnatal brain have been successfully electroporated. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the literature describing electroporation of the CNS with a focus on the adult brain. In addition, the mechanism of electroporation, different ways of delivering the electric pulses, and the risk of damaging the target tissue are highlighted. Electroporation has been successfully used in humans to enhance gene transfer in vaccination or cancer therapy with several clinical trials currently ongoing. Improving the knowledge about in vivo electroporation will pave the way for electroporation-enhanced gene therapy to treat brain carcinomas, as well as CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases exhibit varying and characteristic patterns of regional brain cell death, yet in each disorder there are distinct variations in the relative vulnerability of neurons within targeted brain regions. For example, in Parkinson's disease (PD) up to 90% of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tier of the substantia nigra pars compacta are lost at post-mortem, while as few as 25% of dopaminergic neurons in the dorsal tier of this nucleus succumb to the disease process. To date the reasons underlying differential vulnerability of similar neurons within a defined cytoarchitectural region has received little attention. We suggest variations in protein distribution underlies this differential vulnerability. Within the substantia nigra pars compacta the more vulnerable neurons exhibit an increased expression of factors that may contribute to vulnerability (D-2 dopamine autoreceptors, GIRK-2 potassium channels, lactotransferrin and the dopamine transporter) while also expressing a relative lack of neuroprotective elements (dopamine vesicle transport protein and a number of trophic and growth factors). Differential distribution of key proteins expressed by individual cells within the same cytoarchitectural brain region may influence the severity and likelihood of common neurodegenerative mechanisms, such as protein aggregation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptosis, and thus the eventual fate of individual cells in the disease process. An understanding of how variable protein expression can influence cell survival within the diseased human brain in a range of neurodegenerative disorders may provide avenues for the development of novel strategies to improve the survival of targeted neurons in vivo.

AB  - Objective: Work is currently under way on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fifth Edition, due to be published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013. Dissatisfaction with the current categorical descriptive approach has led to aspirations for a paradigm shift for DSM-5.
   Method: A historical review of past revisions of the DSM was performed. Efforts undertaken before the start of the DSM-5 development process to conduct a state-of-the science review and set a research agenda were examined to determine if results supported a paradigm shift for DSM-5. Proposals to supplement DSM-5 categorical diagnosis with dimensional assessments are reviewed and critiqued.
   Results: DSM revisions have alternated between paradigm shifts (the first edition of the DSM in 1952 and DSM-III in 1980) and incremental improvements (DSM-II in 1968, DSM-III-R in 1987, and DSM-IV in 1994). The results of the review of the DSM-5 research planning initiatives suggest that despite the scientific advances that have occurred since the descriptive approach was first introduced in 1980, the field lacks a sufficiently deep understanding of mental disorders to justify abandoning the descriptive approach in favour of a more etiologically based alternative. Proposals to add severity and cross-cutting dimensions throughout DSM-5 are neither paradigm shifting, given that simpler versions of such dimensions are already a component of DSM-IV, nor likely to be used by busy clinicians without evidence that they improve clinical outcomes.
   Conclusions: Despite initial aspirations that DSM would undergo a paradigm shift with this revision, DSM-5 will continue to adopt a descriptive categorical approach, albeit with a greatly expanded dimensional component. Can J Psychiatry. 2010; 55(11): 692-700.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are a group of hereditary and sporadic conditions that are characterized by progressive nervous system dysfunctions. These disorders are often associated with neuronal atrophy and are characterized by the presence of intra- or extra-neuronal inclusions in the central or peripheral nervous system. The emerging understanding on these apparently diverse set of disorders suggest that they share a few key pathomechanisms, one of which could be the abnormality in the protein quality control pathways. Recent studies have shown that either an overload on the proteolytic pathways - the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagosome-lysosome system - or defects in the critical components of these pathways might underlie the neuropathology. Here, we review the recent advances in our understanding on the role of protein quality control systems in the pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders, highlight the interdependence between the two pathways and their involvement in neuronal survival.

AB  - The present review investigates the empirical evidence from cross-sectional and long-term follow-up studies on neurocognitive indicators of an increased risk for developing schizophrenia spectrum psychoses in clinically defined high-risk samples. First, the investigations at the Cologne center for early recognition and intervention are briefly summarized and then integrated within the available literature. Thirty-two studies with original data could be identified by extensive literature search. Cross-sectional investigations of neurocognitive baseline assessments in high-risk samples with unknown conversion status have produced rather inconsistent results. Nevertheless, most convincing evidence could be collected for abnormal functioning in processing speed measures (digit symbol coding, Trailmaking Test-B, Stroop Color Naming), the Continuous Performance Test, verbal working memory measures, verbal memory and learning, and verbal fluency, though negative findings have also been reported in every instance. Moreover, high-risk subjects were found to perform both at the schizophrenia performance level and at a close to normal level. Longitudinal follow-up assessments provided predictive evidence with regard to psychosis conversion for measures of processing speed and of verbal memory and learning. However, a substantial number of negative findings does not allow for straight-forward conclusions. Finally, some reasons for inconsistent findings are discussed critically speculating on demographic differences, reliability and sample sizes, and conceptual imprecision in communicating results.

My discussion begins with the basics regarding what brain activity ERPs measure and why they are well suited to reveal critical aspects of perceptual processing, attentional selection, and cognition, which are unobservable with behavioral methods alone. I then review a number of important methodological issues and often-forgotten facts that should be considered when evaluating or planning ERP experiments.

Furthermore, the cultural characteristics of depressive postpartum symptomatology are examined. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted for the period 1987-2009, using the Medline electronic database for the following keywords: postpartum depression and postnatal depression. These terms were combined with: assessment, screening and psychometric tools. Results: Of the four screening tools reviewed and compared, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) presented substantial sensitivity and specificity as screening tools. However, none of the instruments could be rated flawless when applied to different cultural contexts. Conclusions: In addition to the EPDS, a new generation of instruments is currently available. Supplementary research is needed to substantiate their use as screening tools in general practice. Additional studies are needed to adapt and test instruments to detect postnatal depression within a wider range of languages and cultures.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a large group of neurological disorders. Clinical symptoms can include memory loss, cognitive impairment, loss of movement or loss of control of movement, and loss of sensation. Symptoms are typically adult onset (although severe cases can occur in adolescents) and are reflective of neuronal and glial cell loss in the central nervous system. Neurodegenerative diseases also are considered progressive, with increased severity of symptoms over time, also reflective of increased neuronal cell death. However, various neurodegenerative diseases differentially affect certain brain regions or neuronal or glial cell types. As an example, Alzheimer disease (AD) primarily affects the temporal lobe, whereas neuronal loss in Parkinson disease (PD) is largely (although not exclusively) confined to the nigrostriatal system. Neuronal loss is almost invariably accompanied by abnormal insoluble aggregates, either intra- or extracellular. Thus, neurodegenerative diseases are categorized by (a) the composite of clinical symptoms, (b) the brain regions or types of brain cells primarily affected, and (c) the types of protein aggregates found in the brain. Here we review the methods by which Drosophila melanogaster has been used to model aspects of polyglutamine diseases, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and key insights into that have been gained from these models; Alzheimer disease and the tauopathies are covered elsewhere in this special issue.

   High levels of fear are associated with earlier help-seeking in both diseases; for low levels of fear, the picture is unclear.
   The level of fear is an important factor, which should be taken into account when facilitating help-seeking by patients.

AB  - Functional stereotaxy was introduced in the late 1940s to reduce the morbidity of lobotomy in psychiatric disease by using more focal lesions. The advent of neuroleptics led to a drastic decline in psychosurgery for several decades. Functional stereotactic neurosurgery has recently been revitalized, starting with treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which deep brain stimulation (DBS) facilitates reversible focal neuromodulation of altered basal ganglia circuits. DBS is now being extended to treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and addiction. In this review, we discuss the concept that dysfunction of motor, limbic and associative cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops underlies these various disorders, which might now be amenable to DBS treatment.

AB  - Background and Aim: Published research on suicidality among Norwegian youth and publications describing interventions were summarized in order to access the current status of knowledge building via empirical research. Method: A systematic Medline search identified 29 studies on risk factors on the entire spectrum of suicidal phenomena from self-harm without suicidal ideation to completed suicide with the mean age at/under 25 years. A specialist Norwegian journal, Suicidologi, was searched for additional matter, especially interventions. Result: Most studies focussed on psychological and psychiatric risk factors of attempted suicide. Other suicidal phenomena, psychosocial and societal risk factors, and impact of interventions were hardly studied. Depression, previous suicidal behaviour, alcohol use and non-intact parental unit were consistent significant risk factors found in suicide and attempted suicide studies. Conclusion: Supporting non-intact parental units and the maintenance of intact parental units along with early detection and management of suicide attempts, depression and alcohol use should be targeted as suicide prevention interventions among adolescents.

   Method:
   We conducted a systematic search in the literature. Normal population studies and clinical studies were included. The methodological quality of each study was evaluated by objective criteria. A best evidence synthesis was used to determine the strengths of the association.
   Results:
   Sixteen studies were included. We found convincing evidence for a negative association between AP and AA. After controlling for intelligence, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status (SES), the association between the hyperactive symptoms of AP and AA was non-significant in two studies.
   Conclusion:
   Children with AP are at risk for lower AA and subsequent adverse outcomes later in life. Interventions in affected children should focus on their behavioural and educational development.

AB  - Aim - To review the literature on the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy [ECT], with a particular focus on depression, its primary target group. Methods - PsycINFO, Med line, previous reviews and meta-analyses were searched in an attempt to identify all studies comparing ECT with simulated-ECT [SECT]. Results - These placebo controlled studies show minimal support for effectiveness with either depression or 'schizophrenia' during the course of treatment (i.e. only for some patients, on some measures, sometimes perceived only by psychiatrists but not by other raters), and no evidence, for either diagnostic group, of any benefits beyond the treatment period. There are no placebo-controlled studies evaluating the hypothesis that ECT prevents suicide, and no robust evidence from other kinds of studies to support the hypothesis. Conclusions - Given the strong evidence (summarised here) of persistent and, for some, permanent brain dysfunction, primarily evidenced in the form of retrograde and anterograde amnesia, and the evidence of a slight but significant increased risk of death, the cost-benefit analysis for ECT is so poor that its use cannot be scientifically justified.

AB  - Adult-onset neurodegeneration and other protein conformational diseases are associated with the appearance, persistence, and accumulation of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins. To protect the proteome from long-term damage, the cell expresses a highly integrated protein homeostasis (proteostasis) machinery to ensure that proteins are properly expressed, folded, and cleared, and to recognize damaged proteins. Molecular chaperones have a central role in proteostasis as they have been shown to be essential to prevent the accumulation of alternate folded proteotoxic states as occurs in protein conformation diseases exemplified by neurodegeneration. Studies using invertebrate models expressing proteins associated with Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, and Parkinson's disease have provided insights into the genetic networks and stress signaling pathways that regulate the proteostasis machinery to prevent cellular dysfunction, tissue pathology, and organismal failure. These events appear to be further amplified by aging and provide evidence that age-related failures in proteostasis may be a common element in many diseases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most acutely effective treatment for depression, but is limited by cognitive side effects. However, research on their persistence, severity, and pattern is inconsistent. We aimed to quantify ECT-associated cognitive changes, specify their pattern, and determine progression.
   Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycArticles, PsychINFO, PsychLIT, and reference lists were systematically searched through January 2009. We included all independent, within-subjects design studies of depressed patients receiving ECT where cognition was assessed using standardized tests. Main outcome was change in performance after ECT relative to pretreatment scores with respect to delay between finishing ECT and cognitive testing. We explored potential moderators' influence, e.g., electrode placement, stimulus waveform.
   Results: Twenty-four cognitive variables (84 studies, 2981 patients) were meta-analyzed. No standardized retrograde amnesia tests were identified. Significant decreases in cognitive performance were observed 0 to 3 days after ECT in 72% of variables: effect sizes (ES) ranging from -1.10 (95% confidence interval [Cl], -1.53 to -.67) to -.21 (95% Cl, -.40 to .01). Four to 15 days post-ECT, all but one Cl included zero or showed positive ES. No negative ES were observed after 15 days, with 57% of variables showing positive ES, ranging from .35 (95% Cl, .07-.63) to .75 (95% Cl, .43-1.08). Moderators did not influence cognitive outcomes after 3 days post-ECT.
   Conclusions: Cognitive abnormalities associated with ECT are mainly limited to the first 3 days posttreatment. Pretreatment functioning levels are subsequently recovered. After 15 days, processing speed, working memory, anterograde memory, and some aspects of executive function improve beyond baseline levels.

AB  - In the past 50 years, extensive evidence has shown the ability of vertebrate cardiac non-neuronal cells to synthesize and release catecholamines (CA). This formed the mindset behind the search for the intrinsic endocrine heart properties, culminating in 1981 with the discovery of the natriuretic peptides (NP). CA and NP, co-existing in the endocrine secretion granules and acting as major cardiovascular regulators in health and disease, have become of great biomedical relevance for their potent diagnostic and therapeutic use. The concept of the endocrine heart was later enriched by the identification of a growing number of cardiac hormonal substances involved in organ modulation under normal and stress-induced conditions. Recently, chromogranin A (CgA), a major constituent of the secretory granules, and its derived cardio-suppressive and antiadrenergic peptides, vasostatin-1 and catestatin, were shown as new players in this framework, functioning as cardiac counter-regulators in 'zero steady-state error' homeostasis, particularly under intense excitatory stimuli, e. g. CA-induced myocardial stress. Here, we present evidence for the hypothesis that is gaining support, particularly among human cardiologists. The actions of CA, NP and CgA, we argue, may be viewed as a hallmark of the cardiac capacity to organize 'whip-brake' connection-integration processes in spatio-temporal networks. The involvement of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)/nitric oxide (NO) system in this configuration is discussed. The use of fish and amphibian paradigms will illustrate the ways that incipient endocrine-humoral agents have evolved as components of cardiac molecular loops and important intermediates during evolutionary transitions, or in a distinct phylogenetic lineage, or under stress challenges. This may help to grasp the old evolutionary roots of these intracardiac endocrine/paracrine networks and how they have evolved from relatively less complicated designs. The latter can also be used as an intellectual tool to disentangle the experimental complexity of the mammalian and human endocrine hearts, suggesting future investigational avenues.

AB  - Workplace stressors are associated with greater coronary heart disease risk, although there is debate over the psychophysiological consequences of work stress. This study builds on recent reviews and examines the literature linking work stress with sympatho-adrenal biomarkers (plasma catecholamines and heart rate variability) and HPA axis biomarkers - the post-morning profile of cortisol.
   Methods: Relevant studies using appropriate search terms were searched using the bibliographic databases PubMed, Embase, Biosys and Toxline. Four studies on plasma catecholamines, 10 studies on heart rate variability, and 16 studies on post-morning cortisol were reviewed.
   Results: In the majority of studies that examined the association of HRV and work stress, greater reports of work stress is associated with lower heart rate variability. The findings for plasma catecholamines and cortisol secretion are less clear cut and suffer from poorer quality of studies in general. Conclusion: There is evidence that work stress is related to elevated stress responses in terms of sympatho-adrenal and HPA axis biomarkers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background O*NET is a publicly available online database that describes occupational features across US job titles and that has been used to estimate workplace physical and psychosocial exposures and organizational characteristics. The aim of this review is to describe and evaluate the use of O*NET as a job exposure matrix.
   Methods A review of the peer-reviewed published and gray literature was conducted. Twenty-eight studies were found that used O*NET to estimate work exposures related to health or safety outcomes. Each was systematically evaluated across eight main features.
   Results Many health outcomes have been studied with O*NET estimates of job exposures. Some studies did not use conceptual definitions of exposure; few studies estimated convergent validity, most used predictive validity. Multilevel analysis was underutilized.
   Conclusion O*NET is worthy of exploration by the occupational health community, although its scientific value is still undetermined. More studies could eventually provide evidence of convergent validity. O*NET has the potential to allow examination of occupational risks that might have otherwise been ignored due to missing data or resource constraints on field data collection of job exposure information.

AB  - Background: Early child development interventions can set children on positive social and educational trajectories. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence for the adult health impacts of centre-based preschool interventions for preschoolers.
   Methods: Medline, Embase, ERIC, Psych Info, Sociological Abstracts, the Cochrane Library, C2-SPECTR and the Head Start database were searched (1980-2008), and reference lists were searched for articles missed by the electronic search.
   Results: The 12 eligible articles reviewed reported multi-faceted interventions and involved disadvantaged populations in all but one study. Limitations included a restricted range of health outcomes, reliance on self-report measures (11 studies), small sample sizes (nine studies with <100 in each arm) and a relatively young adult age at follow-up. There were positive intervention effects across the majority of behavioural outcomes, and a suggestion of a reduction in symptoms of depression. Non-communicable disease outcomes (e. g. diabetes mellitus) tended to have adverse or near-zero effect estimates.
   Conclusions: The reviewed articles provide some support for the role of early childhood interventions to improve health behaviours but not chronic disease outcomes. Population health researchers should become more involved in the evaluation of preschool interventions as there is great potential for broad population health benefit.

AB  - Creativity is a cornerstone of what makes us human, yet the neural mechanisms underlying creative thinking are poorly understood. A recent surge of interest into the neural underpinnings of creative behavior has produced a banquet of data that is tantalizing but, considered as a whole, deeply self-contradictory. We review the emerging literature and take stock of several long-standing theories and widely held beliefs about creativity. A total of 72 experiments, reported in 63 articles, make up the core of the review. They broadly fall into 3 categories: divergent thinking, artistic creativity, and insight. Electroencephalographic studies of divergent thinking yield highly variegated results. Neuroimaging studies of this paradigm also indicate no reliable changes above and beyond diffuse prefrontal activation. These findings call into question the usefulness of the divergent thinking construct in the search for the neural basis of creativity. A similarly inconclusive picture emerges for studies of artistic performance, except that this paradigm also often yields activation of motor and temporoparietal regions. Neuroelectric and imaging studies of insight are more consistent, reflecting changes in anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal areas. Taken together, creative thinking does not appear to critically depend on any single mental process or brain region, and it is not especially associated with right brains, defocused attention, low arousal, or alpha synchronization, as sometimes hypothesized. To make creativity tractable in the brain, it must be further subdivided into different types that can be meaningfully associated with specific neurocognitive processes.

AB  - Cumulative acute psychosocial stress is thought to promote the development of a range of disorders which suggests that biomarkers for the physiological response may become valuable tools for biomedical research and development. The search for these biomarkers has been aided by the development of a standardised protocol for inducing psychosocial stress that combines social-evaluative threat and uncontrollability, i.e., the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Among other biological markers of acute stress, this test induces significant changes of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), which is thought to play a pivotal role in the generation of stress-associated pathologies. The HPAA responses show differences between patients and healthy subjects as well as between pathologies. Moreover, gender, age, personality traits, social environment, and genotype can also shape the individual's acute stress response triggered by the TSST. Characterization of the roles and interactions of these factors in generating a dysregulation of the neuroendocrine responses to acute psychosocial stress await longitudinal studies.

KW  - COUNTERTRANSFERENCE
KW  - THERAPY
AB  - Introduction: Malignant Narcissism has been recognized as a serious condition but it has been largely ignored in psychiatric literature and research. In order to bring this subject to the attention of mental health professionals, this paper presents a contemporary synthesis of the biopsychosocial dynamics and recommendations for treatment of Malignant Narcissism.
   Methods: We reviewed the literature on Malignant Narcissism which was sparse. It was first described in psychiatry by Otto Kernberg in 1984. There have been few contributions to the literature since that time. We discovered that the syndrome of Malignant Narcissism was expressed in fairy tales as a part of the collective unconscious long before it was recognized by psychiatry. We searched for prominent malignant narcissists in recent history. We reviewed the literature on treatment and developed categories for family assessment.
   Results: Malignant Narcissism is described as a core Narcissistic personality disorder, antisocial behavior, ego-syntonic sadism, and a paranoid orientation. There is no structured interview or self-report measure that identifies Malignant Narcissism and this interferes with research, clinical diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents a synthesis of current knowledge about Malignant Narcissism and proposes a foundation for treatment.
   Conclusions: Malignant Narcissism is a severe personality disorder that has devastating consequences for the family and society. It requires attention within the discipline of psychiatry and the social science community. We recommend treatment in a therapeutic community and a program of prevention that is focused on psychoeducation, not only in mental health professionals, but in the wider social community.

AB  - Decision making is studied from a number of different theoretical approaches. Normative theories focus on how to make the best decisions by deriving algebraic representations of preference from idealized behavioral axioms. Descriptive theories adopt this algebraic representation, but incorporate known limitations of human behavior. Computational approaches start from a different set of assumptions altogether, focusing instead on the underlying cognitive and emotional processes that result in the selection of one option over the other. This review comprehensively but concisely describes and contrasts three approaches in terms of their theoretical assumptions and their ability to account for behavioral and neurophysiological evidence from experimental research. Although each approach contributes substantially to our understanding of human decision making, we argue that the computational approach is more fruitful and parsimonious for describing and predicting choices in both laboratory and applied settings and for understanding the neurophysiological substrates of decision making.

AB  - Objectives: A considerable body of literature has reported on emotion perception deficits and the relevance to clinical symptoms and social functioning in schizophrenia. Studies published between 1970-2007 were examined regarding emotion perception abilities between patient and control groups and potential methodological, demographic, and clinical moderators. Data Sources and Review: Eighty-six studies were identified through a computerized literature search of the MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and PubMed databases. A quality of reporting of meta-analysis standard was followed in the extraction of relevant studies and data. Data on emotion perception, methodology, demographic and clinical characteristics, and antipsychotic medication status were compiled and analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis Version 2.0 (Borenstein M, Hedges L, Higgins J and Rothstein H. Comprehensive Meta-analysis. 2. Englewood, NJ: Biostat; 2005). Results: The meta-analysis revealed a large deficit in emotion perception in schizophrenia, irrespective of task type, and several factors that moderated the observed impairment. Illness-related factors included current hospitalization and-in part-clinical symptoms and antipsychotic treatment. Demographic factors included patient age and gender in controls but not race. Conclusion: Emotion perception impairment in schizophrenia represents a robust finding in schizophrenia that appears to be moderated by certain clinical and demographic factors. Future directions for research on emotion perception are discussed.

   To review the literature on the involvement of glutamate (Glu), including its interactions with other neurochemical systems, in the pathophysiology of depression.
   Method:
   A MEDLINE search using the terms glutamate, depression and major depressive disorder, was performed.
   Results:
   Alterations in proteins involved in glutamatergic signalling are implicated in variations in behaviour in animal models of depression. Drugs acting at Glu receptors appear to have antidepressant-like effects in these models, and traditional antidepressant pharmacotherapies act on the glutamatergic system. Recent evidence from genetic studies and in vivo spectroscopy also correlate glutamatergic dysfunction with depression. Trials of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists in humans have provided mixed results.
   Conclusion:
   A growing body of evidence indicates that the glutamatergic system is involved in the pathophysiology of depression, and may represent a target for intervention.

AB  - Background: There is little published in the field of mental health services for traumatized people in Bangladesh. Objective: To identify the existence of any services for people with psychological trauma and to describe how they work.
   Method: A telephone survey using a semi-structured interview was carried out in Summer 2008. Eight organisations were contacted, including two government agencies, two universities and four non-governmental agencies (NGOs).
   Results: The survey identified eight services, seven of which were based in Dhaka. Three of the respondents provided services for children. Mental health interventions included selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), counselling, together with medical, educational, legal and occupational support.
   Conclusions: There are services for traumatized people in Dhaka, but most of the rural population has limited access to them. Respondents acknowledged their training and development needs and the requirement to communicate more with each other. Future research is needed to address the efficacy of these services as well as the unmet necessities of the majority of the rural population of Bangladesh. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background An accumulating body of research demonstrates that risk of suicide varies between occupational groups. Identification of the occupations at risk, and the factors that contribute to the increased risk of suicide in these groups is essential for the development of effective suicide prevention strategies. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that veterinary surgeons are a group at risk.
   Aims To conduct a systematic review of studies of rates and methods of suicide in the veterinary profession.
   Methods A systematic search of the international research literature was performed in May 2008. The data from the 19 studies of the prevalence of suicide in the veterinary profession were extracted by two independent reviewers and analysed.
   Results Between 0 and 43% of veterinary surgeon deaths were due to suicide. In all but one of the 15 studies presenting risk of suicide in veterinary surgeons with a comparison population, an elevated risk was found. The better quality studies with the lowest risk of bias indicated that in the UK, the rate of suicide in the veterinary profession was at least three times the general population rate. Studies of the methods of suicide veterinary surgeons use suggest that self-poisoning and firearms are particularly common.
   Conclusions There appears to be an elevated risk of suicide for veterinary surgeons in several countries. Access to means of suicide influences the methods used and may contribute to increased risk.

AB  - Subject matter experts systematically reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of housing interventions that affect health outcomes associated with exposure to chemical agents, such as pesticides, lead, volatile organic compounds, as well as the radon gas. Particulates were also examined, and the role of ventilation on exposures was assessed. The review included both published literature and peer-reviewed reports from the US Environmental Protection Agency. Four of the 14 interventions reviewed had sufficient evidence to demonstrate their effectiveness and are ready for implementation: radon air mitigation by using active soil depressurization systems, integrated pest management to reduce exposures to pesticides, smoke-free home policies making indoor areas smoke-free (ie, no smoking allowed anywhere at any time), and residential lead hazard control. Four interventions needed more field evaluation, 3 needed formative research, and 3 either had no sufficient evidence of effectiveness or had evidence the interventions were ineffective. This evidence review shows that housing improvements are likely to help reduce radon-induced lung cancer, cardiovascular mortality related to secondhand smoke, and neurological effects from exposure to pesticides and lead paint. Investing in housing interventions may yield important savings from reduced disease and injury from avoidable exposures to chemical agents.

AB  - While problem-solving courts may soon become permanent fixtures within the criminal justice system in Canada, little is actually known of their effectiveness in dealing with crime. The current paper will review the fundamental basis for these court models, with special attention on their arrival in Canada. The focus will be on three particular forms of problem-solving courts mental health court, drug treatment court and community court due in large part to the availability of literature. Existing evaluations, both process and outcome, of both the Canadian and American models will be discussed and their inadequacies addressed. It is hoped that this article will serve to dispel myths surrounding the ethical application of random assignment when evaluating these court systems. Through the application of experimental methodology, evaluations may finally be able to address the issue of whether these court systems are effective alternatives to the traditional criminal justice stream.

AB  - The inaccuracy of the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been a major incentive for studies aimed at the identification of biornarkers. Brain-derived cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins are potential biomarkers considering the major role that proteins play in PD pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the current hypotheses about the pathogenesis of PD and identify the most promising candidate biomarkers among the CSF proteins studied so far. The list of potential markers includes proteins involved in various pathogenetic processes, such as oxidative stress and protein aggregation. This list will undoubtedly grow in the near future by application of CSF proteomics and subsequent validation of identified proteins. Probably a single biomarker will not suffice to reach high sensitivity and specificity, because PD is pathogenetically heterogeneous and shares etiological factors with other neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, identified candidate biomarkers will have to be thoroughly validated before they can be implemented as diagnostic aids. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heavy ion collisions (HICs) represent a unique tool to probe the in-medium nuclear interaction in regions away from saturation. In this review we present a selection of new reaction observables in dissipative collisions particularly sensitive to the symmetry term of the nuclear equation of state (Iso-EoS). We will first discuss the isospin equilibration dynamics. At low energies this manifests via the recently observed dynamical dipole radiation, due to a collective neutron-proton oscillation with the symmetry term acting as a restoring force. At higher beam energies Iso-EoS effects will be seen in an isospin diffusion mechanism, via imbalance ratio measurements, in particular from correlations to the total kinetic energy loss. For fragmentation reactions in central events we suggest to look at the coupling between isospin distillation and radial flow. In neck fragmentation reactions important Iso-EoS information can be obtained from the fragment isospin content, velocity and alignment correlations. The high-density symmetry term can be probed from isospin effects on heavy-ion reactions at relativistic energies ( few A GeV range), in particular for high transverse momentum selections of the reaction products. Rather isospin sensitive observables are proposed from nucleon/cluster emissions, collective flows and meson production. The possibility of shedding light on the controversial neutron/proton effective mass splitting in asymmetric matter is also suggested. A large symmetry repulsion at high baryon density will also lead to an 'earlier' hadron-deconfinement transition in n-rich matter. The binodal transition line of the (T, rho(B)) diagram is lowered to a region accessible through heavy-ion collisions in the energy range of the new planned facilities, e.g. the FAIR/NICA projects. Some observable effects of the formation of a mixed phase are suggested, in particular a neutron trapping mechanism. The dependence of the results on a suitable treatment of the isovector part of the interaction in effective QCD Lagrangian approaches is critically discussed. We stress the interest of this study in nuclear astrophysics, in particular for supernovae explosions and neutron star structure, where the knowledge of the Iso-EoS is important at low as well as at high baryon density.

AB  - Self-regulatory processes play an important role in mediating between the disease and the health outcomes, and potentially also work outcomes. This systematic review aims to explore the relationship between illness perceptions and work participation in patients with somatic diseases and complaints.
   The bibliographic databases Medline, PsycINFO and Embase were searched from inception to March 2008. Included were cross-sectional or longitudinal studies, patients with somatic diseases or complaints, illness perceptions based on at least four dimensions of the common sense model of self-regulation, and work participation.
   Two longitudinal and two cross-sectional studies selected for this review report statistically significant findings for one or more illness perception dimensions in patients with various complaints and illnesses, although some dimensions are significant in one study but not in another. Overall, non-working patients perceived more serious consequences, expected their illness to last a longer time, and reported more symptoms and more emotional responses as a result of their illness. Alternatively, working patients had a stronger belief in the controllability of their condition and a better understanding of their disease.
   The limited number of studies in this review suggests that illness perceptions play a role in the work participation of patients with somatic diseases or complaints, although it is not clear how strong this relationship is and which illness perception dimensions are most useful. Identifying individuals with maladaptive illness perceptions and targeting interventions toward changing these perceptions are promising developments in improving work participation.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that social and vocational interventions effectively enhance social and vocational functioning for individuals with schizophrenia. In this review, we first consider recent advances in vocational and social rehabilitation, then examine current findings on neurocognition, social cognition, and motivation with regard to the impact these elements have on rehabilitation interventions and outcomes. A critical evaluation of recent studies examining standalone treatment approaches and hybrid approaches that integrate components such as cognitive remediation and skills training reveals several ongoing challenges within the field. Greater understanding of the differential impact of various approaches, methods that may increase the magnitude of treatment effects, and the generalization of treatment effects to community functioning are among crucial areas for future research. Overall, these treatments hold promise in improving psychosocial functioning and helping individuals with schizophrenia acquire important life skills.

   The value of drug interviews in the treatment of conversion disorder is at present unknown.
   Aims
   To review all the available papers published in English that report on the use of drug interviews for treating conversion/dissociative disorder.
   Method
   Databases (including EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) were searched from 1920 to 2009. Selected publications had to report on the use of drug interviews in people diagnosed with a conversion/dissociative disorder. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted. Predictors of a positive response were ascertained using meta-analytic techniques.
   Results
   Fifty-five papers meeting inclusion criteria were identified. No studies compared the intervention with a suitable control group. However, two studies reported high response rates when drug interview was used in individuals with treatment-resistant conversion disorder. In the meta-analysis, the use of suggestion and occurrence of emotional catharsis during the interview were positively associated with recovery. Combining two medications and comorbid psychiatric disorder were negatively associated with recovery.
   Conclusions
   The evidence for effectiveness of drug interviews is of poor quality but it may be of benefit in the treatment of acute and treatment-resistant conversion disorder. A proactive approach during the interview, making suggestions the individual will respond, could influence outcome. Comorbid psychiatric disorder should be treated conventionally. Experimental studies to determine efficacy are required.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive, low-cost and easy-to-use technique that can be applied to modify cerebral excitability. This is achieved by weak direct currents to shift the resting potential of cortical neurons. These currents are applied by attaching two electrodes (usually one anode and one cathode) to distinct areas of the skull. Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) is a variant of tDCS where the electrodes are attached to the mastoids behind the ears in order to stimulate the vestibular system. tDCS and GVS are safe when standard procedures are used. We describe the basic physiological mechanisms and application of these procedures. We also review current data on the effects of tDCS and GVS in healthy subjects as well as clinical populations. Significant effects of such stimulation have been reported for motor, visual, somatosensory, attentional, vestibular and cognitive/emotional function as well as for a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, both techniques may induce neuroplastic changes which make them promising techniques in the field of neurorehabilitation. A number of open research questions that could be addressed with tDCS or GVS are formulated in the domains of sensory and motor processing, spatial and nonspatial attention including neglect, spatial cognition and body cognition disorders, as well as novel treatments for various neuropsychological disorders. We conclude that the literature suggests that tDCS and GVS are exciting and easily applicable research tools for neuropsychological as well as clinical-therapeutic investigations.

AB  - Endocannabinoids (eCBs) include a group of lipid mediators that act as endogenous agonists at cannabinoid (CB1, CB2) and vanilloid (TRPV1) receptors. In the last two decades a number of eCBs-metabolizing enzymes have been discovered that, together with eCBs and congeners, target receptors and proteins responsible for their transport and intracellular trafficking form the so-called "endocannabinoid system" (ECS). Within the central nervous system ECS elements participate in neuroprotection against neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. More recently, a role for eCBs has been documented also in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp120-mediated insults, and in HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The modulation of ECS in the latter disease conditions is the subject of this review, that will also address the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of eCBs. In particular, the interactions between neurons and glia during neuroinflammation, and the alterations of ECS in these cells upon gp120 insults and HAD will be discussed, along with the potential therapeutic exploitation of ECS-oriented drugs for the treatment of HAD and related disorders.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT) in relation to bipolar disorder (BD) and neuropsychological functions has been studied little in the field of psychoneuroendocrinology. The aim of this study is to review the current status of the following subjects: (1) cognitive dysfunctions in BD as well as their hypothetic etiology; (2) response of the HPT axis in each phase of BD, and finally, (3) the connection between alterations in HPT and neuropsychological deficits.
   After a careful analysis of the scientific literature, we conclude that more systematic research is needed because most of the issues, such as the role of HPT in BD and the implication of HPT in neuropsychological deficits, still remain unclear.

AB  - "What is an emotion?" William James's seminal paper in Mind (1884) proposed the idea that physiological and behavioral responses precede subjective experience in emotions that are marked by "distinct bodily expression." This notion has broadly inspired the investigation of emotion-specific autonomic nervous system activity, a research topic with great longevity. The trajectory of this literature is traced through its major theoretical challenges from the Cannon-Bard, activation, and Schachter-Singer theories, through its rich empirical history in the field of psychophysiology. Although these studies are marked by various findings, the overall trend of the research supports the notion of autonomic specificity for basic emotions. The construct of autonomic specificity continues to influence a number of core theoretical issues in affective science, such as the existence of basic or 'natural kinds' of emotion, the structure of affective space, the cognition-emotion relationship, and the function of emotion. Moreover, James's classic paper, which stimulated the emergence of psychology from philosophy and physiology in the latter nineteenth century, remains a dynamic force in contemporary emotion research.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature about the efficacy of antidepressant prophylaxis during interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy.
   Method: We have performed a database search in PUBMED and ISI Web of Knowledge (1980-August 2009) for the available literature. The keywords "prevention" or "prophylaxis", and "depression", and "interferon", and "antidepressant" or "antidepressive agents" were used.
   Results: The six eligible studies comprise three randomized controlled trials, two in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients and one in individuals with melanoma, and three open-label studies with HCV patients. The results of the randomized controlled trials suggest that antidepressant prophylaxis may blunt the magnitude of depressive symptoms in HCV patients and raise the rates of treatment completion. In melanoma patients, this preventive strategy may reduce the incidence of depression during IFN-alpha treatment. In addition, the open-label studies with HCV patients suggest that this strategy may reduce the onset of major depression in specific samples (current psychiatric diagnosis, major depression in remission, past history of IFN-alpha-induced depression) on IFN-alpha (re-)treatment.
   Conclusions: In the face of so few trials about the usefulness of prophylaxis with antidepressants before IFN-alpha treatment, there is not enough information to sufficiently and widely support this strategy to prevent depression. However, this approach may, nonetheless, bring some beneficial outcomes, if applied to specific patient groups. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Yawning is a phylogenetically old behaviour that can be observed in most vertebrate species from foetal stages to old age. The origin and function of this conspicuous phenomenon have been subject to speculations for centuries. Here, we review the experimental evidence for each of these hypotheses. It is found that theories ascribing a physiological role to yawning (such as the respiratory, arousal, or thermoregulation hypotheses) lack evidence. Conversely, the notion that yawning has a communicative function involved in the transmission of drowsiness, boredom, or mild psychological stress receives increasing support from research in different fields. In humans and some other mammals, yawning is part of the action repertoire of advanced empathic and social skills. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conceptual and empirical approaches to the study of the role of asymmetric frontal cortical activity in emotional processes are reviewed. Although early research suggested that greater left than right frontal cortical activity was associated with positive affect, more recent research, primarily on anger, suggests that greater left than right frontal cortical activity is associated with approach motivation, which can be positive (e.g., enthusiasm) or negative in valence (e.g., anger). In addition to reviewing this research on anger, research on guilt, bipolar disorder, and various types of positive affect is reviewed with relation to their association with asymmetric frontal cortical activity. The reviewed research not only contributes to a more complete understanding of the emotive functions of asymmetric frontal cortical activity, but it also points to the importance of considering motivational direction as separate from affective valence in psychological models of emotional space.

AB  - Alterations in exploratory behavior are a fundamental feature of bipolar mania, typically characterized as motor hyperactivity and increased goal-directed behavior in response to environmental cues. In contrast, abnormal exploration associated with schizophrenia and depression can manifest as prominent withdrawal, limited motor activity, and inattention to the environment. While motor abnormalities are cited frequently as clinical manifestations of these disorders, relatively few empirical studies have quantified human exploratory behavior. This article reviews the literature characterizing motor and exploratory behavior associated with bipolar disorder and genetic and pharmacological animal models of the illness. Despite sophisticated assessment of exploratory behavior in rodents, objective quantification of human motor activity has been limited primarily to actigraphy studies with poor cross-species translational value. Furthermore, symptoms that reflect the cardinal features of bipolar disorder have proven difficult to establish in putative animal models of this illness. Recently, however, novel tools such as the human behavioral pattern monitor provide multivariate translational measures of motor and exploratory activity, enabling improved understanding of the neurobiology underlying psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Objective: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the only established therapy for the large percentage of patients with depression who fail to respond to standard treatments. It is commonly used but has substantial problems including the occurrence of cognitive side effects that are often highly distressing for patients. One highly promising potential alternative is magnetic seizure therapy (MST). This review provides an overview of the cognitive side effects of ECT and the attempts to overcome these, the history and development of MST is then reviewed, and finally a case study of the first patient treated in Australia with MST is presented.
   Methods: OVID and MEDLINE databases were used to search for the relevant literature. Reviews, meta-analyses and what were considered seminal articles were selected from the ECT literature to provide an overview of this large body of research. All of the known MST published work to date was included in this review.
   Results: The first patient treated in Australia underwent MST for treatment-resistant depression in October 2009. Extensive pre- and post-psychopathology and neurocognitive assessments were conducted. The patient no longer met criteria for a major depressive episode following eight MST treatments and has remained in remission at evaluations to date. She did not experience any disorientation following treatments and her neurocognitive assessments revealed no apparent MST-related cognitive side effects.
   Conclusions: Research to date and our current findings provide considerable impetus to continue to vigorously investigate the use of MST in treatment resistant depression.

AB  - The goal of my research is to gain insight using rodent models into the fundamental molecular, cellular and systems that make up the base of memory formation. My work focuses on fear memories. Aberrant fear and/or anxiety may be at the heart of many psychiatric disorders. In this article, I review the results of my research group; these results show that particular neurons in the lateral amygdala, a brain region important for fear, are specifically involved in particular fear memories. We started by showing that the transcription factor CREB (cAMP/Ca(2+) response element binding protein) plays a key role in the formation of fear memories. Next, we used viral vectors to overexpress CREB in a subset of lateral amygdala neurons. This not only facilitated fear memory formation but also "drove" the memory into the neurons with relatively increased CREB function. Finally we showed that selective ablation of the neurons overexpressing CREB in the lateral amygdala selectively erased the fear memory. These findings are the first to show disruption of a specific memory by disrupting select neurons within a distributed network.

AB  - Active transport along the axon is crucial to the neuron. Motor-driven transport supplies the distal synapse with newly synthesized proteins and lipids, and clears damaged or misfolded proteins. Microtubule motors also drive long-distance signaling along the axon via signaling endosomes. Although positive signaling initiated by neurotrophic factors has been well-studied, recent research has focused on stress-signaling along the axon. Here, the connections between axonal transport alterations and neurodegeneration are discussed, including evidence for defective transport of vesicles, mitochondria, degradative organelles, and signaling endosomes in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Defects in transport are sufficient to induce neurodegeneration, but recent progress suggests that changes in retrograde signaling pathways correlate with rapidly progressive neuronal cell death.

AB  - Research on the impact of nocturnal road traffic noise on sleep and the consequences on daytime functioning demonstrates detrimental effects that cannot be ignored. The physiological reactions due to continuing noise processing during night time lead to primary sleep disturbances, which in turn impair daytime functioning. This review focuses on noise processing in general and in relation to sleep, as well as methodological aspects in the study of noise and sleep. More specifically, the choice of a research setting and noise assessment procedure is discussed and the concept of sleep quality is elaborated. In assessing sleep disturbances, we differentiate between objectively measured and subjectively reported complaints, which demonstrates the need for further understanding of the impact of noise on several sleep variables. Hereby, mediating factors such as noise sensitivity appear to play an important role. Research on long term effects of noise intrusion on sleep up till now has mainly focused on cardiovascular outcomes. The domain might benefit from additional longitudinal studies on deleterious effects of noise on mental health and general well-being. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Patients with schizophrenia suffer from impairments in facial affect recognition and social functioning. Since antipsychotic medication affects different areas in the brain, they may also affect target areas involved in emotional processing mechanisms. In this article, we review the findings of the effect of antipsychotic medication on facial affect recognition in schizophrenia. We searched PubMed for articles in English with the keywords schizophrenia, facial, affect, emotion, antipsychotic and medication, published till January 2008. Eight relevant articles were found describing original studies. No substantial improvements in facial affect recognition were found after treatment with either typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs. Facial affect recognition was not related to neuropsychological functioning, and it was unclear whether improvement of symptom severity was related to performance on the facial affect recognition tasks. It is recommended that future research should focus on measuring social skills and social functioning more directly, and by investigating the effects of additional behavioural treatments on facial affect recognition and social functioning relative to treatment with antipsychotic medication alone.

AB  - Background: While the effects of daily fine particulate exposure (PM) have been well reviewed, the epidemiological and physiological evidence of cardiovascular effects associated to sub-daily exposures has not. We performed a theoretical model-driven systematic non-meta-analytical literature review to document the association between PM sub-daily exposures (<= 6 hours) and arrhythmia, ischemia and myocardial infarction (MI) as well as the likely mechanisms by which sub-daily PM exposures might induce these acute cardiovascular effects. This review was motivated by the assessment of the risk of exposure to elevated sub-daily levels of PM during fireworks displays.
   Methods: Medline and Elsevier's EMBase were consulted for the years 1996-2008. Search keywords covered potential cardiovascular effects, the pollutant of interest and the short duration of the exposure. Only epidemiological and experimental studies of adult humans (age > 18 yrs) published in English were reviewed. Information on design, population and PM exposure characteristics, and presence of an association with selected cardiovascular effects or physiological assessments was extracted from retrieved articles.
   Results: Of 231 articles identified, 49 were reviewed. Of these, 17 addressed the relationship between sub-daily exposures to PM and cardiovascular effects: five assessed ST-segment depression indicating ischemia, eight assessed arrhythmia or fibrillation and five considered MI. Epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to sub-daily levels of PM is associated with MI and ischemic events in the elderly. Epidemiological studies of sub-daily exposures suggest a plausible biological mechanism involving the autonomic nervous system while experimental studies suggest that vasomotor dysfunction may also relate to the occurrence of MI and ischemic events.
   Conclusions: Future studies should clarify associations between cardiovascular effects of sub-daily PM exposure with PM size fraction and concurrent gaseous pollutant exposures. Experimental studies appear more promising for elucidating the physiological mechanisms, time courses and causes than epidemiological studies which employ central pollution monitors for measuring effects and for assessing their time course. Although further studies are needed to strengthen the evidence, given that exposure to sub-daily high levels of PM (for a few hours) is frequent and given the suggestive evidence that sub-daily PM exposures are associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular effects, we recommend that persons with cardiovascular diseases avoid such situations.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the degeneration of dopamine (DA) and non-DA neurons, the almost uniform presence of Lewy bodies, and motor deficits. Although the majority of PD is sporadic, specific genetic defects in rare familial cases have provided unique insights into the pathogenesis of PD. Through the creation of animal and cellular models of mutations in LRRK2 and a-synuclein, which are linked to autosomal-dominant PD, and mutations in parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1, which are responsible for autosomal-recessive PD, insight into the molecular mechanisms of this disorder are leading to new ideas about the pathogenesis of PD. In this review, we discuss the animal models for these genetic causes of PD, their limitations, and value. Moreover, we discuss future directions and potential strategies for optimization of the genetic models.

AB  - Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone with important roles in regulating pathogenic transformation. In addition to its well-characterized functions in malignancy, recent evidence from several laboratories suggests a role for Hsp90 in maintaining the functional stability of neuronal proteins of aberrant capacity, whether mutated or over-activated, allowing and sustaining the accumulation of toxic aggregates. In addition, Hsp90 regulates the activity of the transcription factor heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), the master regulator of the heat shock response, mechanism that cells use for protection when exposed to conditions of stress. These biological functions therefore propose Hsp90 inhibition as a dual therapeutic modality in neurodegenerative diseases. First, by suppressing aberrant neuronal activity, Hsp90 inhibitors may ameliorate protein aggregation and its associated toxicity. Second, by activation of HSF-1 and the subsequent induction of heat shock proteins, such as Hsp70, Hsp90 inhibitors may redirect neuronal aggregate formation, and protect against protein toxicity. This mini-review will summarize our current knowledge on Hsp90 in neurodegeneration and will focus on the potential beneficial application of Hsp90 inhibitors in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Coral reefs in shallow-water environments (< 30 m) are in decline due to local and global anthropogenic stresses. This has led to renewed interest in the 'deep reef refugia' hypothesis (DRRH), which stipulates that deep reef areas (1) are protected or dampened from disturbances that affect shallow reef areas and (2) can provide a viable reproductive source for shallow reef areas following disturbance. Using the Caribbean as an example, the assumptions of this hypothesis were explored by reviewing the literature for scleractinian corals-the reef framework builders on tropical reefs. Although there is evidence to support that deep reefs (> 30 m) can escape the direct effects of storm-induced waves and thermal bleaching events, deep reefs are certainly not immune to disturbance. Additionally, the potential of deep reefs to provide propagules for shallow reef areas seems limited to 'depth-generalist' coral species, which constitute only similar to 25% of the total coral biodiversity. Larval connectivity between shallow and deep populations of these species may be further limited due to specific life history traits (e.g., brooding reproductive strategy and vertical symbiont acquisition mode). This review exposes how little is known about deep reefs and coral reproduction over depth. Hence, a series of urgent research priorities are proposed to determine the extent to which deep reefs may act as a refuge in the face of global reef decline.

AB  - The use of neuromodulation as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) has recently attracted renewed interest due to development of other non-pharmacological therapies besides electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Method: We convened a working group of researchers to discuss the updates and key challenges of neuromodulation use for the treatment of MDD. Results: The state-of-art of neuromodulation techniques was reviewed and discussed in four sections: [1] epidemiology and pathophysiology of MDD; [2] a comprehensive overview of the neuromodulation techniques; [3] using neuromodulation techniques in MDD associated with non-psychiatric conditions; [4] the main challenges of neuromodulation research and alternatives to overcome them. Discussion: ECT is the first-line treatment for severe depression. TMS and tDCS are strategies with a relative benign profile of side effects; however, while TMS effects are comparable to antidepressant drugs for treating MDD; further research is needed to establish the role of tDCS. DBS and VNS are invasive strategies with a possible role in treatment-resistant depression. In summary, MDD is a chronic and incapacitating condition with a high prevalence; therefore clinicians should consider all the treatment options including invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation approaches.

Methods Literature searches yielded 31 studies comparing individuals with and without a history of CSA on six health outcomes: general health, gastrointestinal (GI) health, gynecologic or reproductive health, pain, cardiopulmonary symptoms, and obesity. Exploratory subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential methodological moderators. Results Results suggested that a history of CSA was associated with small to moderate group differences on almost all health outcomes assessed, such that individuals with a history of CSA reported more complaints for each health outcome. Suggestive trends in moderating variables of study design and methodology are presented. Conclusions Results highlight the long-term physical health consequences of CSA and identify potential moderators to aid in the design of future research.

AB  - Objective: We will review the available evidence on the frequency, clinical correlates, mechanism, and treatment of apathy following stroke.
   Methods: We have explored relevant databases (that is, PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) using the following key words and their combinations: apathy, motivation, abulia, stroke, cerebrovascular disease, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, anterior cerebral infarction, and thalamus.
   Results: The frequency of apathy following stroke has been consistently estimated between 20% and 25%. It appears to be associated with the presence of cognitive impairment, a chronic course characterized by progressive functional decline, and with disruption of neural networks connecting the anterior cingulate gyrus, the dorsomedial frontal cortex, and the frontal pole with the ventral aspects of the caudate nucleus, the anterior and ventral globus pallidus, and the dorsomedian and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Published treatment studies have been mostly limited to anecdotal case reports, generally using dopamine agonists or stimulant medications. Cholinesterase inhibitors and nefiracetam may significantly reduce apathetic symptoms. However, their efficacy was examined in relatively small clinical trials that require replication.
   Conclusion: Apathy is a frequent neuropsychiatric complication of stroke that, although often associated with depression and cognitive impairment, may occur independently of both. Its presence has been consistently associated with greater functional decline. However, there is no conclusive evidence about which is the best treatment for this condition.

AB  - This paper presents a general review of the distribution of mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) in relationship to geomorphology in US waters. It was specifically concerned with the depth range of 30-100 m, where more than 186,000 km(2) of potential seafloor area was identified within the US Gulf of Mexico/Florida, Caribbean, and main Hawaiian Islands. The geomorphology of MCEs was largely inherited from a variety of pre-existing structures of highly diverse origins, which, in combination with environmental stress and physical controls, restrict the distribution of MCEs. Sea-level history, along with depositional and erosional processes, played an integral role in formation of MCE settings. However, mapping the distribution of both potential MCE topography/substrate and existing MCE habitat is only beginning. Mapping techniques pertinent to understanding morphology and MCE distributions are discussed throughout this paper. Future investigations need to consider more cost-effective and remote methods (such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and acoustics) in order to assess the distribution and extent of MCE habitat. Some understanding of the history of known MCEs through coring studies would help understand their initiation and response to environmental change over time, essential for assessing how they may be impacted by future environmental change.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established medical therapy for the treatment of movement disorders and shows great promise for several other neurological disorders. However, after decades of clinical utility the underlying therapeutic mechanisms remain undefined. Early attempts to explain the mechanisms of DBS focused on hypotheses that mimicked an ablative lesion to the stimulated brain region. More recent scientific efforts have explored the wide-spread changes in neural activity generated throughout the stimulated brain network. In turn, new theories on the mechanisms of DBS have taken a systems-level approach to begin to decipher the network activity. This review provides an introduction to some of the network based theories on the function and pathophysiology of the cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops commonly targeted by DBS. We then analyze some recent results on the effects of DBS on these networks, with a focus on subthalamic DBS for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Finally we attempt to summarize how DBS could be achieving its therapeutic effects by overriding pathological network activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This article aims to give a literature review related to the development and mental health of foster children with special consideration of trauma history. Methods A computer-based literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, PSYNDEXplus, and SCOPUS. We determined a time frame from 1998 to 2009. Results The literature search resulted in 32 articles reporting empirical data about development and mental health in foster children. Very high rates of exposure to maltreatment, developmental delays and mental disorders were found. A broad spectrum of externalizing as well as internalizing symptoms and a high prevalence of comorbid mental disorders were found. Conclusions Foster children exhibit a broad pattern of developmental problems and psychopathology. The etiology of these disorders is discussed in the context of multiple risk factors, especially that of persistent maltreatment.

AB  - Introduction
   Studies investigating the efficacy of interventions for improving treatment non-adherence in schizophrenia have generated contrasting findings. The present review examined psychosocial interventions for improving medication adherence and prevention of relapse among patients with schizophrenia in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific.
   Methods
   The relevant literature and systematic review were identified by computerized searches using keywords, and hand-searched for other selected articles.
   Results
   The reasons for poor medication adherence were complex and heterogenous. Psychoeducation programs alone are ineffective in achieving good medication adherence because they do not lead to attitudinal and behavioral changes. The greatest improvement in adherence was seen with interventions employing a combination of educational, behavioral and cognitive strategies. Unfortunately, few relevant studies from this region were found. There were some interventions related to psychoeducation and compliance therapy (CT) that were successfully conducted by nurses. Patients in developing countries generally had better family support, but strong stigma towards mental illness and interference by traditional healers led to poor treatment adherence. Lack of facilities and shortage of medical professionals aggravated the situation.
   Discussion
   Intervention to improve treatment adherence and prevention of relapse among patients with schizophrenia should be incorporated into existing psychiatric services. Adherence to treatment in patients with schizophrenia could be improved if continuously supported and monitored by caregivers and treating doctors, to facilitate a change in the patient's attitude. Paramedical personnel, such as psychiatric nurses, could be actively involved in intervention programs because of the shortage of medical professionals in this region.

AB  - Hydrogen (delta H-2), carbon (delta C-13), oxygen (delta O-18) and nitrogen (delta N-18) isotopes of tree rings growing in field conditions can be indicative of past pollution effects. The characteristic delta C-13 trend is a positive shift generally explained by invoking closure of stomata, but experimental studies suggest that increased rates of carboxylation could also generate such trends. In many cases the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values decrease in trees exposed to pollution and exhibit inverse coinciding long-term trends with delta C-13 values. However, some trees exposed to diffuse pollution and experimental conditions can show an increase or no delta O-18 change even if delta C-13 values increase. These diverse responses depend on how stress conditions modify physiological functions such as stomatal conductance, carboxylation, respiration, and perhaps water assimilation by the root system. Recent studies suggest that delta N-18 changes in trees can be caused by soil acidification and accumulation of anthropogenic emissions with isotopic signals deviating from natural N.

An electronic search using PubMed for articles in English focusing on psychosis and aggression or agitation in adults aged 65+ with dementia. Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and randomized controlled treatment studies examining the outcomes of aggression and psychosis were eligible for inclusion. Eighteen articles were selected for final analysis. Of the seven cross-sectional and two longitudinal studies directly examining the correlation of aggression and psychosis, most showed a positive association. Outcome data from the nine treatment studies was more mixed. Limited data link psychosis with aggression in persons with dementia. Prospectively designed studies looking at the temporal relationship of these variables are needed to make a stronger causal argument.

AB  - Objective. To review the current literature that describes the effect of Antarctic residence on energy dynamics and aerobic fitness.
   Study design. Literature review.
   Methods. Published literature on energy dynamics and aerobic fitness in the polar environment was reviewed. Energy dynamics were represented by body weight, body fat, food intake and energy expenditure. Consideration was given to seasonal variation and possible explanations for the apparent high metabolic cost of Antarctic residence. The influence of cold exposure was discussed and comment was made on the differences between temperate and polar residence.
   Results. Food intake and energy expenditure are found to increase with Antarctic residence. There is often an associated increase in body weight and body fat. Seasonal variation is common but not universal, with an increase in body weight and body fat in winter. Variation in aerobic fitness appears to be related to the specific study sample rather than Antarctic residence per se.
   Conclusions. In most instances, Antarctic residence has effects on energy dynamics and aerobic fitness. Explanations for the observed changes may include physiological adaptations, such as a raised basal metabolic rate and increased thermogenesis. However, cold-induced changes are less likely when cold exposure is minimized by heated buildings and insulated clothing. Activity patterns related to work and leisure thus represent a more likely cause. The majority of the research is several decades old; further research would help to elucidate the patterns of energy dynamics of modern Antarctic workers.

AB  - Objective: To review the frequency, clinical correlates, and mechanism of anosognosia after stroke.
   Methods: We searched the most recent relevant literature on anosognosia after stroke and carried out a critical analysis of the main findings.
   Results: Anosognosia is present in about 10% of acute stroke patients and its diagnosis is relatively simple. Nevertheless, a valid and reliable standardization of diagnostic instruments and criteria for research purposes is more difficult to achieve. This limitation may partially account for various instruments available to assess anosognosia and the different strategies used to diagnose this phenomenon. Anosognosia is a fleeting phenomenon and chronic cases are infrequent. There is a robust association between anosognosia and right-hemisphere lesions involving cortical (insular, temporal, and parietal lobes) and subcortical structures (thalamus and basal ganglia). The main clinical correlates of anosognosia are the presence of neglect, cognitive deficits, previous strokes, and older age. Anosognosia has a negative impact on the rehabilitation of stroke patients. The mechanism of anosognosia remains unknown but was explained as owing to psychological denial, disconnexion between left and right hemispheres, and dysfunction of a system that monitors the intention to move and actual movements.
   Conclusion: Anosognosia is a relatively frequent complication of acute stroke and may become an excellent model to understand the mechanism of human awareness.

AB  - We incorporate the dual-mode concept in our dual-aspect PE-SE (proto-experience-subjective experience) framework. The two modes are: (1) the non-tilde mode that is the physical (material) and mental aspect of cognition (memory and attention) related feedback signals in a neural-network, which refers to the cognitive nearest past approaching towards present; and (2) the tilde mode that is the material and mental aspect of the feed-forward signals due to external environmental input and internal endogenous input, which pertains to the nearest future approaching towards present and is a entropy-reversed representation of non-tilde mode. Furthermore, one could argue that there are at least five sub-pathways in the stimulus-dependent feed-forward pathway and cognitive feedback pathway for information transfer in the brain dynamics: (i) classical axonal-dendritic neural sub-pathway including electromagnetic information field sub-pathway; (ii) quantum dendritic-dendritic microtubule (MT) (dendritic webs) sub-pathway; (iii) Ca++-related astroglial-neural sub-pathway; (iv) (a) the sub-pathway related to extrasynaptic signal transmission between fine distal dendrites of cortical neurons for the local subtle modulation due to voltages created by intradendritic dual-aspect charged surface effects within the Debye layer around endogenous structures such as microtubules (MT) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in dendrites, and (b) the sub-pathway related to extracellular volume transmission as fields of neural activity for the global modulation in axonal-dendritic neural sub-pathway; and (v) the sub-pathway related to information transmission via soliton propagation. We propose that: (i) the quantum conjugate matching between experiences in the mental aspect of the tilde mode and that of the non-tilde mode is related more to the mental aspect of the quantum microtubule-dendritic-web and less to that of the non-quantum sub-pathways; and (ii) the classical matching between experiences in the mental aspect of the tilde mode and that of the non-tilde mode is related to the mental aspect of the non-quantum sub-pathways (such as classical axonal-dendritic neural sub-pathway). In both cases, a specific SE is selected when the tilde mode interacts with the non-tilde mode to match for a specific SE, and when the necessary ingredients of SEs (such as the formation of neural networks, wakefulness, re-entry, attention, working memory, and so on) are satisfied. When the conjugate match is made between the two modes, the world-presence (Now) is disclosed. The material aspects in the tilde mode and that in the non-tilde mode are matched to link structure with function, whereas the mental aspects in the tilde mode and that in the non-tilde mode are matched to link experience with structure and function.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven a powerful treatment for medication refractory movement disorders. Success in this group of patients has allowed preliminary studies of DBS to proceed in severe and medication resistant cases of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and burette's syndrome (TS). Pathophysiological and imaging studies along with attempts at lesioning the basal ganglia, have offered clues as to nodes in the circuitry that may be amenable to neuromodulation. DBS in neuropsychiatric illness has offered hope, but at this time rigorous screening by interdisciplinary and ethical teams should be employed when establishing treatment candidacy. A cautious approach to these disorders utilizing institutional review board approved research protocols will hopefully shed light onto patient selection and brain target(s) for each disorder. We need to keep an open mind as we move forward and especially that rational therapy may need to be patient and symptom specific. This review will summarize each disorder (depression, OCD and TS), review pathophysiology (both known and speculated), and update the current observations on DBS in each neuropsychiatric condition.

AB  - In light of both the FDA's clearance of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for adult major depressive disorder and concerns about safety and efficacy of existing antidepressant therapies for adolescent depression, there is increasing interest in rTMS as a novel treatment for adolescent depression. We reviewed English-language studies using rTMS in persons under the age of 18, yielding 6 published reports. Because rTMS is typically delivered at or above 1 Hz for psychiatric indications, our search was confined to these frequencies. Also included are studies involving rTMS above 1 Hz for non-psychiatric indications. Articles were retrieved from the MEDLINE database. There were 19 reported subjects under age 18 who have been administered rTMS at a frequency above 1 Hz: 10 for major depression, 5 for spastic cerebral palsy and 4 for epilepsia partialis continua. We found that most subjects responded favorably to rTMS and no adverse events have been reported. However data are insufficient for drawing firm conclusions about safety and efficacy. Further studies of rTMS as a treatment for adolescent depression are warranted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The basal ganglia (BG) are composed of several nuclei involved in neural processing related to the execution of motor, cognitive and emotional activities. Preclinical and clinical data have implicated a role for these structures in pain processing. Recently neuroimaging has added important information on BG activation in conditions of acute pain, chronic pain and as a result of drug effects. Our current understanding of alterations in cortical and sub-cortical regions in pain suggests that the BG are uniquely involved in thalamo-cortico-BG loops to integrate many aspects of pain. These include the integration of motor, emotional, autonomic and cognitive responses to pain.

   Method: An electronic literature search was complemented by review articles and cross-references. Studies reporting standard diagnosis and incidence or prevalence rates were included.
   Results: Immigrants had an increased risk for schizophrenia in countries of longstanding immigration, but with lower risk ratios than in those of recent immigration. The risk was higher in black immigrants and the black population living in the United States. But incidence and prevalence rates in Africa and the Caribbean were similar to those of international studies.
   Conclusion: Comparing the most recent generation of immigrants with descendants of previous ones may account for the lower risk ratios observed in countries of longstanding vs. recent immigration. Two neurobiological hypotheses are proposed to explain the epidemiological findings in black populations and in immigrants.

KW  - Behaviour
KW  - HPA axis
AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the main neuroendocrine system of response to stress, and an imbalance of this system's activity is believed to be at the core of numerous psychiatric pathologies. During the neonatal period, the glucocorticoid response to stress is maintained at low levels by specific maternal behaviours, which is essential for proper brain development. Effective evaluation of the impact of increased secretion of corticosterone during an essentially anabolic developmental period on adulthood behaviour involved separation of the neonate from its mother for periods ranging from 3 to 24 h. It has been shown that disinhibition of the stress response is achieved by such procedures. The pioneering studies by Seymour Levine set the stage for a prolific and promising field of study that may help neuroscientists unveil the neurobiological underpinnings of stress-related disorders. Based on a series of studies, we propose that maternal separation and maternal deprivation change stress-related behaviours, but that corticosterone seem to be only partially involved in these changes in adulthood. It appears that extra-hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing factor and neurotransmitter systems may be the primary mediators of these behavioural outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with hippocampal volume deficits, but the effects of alcohol use on hippocampal volume in PTSD are unclear. We meta-analytically examined the relationship between alcohol use, PTSD, and hippocampal volume deficits. Studies were initially searched through electronic databases. Twelve studies reporting data for the right hippocampal volume and 11 studies with data for the left hippocampal volume met initial inclusion criteria. In the meta-analysis of the studies in which subjects had no lifetime history of alcoholism, both the left and right hippocampal volumes were smaller in PTSD subjects compared to controls. Meta-regression using a continuous trial-level covariate showed that a lifetime history of alcoholism further moderates left and right hippocampal volume in PTSD. PTSD is associated with hippocampal volume deficits independent of a lifetime history of alcoholism, but alcoholism further contributes to the hippocampal volume deficits associated with PTSD.

   Method: A computerized search in PubMed, looking for published articles since 1980.
   Results: During the last years, the PBD diagnosis has proliferated largely, with some studies reporting incidences between 1% and 5%. In the past, some researchers reported that atypical symptoms could be more common than the classical symptoms in the PBD. However, current studies confirm the presence of typical mania symptoms in the youngest. Also, they confirm the utility of the diagnostic criteria DSM-IV in this population, with the PBD-NOS as the most prevalent phenotype. Those cases with irritability and without any other maniac symptom are still not clear, but the evidence shows a possible evolution towards others non-bipolar affective disorders. The PBD has high comorbidity, especially with ADHD and Disruptive Behavior Disorders. In the longitudinal evaluation, the PBD cases show high rates of relapse and persistent subsyndromical symptoms. The diagnosis is based in the clinical presentation, with collateral information provided by the family. Screening scales and standardized interview has been developed.
   Conclusions: Now days is possible the diagnosis of PBD, although there is not enough information about the categorization and the longitudinal course of the PBD. Future studies are needed in order to clarify these shadows.

AB  - It is argued that conscious emotional feelings can not be adequately explained by just particular circuits or coherent activations within the brain, as is conventionally believed; nor by activations representing environmental stimuli going to the brain. According to the model suggested herein, the limbic system responds to sensory and other inputs according to how closely they are associated with built-in rewards or punishments. It does this by (a) activating the autonomic nervous system so that it prepares the body to acquire a reward or avoid a punishment, and (b) also activating the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC activations are temporally correlated with the autonomic activations and the feedback to them, so that they become identified with the autonomic attempts to acquire (a reward) or avoid (a punishment). The PFC circuit thus acquires a valence. The valence, along with arousal in a given context, underlies conscious emotional feelings. The model is related to: (a) how attention progresses along networks within working memory; (b) how a single, unified percept is formed; (c) how both value-based and cognitive-based responses are formulated; and (d) how the stream of consciousness is put together and driven forward. These concepts are integrated into a scenario of the orchestration of conscious experience and behaviour by subcortical-limbic system structures interacting with the cortex, and are shown to be consistent with much of the literature.

AB  - We describe the free Dirac field in a four-dimensional spacetime as a locally covariant quantum field theory in the sense of Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch, using a representation independent construction. The freedom in the geometric constructions involved can be encoded in terms of the cohomology of the category of spin spacetimes. If we restrict ourselves to the observable algebra, the cohomological obstructions vanish and the theory is unique. We establish some basic properties of the theory and discuss the class of Hadamard states, filling some technical gaps in the literature. Finally, we show that the relative Cauchy evolution yields commutators with the stress-energy-momentum tensor, as in the scalar field case.

AB  - Early life stress is one of the most explicit and undisputed environmental risk factors for disease later in life, including metabolic and psychiatric diseases. The developmental timing and context of stressful stimuli is thereby essential and determines the adaptive or maladaptive consequences. This review, which honors the invaluable accomplishments of one of the pioneers in the field, the late Seymour "Gig" Levine, focuses on the contribution of mouse models to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the acute and persistent effects of early life stress. The importance of the postnatal period and the complex role of maternal care in regulating the offspring's stress system activity are specifically addressed. Further, I discuss the possible molecular mechanisms that may be responsible for the persistent effects of early life stress, including the important issue of resilience and susceptibility to adverse life events.

AB  - Studies of discourse processing focus on the ways in which readers and listeners comprehend language. The linguistic segments of interest to the field tend to be larger than sound, word, or sentence-level units; they include the books and conversational communications that comprise our everyday cognitive and social interactions. The current review focuses on discourse comprehension (specifically text processing), highlighting three core issues of primary interest to the research field. First, we outline the particular elements that make up naturalistic discourse activity. Second, we identify potential interactions among the elements, and how investigations of these interactions have resulted in influential frameworks for the field. Finally, we examine contemporary work (both theoretical and applied) that might further enhance current accounts of discourse processing. As appropriate, the review includes references to relevant empirical research outlining the processes that guide, and are guided by, our discourse experiences. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Increasing research is highlighting the fact that streams provide crucial ecosystem services through the biogeochemical and ecological processes they sustain. Freshwater land-based salmonid farms commonly discharge their effluents into low order, headwater streams, partly due to the fact that adequate freshwater resources for production are commonly found in undisturbed areas. We review the effects of salmonid farm effluents on different biological components of stream ecosystems. Relevant considerations related to the temporal and spatial scales of effluent discharge and ecological effects are discussed. These highlight the need to characterize the patterns of stressor discharge when assessing environmental impacts and designing ecological effects studies. The potential role of multiple stressors in disrupting ecosystem structure and function is discussed with an emphasis on aquaculture veterinary medicines. Further research on the effects of veterinary medicines using relevant exposure scenarios would significantly contribute to our understanding of their impact in relation to other effluent stressors.

Systematic literature searches were performed on CINAHL, MediText, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. It has found that the majority of migrants enjoy better health than the Australian-born population in the conditions that are part of the NHPAs, with the exception of diabetes. Mediterranean migrants have particularly favourable health outcomes. The migrant health advantage appears to deteriorate with increasing duration of residence. Many of the analyzed studies were conducted more than 10 year ago or had a narrow focus. Little is known about the health status of migrants with respect to a number of NHPAs, including musculoskeletal conditions and asthma. The health status of recently arrived migrant groups from the Middle East and Africa has not been explored in detail.

   Method: We conducted PubMed and PsycINFO searches of recently published articles that reported on the treatment outcomes of psychotherapies for PDs. Our focus was on studies that used randomized controlled trial (ROT) methodology. The search period was from January 2006 to June 2009.
   Results: The effectiveness of various psychotherapy treatment packages for PDs is well supported by favourable results from RCTs. Beneficial effects of psychotherapy included reduced symptomatology, improved social and interpersonal functioning, reduced frequency of maladaptive behaviours, and decreased hospitalization. Equivalent effects among the interventions we compared were common. Many of the treatments studied required only limited training by therapists. Most studies were focused on treating patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Some findings were suggestive of psychotherapy being cost-effective; however, few studies actually included formal cost analyses. Only one study included follow-up of treated patients beyond 1-year posttreatment.
   Conclusions: There is strong support for the use of psychotherapy to treat patients with PDs. However, most of the evidence is limited to BPD. The findings of recent studies hold promise for training and practice. Future research should attend to identification of appropriate patient treatment matches, elucidation of active treatment ingredients, and illumination of factors that are common among treatments that account for their equivalent effects.

A database search using keywords located recent clinical and population studies addressing the association between depression and type 2 diabetes. Both cross-sectional and cohort studies were reviewed. Depression appears to exacerbate the progression of type 2 diabetes. The evidence is strong supporting the hypothesis that depression in persons with diabetes increases the risk of diabetes-related burden, including suboptimal glycemic control, complications, functionality, mortality, and health care utilization. Screening for depression among patients with diabetes should be increased in primary care. Newer approaches to diabetes care management may help to slow the progression of diabetes.

Results Sixteen studies were identified (N = 3,700 adolescents). Half of the projects utilized rigorous methodologies to determine intervention effect on behavior change, such as conducting a randomized controlled trial (n = 8). Nine studies reported behaviors at least 3 months post-intervention and five out of nine showed decreases in sexual risk behavior. Conclusions Several HIV prevention programs with juvenile offenders have led to sexual risk reduction, although effect sizes are modest. Most existing programs have neglected to address the impact of family, mental health, and substance use on HIV risk. More work is needed to develop evidence-based interventions that include HIV prevention strategies relevant and appropriate for the juvenile justice setting.

   Switching antidepressants is a common strategy for managing treatment-resistant depressed patients. However, no systematic reviews have been conducted to date.
   Method:
   We systematically searched MEDLINE/EMBASE/Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and additional sources. We included double-blind studies of patients with depressive symptomatology who were not responding to initial antidepressant monotherapy and were subsequently randomized to another antidepressant or to continue the same antidepressant. Results were pooled for meta-analysis of response + remission rates using a fixed-effects model.
   Results:
   A total of three studies were included. Switching to another antidepressant was not superior to continuing the initial antidepressant in any of these studies. Our meta-analysis showed no significant advantages to either strategy and no significant heterogeneity of results [OR for response rates: 0.85 (95% CI: 0.55-1.30) favoring continuing].
   Conclusion:
   There is a discrepancy between the published evidence and the frequent decision to switch antidepressants, indicating an urgent need for more controlled studies. Pending such studies we recommend that physicians rely on more thoroughly evaluated strategies.

AB  - Panic disorder (PD) is a multidimensional anxiety disorder that involves the activation of a complex brain fear-network. The goals of this systematic review are to pinpoint some working functions of the most important neuroanatomical structures of fear and panic neurocircuitry and to raise hypotheses about how cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) may work on modulating the neurocircuitry of fear. The bibliographical search was carried out using mainly the PubMed database. Fifty-six articles were selected. A number of studies regarding several brain sites that participate in fear and anxiety circuitry were found and each region was described with its functionalities within the circuitry. Among the structures chosen were: the amygdala, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, which play a special role. Study hypotheses showed that CBT may operate upstream from the amygdala and exert inhibitory effects on a variety of learned responses. It may work by strengthening the medial prefrontal cortex ability to inhibit firing of amygdala neurons, under the modulation of the hippocampus. Only two studies examined the modulation of fear neurocircuitry with CBT in PD. The results indicate that CBT has the potential to modify the dysfunctional neural circuitry associated with PD, but there is insufficient evidence to support the preliminary hypothesis.

AB  - Background. The pathogenesis of bipolar illness is unknown. A search for common mechanism of action in effective medications has been utilized as a method to gain clues into mechanisms of illness. The recent increase of reports of documented efficacy of first-and second-generation antipsychotics in the control of mania offers a new opportunity to gain insight into the pathophysiological mechanism of bipolar disorder. Methods. A selected critical review of the literature is performed to gain insights into the effect of antipsychotic medications on ion regulation. Results. Dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptor stimulation increases intracellular sodium concentrations. D-1 and D-2 blockade normalizes stimulated intracellular sodium concentrations, and increases active sodium pump expression. Conclusions. A similar exercise has previously suggested that lithium and effective anticonvulsants reduce sodium influx in an activity-dependent manner. The current review suggests that antipsychotic medications may have a similar effect by a different mechanism. The role of ion dysregulation in the genesis of mania in bipolar illness needs to continue to be examined.

AB  - A key challenge for cognitive psychology is the investigation of mental representations, such as object categories, subjective probabilities, choice utilities, and memory traces. In many cases, these representations can be expressed as a non-negative function defined over a set of objects. We present a behavioral method for estimating these functions. Our approach uses people as components of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, a sophisticated sampling method originally developed in statistical physics. Experiments 1 and 2 verified the MCMC method by training participants on various category structures and then recovering those structures. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the MCMC method can be used estimate the structures of the real-world animal shape categories of giraffes, horses, dogs, and cats. Experiment 4 combined the MCMC method with multidimensional scaling to demonstrate how different accounts of the structure of categories, such as prototype and exemplar models, can be tested, producing samples from the categories of apples, oranges, and grapes.

AB  - This paper considers possible mechanisms for the Night Eating Syndrome (NES). NES is a disorder characterized by a delay in the circadian rhythm of meals and of several neuroendocrine factors. The disorder occurs in genetically vulnerable people when exposed to stress. No convincing mechanism of the NES has been reported until now. To search for the mechanisms of NES, the long term treatment of two highly perceptive patients with rapid onset of the disorder are described. Disruption of three neuroendocrine systems compatible with these histories are discussed: the glucocorticoid system, the melatonergic system, and the serotonergic system. Current evidence favors the serotonergic system and this view is strongly supported by the great effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of NES.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer's disease. The potential causes of PD remain uncertain, but recent studies suggest neuroinflammation and microglia activation play important roles in PD pathogenesis. Major unanswered questions include whether protein aggregates cause the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that underlies the clinical symptoms and whether neuroinflammation is a consequence or a cause of nigral cell loss. Within the microenvironment of the brain, glial cells play a critical role in homeostatic mechanisms that promote neuronal survival. Microglia have a specialized immune surveillance role and mediate innate immune responses to invading pathogens by secreting a myriad of factors that include, cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and growth factors. Some of these factors have neuroprotective and trophic activities and aid in brain repair processes; while others enhance oxidative stress and trigger apoptotic cascades in neurons. Therefore, pro- and anti-inflammatory responses must be in balance to prevent the potential detrimental effects of prolonged or unregulated inflammation-induced oxidative stress on vulnerable neuronal populations. In this review, we discuss potential triggers of neuroinflammation and review the strongest direct evidence that chronic neuroinflammation may have a more important role to play in PD versus other neurodegenerative diseases. Alternatively, we propose that genetic deficiency is not the only way to reduce protective factors in the brain which may function to keep microglial responses in check or regulate the sensitivity of DA neurons. If chronic inflammation can be shown to decrease the levels of neuroprotective factors in the midbrain, in essence genetic haploinsufficiency of protective factors such as Parkin or RGS10 may result from purely environmental triggers (aging, chronic systemic disease, etc.), increasing the vulnerability to inflammation-induced nigral DA neuron death and predisposing an individual to development of PD. Lastly, we review the latest epidemiological and experimental evidence supporting the potential use of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs as neuroprotective agents to delay the progressive nigrostriatal degeneration that leads to motor dysfunction in PD.

AB  - The field of neural repair in stroke has identified cellular systems of reorganization and possible molecular mechanisms. Conceptual barriers now limit the generation of clinically useful agents. First, it is not clear what the causal mechanisms of neural repair are in stroke. Second, adequate delivery systems for neural repair drugs need to be determined for candidate molecules. Third, ad hoc applications of existing pharmacological agents that enhance attention, mood or arousal to stroke have failed. New approaches that specifically harness the molecular systems of learning and memory provide a new avenue for stroke repair drugs. Fourth, combinatorial treatments for neural repair need to be considered for clinical therapies. Finally, neural repair therapies have as a goal altering brain connections, cognitive maps and active neural networks. These actions may trigger a unique set of "neural repair side effects" that need to be considered in planning clinical trials. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease.
   The purpose of the current review is to evaluate the evidence suggesting that PTSD increases cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and to identify possible biomarkers and psychosocial characteristics and behavioral variables that are associated with these outcomes.
   A systematic literature search in the period of 2002-2009 for PTSD, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disease was conducted.
   The literature search yielded 78 studies on PTSD and cardiovascular/metabolic disease and biomarkers.
   Although the available literature suggests an association of PTSD with cardiovascular disease and biomarkers, further research must consider potential confounds, incorporate longitudinal designs, and conduct careful PTSD assessments in diverse samples to address gaps in the research literature. Research on metabolic disease and biomarkers suggests an association with PTSD, but has not progressed as far as the cardiovascular research.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop recommendations for antenatal care and monitoring for women with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia who are on lithium carbonate, antipsychotic or anti-epileptic medication during pregnancy. A literature search and review of original research, published reviews and guidelines was undertaken for mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in pregnancy and for the management of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in pregnancy. This information was summarized, condensed and then reviewed by representatives of psychiatry, pharmacy, paediatrics and obstetrics to produce an information booklet and subsequently monitoring recommendations and tables. A model of antenatal monitoring and care for women with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and related disorders who are maintained on psychotropic medication was developed. This included an online and published booklet for clinicians summarizing psychotropic medication in pregnancy, and lactation and monitoring tables that could be part of patient case files. These were to assist in reminding and educating staff on the need for additional monitoring and assessment above standard antenatal care for women on mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medication. Women with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have an increased risk of complications in pregnancy from their illness and from the medications they are prescribed. A summary of the risks and a model of suggested additional monitoring during pregnancy have been developed in consultation across a number of clinical disciplines.

Challenges front outside include mounting patient and carer criticism, intrusion of other professions into psychiatry's traditional field of competence, and psychiatry's low status within medicine and in society in general Studies suggest that the decline of the recruitment into psychiatry, as it is observed tit many countries, might be related to problems arising from these challenges It is unclear whether psychiatry will survive as a unitary medical discipline or whether those segments which are more rewarding, both financially and in status, will break away, leaving the unattractive tasks to carry out by what remains of psychiatry The demise of the generalist and the rise of the specialist tit modern society may contribute to this development Attempts are underway by professional bodies to define the profile of a "general psychiatrist" Such discussions should be complemented by an analysis of the incentives which contribute to the centrifugal tendencies tit psychiatry

AB  - The study of socioeconomic status (SES) and the brain finds itself in a circumstance unusual for Cognitive Neuroscience: large numbers of questions with both practical and scientific importance exist, but they are currently under-researched and ripe for investigation. This review aims to highlight these questions, to outline their potential significance, and to suggest routes by which they might be approached. Although remarkably few neural studies have been carried out so far, there exists a large literature of previous behavioural work. This behavioural research provides an invaluable guide for future neuroimaging work, but also poses an important challenge for it: how can we ensure that the neural data contributes predictive or diagnostic power over and above what can be derived from behaviour alone? We discuss some of the open mechanistic questions which Cognitive Neuroscience may have the power to illuminate, spanning areas including language, numerical cognition, stress, memory, and social influences on learning. These questions have obvious practical and societal significance, but they also bear directly on a set of longstanding questions in basic science: what are the environmental and neural factors which affect the acquisition and retention of declarative and nondeclarative skills? Perhaps the best opportunity for practical and theoretical interests to converge is in the study of interventions. Many interventions aimed at improving the cognitive development of low SES children are currently underway, but almost all are operating without either input from, or study by, the Cognitive Neuroscience community. Given that longitudinal intervention studies are very hard to set up, but can, with proper designs, be ideal tests of causal mechanisms, this area promises exciting opportunities for future research.

AB  - While psychological research has long shown that adolescence is a period of major cognitive and affective transition, recent neurophysiological research has shown that adolescence is also accompanied by observable maturational changes in the brain, both in terms of structure and neurotransmitter function. Given this situation, we would expect that there should be observable and perhaps major changes in electrocortical activity and responses. In this review, we discuss developmental reductions in EEG power and alterations in the dominant band of EEG oscillation frequency, moderated by developmental factors such as growth-related changes in grey and white matter, and in the developmental history of cognitive and sociocultural stressors. Similarly, we summarize alterations in event-related potential components reflecting stimulus processing, response monitoring, and response anticipation. We review the literature on such changes in EEG and event-related potentials during the adolescent period and summarize some of the new developments in the field as well as interpretative difficulties.

AB  - To comprehend emotional prosodic cues in speech is a critical function of human social life. However, it is common in everyday communication that conflicting information in emotional prosody and semantic content co-occur. Here, we sought to specify brain regions involved in conflict monitoring of these interfering communication channels. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we obtained signal increases in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus when participants listened to incongruous compared with congruous sentences. Moreover, valence-specific effects were found in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left STG for happily intoned sentences expressing a negative content. The left caudate nucleus along with the thalamus was active when angrily intoned sentences were coupled with positive semantic content. Our results suggest a brain network that monitors conflict in emotional prosody and emotional semantic content comprising of medial prefrontal areas that have previously been associated with cognitive conflict processing. Furthermore, our study extends the knowledge of these processes by suggesting valence-specific differences of emotional conflict processing.

AB  - Gambling is a widespread form of entertainment that may afford unique insights into the interaction between cognition and emotion in human decision-making. It is also a behaviour that can become harmful, and potentially addictive, in a minority of individuals. This article considers the status of two dominant approaches to gambling behaviour. The cognitive approach has identified a number of erroneous beliefs held by gamblers, which cause them to over-estimate their chances of winning. The psychobiological approach has examined case-control differences between groups of pathological gamblers and healthy controls, and has identified dysregulation of brain areas linked to reward and emotion, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum, as well as alterations in dopamine neurotransmission. In integrating these two approaches, recent data are discussed that reveal anomalous recruitment of the brain reward system (including the vmPFC and ventral striatum) during two common cognitive distortions in gambling games: the near-miss effect and the effect of personal control. In games of chance, near-misses and the presence of control have no objective influence on the likelihood of winning. These manipulations appear to harness a reward system that evolved to learn skill-oriented behaviours, and by modulating activity in this system, these cognitive distortions may promote continued, and potentially excessive, gambling.

AB  - Conformational diseases, a general term comprising more than 40 disorders are caused by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins. Improper protein folding (misfolding) as well as accrual of unfolded proteins can lead to the formation of disordered (amorphous) or ordered (amyloid fibril) aggregates. The gradual accumulation of protein aggregates and the acceleration of their formation by stress explain the characteristic late or episodic onset of the diseases. The best studied in this group are neurodegenerative diseases and amyloidosis accompanied by the deposition of a specific aggregation-prone proteins or protein fragments and formation of insoluble fibrils. Amyloidogenic protein accumulation often occurs in the brain tissues, e.g. in Alzheimer's disease with the deposition of amyloid-beta and Tau, in scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy with the accumulation of prion protein, in Parkinson's disease with the deposition of a-synuclein. Other examples of amyloid proteins are transthyretin, immunoglobulin light chain, gelsolin, etc. In addition to the brain, the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins leading to pathology takes place in a wide variety of organs and tissues, including different parts of the eye. The best studied ocular conformational diseases are cataract in the lens and retinitis pigmentosa in the retina, but accumulation of misfolded proteins also occurs in other parts of the eye causing various disorders. Furthermore, ocular manifestation of systemic amyloidosis often causes the deposition of amyloidogenic proteins in different ocular tissues. Here we present the data regarding naturally unfolded and misfolded proteins in eye tissues, their structure-function relationships, and molecular mechanisms underlying their involvement in diseases. We also summarize the etiology of ocular conformational diseases and discuss approaches to their treatment. (C) Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Flowering plants display spectacular floral diversity and a bewildering array of reproductive adaptations that promote mating, particularly outbreeding. A striking feature of this diversity is that related species often differ in pollination and mating systems, and intraspecific variation in sexual traits is not unusual, especially among herbaceous plants. This variation provides opportunities for evolutionary biologists to link micro-evolutionary processes to the macro-evolutionary patterns that are evident within lineages. Here, I provide some personal reflections on recent progress in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of plant reproductive diversity. I begin with a brief historical sketch of the major developments in this field and then focus on three of the most significant evolutionary transitions in the reproductive biology of flowering plants: the pathway from outcrossing to predominant self-fertilization, the origin of separate sexes (females and males) from hermaphroditism and the shift from animal pollination to wind pollination. For each evolutionary transition, I consider what we have discovered and some of the problems that still remain unsolved. I conclude by discussing how new approaches might influence future research in plant reproductive biology.

AB  - Background: Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is well known internationally and widely used for scoring the severity of illness in psychiatry. Problems with GAF show a need for its further development (for example validity and reliability problems). The aim of the present study was to identify gaps in current knowledge about properties of GAF that are of interest for further development. Properties of GAF are defined as characteristic traits or attributes that serve to define GAF (or may have a role to define a future updated GAF).
   Methods: A thorough literature search was conducted.
   Results: A number of gaps in knowledge about the properties of GAF were identified: for example, the current GAF has a continuous scale, but is a continuous or categorical scale better? Scoring is not performed by setting a mark directly on a visual scale, but could this improve scoring? Would new anchor points, including key words and examples, improve GAF (anchor points for symptoms, functioning, positive mental health, prognosis, improvement of generic properties, exclusion criteria for scoring in 10-point intervals, and anchor points at the endpoints of the scale)? Is a change in the number of anchor points and their distribution over the total scale important? Could better instructions for scoring within 10-point intervals improve scoring? Internationally, both single and dual scales for GAF are used, but what is the advantage of having separate symptom and functioning scales? Symptom (GAF-S) and functioning (GAF-F) scales should score different dimensions and still be correlated, but what is the best combination of definitions for GAF-S and GAF-F? For GAF with more than two scales there is limited empirical testing, but what is gained or lost by using more than two scales?
   Conclusions: In the history of GAF, its basic properties have undergone limited changes. Problems with GAF may, in part, be due to lack of a research programme testing the effects of different changes in basic properties. Given the widespread use, research-based development of GAF has not been especially strong. Further research could improve GAF.

AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence is a major public health issue, particularly among women. Abused women experience many acute and chronic health consequences resulting in frequent healthcare visits. There exists a system-level opportunity to intervene, yet abused women refrain from spontaneous disclosure of their experiences of victimization due to embarrassment. Meanwhile providers often fail to ask due to lack of time, priority of acute medical problems and discomfort. Missed opportunities to detect intimate partner violence and control (IPVC) can be availed by computer-assisted interactive screening
   Aim: The purpose of this paper is to critically review current scientific knowledge on the use of enhanced Web 2.0 interactive computer-assisted screening for IPVC in clinical settings.
   Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed published literature was conducted using Medline and PsychInfo data bases from 1996 to 2010. Eligibility criteria were applied to the identified records. Additional studies were identified by searching reference list and contacting authors. Eight eligible studies were appraised for the study characteristics and IPVC related outcomes for the process-of-care, patient, and provider.
   Results: The selected studies (descriptive, randomized trial, and qualitative) were conducted in the emergency and family medicine settings on two programs of research which used similar interactive computer screen, Promote Health. The reviewed evidence supports the effectiveness of computer screening for improving provider-patient communication on IPVC in both settings and compromised mental health in family medicine. However the management of detected cases of IPVC by time-pressed frontline clinicians needs a more supportive environment. The need for such system-level support is greater for the emergency setting.
   Conclusions: The use of computer-assisted screening in similar settings can enhance the detection and disclosure of IPVC, although a coordinated multiservice response is needed to address it comprehensively. Future studies should examine the development of a coordinated response and the role of context on the success or failure of such program.

AB  - Sirtuins are a family of conserved proteins with deacetylase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. In humans they are coded by seven genes (SIRT1-7). The most widely investigated and best known sirtuin is SIRT1, which can be activated by the natural phytocompound resveratrol and plays a role in several physiologic (embryogenesis, glucose metabolism, apoptosis, autophagy, chromatin integrity, and transcriptional state) and pathologic (diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegeneration) conditions. In the field of neurodegeneration, resveratrol and SIRT1 have proved beneficial in in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), reducing amyloid-beta protein accumulation, considered one of the pathogenic mechanisms. In contrast to these promising biological data, however, genetic studies linking SIRT1 variability to AD are negative (this is the case for other sirtuins too, e. g., SIRT3). In this review, we summarize the in vitro, in vivo, and genetic experimental results linking SIRT1 and the other sirtuins to AD, while a description of sirtuins' biochemical features and modulating compounds, as well as sirtuins' involvement in other neurodegenerative disorders are discussed as collateral aims.

AB  - Despite significant advances in the field of social neuroscience, much remains to be understood regarding the development and maintenance of social skills across the life span. Few comprehensive models exist that integrate multidisciplinary perspectives and explain the multitude of factors that influence the emergence and expression of social skills. Here, a developmental biopsychosocial model (SOCIAL) is offered that incorporates the biological underpinnings and socio-cognitive skills that underlie social function (attention/executive function, communication, socio-emotional skills), as well as the internal and external (environmental) factors that mediate these skills. The components of the model are discussed in the context of the social brain network and are Supported by evidence from 3 conditions known to affect social functioning (autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury). This integrative model is intended to provide a theoretical structure for understanding the origins of social dysfunction and the factors that influence the emergence of social skills through childhood and adolescence in both healthy and clinical populations.

AB  - Postnatal depression (PND) impacts on the mother and her partner, the family, mother-baby interaction and on the baby. This review synthesises the evidence from qualitative and quantitative research to determine whether screening for PND is acceptable to women and healthcare professionals. The research literature was systematically searched to retrieve articles available until February 2007. No language or geographical restrictions were applied. Studies were included if the acceptability of PND screening was assessed during the prenatal and postnatal period. Data were synthesised using the textual narrative approach. Fifteen of the 16 eligible studies focused on the acceptability of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Screening for PND was generally found to be acceptable to women and healthcare professionals, although aspects of its administration were identified as being important. Specifically, a woman needs to feel comfortable about the screening process if she is to answer the questions honestly. This may be facilitated through forewarning and administration by a trusted person in her own home. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of differing cultural attitudes towards answering the questions, and the ambiguity of the question about self-harm. Further research into the acceptability of strategies other than EPDS is needed.

This chapter addresses the issue of sex influences on human brain function first as it pertains to studies of emotional memory, then as it pertains to the field of neuroscience more generally. The striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not.

AB  - The salinization and water deficit of soil are widespread environmental problems in limiting plant survival, growth, and productivity. However, some plants could adopt some strategies to resist salinity and drought stresses. Among these strategies, the mechanism of osmotic adjustment could help plants and algae to avoid ion toxicity and maintain water uptake in both stresses by accumulating large quantities of osmolytes. Two types of osmolytes, organic solutes and inorganic ions, play a key role in osmotic adjustment. Different osmolytes and their osmotic adjustment actions are different according to their distribution in different plants. Organic solutes, known as compatible solutes, include amino acids, glycerol, sugars, and other low molecular weight metabolites, serve a function in cells to lower or balance the osmotic potential of intracellular and extracellular ions in resistance to osmotic stresses. Inorganic ions for osmotic adjustment are mainly Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-. Inorganic ions make great contribution in osmotic adjustment by ion transport processes with related ion antiporters and ion channels. The aim of this review is to integrate recent data on the mechanisms of osmotic adjustment by osmolytes in plants and algae, and to illustrate the variety of related molecular mechanisms, to introduce new concepts and techniques into this research field. Genetic manipulation including the application of transgenic techniques in plants provides promising strategies to elevate the tolerance capability of plants under osmotic stress conditions.

AB  - The increasing worldwide prevalence of dementia is a major public health concern. Findings from some epidemiological studies suggest that diet and nutrition may be important modifiable risk factors for development of dementia. In order to evaluate the strength of the available evidence of an association of dietary factors with dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD), we systematically searched relevant publication databases and hand-searched bibliographies up to end July 2007. We included prospective cohort studies which evaluated the association of nutrient levels with the risk of developing dementia and randomized intervention studies examining the treatment effect of nutrient supplementation on cognitive function. One hundred and sixty studies, comprising ninety one prospective cohort studies and sixty nine intervention studies, met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Of these, thirty-three studies (19 cohort and 14 randomized controlled trials) investigated the effects of folate, B-vitamins, and levels of homocysteine (a biomarker modifiable through B-vitamin supplementation) or fish/fatty acids and are the focus of the present report. Some observational cohort studies indicated that higher dietary intake or elevated serum levels of folate and fish/fatty acids and low serum levels of homocysteine were associated with a reduced risk of incident AD and dementia, while other studies reported no association. The results of intervention studies examining the effects of folic acid or fatty acid supplementation on cognitive function are inconsistent. In summary, the available evidence is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions on the association of B vitamins and fatty acids with cognitive decline or dementia, and further long-term trials are required.

AB  - Initial investigations of the cerebellar microcircuit inspired the Marr-Albus theoretical framework of cerebellar function. We review recent developments in the experimental understanding of cerebellar microcircuit characteristics and in the computational analysis of Marr-Albus models. We conclude that many Marr-Albus models are in effect adaptive filters, and that evidence for symmetrical long-term potentiation and long-term depression, interneuron plasticity, silent parallel fibre synapses and recurrent mossy fibre connectivity is strikingly congruent with predictions from adaptive-filter models of cerebellar function. This congruence suggests that insights from adaptive-filter theory might help to address outstanding issues of cerebellar function, including both microcircuit processing and extra-cerebellar connectivity.

AB  - Psychiatric rehabilitation has become accepted by the mental health field as a legitimate field of study and practice. Over the last several decades various psychiatric rehabilitation programme models and procedures have been developed, evaluated and disseminated. At the same time the process of psychiatric rehabilitation has been specified and its underlying values and practitioner technology articulated. This review describes the psychiatric rehabilitation process and in so doing differentiates psychosocial interventions that can be classified as psychiatric rehabilitation interventions from other psychosocial interventions. Furthermore, the major psychiatric rehabilitation interventions are examined within a framework of the psychiatric rehabilitation process with a review of their evidence. The review concludes that psychiatric rehabilitation interventions are currently a mixture of evidence-based practices, promising practices and emerging methods that can be effectively tied together using the psychiatric rehabilitation process framework of helping individuals with serious mental illnesses choose, get and keep valued roles, and together with complementary treatment orientated psychosocial interventions, provide a broad strategy for facilitating recovery.

AB  - A systematic review of the literature on the prevalence, theories and correlates of child labor was done with emphasis on mental health. The methodologies of these literatures are variable in their strength and weakness. Some surveys are intensive and informative. Exploitation of young children's labor is extensive in developing countries such as Ethiopia, where an estimated every 4th under 15 year old is a child laborer. This review further highlights why children end up in the job market, and what they wish to do in the future. Relevant recommendations to policy makers on appropriate and streamlined education, as well as the need for further longitudinal and intervention oriented research, capacity building for parents and further advice is given.

AB  - Evidence from behavioral genetics supports the conclusion that a significant amount of the variance in antisocial personality and behavior (APB) is due to genetic contributions. Many scientific fields such as psychology, medicine, and criminal justice struggle to incorporate this information with preexisting paradigms that focused exclusively on external or learned etiology of antisocial behavior. The current paper presents a meta-analytic review of behavioral genetic etiological studies of APB. Results indicated that 56% of the variance in APB can be explained through genetic influences, with 11% due to shared non-genetic influences, and 31% due to unique non-genetic influences. This data is discussed in relation to evolutionary psychological theory.

AB  - Oxidative stress plays a central role in neuronal injury and cell death in acute and chronic pathological conditions. The cellular responses to oxidative stress embrace changes in mitochondria and other organelles, notably endoplasmic reticulum, and can lead to a number of cell death paradigms, which cover a spectrum from apoptosis to necrosis and include autophagy. In Alzheimer's disease, and other pathologies including Parkinson's disease, protein aggregation provides further cellular stresses that can initiate or feed into the pathways to cell death engendered by oxidative stress. Specific attention is paid here to mitochondrial dysfunction and programmed cell death, and the diverse modes of cell death mediated by mitochondria under oxidative stress. Novel insights into cellular responses to neuronal oxidative stress from a range of different stressors can be gained by detailed transcriptomics analyses. Such studies at the cellular level provide the key for understanding the molecular and cellular pathways whereby neurons respond to oxidative stress and undergo injury and death. These considerations underpin the development of detailed knowledge in more complex integrated systems, up to the intact human bearing the neuropathology, facilitating therapeutic advances.

Data collected from 50 technological companies which located in Hsinchu Science Parks in Taiwan (N = 239) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results confirm that both computer attitude and flow experience generate positive and direct influence on learning outcome. Specially, the effect of personal computer attitude is amplified on learning outcome through experience of flow in an e-learning environment.

AB  - In addition to their well-established role in providing the cell with ATP, mitochondria are the source of iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) and heme - prosthetic groups that are utilized by proteins throughout the cell in various critical processes. The post-transcriptional system that mammalian cells use to regulate intracellular iron homeostasis depends, in part, upon the synthesis of ISCs in mitochondria. Thus, proper mitochondrial function is crucial to cellular iron homeostasis. Many neurodegenerative diseases are marked by mitochondrial impairment, brain iron accumulation, and oxidative stress - pathologies that are interrelated. This review discusses the physiological role that mitochondria play in cellular iron homeostasis and, in so doing, attempts to clarify how mitochondrial dysfunction may initiate and/or contribute to iron dysregulation in the context of neurodegenerative disease. We review what is currently known about the entry of iron into mitochondria, the ways in which iron is utilized therein, and how mitochondria are integrated into the system of iron homeostasis in mammalian cells. Lastly, we turn to recent advances in our understanding of iron dysregulation in two neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), and discuss the use of iron chelation as a potential therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - A number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, tauopathies, Parkinson's disease, and synucleinopathies, polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, are characterized by the existence of a protein or peptide prone to aggregation specific to the disease: amyloid-beta , tau protein, alpha-synuclein, atrophin 1, androgen receptor, prion protein, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, alpha 1A subunit of CaV2.1, TATA-box binding protein, huntingtin, and ataxins 1, 2, 3, and 7. Beside this common molecular feature, we have found three additional main properties related to the disease-connected protein or peptide, which are shared by all those neurological disorders: first, proneness to aggregation, which, in many cases, seems to be bound to the lack of a clearly defined secondary structure; second, reported presence of the disease-related protein inside the nucleus; and finally, an apparently unspecific interaction with DNA. These findings, together with the lack of clear details to explain the molecular origin of these neurodegenerative diseases, invite a hypothesis that, together with other plausible molecular explanations, may contribute to find the molecular basis of these diseases: I propose here the hypothesis that many neurological disorders may be the consequence, at least in part, of an aberrant interaction of the disease-related protein with nucleic acids, therefore affecting the normal DNA expression and giving place to a genetic stress which, in turn, alters the expression of proteins needed for the normal cellular function and regulation.

AB  - Background: Violence against women is a recognized violation of human rights and an important public health concern. Violence during pregnancy is a risk to both the woman and her baby.
   Aims: The aim of this review was to identify what the literature reveals about violence during pregnancy in Asian countries.
   Methods: A systematic, integrated review was conducted of peer-reviewed literature published 1995-2009. Four databases were searched using the terms 'intimate partner violence', 'domestic violence', 'pregnancy', 'Asia', and 'developing countries'. Reported results were compared within identified themes: prevalence, associated factors, interaction of violence and pregnancy, impact on women's health, and the cultural role of children.
   Results: Twenty three eligible papers were found; 14 reported quantitative methods, 3 reported qualitative methods, and 6 reported both. Research was conducted in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, China, Thailand, and Iran. The prevalence of violence during pregnancy ranged from 4.3% to 48%. Adverse effects of violence were evident on women's physical and mental health and on their babies. Variables found to interact with violence were unintended pregnancy, woman's age, partner's education, social support, previous history of family violence, and the cultural value of children. The existing pattern and intensity of violence in the relationship were not found to change consistently with the woman's pregnancy.
   Conclusions: The limited literature suggests that violence during pregnancy is a problem in at least some Asian countries as throughout the world. Further research is needed to increase knowledge of this important matter of significance both to women's health and well-being and to social coherence.

AB  - From our research and literature search we propose an understanding of the mechanism of action of antidepressants treatments (ADTs) that should lead to increase efficacy and tolerance. We understand that ADTs promote synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. This promotion is linked with stimulation of dopaminergic receptors. Previous evidence shows that all ADTs (chemical, electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, sleep deprivation) increase at least one monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) or dopamine (DA); this article focuses on DA release or turn-over in the frontal cortex. DA increased dopaminergic activation promotes synaptic plasticity with an inverted U shape dose-response curve. Specific interaction between DA and glutamate is mediated by D1 receptor subtypes and Glutamate (NMDA) receptors with neurotrophic factors likely to play a modulatory role. With the understanding that all ADTs have a common, final, DA-ergic stimulation that promotes synaptic plasticity we can predict that (1) AD efficiency is related to the compound strength for inducing DA-ergic stimulation. (2) ADT efficiency presents a therapeutic window that coincides with the inverted U shape DA response curve. (3) ADT delay of action is related to a "synaptogenesis and neurogenesis delay of action." (4) The minimum efficient dose can be found by starting at a low dosage and increasing up to the patient response. (5) An increased tolerance requires a concomitant prescription of a few ADTs, with different or opposite adverse effects, at a very low dose. (6) ADTs could improve all diseases with cognitive impairments and synaptic depression by increasing synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis.

AB  - The New Caledonia SW lagoon is wide (5-20 nautical miles) and semi-closed. It is influenced by both the open ocean and the high island within a meteorological context subject to seasonal, inter-annual and longer term variations. The short-term variability (>1 day) of meteorological, hydrographical and planktonic parameters is illustrated by a 5-month long time series and is linked to local or remote wind, and precipitation. Seasonal and inter-annual variabilities, inferred from a 10-year long station by spectral analysis, appear clearly for all parameters. Seasonality is the main scale of variability as the island lies near the tropic of Capricorn. Inter-annual variability of a 3-4 year periodicity is poorly related to the Southern oscillation index (an equatorial climatic index), stressing the need for a separate tropical index. Long term trends appear on several parameters but their reliability depends on the length of the records. Considering only the longest records (1958-2005), surface temperature appears to have increased since the end of the 1960s in Noumea area. Finally, as a result of greater terrestrial influence, shallower depths, and longer water turnover times close to shore, the temporal variability amplitude decreases from the shore to the barrier reef.

AB  - The siting of cellular phone base stations and other cellular infrastructure such as roof-mounted antenna arrays, especially in residential neighborhoods, is a contentious subject in land-use regulation. Local resistance from nearby residents and landowners is often based on fears of adverse health effects despite reassurances from telecommunications service providers that international exposure standards will be followed. Both anecdotal reports and some epidemiology studies have found headaches, skin rashes, sleep disturbances, depression, decreased libido, increased rates of suicide, concentration problems, dizziness, memory changes, increased risk of cancer, tremors, and other neurophysiological effects in populations near base stations. The objective of this paper is to review the existing studies of people living or working near cellular infrastructure and other pertinent studies that could apply to long-term, low-level radiofrequency radiation (RFR) exposures. While specific epidemiological research in this area is sparse and contradictory, and such exposures are difficult to quantify given the increasing background levels of RFR from myriad personal consumer products, some research does exist to warrant caution in infrastructure siting. Further epidemiology research that takes total ambient RFR exposures into consideration is warranted. Symptoms reported today may be classic microwave sickness, first described in 1978. Nonionizing electromagnetic fields are among the fastest growing forms of environmental pollution. Some extrapolations can be made from research other than epidemiology regarding biological effects from exposures at levels far below current exposure guidelines.

AB  - Brain imaging studies have long supported that schizophrenia is a disorder of the brain, involving many discrete and widely spread regions. Generally, studies have shown decreases in cortical gray matter (GM) volume. Here, we selectively review recent papers studying GM volume changes in schizophrenia subjects, both first-episode (FE) and chronic, in an attempt to quantify and better understand differences between healthy and patient groups. We focused on the cortical GM of the prefrontal cortex, limbic and paralimbic structures, temporal lobe, and one subcortical structure (the caudate nucleus).
   We performed a search of the electronic journal database PsycINFO using the keywords "schizophrenia" and "MRI," and selected for papers published between 2001 and 2008. We then screened for only those studies utilizing manual or manually edited tracing methodologies for determining regions of interest (ROIs). Each region of interest was indexed independently; thus, one paper might yield results for numerous brain regions.
   Our review found that in almost all ROIs, cortical GM volume was decreased in the patient populations. The only exception was the caudate nucleus most studies reviewed showed no change, while one study showed an increase in volume; this region, however, is particularly sensitive to medication effects. The reductions were seen in both FE and chronic schizophrenia.
   These results clearly support that schizophrenia is an anatomical disorder of the brain, and specifically that schizophrenia patients tend to have decreased cortical GM in regions involved in higher cognition and emotional processing. That these reductions were found in both FE and chronic subjects supports that brain abnormalities are present at the onset of illness, and are not simply a consequence of chronicity. Additional studies assessing morphometry at different phases of the illness, including prodromal stages, together with longitudinal studies will elucidate further the role of progression in this disorder.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are the second and third most common human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases, respectively, after Alzheimer's disease. They are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. Some forms of PD and ALS are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. Morphological, biochemical, and genetic, as well as cell and animal model, studies reveal that mitochondria could have a role in this neurodegeneration. The functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and overlying genetic variations. In PD, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial DNA mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. In ALS, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial cell death proteins. Transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This review will present how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to neurodegeneration in PD and ALS and could serve as a target for drug therapy.

AB  - In recent years, new research has brought the field of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) out of its infancy and into a phase of relative maturity through many demonstrated prototypes such as brain-controlled wheelchairs, keyboards, and computer games. With this proof-of-concept phase in the past, the time is now ripe to focus on the development of practical BCI technologies that can be brought out of the lab and into real-world applications. In particular, we focus on the prospect of improving the lives of countless disabled individuals through a combination of BCI technology with existing assistive technologies (AT). In pursuit of more practical BCIs for use outside of the lab, in this paper, we identify four application areas where disabled individuals could greatly benefit from advancements in BCI technology, namely, "Communication and Control", "Motor Substitution", "Entertainment", and "Motor Recovery". We review the current state of the art and possible future developments, while discussing the main research issues in these four areas. In particular, we expect the most progress in the development of technologies such as hybrid BCI architectures, user-machine adaptation algorithms, the exploitation of users' mental states for BCI reliability and confidence measures, the incorporation of principles in human-computer interaction (HCI) to improve BCI usability, and the development of novel BCI technology including better EEG devices.

AB  - Depression is a comorbid condition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with negative consequences in patients and caregivers. Pathophysiology and optimal treatment are matters to be elucidated. A search of articles dealing with depression in AD was conducted in MEDLINE with special attention to epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. Depression may predate dementia and tends to occur in up to 50% of AD patients with a decrease of noradrenalin and serotonin in the brain being the most plausible cause. Only 7 small double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials with antidepressants in AD patients with depression were found: 4 with sertraline, 1 with fluoxetine, 1 with imipramine, and another one with clomipramine. The total number of treated patients was 318. The weighted odds ratio (OR) was calculated with the method of Mantel-Haenszel. Both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are better than placebo in treating depression in AD (weighted OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.13-2.96), with sertraline being one of the most used drugs. The differences were significant in 2 trials and not significant in four. The magnitude of effect is globally modest. Moreover, it is noteworthy mentioning the high rates of response to placebo in most studies. Depression is one of the most frequent behavioral symptoms in AD. Although antidepressants may work in AD, given the small number of patients treated, the effect is unclear. Further large randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted in order to know the best drug to begin with and the actual degree of efficacy.

AB  - It is a clinical reality that women make up the large majority of chronic pain patients, and there is now consensus from laboratory experiments that when differences are seen, women are more sensitive to pain than men. Research in this field has now begun to concentrate on finding explanations for this sex difference. Although sex differences in sociocultural, psychological, and experiential factors likely play important roles, evidence largely from animal studies has revealed surprisingly robust and often qualitative sex differences at low levels of the neuraxis. Although not yet able to affect clinical practice, the continued study of sex differences in pain may have important implications for the development of new analgesic strategies.

AB  - Mitochondria are crucial regulators of energy metabolism and apoptotic pathways and have been closely linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In this review we mainly focus on mitochondrial dysfunction in two of the most prevalent neurological disorders: Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We discuss whether the role of mitochondria in those diseases should be considered primordial or secondary to other processes that eventually lead to neurodegeneration. In the case of Parkinson's disease, the role of mitochondria is quite clear and might be involved in the mechanism of this disorder. For Alzheimer's disease, the evidence in favor of such a link is more indirect, and mitochondrial dysfunction likely occurs at a later stage of the disorder.

AB  - The physical barrier between blood and the CNS (the blood-brain barrier, the blood-spinal cord barrier and the blood-CSF barrier) protects the CNS from both toxic and pathogenic agents in the blood. It is now clear that disruption of the blood-CNS barrier plays a key role in a number of CNS disorders, particularly those associated with neurodegeneration Such disruption is inevitably accompanied by inflammatory change, as immune cells and immune mediators gain access to the brain or spinal cord. The blood-CNS barrier also presents a major obstacle for potential CNS medicines. Robust methods to assess CNS permeation are therefore essential for CNS drug discovery, particularly when brain pharmacokinetics are taken into account and especially when such measures are linked to neurochemical. physiological, behavioural or neuroimaging readouts of drug action Drug candidates can be successfully designed to cross the blood-CNS barrier, but for those that can't there is the possibility of entry with a delivery system that facilitates the movement of drug candidate across the blood-CNS barrier.

AB  - Objective: This review paper will be discussing on mental health of children and adolescents in Malaysia. Behavioural problems, academic failure and underachievement in school are common reasons for referral of children to the medical services. Epidemiological research has substantiated a possible seriously mismatch between the rates of child mental health problems across a broad spectrum and the number of children actually referred to existing services. These data suggest it is imperative in Malaysia to empirically investigate the present realities in the schools in regard to special education needs and their neglect. Methods: The present preliminary study is based on a literature review of epidemiological features of learning disorders and comorbidities using the Cochran library key word search. Available statistics for learning disorders from the WHO are compared with records for the year 2007 from the Ministry of Education in Malaysia. Results: Findings of this comparison with international prevalence rates of learning disorders and related diseases show a sizable gap between real existing needs in Malaysia, and their perception. Based on quantitative estimates, the findings suggest that some 1.4 million children in Malaysia have mental health difficulties that interfere with normal functioning and development, but adequate services for intervention are largely not available. Conclusion: The present undersupply of adequate service for children with learning difficulties is aggravated by the lack of systematic developmental screening in early childhood in Malaysia. This status affects the outcomes and development of the general education system in efforts to meet challenges in the new century.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common wneurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population older than 60 years. Classically, PD is considered to be a motor system disease and its diagnosis is based on the presence of a set of cardinal motor signs (rigidity, bradykinesia, rest tremor) that are consequence of a pronounced death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Nowadays there is considerable evidence showing that non-dopaminergic degeneration also occurs in other brain areas which seems to be responsible for the deficits in olfactory, emotional and memory functions that precede the classical motor symptoms in PD. The present review attempts to examine results reported in epidemiological, clinical and animal studies to provide a comprehensive picture of the antiparkinsonian potential of caffeine. Convergent epidemiological and pre-clinical data suggest that caffeine may confer neuroprotection against the underlying dopaminergic neuron degeneration, and influence the onset and progression of PD. The available data also suggest that caffeine can improve the motor deficits of PD and that adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists such as istradefylline reduces OFF time and dyskinesia associated with standard 'dopamine replacement' treatments. Finally, recent experimental findings have indicated the potential of caffeine in the management of non-motor symptoms of PD, which do not improve with the current dopaminergic drugs. Altogether, the studies reviewed provide strong evidence that caffeine may represent a promising therapeutic tool in PD, thus being the first compound to restore both motor and non-motor early symptoms of PD together with its neuroprotective potential.

AB  - This review provides a cumulative perspective on current human factors research by first briefly acknowledging previous Annual Review articles. We show that several recent conceptual advances are an outgrowth of the information-processing approach adopted by the field and present several areas of current research that are built directly on prior work. Topic areas that provide fundamental tools for human factors analyses are summarized, and several current application areas are reviewed. We end by considering alternatives to the information-processing approach that have been proposed and placing those alternatives in context. We argue that the information-processing language provides the foundation that has enabled much of the growth in human factors. This growth reflects a cumulative development of concepts and methods that continues today.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly population. It is predicted that the incidence of AD will be increased in the future making this disease one of the greatest medical, social, and economic challenges for individuals, families, and the health care system worldwide. The etiology of AD is multifactorial. It features increased oxidative state and deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of protein tau in the central cortex and limbic system of the brain. Here we provide an overview of the positive impacts of exercise on this challenging disease. Regular physical activity increases the endurance of cells and tissues to oxidative stress, vascularization, energy metabolism, and neurotrophin synthesis, all important in neurogenesis, memory improvement, and brain plasticity. Although extensive studies are required to understand the mechanism, it is clear that physical exercise is beneficial in the prevention of AD and other age-associated neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Growing dependence on coal-fired power plants for electrical generation in many countries presents ongoing environmental challenges. Burning pulverized coal in thermal power plants (TPPs) generates large amounts of fly ash (FA) that must be disposed of or otherwise handled, in an environmentally-sound manner. A possible option for dealing with fly ash is to use it as an amendment for mine spoil or other damaged soil. It has been demonstrated through studies in India and other countries that FA alone or in combination with organic or inorganic materials can be used in a productive manner for reclamation of mine spoil. The characteristics of FA, including silt-sized particles, lighter materials with low bulk density (BD), higher water holding capacity, favorable pH and significant concentrations of many essential plant nutrients, make it a potentially favorable amendment for mine spoil reclamation. Studies have indicated that the application of FA has improved the physical, chemical and biological qualities of soil to which it is applied. The release of trace metals and soluble salts from FA could be a major limitation to its application. This is particularly true of fresh, un-weathered FA or acidic FA, although perhaps not a concern for weathered/pond ash or alkaline FA. Some potential contaminants, especially metals and other salt ions, could be immobilized and rendered biologically inert by the addition of certain inorganic and organic amendments. However, in view of the variability in the characteristics of FAs that are associated with location, feed coal, combustion conditions and other factors, the suitability of a particular FA for a specific soil/mine spoil needs to be critically evaluated before it is applied in order to maximize favorable results and eliminate unexpected consequences. FA generated in India tends to be mostly alkaline, with lower levels of trace elements than are often found in FAs from other countries. The concentrations of potential chemical stressors, predominantly metals, in Indian FAs are often less than established or proposed permissible limits and are thus better suited for soil application. A major logistic limitation to the use of FA could be the cost involved in transport of ash from production to utilization sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies into the mechanisms of corticosteroid action continue to be a rich bed of research, spanning the fields of neuroscience and endocrinology through to immunology and metabolism. However, the vast literature generated, in particular with respect to corticosteroid actions in the brain, tends to be contentious, with some aspects suffering from loose definitions, poorly-defined models, and appropriate dissection kits. Here, rather than presenting a comprehensive review of the subject, we aim to present a critique of key concepts that have emerged over the years so as to stimulate new thoughts in the field by identifying apparent shortcomings. This article will draw on experience and knowledge derived from studies of the neural actions of other steroid hormones, in particular estrogens, not only because there are many parallels but also because 'learning from differences' can be a fruitful approach. The core purpose of this review is to consider the mechanisms through which corticosteroids might act rapidly to alter neural signaling.

AB  - Pin1 [Protein Interacting with NIMA (never in mitosis A)] is a peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase that isomerizes phospho-Serine/Threonine-Proline [p(S/T)-P] motifs of its target proteins. Pin1 functions in concert with proline directed kinases such as cyclin-dependent protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and protein phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and PP2B, in the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes including cell division, DNA damage response, and gene transcription, and in susceptibility to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on the roles of Pin1 in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Frontotemporal dementia associated with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Pin1 interacts with neuronal cytoskeletal proteins such as tau, amyloid-beta protein precursor, alpha-synuclein, and neurofilaments, often in association with phosphorylation events that influence their functions in the neuronal cytoskeleton. Overexpression of Pin1 reduces WT tau stability but increases P301L mutant tau stability. Pin1 associates with neurofilament H (NF-H) and modulates excitotoxic and oxidative stress induced perikaryal phosphorylation of NF-H. Pin1 mediates the neural specific apoptosis machinery. The specific inhibitors of Pin1 may have potential therapeutic implications in neurodegeneration.

Data indicate that approximately 25% of patients with depression in late life present with psychotic symptoms. In this review, we systematically searched four main databases; EMBASE, PsychINFO, Medline and Cochrane Collaboration on the pharmacotherapy of late life depression with psychotic features. Data for the treatment of psychotic depression in late life are scares although available evidence indicates efficacy for antidepressants, antipsychotic medications and mifepristone and electroconvulsive therapy. Based on the available evidence, we have provided a guideline for the appropriate treatment of this important disorder thus preventing undue suffering to the patients and their families.

AB  - Brain damage was traditionally seen as the product of a neurological disease or injury. Nevertheless, modern brain imaging techniques have provided increasing evidence for alterations in brain tissue and metabolism for a number of psychiatric disorders. Though for a while "dissociated'' (Spiegel, 2006) from the clinical and scientific arena, dissociative disorders have in the last several years received a renewed interest among several groups of researchers, who embarked on the work of disentangling their neural correlates. We review data from our own research as well as others, which point to distinct changes in brain regions underlying dissociative amnes(t)ic disorders. These changes may consist of overall reductions in brain metabolism or more selective alterations primarily in the right temporo-frontal cortices. Recent evidence with refined magnetic resonance imaging techniques furthermore reveals selective fiber degenerations in these regions. While these changes may persist and probably even intensify in some patients, they may be reversible in others - especially if treatment is carried out successfully within short time after onset. Implications of these findings for the pathogenetic conceptualization of dissociative amnes(t)ic disorders are outlined.

AB  - For two decades, genetic engineering has made it possible to develop crops and trees designed for yield improvement and simplified culture management. This, combined with field deployment of monocultures over large areas, can result in environmental stress and unwanted potential side effects. The commercial production of genetically modified (GM) crops and the recent development of GM trees raise concerns about their potential impact on the environment, in general, and on the biodiversity of non-target organisms, in particular. Fungi are spread worldwide and play key roles in ecosystems. They have been closely associated with plants since they emerged from the oceans. This review critically examines research monitoring the potential effects of GM crops and GM trees on target and non-target fungi. Parsing public databases for peer-reviewed publications about GM plant impacts on fungi yielded 149 studies, a relatively modest number considering the diversity of crops and ecosystems studied. Analysis of these publications showed that the effects of GM plants expressing herbicide and insect tolerance on fungi are understudied while they dominate the GM area worldwide. Experiments monitoring the impact of GM crops and GM trees with enhanced antifungal activity towards target fungi showed, for the most part, significant decreases in disease severity caused by fungal pathogens. Significant changes, expressed as an increase or decrease in fungal development, abundance, and diversity of non-target fungi, were observed in 18 out of 60 studies and all of them involved GM plants expressing traits that were unexpected to affect fungi. The remaining 42 studies did not identify a significant impact on fungal populations. Therefore, in spite of the fact that GM plants have been commercialized since 1996, no clear generalized trend can be identified and it appears that a case-by-case approach is the safest.

AB  - The effects of amyloid-beta are extremely complex. Current work in the field of Alzheimer disease is focusing on discerning the impact between the physiological signaling effects of soluble low molecular weight amyloid-beta species and the more global cellular damage that could derive from highly concentrated and/or aggregated amyloid. Being able to dissect the specific signaling events, to understand how soluble amyloid-beta induces its own production by up-regulating BACE1 expression, could lead to new tools to interrupt the distinctive feedback cycle with potential therapeutic consequences. Here we describe a positive loop that exists between the secretases that are responsible for the generation of the amyloid-beta component of Alzheimer disease. According to our hypothesis, in familial Alzheimer disease, the primary overproduction of amyloid-beta can induce BACE1 transcription and drive a further increase of amyloid-beta precursor protein processing and resultant amyloid-beta production. In sporadic Alzheimer disease, many factors, among them oxidative stress and inflammation, with consequent induction of presenilins and BACE1, would activate a loop and proceed with the generation. of amyloid-beta and its signaling role onto BACE1 transcription. This concept of a signaling effect by and feedback on the amyloid-beta precursor protein will likely shed light on how amyloid-beta generation, oxidative stress, and secretase functions are intimately related in sporadic Alzheimer disease.

AB  - The combined method is based on using an electrical method for moisture gradient monitoring and an acoustic emission method for detection of microcracking. In the method, electrodes are used to create an electric field in drying wood and to measure the electric complex spectrum using the impedance spectroscopy method, while at the same time measuring acoustic emissions from drying wood. The result can be used for calculating the parameters required for determining the stress state prevailing in the wood. The spectrum is affected by the properties of the wood, such as moisture content, moisture gradient, temperature, density and structure. When the electric complex spectrum and acoustic emission response are determined at the same time, it is possible to estimate both the main reason for the stresses (moisture gradient) and the outcome (microcracking and macrocracking). The results may be used to control drying to achieve wood products of superior quality. The method was studied and tested both in the laboratory and in industrial kilns.

TI  - Seizure Thresholds in Elderly Patients Treated with Electroconvulsive Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder: A Review
KW  - Aging
KW  - electroconvulsive therapy
KW  - review
KW  - seizure threshold
AB  - Objective: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is effective and generally safe in depression. Its effectiveness and side effects are suggested to be related to the electrical stimulus administered relative to the seizure threshold. Since aging seems to raise the seizure threshold in ECT, we reviewed the literature for evidence correlating advanced age and seizure threshold, and for hypotheses explaining why seizure thresholds might raise with age.
   Methods: Pubmed, PsychINFO, three standard works on ECT, and cross-references were searched for studies investigating seizure thresholds and/or associated factors in elderly depressed patients.
   Results: A total of 406 possibly relevant articles were found, of which 27 studies could be included. One very recently published study was included afterwards because of its significance. Aging was moderately associated with a raised initial seizure threshold with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.30 to 0.64 (p< 0.05). Also, seizure thresholds in elderly patients were more likely to raise during the ECT course. Reported hypotheses for these clinical phenomena include a decrease of neuroexcitability, changes in morphologic and functional characteristics of the brain, somatic comorbidity, and concomitant medication use.
   Conclusion: To optimize ECT in elderly patients, hypotheses and suggestions for further research are proposed regarding the moderate correlation between advanced age and initial seizure threshold and the rise in seizure threshold during the ECT course.

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that patients develop post-operative cognitive decline (POCD) following surgery. POCD is characterized by transient short-term decline in cognitive ability evident in the early post-operative period. This initial decline might be associated with increased risk of a delayed cognitive decline associated with dementia 3 to 5 years post-surgery. In some studies, the conversion rates to dementia are up to 70% in patients who are 65 years or older. The factors responsible for the increased risk of dementia are unclear; however, clinical studies investigating the prevalence of POCD and dementia following surgery do not show an association with the type of anesthesia or duration of surgery. Epidemiological studies from our group support this observation. The adjusted Hazard Ratios for developing dementia (or AD specifically) after prostate or hernia surgery were 0.65 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.83, prostate) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85, hernia) for cohorts of subjects exposed to general anesthesia compared to those exposed only to local anesthesia. Animal studies suggest that prolonged exposure to some volatile-inhalational anesthetics increase production of amyloid-fi and vulnerability to neurodegeneration, but these results are weakened by the absence of clinical support. Inflammation and a maladaptive stress response might also contribute to the pathophysiology of this disorder. Future research needs to identify predisposing factors, and then strategies to protect against POCD and subsequent dementia. The field also needs to adopt a more rigorous approach to codifying the frequency and extent of early and delayed post-operative cognitive decline.

AB  - Flavonoids are secondary plant metabolites of great structural variety and high medicinal significance. The search for new chemical entities and the quality control of flavonoid containing natural products require easy-to-use but reliable and robust analytical methodologies. For structural elucidation of flavonoids and their glycosides, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectroscopy (MS) are the generally used techniques. In phytochemical analyses, however; high amounts of flavonoids are difficult to isolate for NMR, thus low sample volume requiring MS based methods are emerging. This review summarizes and compares currently available methods for structural elucidation of flavonoids by LC-MS and LC-MSn. and focuses on the identification options of unknown flavonoid glycosides in complex samples (e.g., plant extracts) with the emphasis on the differentiation of isomeric compounds.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by progressive decline in memory and cognition and pathologically by extracellular amyloid-beta (A beta) deposits and intraneuronal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau. Since its proposal in 1992. the amyloid cascade hypothesis implicates A beta overproduction as a causative event in disease pathogenesis, and this thinking has predominated the field's understanding of AD pathogenesis and the development of potential therapeutics (i.e.. A beta-reducing agents). Though A beta has been shown to induce AD pathology, unanswered questions for sporadic AD development suggests this hypothesis is best applied to familial disease only. The more recent mitochondrial cascade hypothesis is supported by data showing that early impairments of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress may precede A beta overproduction and deposition. However, the development of A beta-reducing agents continues. Unfortunately, these agents have not been efficiently tested for their effect on one of the earliest AD pathologies. i.e., mitochondrial dysfunction. This paper will review supporting data for the amyloid and mitochondrial cascade hypotheses, reports of the effects of secretase inhibitors on AD-phenotypic cells and animals, and begin to look at a potential role for gamma-secretase, which is localized to mitochondria, in AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB  - It is clear from a striking convergence of human tissue studies, neurotoxin models, and genetic models that mitochondrial dysregulation plays a central pathogenic role in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related neurodegenerative conditions. Impaired mitochondrial quality could result from both increased damage and decreased ability to repair or clear damaged mitochondria. In particular, common deficits in mitochondrial respiratory chain function, oxidative stress, morphology/dynamics, and calcium handling capacities have been described in multiple PD model systems employing complex I inhibitors, 6-hydroxydopamine and molecular manipulation of Parkinsonian genes including alpha-synuclein, PTEN-induced kinase I, Parkin, DJ-1, and, to a lesser extent, leucine rich repeat kinase 2. The most recent and exciting work implicates alterations in the regulation of macroautophagy and likely of selective mitophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, although additional studies are needed to resolve some issues in this area. Future studies emphasizing the normal mitoprotective function(s) of proteins associated with recessive loss-of-function causes of familial PD, as well as compensatory mechanisms operating in their absence, may offer particularly valuable insights into strategies to enhance mitochondrial health.

AB  - The recent discovery of a number of genes involved in familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) has moved the use of model genetic organisms to the frontline. One avenue holding tremendous potential to find therapies against human diseases is the use of intact living systems where complex biological processes can be examined. Despite key differences that need to be taken into account when using invertebrate models such as Drosophila, there are many advantages offered by this system. The rapid generation time and the ability to easily generate transgenic animals together with the variety of genetic tools to control temporal and spatial expression of any given gene makes the fly model a very attractive system to study human neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we analyze how the use of fruit flies has revealed to be an excellent tool providing valuable insights into the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of PD.

AB  - Neuroaesthetics is a relatively young field within cognitive neuroscience, concerned with the neural underpinnings of aesthetic experience of beauty, particularly in visual art. Neuroscientific investigations have approached this area using imaging and neurophysiological techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). The results produced so far are very heterogeneous. Nonetheless, an overall view of the findings suggests that the aesthetic experience of visual artworks is characterized by the activation of: sensorimotor areas; core emotional centres; and reward-related centres. In the present review, we discuss the functional relevance of these activations and propose that aesthetic experience is a multilevel process exceeding a purely visual analysis of artworks and relying upon visceromotor and somatomotor resonance in the beholder.

AB  - Human morality provides the foundation for many of the pillars of society, informing political legislation and guiding legal decisions while also governing everyday social interactions. In the past decade, researchers in the field of cognitive neuroscience have made tremendous progress in the effort to understand the neural basis of human morality. The emerging insights from this research point toward a model in which automatic processing in parallel neural circuits, many of which are associated with social emotions, evaluate the actions and intentions of others. Through various mechanisms of competition, only a subset of these circuits ultimately causes a decision or an action. This activity is experienced consciously as a subjective moral sense of right or wrong, and an interpretive process offers post hoc explanations designed to link the social stimulus with the subjective moral response using whatever explicit information is available.

AB  - The eastern Mediterranean is naturally highly oligotrophic, but urbanization along the Levant coast has led to raised organic and nutrient loads. This study tracks living foraminiferal assemblages at two sites near an activated sewage sludge outfall from 11/2003 to 5/2004. Oligotrophic site PL29 shows seasonal variations in O-2. chlorophyll a, and organic carbon, and has an abundant, diverse benthic foraminiferal assemblage living at various in-sediment depths. At eutrophic site PL3, similar to 16 years of sludge injection favor a depleted assemblage primarily of opportunist foraminifera. This site shows less seasonality, is subjected to organic matter overload, O-2-stress, and periodic anoxia, foraminifera are less abundant and diverse, and live at shallower depths. The assemblages at both sites represent a common pool of species, with Ammonia tepida highly dominant. Benthic foraminifera were therefore found to be sensitive to trophic trajectories, respond on sub-seasonal time-scales, and track injection and dispersal of organic loads on the shelf.

AB  - A number of previous articles on blindsight have stressed that even after the lesion of the primary visual cortex (V1), subjects can perform visually guided saccades toward the targets in the blind field and that the extrageniculate visual pathway which bypasses the V1 can control the saccades by itself. However, in monkey model of V1 lesion, about two months of time is needed for recovery, suggesting that the extrageniculate visual pathway cannot immediately take over the function of the geniculo-striatal pathway, and on close look at the dynamics of saccades, saccades became ballistic and online corrections of trajectories and velocities were impaired, and that decision threshold for saccade initiation was lowered. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the visual signal through V1 is necessary for deliberate control of saccades.

AB  - Over the past several decades there has been considerable progress in our basic knowledge as to the mechanisms and factors regulating Mn toxicity. The disorder known as manganism is associated with the preferential accumulation of Mn in the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia which is generally considered to be the major and initial site of injury. Because the area of the CNS comprising the basal ganglia is very complex and dependent on the precise function and balance of several neurotransmitters, it is not surprising that symptoms of manganism often overlap with that of Parkinson's disease. The fact that neurological symptoms and onset of Mn toxicity are quite broad and can vary unpredictably probably reflects specific genetic variance of the physiological and biochemical makeup within the basal ganglia in any individual. Differences in response to Mn overexposure are, thus, likely due to underlying genetic variability which ultimately presents in deviations in both susceptibility as well as the characteristics of the neurological lesions and symptoms expressed. Although chronic exposure to Mn is not the initial causative agent provoking Parkinsonism, there is evidence suggesting that persistent exposure can predispose an individual to acquire dystonic movements associated with Parkinson's disease. As noted in this review, there appears to be common threads between the two disorders, as mutations in the genes, parkin and ATP13A2, associated with early onset of Parkinsonism, may also predispose an individual to develop Mn toxicity. Mutations in both genes appear to effect transport of Mn into the cell. These genetic difference coupled with additional environmental or nutritional factors must also be considered as contributing to the severity and onset of manganism.

AB  - Latent inhibition (LI) is defined as poorer associative learning with a previously exposed. irrelevant stimulus than with a non-preexposed, novel stimulus. This study examined how type of within-subject procedure, class of schizotypal symptoms, and gender modulate LI. Two within-subject procedures were examined, one excluding, and one including a masking task. The former yielded a stronger stimulus preexposure effect than the latter. However, the stimulus preexposure effect was attenuated by total schizotypy score in the masked, but not in the non-masked procedure. The results with schizotypy factors (positive and negative symptoms) as well as with schizotypy factors x gender interactions were inconsistent with those of other studies. It was suggested that in addition to LI, interference and novel pop-out effects were also produced by the procedures, particularly in the non-masked condition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While peripheral immune access to the central nervous system (CNS) is restricted and tightly controlled, the CNS is capable of dynamic immune and inflammatory responses to a variety of insults. Infections, trauma, stroke, toxins and other stimuli are capable of producing an immediate and short lived activation of the innate immune system within the CNS. This acute neuroinflammatory response includes activation of the resident immune cells ( microglia) resulting in a phagocytic phenotype and the release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines. While an acute insult may trigger oxidative and nitrosative stress, it is typically short-lived and unlikely to be detrimental to long-term neuronal survival. In contrast, chronic neuroinflammation is a long-standing and often self-perpetuating neuroinflammatory response that persists long after an initial injury or insult. Chronic neuroinflammation includes not only long-standing activation of microglia and subsequent sustained release of inflammatory mediators, but also the resulting increased oxidative and nitrosative stress. The sustained release of inflammatory mediators works to perpetuate the inflammatory cycle, activating additional microglia, promoting their proliferation, and resulting in further release of inflammatory factors. Neurodegenerative CNS disorders, including multiple sclerosis ( MS), Alzheimer's disease ( AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), tauopathies, and age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), are associated with chronic neuroinflammation and elevated levels of several cytokines. Here we review the hallmarks of acute and chronic inflammatory responses in the CNS, the reasons why microglial activation represents a convergence point for diverse stimuli that may promote or compromise neuronal survival, and the epidemiologic, pharmacologic and genetic evidence implicating neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Myelin sheaths include an extraordinary structure, the "paranodal axoglial junction" (PNJ), which attaches the sheath to the axon at each end of each myelin segment. Its size is enormous and its structure unique. Here we review past and current studies showing that this junction can serve multiple functions in maintaining reliable saltatory conduction. The present evidence points to three functions in particular. 1) It seals the myelin sheath to the axon to prevent major shunting of nodal action currents beneath the myelin sheath while still leaving a narrow channel interconnecting the internodal periaxonal space with the perinodal space. This pathway represents a potential route through which juxtaparanodal and internodal channels can influence nodal activity and through which nutrients, such as glucose, and other metabolites can diffuse to and from the internodal periaxonal space. 2) It serves as a mechanism for maintaining discrete, differentiated axolemmal domains at and around the node of Ranvier by acting as a barrier to the lateral movement of ion channel complexes within the axolemma, thus concentrating voltage-gated sodium channels at the node and segregating fast voltage-gated potassium channels to the juxtaparanode under the myelin sheath. 3) It attaches the myelin sheath to the axon on either side of the node and can thus maintain nodal dimensions in the face of mechanical stresses associated with stretch or other local factors that might cause disjunction. It is therefore the likely means for maintaining constancy of nodal surface area and electrical parameters essential for consistency in conduction. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

KW  - 1980S
AB  - In 2008, share prices on U.S. stock markets fell further than they had during any one year since the 1930s. Does this mean corporate governance 'failed?" This Article argues generally "no," based on a study of a sample of companies at "ground zero" of the stock market meltdown, namely the thirty-seven firms removed from the iconic S&P 500 index during 2008. The study, based primarily on searches of the Factiva news database, reveals that institutional shareholders were largely mute as share prices fell and that boardroom practices and executive pay policies at various financial firms were problematic. On the other hand, there apparently were no Enron-style frauds, there was little criticism of the corporate governance of companies that were not under severe financial stress, and directors of troubled firms were far from passive, as they orchestrated CEO turnover at a rate far exceeding the norm in public companies. Given that corporate governance functioned tolerably well in companies removed from the S&P 500 and that a combination of regulation and market forces will likely prompt financial firms to scale back the free-wheeling business activities that arguably helped to precipitate the stock market meltdown, the case is not yet made for fundamental reform of current corporate governance arrangements.

AB  - White matter abnormalities constitute one element of the network dysfunction that underlies affective disorders: differences between the white matter of subjects with affective disorders and control subjects have been identified using a range of neuroimaging and histological techniques. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can uniquely study the orientation and integrity of white matter tracts and is thus an ideal tool to shed light on white matter abnormalities in subjects with affective disorders. Here, we systematically review DTI studies of affective disorders. We identified DTI studies of affective disorders from EMBASE and MEDLINE and searched the reference lists of relevant papers. Twenty-seven articles comparing subjects with affective disorders with control subjects were included in the review, with eight studies included in a meta-analysis of superior frontal regions. Twenty-one of 27 studies found significantly lower anisotropy in subjects with affective disorders compared with control subjects, more specifically within the frontal and temporal lobes or tracts. A large effect size was detected within the superior frontal gyrus, although heterogeneity and one index of publication bias were significant. Although there is significant heterogeneity of acquisition and analysis methods and subject properties, DTI studies of affective disorders consistently identify reduced anisotropy in the frontal and temporal lobes and tracts of subjects with affective disorders relative to control subjects.

AB  - Background Agricultural work in the United States and Canada continues to be one of the most dangerous vocations. Surveillance evidence suggests that older farmers (>60 years of age) are at greater risk of serious injury than their younger counterparts. The purpose of this article was to outline illnesses and medications that may contribute to older farmers' increased risk of agricultural injury and to determine a minimum set of health-related covariates that could be used in farm injury studies.
   Methods A review of English language literature in Medline, CINAHL, and NIOSH databases was conducted examining disease and medication factors related to farm injury.
   Results Health- and disease-related factors most commonly reported as significantly contributing to agricultural injury included previous injury, hearing problems, depression, arthritis, and sleep deprivation. The use of "any medication" was identified as a significant risk factor for injury in a number of studies. The use of sleep medication was significantly related to injury in two studies.
   Conclusions Based on the findings, it is recommended that at a minimum, researchers collect information on the prevalence of previous injury, hearing problems, depression, arthritis/muscular-skeletal problems and sleep disturbance as these have been identified as significant risk factors in a number of studies. In addition, where subjects that identify any of these afflictions, further information should be sought on any medications used in their treatment which can add data on disease severity More research and surveillance activities need to be focused on the older farm worker This population is critical to the maintenance of the agricultural base in North America and health and safety research initiatives need to address this. By integrating research from the fields of gerontology, occupational health and safety, and injury prevention, innovative interventions could be constructed to assist the aging farmer in the continuation of safe farming.

AB  - Only a small percentage of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease is directly related to familial forms. The etiology of the most abundant, sporadic forms seems to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Environmental compounds are now extensively studied for their possible contribution to neurodegeneration. Chemicals were found which were able to reproduce symptoms of known neurodegenerative diseases, others may either predispose to the onset of neurodegeneration, or exacerbate distinct pathogenic processes of these diseases. in any case, in vitro studies performed with models presenting various degrees of complexity have shown that many environmental compounds have the potential to cause neurodegeneration, through a variety of pathways similar to those described in neurodegenerative diseases. Since the population is exposed to a huge number of potentially neurotoxic compounds, there is an important need for rapid and efficient procedures for hazard evaluation. Xenobiotics elicit a cascade of reactions that, most of the time, involve numerous interactions between the different brain cell types. A reliable in vitro model for the detection of environmental toxins potentially at risk for neurodegenerative diseases should therefore allow maximal cell-cell interactions and multi-parametric endpoints determination. The combined use of in vitro models and new analytical approaches using "omics" technologies should help to map toxicity pathways, and advance our understanding of the possible role of xenobiotics in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Until recently, the brain was studied almost exclusively by neuroscientists and the immune system by immunologists, fuelling the notion that these systems represented two isolated entities. However, as more data suggest an important role of the immune system in regulating the progression of brain aging and neurodegenerative disease, it has become clear that the crosstalk between these systems can no longer be ignored and a new interdisciplinary approach is necessary. A central question that emerges is whether immune and inflammatory pathways become hyperactivated with age and promote degeneration or whether insufficient immune responses, which fail to cope with age-related stress, may contribute to disease. We try to explore here the consequences of gain versus loss of function with an emphasis on microglia as sensors and effectors of immune function in the brain, and we discuss the potential role of the peripheral environment in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Blood-injury-injection (BII) phobia presents with a unique anxiety response that often involves blood pressure drops and pronounced bradycardia, which can culminate in fainting. The current recommended treatment for BII phobia is Applied Tension (AT), a tension technique that includes in vivo exposure. However, surprisingly little empirical evidence is available on the additive efficacy of tension beyond exposure alone. Our literature search yielded five controlled treatment studies for BII phobia, all from one research group. Beyond AT, these studies also tested Exposure only (E), Tension only, Applied Relaxation (AR), or a combination of AR and AT. Based on self-reported levels of anxiety, in-session avoidance and fainting, AT was superior over other conditions; however, when considering pre- to post-treatment effect sizes on BII-related questionnaires. E outperformed all other treatments. In addition, AT did not yield better results on physiological measures, and individuals with BII fears improved similarly within studies across treatment groups, regardless of fainting status. Heterogeneity in patient populations (e.g. extent of fainting-proneness), differential targeting of BII phobia manifestations, and small sample sizes may explain some of the variability in findings. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of treatment techniques for BII phobia patients with and without fainting history. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pain perception and its genesis in the human brain have been reviewed recently. In the current article, the reports on pain modulation in the human brain were reviewed from higher cortical regulation, i.e. top-down effect, particularly studied in psychological determinants. Pain modulation can be examined by gene therapy, physical modulation, pharmacological modulation, psychological modulation, and pathophysiological modulation. In psychological modulation, this article examined (a) willed determination, (b) distraction, (c) placebo, (d) hypnosis, (e) meditation, (f) qi-gong, (g) belief, and (h) emotions, respectively, in the brain function for pain modulation. In each, the operational definition, cortical processing, neuroimaging, and pain modulation were systematically deliberated. However, not all studies had featured the brain modulation processing but rather demonstrated potential effects on human pain. In our own studies on the emotional modulation on human pain, we observed that emotions could be induced from music melodies or pictures perception for reduction of tonic human pain, mainly in potentiation of the posterior alpha EEG fields, likely resulted from underneath activities of precuneous in regulation of consciousness, including pain perception. To sum, higher brain functions become the leading edge research in all sciences. How to solve the information bit of thinking and feeling in the brain can be the greatest challenge of human intelligence. Application of higher cortical modulation of human pain and suffering can lead to the progress of social humanity and civilization.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common causes of dementia and movement disorders in the elderly. While progressive accumulation of oligomeric amyloid-beta protein (A beta) has been identified as one of the central toxic events in AD leading to synaptic dysfunction, accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) resulting in the formation of oligomers has been linked to PD. Most of the studies in AD have been focused on investigating the role of A beta and Tau; however, recent studies suggest that alpha-syn might also play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. For example, fragments of alpha-syn can associate with amyloid plaques and A beta promotes the aggregation of alpha-syn in vivo and worsens the deficits in alpha-syn tg mice. Moreover, alpha-syn has also been shown to accumulate in limbic regions in AD, Down's syndrome, and familial AD cases. A beta and alpha-syn might directly interact under pathological conditions leading to the formation of toxic oligomers and nanopores that increase intracellular calcium. The interactions between A beta and alpha-syn might also result in oxidative stress, lysosomal leakage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, better understanding the steps involved in the process of A beta and alpha-syn aggregation is important in order to develop intervention strategies that might prevent or reverse the accumulation of toxic proteins in AD.

AB  - Introduction Nanotechnologies are among the fastest growing areas of scientific research and have important applications in a wide variety of fields. The data suggest that in the future workers and consumers exposed to nanoparticles will significantly increase.
   Dermal absorption and toxicity of nanoparticles At now there are gaps in understanding about the human and environmental risk that manufactured nanoparticles pose for occupational exposed people and for consumers. There is a need for assessing the health and environmental impacts, the nanoparticles life cycle, the human exposure routes, the behavior of nanoparticles in the body, and the risk for workers. Possible routes of entry into the body include inhalation, absorption through the skin or digestive tract, injection, and absorption or implantation for drugs delivery systems. In particular, dermal absorption and skin penetration of nanoparticles needs a better evaluation because few and contradictory data are present in the literature, mainly on titanium dioxide.
   Conclusions There are limited data on carbon-based nanoparticles and very few data on other metal nanoparticles increasingly used in industry. The article reviews the literature on the percutaneous absorption of nanoparticles and their effect on skin.

AB  - Background The notion that chronic stress contributes to health inequalities by socio-economic status (SES) through physiological wear and tear has received widespread attention. This article reviews the literature testing associations between SES and cortisol, an important biomarker of stress, as well as the summary index of allostatic load (AL).
   Methods A search of all published literature on the PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge literature search engines was conducted using broad search terms. The authors reviewed abstracts and selected articles that met the inclusion criteria. A total of 26 published studies were included in the review.
   Results Overall, SES was not consistently related to cortisol. Although several studies found an association between lower SES and higher levels of cortisol, many found no association, with some finding the opposite relationship. Lower SES was more consistently related to a blunted pattern of diurnal cortisol secretion, but whether this corresponded to higher or lower overall cortisol exposure varied by study. Approaches to collecting and analysing cortisol varied widely, likely contributing to inconsistent results. Lower SES was more consistently related to higher levels of AL, but primarily via the cardiovascular and metabolic components of AL rather than the neuroendocrine markers.
   Conclusions Current empirical evidence linking SES to cortisol and AL is weak. Future work should standardize approaches to measuring SES, chronic stress and cortisol to better understand these relationships.

AB  - Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is a potential mechanism connecting psychosocial stress to functional somatic disorders (FSD), such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome. We present the first meta-analysis and systematic review of methodological study quality on the association between cardiac ANS dysfunction, measured as parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity using heart rate variability (HRV), and FSD. Literature search revealed 23 available studies including data on 533 FSD patients. Meta-analysis on a subgroup of 14 studies with suitable outcome measures indicated lower PNS activity in FSD patients compared to controls (weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.32, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.01, p = 0.04). The reliability of this summary estimate was, however, significantly limited by unexplained heterogeneity in the effect sizes and potential publication bias (weighted SMD after correction for funnel plot asymmetry = 0.01, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.36, p = 0.95). The systematic review of overall methodological quality of HRV studies in FSD demonstrates that there is substantial room for improvement, especially in selection of healthy control subjects, blinding of researchers performing HRV measurements, report of adequate HRV outcomes, and assessment of and adjustment for potential confounders. Methodological study quality was, however, not a significant predictor of study findings. We conclude that current available evidence is not adequate to firmly reject or accept a role of ANS dysfunction in FSD. Quality criteria and recommendations to improve future research on HRV in FSD are provided. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: A proportion of people with mental health problems require longer term care in a psychiatric or social care institution. However, there are no internationally agreed quality standards for institutional care and no method to assess common care standards across countries. We aimed to identify the key components of institutional care for people with longer term mental health problems and the effectiveness of these components.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review of the literature using comprehensive search terms in 11 electronic databases and identified 12,182 titles. We viewed 550 abstracts, reviewed 223 papers and included 110 of these. A "critical interpretative synthesis" of the evidence was used to identify domains of institutional care that are key to service users' recovery.
   Results: We identified eight domains of institutional care that were key to service users' recovery: living conditions; interventions for schizophrenia; physical health; restraint and seclusion; staff training and support; therapeutic relationship; autonomy and service user involvement; and clinical governance. Evidence was strongest for specific interventions for the treatment of schizophrenia (family psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and vocational rehabilitation).
   Conclusion: Institutions should, ideally, be community based, operate a flexible regime, maintain a low density of residents and maximise residents' privacy. For service users with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, specific interventions (CBT, family interventions involving psychoeducation, and supported employment) should be provided through integrated programmes. Restraint and seclusion should be avoided wherever possible and staff should have adequate training in de-escalation techniques. Regular staff supervision should be provided and this should support service user involvement in decision making and positive therapeutic relationships between staff and service users. There should be clear lines of clinical governance that ensure adherence to evidence-based guidelines and attention should be paid to service users' physical health through regular screening.

AB  - Air pollution has been implicated as a chronic source of neuroinflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that produce neuropathology and central nervous system (CNS) disease. Stroke incidence and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease pathology are linked to air pollution. Recent reports reveal that air pollution components reach the brain; systemic effects that impact lung and cardiovascular disease also impinge upon CNS health. While mechanisms driving air pollution-induced CNS pathology are poorly understood, new evidence suggests that microglial activation and changes in the blood-brain barrier are key components. Here we summarize recent findings detailing the mechanisms through which air pollution reaches the brain and activates the resident innate immune response to become a chronic source of pro-inflammatory factors and ROS, culminating in CNS disease.

AB  - In The Psychology of Genocide, Steven Baum adds a new voice to the field of genocide studies. By connecting relevant psychological theories, Baum is able to effectively show that one's level of emotional and moral development plays a part in determining whether one will become a bystander, perpetrator or rescuer during a genocide. However, his look into hate and genocide lacks a complete psychological perspective because his sole emphasis is on developmental theories. By adding a sociocultural perspective to this approach, specifically through the addition of social identity and representation research, one can get a fuller picture of what leads a society and its people to genocide and hate.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder. Extrapyramidal motor symptoms stem from the degeneration of the dopaminergic pathways in patient brain. Current treatments for PD are symptomatic, alleviating disease symptoms without reversing or retarding disease progression. Although the cause of PD remains unknown, several pathogenic factors have been identified, which cause dopaminergic neuron (DN) death in the substantia nigra (SN). These include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and excitotoxicity. Manipulation of these factors may allow the development of disease-modifying treatment strategies to slow neuronal death. Inhibition of DJ-1A, the Drosophila homologue of the familial PD gene DJ-1, leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DN loss, making fly DJ-1A model an excellent in vivo system to test for compounds with therapeutic potential.
   Results: In the present study, a Drosophila DJ-1A model of PD was used to test potential neuroprotective drugs. The drugs applied are the Chinese herb celastrol, the antibiotic minocycline, the bioenergetic amine coenzyme Q10 (coQ10), and the glutamate antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]-quinoxaline (NBQX). All of these drugs target pathogenic processes implicated in PD, thus constitute mechanism-based treatment strategies. We show that celastrol and minocycline, both having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, confer potent dopaminergic neuroprotection in Drosophila DJ-1A model, while coQ10 shows no protective effect. NBQX exerts differential effects on cell survival and brain dopamine content: it protects against DN loss but fails to restore brain dopamine level.
   Conclusion: The present study further validates Drosophila as a valuable model for preclinical testing of drugs with therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases. The lower cost and amenability to high throughput testing make Drosophila PD models effective in vivo tools for screening novel therapeutic compounds. If our findings can be further validated in mammalian PD models, they would implicate drugs combining antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as strong therapeutic candidates for mechanism-based PD treatment.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be capable of providing significant benefits for several neuropathologies. It is highly effective in reducing the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, and in alleviating chronic pain. Recently, also Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder and treatment-resistant depression have been treated by DES with encouraging results. However, despite these clinical achievements, the precise action mechanisms of DBS still need to be fully characterized. For this reason, several animal models of DBS have been developed, bringing new insights on the effects of this treatment at molecular and cellular level, and providing new evidence on its physiological and behavioral consequences. In parallel, physiological and imaging Studies in patients have contributed to better understanding DBS impact on the function of brain circuits. Here we review the clinical data and experimental work in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo (mostly arisen from studies on DBS of the subthalamic nucleus) in the treatment of PD, which led to the actual knowledge of DBS mechanisms, from molecular to complex behavioral levels.

AB  - Artificial neural networks as a major soft-computing technology have been extensively studied and applied during the last three decades. Research on backpropagation training algorithms for multilayer perceptron networks has spurred development of other neural network training algorithms for other networks such as radial basis function, recurrent network, feedback network, and unsupervised Kohonen self-organizing network. These networks, especially the multilayer perceptron network with a backpropagation training algorithm, have gained recognition in research and applications in various scientific and engineering areas. In order to accelerate the training process and overcome data over-fitting, research has been conducted to improve the backpropagation algorithm. Further, artificial neural networks have been integrated with other advanced methods such as fuzzy logic and wavelet analysis, to enhance the ability of data interpretation and modeling and to avoid subjectivity in the operation of the training algorithm. In recent years, support vector machines have emerged as a set of high-performance supervised generalized linear classifiers in parallel with artificial neural networks. A review on development history of artificial neural networks is presented and the standard architectures and algorithms of artificial neural networks are described. Furthermore, advanced artificial neural networks will be introduced with support vector machines, and limitations of ANNs will be identified. The future of artificial neural network development in tandem with support vector machines will be discussed in conjunction with further applications to food science and engineering, soil and water relationship for crop management, and decision support for precision agriculture. Along with the network structures and training algorithms, the applications of artificial neural networks will be reviewed as well, especially in the fields of agricultural and biological engineering.

AB  - Objective: The authors sought to determine by meta-analysis the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive atypical antipsychotic agents in major depressive disorder.
   Method: Searches were conducted of MEDLINE/PubMed ( 1966 to January 2009), the Cochrane database, abstracts of major psychiatric meetings since 2000, and online trial registries. Manufacturers of atypical antipsychotic agents without online registries were contacted. Trials selected were acute-phase, parallel-group, double-blind controlled trials with random assignment to adjunctive atypical antipsychotic or placebo. Patients had nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder that was resistant to prior antidepressant treatment. Response, remission, and discontinuation rates were either reported or obtained. Data were extracted by one author and checked by the second. Data included study design, number of patients, patient characteristics, methods of establishing treatment resistance, drug doses, duration of the adjunctive trial, depression scale used, response and remission rates, and discontinuation rates for any reason or for adverse events.
   Results: Sixteen trials with 3,480 patients were pooled using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Adjunctive atypical antipsychotics were significantly more effective than placebo ( response: odds ratio=1.69, 95% CI=1.46-1.95, z=7.00, N=16, p<0.00001; remission: odds ratio=2.00, 95% CI=1.69-2.37, z=8.03, N=16, p<0.00001). Mean odds ratios did not differ among the atypical agents and were not affected by trial duration or method of establishing treatment resistance. Discontinuation rates for adverse events were higher for atypical agents than for placebo ( odds ratio=3.91, 95% CI=2.68-5.72, z=7.05, N=15, p<0.00001).
   Conclusions: Atypical antipsychotics are effective augmentation agents in major depressive disorder but are associated with an increased risk of discontinuation due to adverse events.

AB  - Objective:
   To provide a systematic review of studies investigating respiration in PD and comments on relative inconsistencies.
   Method:
   A Medline search of controlled studies focusing on pCO(2), respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute volume in PD patients was conducted for baseline/resting condition, challenge, and recovery phase. Respiratory variability and comparisons between panickers and non-panickers were also examined.
   Results:
   Lower pCO(2) levels in PD subjects are a consistent finding during the baseline/resting condition, the challenge, and recovery phases. Tidal volume and minute volume are increased in PD subjects relative to controls during the baseline/resting condition. However, the most robust finding is a higher than normal respiratory variability, which appears to be a promising factor for the identification of respiratory etiopathological pathways in PD.
   Conclusion:
   Respiratory variability might be a candidate for a biological marker of PD: an abnormal breathing pattern as found in panic disorder (PD) patients compared with controls might indicate instability of the respiratory homeostasis.

AB  - Objective: Early neurodevelopment disabilities ( END) such as cerebral palsy (CP), deafness, blindness, epilepsy, and mental retardation (MR) are very important public health concerns. Although no strong data on END can be obtained in Mexico, the few papers concerning END epidemiology deserve systematic and critical review. Thus, this was the objective of the present paper. Method: We performed a systematic review of papers published reporting on the prevalence of END in Mexico. We performed a search in several medical data bases such as PubMed, Artemisa, ImBioMed, and LiLaCS. Each paper was downloaded, read and discussed. We only selected papers published between 1999 and 2008. Results: No data on CP and epilepsy prevalence in infants have been found. Data on deafness prevalence report hearing loss in 0.65/1,000 healthy newborns, and in 2.6/100 in high-risk very premature infants. With regard to blindness, prevalence of retinopathy of premature infants in any stage was reported at ca 10.61 and 22.2/100 in high-risk premature infants. Congenital hypothyroidism ( CH) prevalence in infants was found in 4.2/10,000 live newborns after a national universal screening survey. Conclusion: No universal data regarding the prevalence of END in Mexico have been investigated, with the exception of CH. Mexico needs more research to determine epidemiologic data focused on designing actions to prevent, treat, and rehabilitate END.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has unparalleled antidepressant efficacy, but its cognitive side effects may be persistent. Research suggests that the side effects may be at least partially dissociable from the therapeutic effects of ECT, suggesting that distinct cortical networks may underlie them and introducing a role for focal seizure induction as a means of minimizing side effects. in magnetic seizure therapy (MST), magnetic fields avoid tissue impedance and induce electrical currents confined to superficial cortex, facilitating focal seizure induction. The translational development strategy for MST has included: (1) device development, (2) feasibility in animals and initial human trials, (3) testing in nonhuman primates on safety and mechanisms of action (with neuroanatomical, neurophysiological and cognitive endpoints), (4) safety testing in patients, (5) initial efficacy testing in patients, (6) dosage optimization, and (7) randomized comparison with ECT. These stages have been iterative, with results of early clinical testing prompting device enhancements that were, in turn, tested in nonhuman primates prior to human trials. Safety testing was aided by development of a nonhuman primate model of human ECT, and the validation of a cognitive battery for the monkey that is sensitive to the range of effects of ECT on human memory. Human testing has been facilitated by the development of an international consortium of centers addressing various aspects of technique and dose/response relationships. Challenges facing MST are common to other device-based therapies: characterizing dose/response relationships, optimizing efficacy, and developing efficient and reliable methods to induce lasting therapeutic change in the circuitry underlying depression.

AB  - Cancer and degenerative diseases are major causes of morbidity and death, derived from the permanent modification of key biopolymers such as DNA and regulatory proteins by usually smaller, reactive molecules, present tit the environment or generated from endogenous and xenobiotic components by the body's own biochemical mechanisms (molecular adducts). In particular, protein adducts with organic electrophiles have been studied for more than 30 [see, e.g., Calleman et al., 1978] years essentially for three purposes: (a) as passive monitors of the metal level of individual exposure to specific chemicals, either endogenously present tit the human body or to which the subject is exposed through food or environmental contamination; (b) as quantitative indicators of the mean extent of the individual metabolic processing which converts a non-reactive chemical substance into its toxic products able to damage DNA (en route to cancer induction through genotoxic mechanisms) or key proteins (as tit the case of several drugs, pesticides or otherwise biologically active substances): (c) to relate the extent of protein modification to that of biological function impairment (such as enzyme inhibition) finally causing the specific health damage. This review describes the role that contemporary mass spectometry-based approaches employed in the qualitative and quantitative study of protein-electrophile adducts play in the discovery of the (bio)chemical mechanisms of toxic substances and highlights the future directions of research in this field. A particular emphasis is given to the measurement of often high levels of the protein adducts of several industrial mid environmental pollutants in unexposed human populations, a phenomenon which highlights the possibility that a number of small organic molecules are generated tit the human organism through minor metabolic processes. the imbalance of which may be the cause of "spontaneous" cases of cancer and of other degenerative diseases of still uncharacterized etiology. With all this in mind, it is foreseen that a holistic description of cellular functions will take advantage of new analytical methods based on time-integrated metabolomic measurements of a new biological compartment, the "adductoem," aimed at better understanding integrated organism response to environmental and endogenous stressors.

AB  - Objective: The current review aims to synthesize existing knowledge about the relationship between psychological stress and wound healing. Methods: A systematic search strategy was conducted using electronic databases to search for published articles up to the end of October 2007. The reference lists of retrieved articles were inspected for further studies and citation searches were conducted. In addition, a meta-analysis of a subset of studies was conducted to provide a quantitative estimation of the influence of stress on wound healing. Results: Twenty-two papers met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review and a subsample of 11 was included in a meta-analysis. The studies assessed the impact of stress on the healing of a variety of wound types in different contexts, including acute and chronic clinical wounds, experimentally created punch biopsy and blister wounds, and minor damage to the skin caused by tape stripping. Seventeen studies in the systematic review reported that stress was associated with impaired healing or dysregulation of a biomarker related to wound healing. The relationship between stress and wound healing estimated by the meta-analysis was r=-0.42 (95% CI=-0.51 to -0.32) (P<01). Conclusion: Attention now needs to be directed towards investigating potential moderators of the relationship, mediating mechanisms underpinning the association, as well as the demonstration of a causal link by the development of experimental interventions in healthy populations.

AB  - Inflation is today a part of the Standard Model of the Universe supported by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) datasets. Inflation solves the horizon and flatness problems and naturally generates density fluctuations that seed LSS and CMB anisotropies, and tensor perturbations (primordial gravitational waves). Inflation theory is based on a scalar field phi (the inflaton) whose potential is fairly. at, leading to a slow-roll evolution. This review focuses on the following new aspects of inflation. We present the effective theory of inflation a la Ginsburg and Landau, in which the inflaton potential is a polynomial in the field phi and has the universal form V (phi) = NM(4)w(phi/[root NMP1]), where w = O(1), M << M-P1 is the scale of inflation and N similar to 60 is the number of e-folds since the cosmologically relevant modes exit the horizon till inflation ends. The slow-roll expansion becomes a systematic 1/N expansion and the inflaton couplings become naturally small as powers of the ratio (M/M-P1)(2). The spectral index and the ratio of tensor/scalar fluctuations are n(s) - 1 = O(1/N), r = O(1/N), while the running index turns out to be dn(s)/d ln k = O(1/N-2) and therefore can be neglected. The energy scale of inflation M similar to 0.7 x 10(16) GeV is completely determined by the amplitude of the scalar adiabatic fluctuations. A complete analytic study plus the Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analysis of the available CMB+LSS data (including WMAP5) with fourth degree trinomial potentials showed: (a) the spontaneous breaking of the phi -> -phi symmetry of the inflaton potential; (b) a lower bound for r in new inflation: r > 0.023 (95% CL) and r > 0.046 (68 CL); (c) the preferred inflation potential is a double-well, even function of the field with a moderate quartic coupling yielding as the most probable values n(s) similar or equal to 0.964, r similar or equal to 0.051. This value for r is within reach of forthcoming CMB observations. The present data in the effective theory of inflation clearly prefer new inflation. Study of higher degree inflaton potentials shows that terms of degree higher than 4 do not affect the fit in a significant way. In addition, a horizon exit happens for phi/[root N M-P1] similar to 0.9, making higher order terms in the potential w negligible. We summarize the physical effects of generic initial conditions (different from Bunch-Davies) on the scalar and tensor perturbations during slow roll and introduce the transfer function D(k), which encodes the observable initial condition effects on the power spectra. These effects are more prominent in the low CMB multipoles: a change in the initial conditions during slow roll can account for the observed CMB quadrupole suppression. Slow-roll inflation is generically preceded by a short, fast-roll stage. Bunch-Davies initial conditions are the natural initial conditions for the fast-roll perturbations. During fast roll, the potential in the wave equations of curvature and tensor perturbations is purely attractive and leads to a suppression of the curvature and tensor CMB quadrupoles. An MCMC analysis of the WMAP+SDSS data including fast roll shows that the quadrupole mode exits the horizon about 0.2 e-fold before fast roll ends and its amplitude gets suppressed. In addition, fast roll fixes the initial inflation redshift to be z(init) = 0.
   9 x 10(56) and the total number of e-folds of inflation to be N-tot &SIME 64. Fast roll fits the TT, the TE and the EE modes well, reproducing the quadrupole suppression. A thorough study of the quantum loop corrections reveals that they are very small and are controlled by powers of (H/M-P1)(2) similar to 10(-9), a conclusion that validates the reliability of the effective theory of inflation. The present review shows how powerful the Ginsburg-Landau effective theory of inflation is in predicting observables that are being or will soon be contrasted with observations.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review to determine the safety and efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids for autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Articles were identified by a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database using the terms autism or autistic and omega-3 fatty acids. The search identified 143 potential articles and six satisfied all inclusion criteria. One small randomized controlled trial (n = 13) noted non-significant improvements in hyperactivity and stereotypy. The remaining five studies were small (n = 30, 22, 19, 9, and 1) with four reporting improvements in a wide range of outcomes including language and learning skills, parental observations of general health and behavior, a clinician-administered symptom scale, and clinical observations of anxiety. Due to the limitations of evidence from uncontrolled studies and the presence of only one small randomized controlled trial, there is currently insufficient scientific evidence to determine if omega-3 fatty acids are safe or effective for ASD.

AB  - Antarctic fellfields present organisms with a heterogeneous habitat characterised by a wide variety of environmental stresses. These include low temperatures, limited moisture availability, frequent and often rapid freeze-thaw and hydration-dehydration cycles, exposure to high photosynthetic photon flux density and ultraviolet (uv) irradiance, seasonal snow cover, high winds, cryoturbation and, depending on location south of the Antarctic Circle, considerable daylight in summer. Most of these factors vary both predictably and unpredictably in spatial and temporal planes. In response to this adverse environment, fellfield organisms have developed a variety of strategies to overcome physiological stress and to exploit the limited resources available during the short austral growing season. A high degree of synchronisation exists, so that investment in non-essential activity and adaptations is minimised.
   Here, we review the combined suites of co-adapted traits used by different fellfield taxa to achieve energy acquisition, growth and reproduction under adverse levels of two principal limiting factors: low temperatures and the scarcity of water. To this end, a detailed characterisation of the Antarctic fellfield microenvironment is followed by a synthesis of available data on the morphology, physiology, life history and behaviour of successful Antarctic flora and fauna. Tolerance of low temperatures by fellfield organisms is achieved by elevation of standard metabolism, production and accumulation of cryoprotectants, supercooling, melanic pigmentation, behavioural avoidance, compact growth forms and synchronised reproduction and extended life cycles. Low moisture conditions are overcome by dehydration resistance, anhydrobiosis, development of resting stages and by behavioural avoidance of desiccating conditions.
   Occupancy of the Antarctic fellfield habitat is considered to require the ability to respond rapidly to ephemeral resources and to tolerate severe environmental stresses. During summer, organisms rely on opportunism to maintain a positive energy balance. During winter, resistance adaptations are used to withstand the potentially lethal climate, especially in habitats not protected by snow cover. This deterministic framework has led to the selection of species that are genetically and physiologically pre-adapted for resource acquisition yet sufficiently robust to withstand cold and desiccation stresses. Non-adapted taxa fail to become established. Despite the environmental selection pressures, available evidence suggests that colonisation of the fellfield habitat has not required the evolution of any adaptations, only the refinement of those already possessed to an extent by some temperate forms. This has led to the convergence of survival strategies. It is hypothesised that, in the short term, the majority of Antarctic fellfield biota are able to absorb the predicted effects of a changing climate by their high levels of physiological tolerance and life-cycle flexibility.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD), the most frequent movement disorder, is Caused by the progressive loss of the dopamine neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the associated deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum. Most cases of PD Occur sporadically With unknown Cause, hot Mutations in several genes have been linked to genetic forms of PD (alpha-synuclein, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, and LRRK2). These genes have provided exciting new avenues to study PD pathogenesis and the mechanisms underlying the selective dopaminergic neuron death in PD. Epidemiological studies in humans, as well as molecular studies in toxin-induced and genetic animal models of PD show that mitochondrial dysfunction is a defect Occurring early in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial PD. Mitochondrial dynamics (fission, fusion, migration) is important for neurotransmission, synaptic maintenance and neuronal survival. Recent studies have shown that PINK1 and Parkin play crucial roles in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and function. Mutations in DJ-1 and Parkin render animals more susceptible to oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxins implicated in sporadic PD, lending support to the hypothesis that some PD cases may be caused by gene-environmental factor interactions. A small proportion of alpha-synuclein is imported into mitochondria, where it accumulates in the brains of PD patients and may impair respiratory complex 1 activity. Accumulation of clonal, somatic mitochondrial DNA deletions has been observed in the substantia nigra during aging and in PD, suggesting that mitochondrial DNA mutations in some instances may predispose to dopamine neuron death by impairing respiration. Besides compromising cellular energy production, mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with the generation of oxidative stress, and dysfunctional mitochondria more readily mediate the induction of apoptosis, especially in the face of cellular stress. Collectively, the Studies examined and summarized here reveal an important causal role for mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathogenesis, and suggest that drugs and genetic approaches with the ability to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, function and biogenesis may have important clinical applications in the future treatment of PD.

   Our aim was to present recent studies of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in patients with schizophrenia, estimate overall prevalence and characteristics affecting the prevalence of AUDs.
   Method:
   We conducted a search using three literature databases and a manual search on articles published in 1996-2008. Meta-regression was used to study how prevalence is affected by different study characteristics. Articles that reported diagnoses according to DSM or ICD diagnostic systems were included.
   Results:
   Altogether 60 studies met our criteria. The median of current AUD prevalence was 9.4% (inter-quartile range, IQR 4.6-19.0, 18 studies) and median of lifetime AUD prevalence 20.6% (IQR 12.0-34.5, 47 studies). In studies using DSM-III-R median prevalence was higher than that in studies using DSM-IV, ICD-9 or ICD-10 (32/17/11/6%).
   Conclusion:
   Approximately every fifth patient with schizophrenia had lifetime AUD diagnosis. When contrasted with the most recent review, there might be a descending trend in AUD prevalence in patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - Many health problems are related to lifestyle and dietary factors. Increasing trend in reproductive disorders observed in recent years may be associated at least in part with these factors, which are compounded by some of the new emergent life styles. The data available suggests that lifestyle factors such as obesity, tobacco smoking or chewing, alcohol and some of the illicit drugs like cocaine, cannabis etc and exposure to extreme heat, have adverse effects on male reproduction. The data on other factors such as use of mobile phone and stress on reproductive health are inadequate and need detailed study. Lifestyle related diseases could be lowered with modification in diet, living and working environment etc. Sub-fertile and/or normal subjects have some control over their reproductive function by adopting healthy lifestyles to avoid additional complications.

   Reducing use of hospital wards and improving their quality are central aims of mental health service policy. However, no comprehensive synthesis is available of evidence on residential alternatives to standard acute psychiatric wards.
   Aims
   To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of and satisfaction with residential alternatives to standard acute in-patient mental health services.
   Method
   A systematic search identified controlled studies comparing residential alternatives with standard in-patient services. Studies were described and assessed for methodological quality. Results from higher quality studies are presented and discussed.
   Results
   Twenty-seven relevant studies were identified. Nine studies of moderate quality provide no contraindication to identified alternative service models and limited preliminary evidence that community-based alternatives may be cheaper and individuals more satisfied than in standard acute wards.
   Conclusions
   More research is needed to establish the effectiveness of service models and target populations for residential alternatives to standard acute wards. Community-based residential crisis services may provide a feasible and acceptable alternative to hospital admission for some people with acute mental illness.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the eponym attached to the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorder of adults, derived from observations of an early nineteenth century physician and paleontologist, James Parkinson, and is now recognized to encompass much more than a movement disorder clinically or dopamine neuron death pathologically. Most PD (similar to 90%) is sporadic (sPD), is associated with mitochondrial deficiencies and has been studied in cell and animal models arising from the use of mitochondrial toxins that unfortunately have not predicted clinical efficacy to slow disease progression in humans. We have extensively studied the cytoplasmic hybrid ("cybrid") model of sPD in which donor mtDNAs are introduced into and expressed in neural tumor cells with identical nuclear genetic and environmental backgrounds. sPD cybrids demonstrate many abnormalities in which increased oxidative stress drives downstream antioxidant response and cell death activating signaling pathways. sPD cybrids regulate mitochondrial ETC genes and gene ontology families like sPD brain. sPD cybrids spontaneously form Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, linking mtDNA expression to neuropathology, and demonstrate impaired organelle transport in processes and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Our recent studies show that near-infrared laser light therapy normalizes mitochondrial movement and can Stimulate respiration in sPD cybrid neurons, and mitochondrial gene therapy can restore respiration and Stimulate mitochondrial ETC gene and protein expression. sPD cybrids have provided multiple lines of circumstantial evidence linking mtDNA to sPD pathogenesis and call serve as platforms for therapy development. sPD cybrid models can be improved by the use of non-tumor human stein cell-derived neural precursor cells and by an introduction of postmortem brain mtDNA to test its causality directly.

AB  - The Unique energy demands of neurons require well-orchestrated distribution and maintenance of mitochondria. Thus, dynamic properties of mitochondria, including fission, fusion, trafficking,, biogenesis, and degradation, are critical to all cells, but may be particularly important in neurons. Dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to neuropathies and is increasingly being linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, but the evidence is particularly strong, and continuously accumulating, in Parkinson's disease (PD). The unique characteristics of neurons that degenerate in PD may predispose those neuronal populations to susceptibility to alterations in mitochondrial dynamics. In addition, evidence from PD-related toxins supports that mitochondrial fission, fusion, and transport may be involved in pathogenesis. Furthermore, rapidly increasing evidence suggests that two proteins linked to familial forms of the disease, parkin and PINK1, interact in a common pathway to regulate mitochondrial fission/fusion. Parkin may also play a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through targeting damaged mitochondria for mitophagy. Taken together, the current data Suggests that mitochondrial dynamics may play a role in PD pathogenesis, and a better understanding of mitochondrial dynamics within the neuron may lead to future therapeutic treatments for PD, potentially aimed at some of the earliest pathogenic events.

AB  - How long did it take you to read this sentence? Chances are your response is a ball park estimate and its value depends on how fast you have scanned the text, how prepared you have been for this question, perhaps your mood or how much attention you have paid to these words. Time perception is here addressed in three sections. The first section summarizes theoretical difficulties in time perception research, specifically those pertaining to the representation of time and temporal processing. The second section reviews non-exhaustively temporal effects in multisensory perception. Sensory modalities interact in temporal judgement tasks, suggesting that (i) at some level of sensory analysis, the temporal properties across senses can be integrated in building a time percept and (ii) the representational format across senses is compatible for establishing such a percept. In the last section, a two-step analysis of temporal properties is sketched out. In the first step, it is proposed that temporal properties are automatically encoded at early stages of sensory analysis, thus providing the raw material for the building of a time percept; in the second step, time representations become available to perception through attentional gating of the raw temporal representations and via re-encoding into abstract representations.

AB  - The striking diversity of psychological and neurophysiological models of 'time perception' characterizes the debate on how and where in the brain time is processed. In this review, the most prominent models of time perception will be critically discussed. Some of the variation across the proposed models will be explained, namely (i) different processes and regions of the brain are involved depending on the length of the processed time interval, and (ii) different cognitive processes may be involved that are not necessarily part of a core timekeeping system but, nevertheless, influence the experience of time. These cognitive processes are distributed over the brain and are difficult to discern from timing mechanisms. Recent developments in the research on emotional influences on time perception, which succeed decades of studies on the cognition of temporal processing, will be highlighted. Empirical findings on the relationship between affect and time, together with recent conceptualizations of self- and body processes, are integrated by viewing time perception as entailing emotional and interoceptive (within the body) states. To date, specific neurophysiological mechanisms that would account for the representation of human time have not been identified. It will be argued that neural processes in the insular cortex that are related to body signals and feeling states might constitute such a neurophysiological mechanism for the encoding of duration.

AB  - In the 15 years since the publication Of two previous reviews oil restraint stress much advancement has been made in the field. However, while previous reviews have focused mainly oil drug effects, recent research has focused on broader implications in the health fields. This research has placed an increased emphasis on stress effects in physiological, immunological, endocrine and developmental processes as well as the impact of stress on numerous disorders. A major problem With Our review was the inability to identify a large number of articles focusing on restraint and immobilization, since those keywords were often omitted from the title or not referred to within the body of the article. It seems likely that additional reviews with extended literature research of this field are required. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To review systematically studies examining the association between sedentary lifestyle and low back pain (LBP) using a comprehensive definition of sedentary behaviour including prolonged sitting both at work and during leisure time.
   Journal articles published between 1998 and 2006 were obtained by searching computerized bibliographical databases. Quality assessment of studies employing a cohort or case-control design was performed to assess the strength of the evidence.
   Using pre-determined keywords, we identified 1,778 titles of which 1,391 were considered irrelevant. Then, 20 of the remaining 387 publications were scrutinized for full review after an examination of all the 387 abstracts. Finally, 15 studies (10 prospective cohorts and 5 case-controls) were included in the methodological quality assessment, of which 8 (6 cohorts and 2 case-controls; 53%) were classified as high-quality studies. One high-quality cohort study reported a positive association, between LBP and sitting at work only; all other studies reported no significant associations. Hence, there was limited evidence to demonstrate that sedentary behaviour is a risk factor for developing LBP.
   The present review confirms that sedentary lifestyle by itself is not associated with LBP.

AB  - A meta-analysis assessed whether exposure to information is guided by defense or accuracy motives. The studies examined information preferences in relation to attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors in situations that provided choices between congenial information, which supported participants' pre-existing attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors, and uncongenial information, which challenged these tendencies. Analyses indicated a moderate preference for congenial over uncongenial information (d = 0.36). As predicted, this congeniality bias was moderated by variables that affect the strength of participants' defense motivation and accuracy motivation. In support of the importance of defense motivation, the congeniality bias was weaker when participants' attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were supported prior to information selection; when participants' attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were not relevant to their values or not held with conviction; when the available information was low in quality; when participants' closed-mindedness was low: and when their confidence in the attitude, belief, or behavior was high. In support of the importance of accuracy motivation, an uncongeniality bias emerged when uncongenial information was relevant to accomplishing a current goal.

   Feedback of treatment outcome during the course of therapy (outcome management) is increasingly considered to be beneficial for improving the quality of mental healthcare.
   Aims
   To review the impact of feedback of outcome to practitioners and/or patients in specialist mental health services.
   Method
   A systematic search and meta-analysis of controlled trials using outcome management in mental health services published in English or German language.
   Results
   Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. Feeding back outcome showed a small, but significant (d=0.10; 95% CI 0.01-0.19) positive short-term effect on the mental health of individuals that did not prevail in the long run. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences regarding feedback modalities. outcome management did not contribute to a reduction of treatment duration.
   Conclusions
   Evidence on the effects of outcome management in mental healthcare is promising. more targeted research is needed in order to identify the effective ingredients of outcome feedback and to assess its cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Objective. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and can potentially be exacerbated by interferon-alpha treatment. Such symptoms can contribute to problems with treatment adherence, which can significantly compromise epidemiological virus control. This review summarizes current knowledge about the etiology, course, and management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with CHC. Method. Studies were identified using computerized searches, with further references obtained from the bibliographies of the reviewed articles. Results. Psychopathological syndromes that occur during interferon-alpha treatment frequently have atypical features that may complicate their recognition using standard diagnostic criteria. In addition, prospective studies in this area often exclude patients with psychiatric disorders and have methodological disparities that make it difficult to develop guidelines for management of psychiatric side effects induced by interferon-alpha. Despite the high prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with psychiatric and substance use disorders, neuropsychiatric concerns often lead to the exclusion of such patients from interferon-alpha treatment, inappropriately depriving them of the potential benefits of this therapy. Conclusion. Consultation-liaison psychiatrists should become familiar with the clinical spectrum of presentations associated with HCV infection as well as with related neuropsychiatric symptoms in order to promote the creation of multidisciplinary teams who specialize in the care of patients with HCV infections. More studies are needed to define neuropsychiatric syndromes that can be induced by interferon-alpha and to clarify best assessment and treatment procedures for these syndromes. It is also important to create and evaluate psychoeducational programs for all patients with chronic HCV infections, even those with low risk of complications, in order to promote adherence to therapy and optimize patients' quality of life.

AB  - Aim - To review studies conducted to establish the risk of spontaneous abortion (SA) in women exposed to antidepressant drugs (ADs) during early pregnancy. Methods - By using different search terms, PubMed, Toxline, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane library databases were searched from January 1980 to March 2008, to identify studies assessing the risk of SA in women exposed to different classes of ADs during the first trimester of pregnancy. Results - Ten studies over 21 identified were selected for the analysis. All were performed prospectively and included as control group unexposed women, or exposed to non-teratogenic drugs or to placebo. In seven studies a depressive episode was specified as the reason for which the drug was prescribed, while the time of exposure was in nine. Conclusions - Only three studies over ten selected reported a significant association between an increased rate of SAs and early pregnancy exposure to some ADs. Many methodological flaws in the study design were found in all studies considered. Given this background and a lack of strong evidence on this issue, further prospective and better designed studies are needed to assess the risk of SA in pregnant women exposed to ADs against the risk of an untreated maternal depression.

AB  - Objective: To determine and estimate the efficacy of discharge planning interventions in mental health care from in-patient to out-patient treatment on improving patient outcome, ensuring community tenure, and saving costs.
   Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis identified studies through an electronic search on the basis of defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and extracted data.
   Results: Of eleven studies included, six were randomised controlled trials, three were controlled clinical trials, and two were cohort studies. The discharge planning strategies used varied widely, most were limited to preparation of discharge during in-patient treatment. Pooled risk ratios were 0.66 (95% CI = 0.51 to 0.84; P < 0.001) for hospital readmission rate, and 1.25 (1.07 to 1.47; P < 0.001) for adherence to out-patient treatment. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were) 0.25 (-0.45 to -0.05; P = 0.02) for mental health outcome, and 0.11(-0.05 to 0.28; NS) for quality of life.
   Conclusion: Discharge planning interventions are effective in reducing rehospitalisation and in improving adherence to aftercare among people with mental disorders.

AB  - Background. Studies suggest that testosterone (TT) replacement may have an antidepressant effect in depressed patients. Objective. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of TT administration on depression using both a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis. Methodology. A search was conducted of MEDLINE, the Clinical Trials Registry, and Cochrane Central for English-language publications concerning randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving use of TT therapy in depressed patients. We searched for additional trials in the individual reference lists of the articles identified in the search. A study was judged to be relevant for inclusion in this review and meta-analysis if it reported original data from a controlled trial comparing use of TT and placebo in patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder according to DSM criteria, and the treatment response was evaluated according to changes on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). We extracted the following data from the identified studies: study source, total number of participants in the study and in each treatment group, participants' ages, number of participants with a diagnosis of hypogonadism or HIV/AIDS, study duration, type of intervention, and change in HAM-D scores in the groups receiving TT versus placebo. The meta-analysis evaluated the effect of TT replacement on response in depressed patients as measured by change in HAM-D scores in the available placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trails. Results. Seven studies (N = 364) were identified that included a placebo-control group in a double-blind design. Eligibility criteria were clearly reported in all trials. Meta-analysis of the data from these seven studies showed a significant positive effect of TT therapy on HAM-D response in depressed patients when compared with placebo (z = 4.04, p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis also showed a significant response in the subpopulations with hypogonadism (z = 3.84, p = 0.0001) and HIV/AIDS (z = 3.339 p = 0.0009) as well as in patients treated with TT gel (z = 2.32, P = 0.02). Conclusions. TT may have an antidepressant effect in depressed patients, especially those with hypogonadism or HIV/AlDS and elderly subpopulations. The route by which TT is administered may play a role in treatment response. (Journal of Psychiatric Practice 2009;15:289-305)

AB  - Functional imaging has revolutionized the neurosciences. In the pain field it has dramatically altered our understanding of how the brain undergoes significant functional, anatomical and chemical changes in patients with chronic pain. However, most studies have been performed in adults. Because functional imaging is non-invasive and can be performed in awake individuals, applications in children have become more prevalent, but only recently in the pain field. Measures of changes in the brains of children have important implications in understanding neural plasticity in response to acute and chronic pain in the developing brain. Such findings may have implications for treatments in children affected by chronic pain and provide novel insights into chronic pain syndromes in adults. In this review we summarize this potential and discuss specific concerns related to the imaging of pain in children.

AB  - While numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, the theory of oxidative stress has received considerable support. Although many correlations have been established and encouraging evidence has been obtained, conclusive proof of causation for the oxidative stress hypothesis is lacking and potential cures have not emerged. Therefore it is likely that other factors, possibly in coordination with oxidative stress, contribute to neuron death. Using Parkinson's disease (PD) as the paradigm, this review explores the hypothesis that oxidative modifications, mitochondrial functional disruption, and impairment of protein degradation constitute three interrelated molecular pathways that execute neuron death. These intertwined events are the consequence of environmental exposure, genetic factors, and endogenous risks and constitute a "Bermuda triangle" that may be considered the underlying cause of neurodegenerative pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: The prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS, also referred to as TA loci) are widespread, mobile two-gene modules that can be viewed as selfish genetic elements because they evolved mechanisms to become addictive for replicons and cells in which they reside, but also possess "normal" cellular functions in various forms of stress response and management of prokaryotic population. Several distinct TAS of type 1, where the toxin is a protein and the antitoxin is an antisense RNA, and numerous, unrelated TAS of type 2, in which both the toxin and the antitoxin are proteins, have been experimentally characterized, and it is suspected that many more remain to be identified.
   Results: We report a comprehensive comparative-genomic analysis of Type 2 toxin-antitoxin systems in prokaryotes. Using sensitive methods for distant sequence similarity search, genome context analysis and a new approach for the identification of mobile two-component systems, we identified numerous, previously unnoticed protein families that are homologous to toxins and antitoxins of known type 2 TAS. In addition, we predict 12 new families of toxins and 13 families of antitoxins, and also, predict a TAS or TAS-like activity for several gene modules that were not previously suspected to function in that capacity. In particular, we present indications that the two-gene module that encodes a minimal nucleotidyl transferase and the accompanying HEPN protein, and is extremely abundant in many archaea and bacteria, especially, thermophiles might comprise a novel TAS. We present a survey of previously known and newly predicted TAS in 750 complete genomes of archaea and bacteria, quantitatively demonstrate the exceptional mobility of the TAS, and explore the network of toxin-antitoxin pairings that combines plasticity with selectivity.
   Conclusion: The defining properties of the TAS, namely, the typically small size of the toxin and antitoxin genes, fast evolution, and extensive horizontal mobility, make the task of comprehensive identification of these systems particularly challenging. However, these same properties can be exploited to develop context-based computational approaches which, combined with exhaustive analysis of subtle sequence similarities were employed in this work to substantially expand the current collection of TAS by predicting both previously unnoticed, derived versions of known toxins and antitoxins, and putative novel TAS-like systems. In a broader context, the TAS belong to the resistome domain of the prokaryotic mobilome which includes partially selfish, addictive gene cassettes involved in various aspects of stress response and organized under the same general principles as the TAS. The "selfish altruism", or "responsible selfishness", of TAS-like systems appears to be a defining feature of the resistome and an important characteristic of the entire prokaryotic pan-genome given that in the prokaryotic world the mobilome and the "stable" chromosomes form a dynamic continuum.

AB  - Background Comorbid substance misuse in psychosis is associated with significant clinical, social and legal problems. An epidemiologically informed approach to planning service delivery requires an understanding of which clinical populations are at particularly high risk for such 'dual diagnosis'. Evidence has now been accumulating in the UK since the early 1990s, and allows a relatively comprehensive comparison of rates between service settings, geographical areas and social contexts in terms of ethnic background. Methods A literature search was carried out with the aim of investigating: (a) comorbid alcohol and drug misuse rates in people with established psychosis in different mental health and addiction settings in the UK, (b) variations in such rates between different population groups. Results There are wide variations in reported drug and alcohol misuse rates in psychosis. Most recent UK studies report rates between 20 and 37% in mental health settings, while figures in addiction settings are less clear (6-15%). Rates are generally not as high as in US studies, but appear to be especially high in inpatient and crisis team settings (38-50%) and forensic settings. In terms of geography, rates appear highest in inner city areas. Some ethnic groups are over-represented among clinical populations of people with dual diagnosis. Conclusions Rates of substance misuse in psychosis are likely to be influenced by service setting, population composition and geography. Acute and forensic settings are especially appropriate for the development of targeted interventions.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) has been considered a paradigm of degenerative diseases of the nervous system characterized by motor impairment (parkinsonism) due to malfunction and loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, PD is a systemic disease of the nervous system with variegated clinical symptoms appearing before parkinsonism and due to the involvement of selected nuclei of the medulla oblongata, pons, autonomic nervous system and olfactory structures, among others. Furthermore, recent clinical data have shown modifications in behavior, personality changes and cognitive impairment leading to dementia. Lewy pathology, hallmark of PD, in the cerebral cortex does not correlate with cognitive impairment. However, recent studies have shown abnormal mitochondria content and function, and increased oxidative stress and oxidative responses in the cerebral cortex in PD. Furthermore, several key PD-related proteins are oxidatively damaged, including alpha-synuclein, beta-synuclein, superoxide dismutases, parkin, DJ1, UCHL1 and enzymes involved in glycolysis and energy metabolism. DNA and RNA are also targets of oxidative damage. Furthermore, abnormal phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and tau occurs at the cortical synapses. Finally, abnormal cortical metabolism has been revealed with neuroimaging methods. These data demonstrate early involvement of the cerebral cortex in PD due to the convergence of multiple metabolic defects. Lewy pathology is a relative late event, geared to isolate unremoved damaged protein, with little significance on cortical neurological deficits. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mechanisms of brain ischemic insult include glutamate excitoxicity, calcium toxicity, free radicals, nitric oxide, inflammatory reactions, as well as dysfunctions of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrion. These injury cascades are interconnected in complex ways, thus it is hard to compare their pathogenic importances in ischemia models. And the research in cellular and molecular pathways has spurred the studies in potential neuroprotections mainly in pharmacological fields, such as anti-excitotoxic treatment, calcium-channel antagonism, approaches for inhibition of oxidation, inflammation and apoptosis, etc. Besides, other protective interventions including thrombolysis, arteriogenesis, regeneration therapy, and ischemia preconditioning or postconditioning, are also under investigations. Despite the present difficulties, we are quite optimistic towards future clinical applications of neuroprotective agents, by optimizing experimental approaches and clinical trials.

AB  - Objective: To present an overview of neuroimaging data on paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and discuss implications for further research.
   Method: Medline PsycINFO databases and reference lists were searched for relevant articles. All neuroimaging studies up to October 1, 2008 involving children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder were included.
   Results: Twenty-eight neuroimaging studies using various neuroimaging techniques (CT (2) MRI (15) MRS (8) and SPECT (2) fMRI (2) but no PET or DTI) including a total of 462 paediatric patients were identified. A number of findings indicate a dysfunction of the prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuit with the involvement of other basal ganglia structures (putamen globus pallidus) and the thalamus in contrast to adult studies which report mainly involvement of the caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex. Several findings point at an aberrant development of the brain in paediatric OCD, patients when compared with healthy controls.
   Conclusion: Neuroimaging studies have contributed to our understanding of the neurobiological basis of paediatric OCD. This review provides an agenda for further theory driven research in particular aimed at identifying a critical window of abnormal maturation of prefrontal-striatal-thalamic and limbic circuitry in paediatric OCD patients.

AB  - The study of neuronal specialisation in different cognitive and perceptual domains is important for our understanding of the human brain, its typical and atypical development, and the evolutionary precursors of cognition. Central to this understanding is the issue of numerical representation, and the question of whether numbers are represented in an abstract fashion. Here we discuss and challenge the claim that numerical representation is abstract. We discuss the principles of cortical organisation with special reference to number and also discuss methodological and theoretical limitations that apply to numerical cognition and also to the field of cognitive neuroscience in general. We argue that numerical representation is primarily non-abstract and is supported by different neuronal Populations residing in the parietal cortex.

AB  - Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disorder accompanying diabetes insipidus, sensorineural hearing loss, neurological complications, and psychiatric illness. This syndrome has been attributed to mutations in the WFS1 gene. In this study, we made a detailed histochemical analysis of the distribution of Wfs1 mRNA in the brain of developing mice. There were three patterns of change in the strength of Wfs1 mRNA signals from birth to early adulthood. In type 1, the signals were weak or absent in neonates but strong or moderate in young adults. This pattern was observed in the CA1 field, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. In type 2, the signals were of a relatively constant strength during development. This pattern was seen in limbic structures (e.g. subiculum and central amygdaloid nucleus) and brainstem nuclei (e.g. facial and chochlear nuclei). In type 3. the signals peaked in the second week of age. This pattern was observed in the thalamic reticular nucleus. Thus, Wfs1 mRNA was widely distributed in the normal mouse brain during postnatal development. This evidence may provide clues as to the physiological role of the Wfs1 gene in the central nervous system, and help to explain endocrinological, otological, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms in Wolfram syndrome patients.

AB  - The authors present the development of the concept of mental disease and treatment in Serbian medicine. Serbian medieval medicine did not acknowledge fortune telling, sorcery, the use of amulets and magical rituals and formulas. These progressive concepts were confirmed by the Church and the Serbian state in what is known as Du an's Code. The Historical data on the establishment of the first psychiatric hospital in the Balkans "Home for the Unsound of Mind" at Guberevac, Belgrade, in 1861 and its founders is reviewed. After World War 1, in 1923, the Faculty of Medicine was established in Belgrade to which the coryphaei of Serbian medicine educated in Europe, mostly in France and Germany, flocked and that same year the Psychiatry Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine in Belgrade was set up. Its first seat was on the premises of the Mental Hospital in Belgrade, and it became a training base and laid the foundations of the future Neuropsychiatry Clinic in Belgrade, which in time evolved into the nursery of psychiatric professionals for all of Serbia. The most important data on the further development of psychiatry up to date are presented.

AB  - Although typically defined as the study of how people and groups interact, the field of social psychology comprises several disparate domains that make only indirect contributions to understanding interpersonal interaction, such as emotion, attitudes and the self. Although these various phenomena seem to have little in common, recent evidence indicates that the topics at the core of social psychology form a natural group of domains with a common functional neuroanatomy, centered on the medial prefrontal cortex. That self-referential, attitudinal, affective and other social phenomena converge on this region might reflect their shared reliance on inexact and internally generated estimates that differ from the more precise representations underlying other psychological phenomena.

   Genetic factors are largely implicated in predisposing to schizophrenia. Environmental factors contribute to the onset of the disorder in individuals at increased genetic risk. Cognitive deficits have emerged as endophenotypes and potential therapeutic targets for schizophrenia because of their association with functional outcome. The aims of this review were to analyse the joint effect of genetic and environmental (GxE) factors on liability to schizophrenia and to investigate relationships between genes and cognitive endophenotypes focusing on practical applications for prevention and rehabilitation.
   Methods
   Medline search of relevant studies published between 1990 and 2008.
   Results
   In schizophrenia, examples of GxE interaction include the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) (Val158Met) polymorphism, which was found to moderate the onset of psychotic manifestations in response to stress and to increase the risk for psychosis related to cannabis use, and neurodevelopmental genes such as AKT1 (serine-threonine kinase), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), DTNBP1 (dysbindin) and GRM3 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 3), which were associated with development of schizophrenia in adulthood after exposure to perinatal obstetric complications. Neurocognitive deficits are recognised as core features of schizophrenia that facilitate the onset of the disorder and have a great impact on functional outcome. Neurocognitive deficits are also endophenotypes that have been linked to a variety of genes [COMT, neuregulin (NRG1), BDNF, Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and dysbindin] conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia. Recently, it has emerged that cognitive improvement during rehabilitation therapy was under control of COMT (Val158Met) polymorphism.
   Conclusion
   This review could indicate a pivotal role of psychiatric genetics in prevention and rehabilitation of schizophrenic psychoses.

AB  - While coral reefs decline, scientists argue, and effective strategies to manage land-based pollution lag behind the extent of the problem. There is need for objective, cost-effective, assessment methods. The measurement of stable nitrogen isotope ratios, delta N-15, in tissues of reef organisms shows promise as an indicator of sewage stress. The choice of target organism will depend upon study purpose, availability, and other considerations such as conservation. Algae are usually plentiful and have been shown faithfully to track sewage input. The organic matrix of bivalve shells can provide time series spanning, perhaps, decades. Gorgonians have been shown to track sewage, and can provide records potentially centuries-long. In areas where baseline data are lacking, which is almost everywhere, delta N-15 in gorgonians can provide information on status and trends. In coral tissue, delta N-15 combined with insoluble residue determination can provide information on both sewage and sediment stress in areas lacking baseline data. In the developed world, delta N-15 provides objective assessment in a field complicated by conflicting opinions. Sample handling and processing are simple and analysis costs are low. This is a method deserving widespread application. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bathymetric patterns of macrofaunal species diversity are best documented in the western North Atlantic where diversity is a unimodal function of depth, peaking in the mid-bathyal zone and being depressed in the upper slope and abyss. There are few inter-basin studies of diversity-depth trends that are controlled for taxonomy, sampling gear, and diversity measures. In this paper, we compare gastropod diversity gradients in the North American Basin of the Atlantic to estimates of diversity in 9 other regions: the Norwegian Sea, West European Basin, Guiana Basin, Gambia Basin, Equatorial Mid-Atlantic, Brazil Basin, Angola Basin, Cape Basin and Argentine Basin. All samples were collected with epibenthic sleds, and diversity calculated by the Sanders-Hurlbert normalized expected number of species. While sampling in other regions is generally less complete than in the western North Atlantic, results indicate that a unimodal pattern is not universal. Diversity can increase, decrease or show no relationship with depth. The level of diversity also varies among basins relative to the western North Atlantic, being depressed in the Norwegian Sea, at bathyal depths in the eastern North Atlantic, and below an oxygen minimum zone in the Cape Basin, and generally elevated at tropical latitudes and in abyssal regions where food supply is high. Associations between gastropod diversity and the ecology and geology of basins suggest that productivity, oxygen concentration, hydrographic disturbance and evolutionary-historical processes may be implicated in shaping bathymetric diversity gradients, but specific causes are difficult to discern. Much more intensive sampling, analyses of other major taxa, and more detailed ecological data are necessary to understand deep-sea biogeography at within- and between-basin spatial scales.

AB  - Dopamine oxidation has been previously demonstrated to cause dysfunction in mitochondrial respiration and membrane permeability, possibly related to covalent modification of critical proteins by the reactive dopamine quinone. However, specific mitochondrial protein targets have not been identified. In this study, we utilized proteomic techniques to identify proteins directly conjugated with C-14-dopamine from isolated rat brain mitochondria exposed to radiolabeled dopamine quinone (150 mu M) and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells treated with C-14-dopamine (150 mu M). We observed a subset of rat brain mitochondrial proteins that were covalently modified by C-14-dopamine, including chaperonin, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1, glucose regulated protein 75/mitochondrial HSP70/mortalin, mitofilin, and mitochondrial creatine kinase. We also found the Parkinson's disease associated proteins ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 and DJ-1 to be covalently modified by dopamine in both brain mitochondrial preparations and SH-SY5Y cells. The susceptibility of the identified proteins to covalent modification by dopamine may carry implications for their role in the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of which the core motor symptoms are attributable to the degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantial nigra pars compacta (SNc). Recent work has revealed that the engagement of L-type Ca2+ channels during autonomous pacemaking renders SNc DA neurons susceptible to mitochondrial toxins used to create animal models of PD, indicating that homeostatic Ca2+ stress could be a determinant of their selective vulnerability. This view is buttressed by the central role of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (linchpins of current theories about the origins of PD) in Ca2+ homeostasis. Here, we summarize this evidence and suggest the dual roles had by these organelles could compromise their function, leading to accelerated aging of SNc DA neurons, particularly in the face of genetic or environmental stress. We conclude with a discussion of potential therapeutic strategies for slowing the progression of PD.

AB  - The foremost feature of a diatom is the species-specific ornamentation of the silicon cell wall, which is preserved and faithfully reproduced through the generations. If exposed to different kinds of stress during reproductive processes, the diatom cell outline and striation pattern can change in different ways, producing teratological forms. These modifications can be slight, leading to difficulties in establishing a threshold between normal and teratological cells, or so marked that it is very difficult to recognize whether an unknown form is teratological or whether it belongs to a new species or variety. Teratological forms appear as an accidental effect of environmental stresses, which can be both physical and chemical. Artificial conditions also often lead to the development of teratological forms. Most frequently, diatoms present abnormal valve outline (lack of symmetry, bent, incised, swollen, or notched profile), unusual raphe system (fragmented, displaced, and bifurcated), abnormal striation pattern (irregular, altered, fragmented, and branched), and unusual raphe channel system (distorted, curved, and occasionally doubled back). In this review we analyzed 222 articles, published from 1890 up to 2008, with the aim to correlate the abnormal diatom cell morphology to environmental alterations, in a perspective which can greatly enhance the evaluation of river environmental quality for biomonitoring purposes.

   Although structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and neuropathological investigations offer complementary information that can be used to formulate and test hypotheses about pathophysiological mechanisms in psychiatric disorders, the findings from these two fields are seldom integrated in a systematic manner. In this study, we overview recent sMRI findings in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and consider how they relate to neuropathological data.
   Recent findings
   sMRI research indicates that schizophrenia is associated with volumetric reductions in a network of frontal, temporal, limbic, striatal, and thalamic regions. Some of these abnormalities are apparent prior to psychosis onset and may progress with ongoing illness. sMRI findings in bipolar disorder have been more variable, with both volumetric increases and decreases being reported across several brain regions at different illness stages. Neuropathological studies of both patient groups suggest the cellular changes associated with these volumetric differences affect diverse tissue compartments in a regionally heterogeneous way.
   Summary
   These findings suggest that any putative pathophysiological mechanism in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder should account for the dynamic, complex, and regionally heterogeneous brain abnormalities seen in these patients. We contend that greater integration of the findings from these two fields will facilitate more targeted and hypothesis-driven research in the future.

AB  - The widely held belief in a central role of left parietal lesions for apraxia can be traced back to Liepmann's model of a posterior to anterior stream converting mental images of intended action into motor execution. Although this model has undergone significant changes, its modern descendants still attribute the parietal contribution to the existence of mental representations of intended movements which precede and direct their motor execution. They predict that pantomime of tool use should be particularly vulnerable to parietal lesions. A review of clinical studies contradicts these assumptions: The impact of parietal lobe damage on pantomime of tool use is inconstant if not absent altogether. The domains of action which are most affected by left parietal damage are the imitation of meaningless gestures and, although probably only in the context of additional more widespread brain damage, actual use of tools and objects.
   I hypothesize that imitation of meaningless gestures and use of tool and objects depend on left parietal lobe integrity because of their demands on categorical apprehension of spatial relationships between multiple objects or between multiple parts of objects. For use of tools and objects the spatial relationships are between the hand, the tool, its recipient, and the material it acts upon. Categorical apprehension concentrates on features of these relations which determine mechanical interactions. For imitation of meaningless gestures, categorical apprehension of demonstrated gesture results in "body part coding" which reduces the visual appearance of the demonstrated gestures to simple spatial relationships between a limited set of discrete body parts. The hypothesis that the role of the left parietal lobe in apraxia concerns categorical apprehension of spatial relationships fits well with more general theories of parietal lobe function and hemisphere asymmetries.

AB  - The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been one of the most enduring ideas in psychiatry. Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself, conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia-025EFversion III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic funnel point.

AB  - Aim: Although the different approaches to psychosis research have made significant advances in their own fields, integration between the approaches is often lacking. This paper attempts to integrate a strand of cognitive research in psychotic disorders (specifically, social cognition research) with phenomenological accounts of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
   Method: The paper is a critical investigation of phenomenological models of disturbed selfhood in schizophrenia in relation to cognitive theories of social cognition in psychotic disorders.
   Results: We argue that disturbance of the basic sense of self, as articulated in the phenomenological literature, may underlie the social cognition difficulties present in psychotic disorders. This argument is based on phenomenological thinking about self-presence ('ipseity') being the primary or most basic ground for the intentionality of consciousness - that is, the directedness of consciousness towards others and the world. A disruption in this basic ground of conscious life has a reverberating effect through other areas of cognitive and social functioning. We propose three routes whereby self-disturbance may compromise social cognition, including dissimilarity, disruption of lived body and disturbed mental coherence.
   Conclusions: If this model is supported, then social cognition difficulties may be thought of as a secondary index or marker of the more primary disturbance of self in psychotic disorders. Further empirical work examining the relationship between cognitive and phenomenological variables may be of value in identifying risk markers for psychosis onset, thus contributing to early intervention efforts, as well as in clarifying the essential psychopathological features of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

AB  - Eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) is the most prevalent eating disorder (ED) diagnosis. In this meta-analysis, the authors aimed to inform Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders revisions by comparing the psychopathology of EDNOS with that of the officially recognized EDs: anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED). A comprehensive literature search identified 125 eligible studies (Published and unpublished) appearing in the literature from 1987 to 2007. Random effects analyses indicated that whereas EDNOS did not differ significantly from AN and BED on eating pathology or general psychopathology, BN exhibited greater eating and general psychopathology than EDNOS. Moderator analyses indicated that EDNOS groups who met all diagnostic criteria for AN except for amenorrhea did not differ significantly from full syndrome cases. Similarly, EDNOS groups who met all criteria for BN or BED except for binge frequency did not differ significantly from full syndrome cases. Results suggest that EDNOS represents a set of disorders associated with substantial psychological and physiological morbidity. Although certain EDNOS subtypes could be incorporated into existing Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) categories, others-such as purging disorder and non-fat-phobic AN-may be best conceptualized as distinct syndromes.

AB  - Background: Birth cohort (BC) studies demonstrate that individuals who develop schizophrenia differ from the general population on a range of developmental indices. The aims of this article were to summarize key findings from BC studies in order to identify areas of convergence and to outline areas requiring further research. Method: We define BC studies as studies based on general population BCs where data are collected prospectively from birth or childhood and which identify schizophrenia or related disorders as an outcome. To identify such studies, we searched various electronic databases using the search parameters (schizo* OR psych*) AND (birth cohort). We also checked the references of relevant articles and previous reviews. Results: We identified 11 BCs from 7 countries that have examined schizophrenia as an outcome in adulthood. There is relatively consistent evidence that, as a group, children who later develop schizophrenia have behavioral disturbances and psychopathology, intellectual and language deficits, and early motor delays. Evidence with respect to alterations in language, educational performance, and physical growth has also been identified in some studies. BC studies have also contributed evidence about a wide range of putative risk factors for schizophrenia. Conclusions: BC studies have provided important, convergent insights into how the developmental trajectory of individuals who develop schizophrenia differs from their peers. The combination of new paradigms and larger cohorts, with the tools of modern epidemiology and biomedical science, is advancing our understanding of the developmental pathways to schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Despite the lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), gabapentin use increased rapidly in the 1990s for mental health conditions. Subsequent RCTs did not demonstrate efficacy for bipolar disorder (BD). We examined the characteristics of review articles to determine their potential role in the growth of gabapentin for BD.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and LexisNexis for review articles or commentaries examining the role of gabapentin for BD. Electronic searches were supplemented by manual searches of reference lists. Articles were abstracted for the types of evidence cited, source of evidence, the proportion of available RCTs cited and narrative blurbs discussing the role of gabapentin for BD. Review articles were classified as narrative versus systematic and positive, neutral or negative regarding the role of gabapentin in BD.
   Results: We included 27 review articles published between 1998 and 2008, but no commentaries met eligibility criteria. Most did not describe potential conflicts of interest or a funding source, and the 3 systematic reviews were of low quality. The 11 reviews published prior to the first RCT of gabapentin for BD cited uncontrolled trials or case series (n=9), basic science (n=6), chart reviews (n=3) or unpublished RCTs (n=2). Six recommended gabapentin, 3 were neutral and 2 were negative. The 16 articles published after the first gabapentin RCT continued to cite uncontrolled trials and basic science; only 5 cited all the available RCTs. However, more of these reviews (n=10) reached negative conclusions about the role of gabapentin for BD.
   Conclusions: Narrative and low-quality systematic reviews, principally those published prior to RCTs, may have contributed to the growth of gabapentin use for BD. High-quality systematic reviews are needed to inform clinicians and policymakers about the effectiveness of new treatments. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for the coordination of several motor, cognitive, and emotional functions and become dysfunctional in several pathological states ranging from Parkinson's disease to Schizophrenia. Here we review principles developed within a neurocomputational framework of BG and related circuitry which provide insights into their functional roles in behavior. We focus on two classes of models: those that incorporate aspects of biological realism and constrained by functional principles, and more abstract mathematical models focusing on the higher level computational goals of the BG. While the former are arguably more "realistic", the latter have a complementary advantage in being able to describe functional principles of how the system works in a relatively simple set of equations, but are less suited to making specific hypotheses about the roles of specific nuclei and neurophysiological processes. We review the basic architecture and assumptions of these models, their relevance to our understanding of the neurobiological and cognitive functions of the BG, and provide an update on the potential roles of biological details not explicitly incorporated in existing models. Empirical studies ranging from those in transgenic mice to dopaminergic manipulation, deep brain stimulation, and genetics in humans largely support model predictions and provide the basis for further refinement. Finally, we discuss possible future directions and possible ways to integrate different types of models. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present review we propose a model to explain the role of the basal ganglia in sensorimotor and cognitive functions based on a growing body of behavioural, anatomical, physiological, and neurochemical evidence accumulated over the last decades. This model proposes that the body and its surrounding environment are represented in the striatum in a fragmented and repeated way, like a mosaic consisting of the fragmented images of broken mirrors. Each fragment forms a functional unit representing articulated parts of the body with motion properties, objects of the environment which the subject can approach or manipulate, and locations the subject can move to. These units integrate the sensory properties and movements related to them. The repeated and widespread distribution of such units amplifies the combinatorial power of the associations among them. These associations depend on the phasic release of dopamine in the striatum triggered by the saliency of stimuli and will be reinforced by the rewarding consequences of the actions related to them. Dopamine permits synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal synapses. The striatal units encoding the same stimulus/action send convergent projections to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) that stimulate or hold the action through a thalamus-frontal cortex pathway. According to this model, this is how the basal ganglia select actions based on environmental stimuli and store adaptive associations as nondeclarative memories such as motor skills, habits, and memories formed by Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning.

AB  - The striatum is the major division of the basal ganglia, representing the input station of the circuit and arguably the principal site within the basal ganglia where information processing occurs.
   Striatal activity is critically involved in motor control and learning. Many parts of the striatum are involved in reward processing and in various forms of learning and memory, such as reward-association learning. Moreover, the striatum appears to be a brain center for habit formation and is likely to be involved in advanced stages of addiction.
   The critical role played by the striatum in learning and cognitive processes is thought to be based on changes in neuronal activity when specific behavioral tasks are being learned.
   Accordingly, excitatory corticostriatal synapses onto both striatal projecting spiny neurons and interneurons are able to undergo the main forms of synaptic plasticity. including long-term potentiation, long-term depression, short-term forms of intrinsic plasticity and spike timing-dependent plasticity.
   These specific forms of neuroplasticity allow the short-term and long-term selection and differential amplification of cortical neural signals modulating the processes of motor and behavioral selection within the basal ganglia neural circuit. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Suicide prevention remains a challenge across communities in North America and abroad. We examine a suicide prevention effort that is widely used, termed gatekeeper training. There are 2 aims: review the state of the evidence on gatekeeper training for suicide prevention, and propose directions for further research.
   Method: Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (PubMed) and PsycINFO from inception to the present for the key words suicide, suicide prevention, and gatekeeper. In addition, a manual scan of relevant articles' bibliographies was undertaken.
   Results: Gatekeeper training has been implemented and studied in many populations, including military personnel, public school staff, peer helpers, clinicians, and Aboriginal people. This type of training has been shown to positively affect the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of trainees regarding suicide prevention. Large-scale cohort studies in military personnel and physicians have reported promising results with a significant reduction in suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and deaths by suicide.
   Conclusions: Gatekeeper training is successful at imparting knowledge, building skills, and molding the attitudes of trainees; however, more work needs to be done on longevity of these traits and referral patterns of gatekeepers. There is a need for randomized controlled trials. In addition, the unique effect of gatekeeper training on suicide rates needs to be fully elucidated.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic brain disease characterized by loss of capacity in movement control, cognition, and emotional regulation over a period of about 30 years. Since it is well established that clinical impairments and brain atrophy can be detected decades prior to receiving a clinical diagnosis, functional neuroimaging efforts have gained momentum in HD research. In most brain disorders, there is accumulating evidence that the clinical manifestations of disease do not simply depend on the extent of tissue loss, but represent a complex balance among neuronal dysfunction, tissue repair, and circuitry reorganization. Based upon this premise, functional neuroimaging modalities may be more sensitive to the earliest changes in HD than are structural imaging approaches. For this review, PET and fMRI studies conducted in HD samples were summarized. Strengths and limitations of the utilization of functional imaging in HID are discussed and recommendations are offered to facilitate future research endeavors. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Beginning approximately a decade and a half ago, it was suggested that some structures that are considered to be part of the "medial temporal lobe memory system" could play a role in perception as well. The implications of this view, interpreted broadly, are that medial temporal lobe structures may be understood as an extension of the ventral visual stream and that their functions cannot be described exclusively in terms of memory. Considerable evidence now supports the view that medial temporal lobe structures are involved in nonmnemonic aspects of cognition, such as perception. This discovery allows for a fuller understanding of the involvement of these structures in mental phenomena than does a purely mnemonic account of their function. See the related review by Suzuki, "Perception and the Medial Temporal Lobe: Evaluating the Current Evidence," in this issue of Neuron.

AB  - The present review explores the role of ceramides in neuronal apoptosis, as well as the recent discovery of the signaling pathways involved in this process placing particular emphasis on the correlation between cellular metabolism and neuronal death. Endogenous levels of ceramides are increased following various pro-apoptotic stimuli which have been identified as potential causes of chronic and acute neurodegenerative diseases. Ceramides induce changes in multiple enzymes and cell signaling components. The early inhibition of the neuronal survival pathway regulated by phosphatidil-inositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B or AKT mediated by ceramide may be a relevant early event in the decision of neuronal survival/death. It may perturb several molecular and metabolic functions. in particular it might decrease glycolisis through rapid modulation of hexokinase activity. This would in turn generate limited amounts of mitochondrial substrates leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. Subtle and early metabolic alterations caused by inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway mediated by ceramide may potentially work with genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Together they may be determinant steps in downstream events leading to neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, reinforcement of the PI3K/AKT pathway could constitute an important neuroprotective strategy.

AB  - The classically structured clinical trial does not offer enough flexibility to make use of continuously emerging knowledge that is generated as the trial progresses. In this regard, there are consistent issues impeding effective psychiatric research, including limitations in efficiency, difficulty demonstrating significant differences between treatment arms, poor external validity,, and ethical constraints. For example, research in the field of psychiatry shows that it is growing increasingly more challenging to demonstrate superiority of interventions to placebo in part related to the increasing placebo response rates. Various design innovations and other tricks of the trade have surfaced to improve sensitivity towards detecting drug-placebo differences and reduce sources of bias in psychiatric research. Diverse strategies have been developed to address these obstacles and improve the outcomes of clinical research in psychiatry. The Current review highlights many of these innovations and describes examples of their practical use, mainly focusing on the study design and conduct perspectives. In the Study design issues, adaptive, equipoise stratified, sequential parallel and effectiveness design will be explored. The proper strategies for pragmatic and ethical conduction of clinical trials will be also discussed in-depth.

AB  - Trace elements (heavy metals and metalloids) are important environmental pollutants, and many of them are toxic even at very low concentrations. Pollution of the biosphere with trace elements has accelerated dramatically since the Industrial Revolution. Primary sources are the burning of fossil fuels, mining and smelting of metalliferous ores, municipal wastes, agrochemicals, and sewage. In addition, natural mineral deposits containing particularly large quantities of heavy metals are found in many regions. These areas often support characteristic plant species thriving in metal-enriched environments. Whereas many species avoid the uptake of heavy metals from these soils, some of them can accumulate significantly high concentrations of toxic metals, to levels which by far exceed the soil levels. The natural phenomenon of heavy metal tolerance has enhanced the interest of plant ecologists, plant physiologists, and plant biologists to investigate the physiology and genetics of metal tolerance in specialized hyperaccumulator plants such as Arabidopsis halleri and Thlaspi caerulescens. In this review, we describe recent advances in understanding the genetic and molecular basis of metal tolerance in plants with special reference to transcriptomics of heavy metal accumulator plants and the identification of functional genes implied in tolerance and detoxification.
   Plants are susceptible to heavy metal toxicity and respond to avoid detrimental effects in a variety of different ways. The toxic dose depends on the type of ion, ion concentration, plant species, and stage of plant growth. Tolerance to metals is based on multiple mechanisms such as cell wall binding, active transport of ions into the vacuole, and formation of complexes with organic acids or peptides. One of the most important mechanisms for metal detoxification in plants appears to be chelation of metals by low-molecular-weight proteins such as metallothioneins and peptide ligands, the phytochelatins. For example, glutathione (GSH), a precursor of phytochelatin synthesis, plays a key role not only in metal detoxification but also in protecting plant cells from other environmental stresses including intrinsic oxidative stress reactions. In the last decade, tremendous developments in molecular biology and success of genomics have highly encouraged studies in molecular genetics, mainly transcriptomics, to identify functional genes implied in metal tolerance in plants, largely belonging to the metal homeostasis network.
   Analyzing the genetics of metal accumulation in these accumulator plants has been greatly enhanced through the wealth of tools and the resources developed for the study of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana such as transcript profiling platforms, protein and metabolite profiling, tools depending on RNA interference (RNAi), and collections of insertion line mutants. To understand the genetics of metal accumulation and adaptation, the vast arsenal of resources developed in A. thaliana could be extended to one of its closest relatives that display the highest level of adaptation to high metal environments such as A. halleri and T. caerulescens.
   This review paper deals with the mechanisms of heavy metal accumulation and tolerance in plants. Detailed information has been provided for metal transporters, metal chelation, and oxidative stress in metal-tolerant plants. Advances in phytoremediation technologies and the importance of metal accumulator plants and strategies for exploring these immense and valuable genetic and biological resources for phytoremediation are discussed.
   A number of species within the Brassicaceae family have been identified as metal accumulators. To understand fully the genetics of metal accumulation, the vast genetic resources developed in A. thaliana must be extended to other metal accumulator species that display traits absent in this model species. A. thaliana microarray chips could be used to identify differentially expressed genes in metal accumulator plants in Brassicaceae. The integration of resources obtained from model and wild species of the Brassicaceae family will be of utmost importance, bringing most of the diverse fields of plant biology together such as functional genomics, population genetics, phylogenetics, and ecology. Further development of phytoremediation requires an integrated multidisciplinary research effort that combines plant biology, genetic engineering, soil chemistry, soil microbiology, as well as agricultural and environmental engineering.

AB  - Can the media reduce intergroup prejudice and conflict? Despite the high stakes of this question, understanding of the mass media's role in shaping prejudiced beliefs, norms, and behavior is limited. A yearlong field experiment in Rwanda tested the impact of a radio soap opera featuring messages about reducing intergroup prejudice, violence, and trauma in 2 fictional Rwandan communities. Compared with a control group who listened to a health radio soap opera, listeners' perceptions of social norms and their behaviors changed with respect to intermarriage, open dissent, trust, empathy, cooperation, and trauma healing. However, the radio program did little to change listeners' personal beliefs. Group discussion and emotion were implicated in the process of media influence. Taken together, the results point to an integrated model of behavioral prejudice and conflict reduction that prioritizes the communication of social norms over changes in personal beliefs.

AB  - A significant increase in the occurrence of allergic respiratory, diseases has been perceived in the world in the last several decades. One of the presumed causes of this phenomenon is the contemporary altered dietary pattern. Many studies investigated the possible inflammatory, or anti-inflammatory effects of various nutrients in the pathophysiology of respiratory allergies. Recent epidemiological studies reported an association between a high intake of w-6 and a low intake of w-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA-s) with the elevated prevalence of respiratory allergies. w-6 PUFA-s are precursors of strong inflammatory mediators which promote allergic inflammation whereas metabolites of w-3 PUF4-s are weak inflammation, mediators. However clinical trials of w-3 supplementation failed to show substantial beneficial results. A high dietary intake of salt could have a bronchoconstrictive effect in the pathogenesis Of asthma, whereas magnesium is considered to act bronchodilatatively, yet most research in asthmatic patients has not proven these proposed impacts. Antioxidants, such as vitamin C, E, A flavonoides, isoflavones and some trace elements (selenium, zinc manganese, copper) are relevant in diminishing oxidative stress. Despite epidemological and some clinical evidence of a protective antioxidant effect against the development of respiratory allergies, interventional studies mainly have not confirmed significant benefit of antioxidant scientific evidence regarding the Due to a large amount of controversial scientific evidence regarding the., possibility of preventing and treating respiratory allergies with a modified diet, there is a need for further research in this field.

AB  - Obesity is currently a worldwide pandemic. It affects more than 300 million humans and it will probably increase over the next 20 years. The consumption of calorie-rich foods is responsible for most of the obesity cases, but not all humans exposed to high-calorie diets develop the disease. This fact has prompted researchers to investigate the mechanisms linking the consumption of high-calorie diets to the generation of an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. According to recent studies, the exposure to fat-rich diets induces an inflammatory response in the hypothalamic areas involved in the control of feeding and thermogenesis. The inflammatory process damages the neuronal circuitries that maintain the homeostatic control of the body's energy stores, therefore favoring body mass gain. This review will focus on the main advances obtained in this field. Arq Bras Endocrinol Metab. 2009;53(2):151-158.

AB  - Profound disturbances in sleep architecture Occur in major depressive disorders (MDD) and in bipolar affective disorders. Reduction in slow wave sleep, decreased latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and abnormalities in the timing of REM/non-REM sleep cycles have all been documented in patients with MDD. It is thus evident that an understanding of the basic mechanisms of sleep regulation is essential for an analysis of the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which functions as the body's master circadian clock, plays a major role in the regulation of the sleep/wakefulness rhythm and interacts actively with the homeostatic processes that regulate sleep. The control of melatonin secretion by the SCN, the occurrence of high concentrations of melatonin receptors in the SCN, and the Suppression of electrical activity in the SCN by melatonin all underscore the major influence which this neurohormone has in regulating the sleep/wake cycle. The transition from wakefulness to high sleep propensity is associated with the nocturnal rise of endogenous melatonin secretion. Various lines of evidence show that depressed patients exhibit disturbances in both the amplitude and shape of the melatonin secretion rhythm and that melatonin can improve the quality of sleep in these patients. The choice of a suitable antidepressant that improves sleep quality is thus important while treating a depressive disorder. The novel antidepressant agomelatine, which combines the properties of a 5-HT2C antagonist and a melatonergic MT1/MT2 receptor agonist, has been found very effective for resetting the disturbed sleep/wake cycle and in improving the clinical status of MDD. Agomelatine has also been found useful in treating sleep problems and improving the clinical status of patients suffering from seasonal affective disorder. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - As in other mammals with binocular vision, monocular lid suture in mice induces bidirectional plasticity: rapid weakening of responses evoked through the deprived eye followed by delayed strengthening of responses through the open eye. It has been proposed that these bidirectional changes occur through three distinct processes: first, deprived-eye responses rapidly weaken through homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD); second, as the period of deprivation progresses, the modification threshold determining the boundary between synaptic depression and synaptic potentiation becomes lower, favouring potentiation; and third, facilitated by the decreased modification threshold, open-eye responses are strengthened via homosynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP). Of these processes, deprived-eye depression has received the greatest attention, and although several alternative hypotheses are also supported by current research, evidence suggests that a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor endocytosis through LTD is a key mechanism. The change in modification threshold appears to occur partly through changes in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit composition, with decreases in the ratio of NR2A to NR2B facilitating potentiation. Although limited research has directly addressed the question of open- eye potentiation, several studies suggest that LTP could account for observed changes in vivo. This review will discuss evidence supporting this three-stage model, along with outstanding issues in the field.

AB  - alpha-Synuclein is a small protein that has special relevance for understanding Parkinson disease and related disorders. Not only is alpha-synuclein found in Lewy bodies characteristic of Parkinson disease, but also mutations in the gene for alpha-synuclein can cause an inherited form of Parkinson disease and expression of normal alpha-synuclein can increase the risk of developing Parkinson disease in sporadic, or non-familial, cases. Both sporadic and familial Parkinson disease are characterized by substantial loss of several groups of neurons, including the dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra that are the target of most current symptomatic therapies. Therefore, it is predicted that alpha-synuclein, especially in its mutant forms or under conditions where its expression levels are increased, is a toxic protein in the sense that it is associated with an increased rate of neuronal cell death. This review will discuss the experimental contexts in which alpha-synuclein has been demonstrated to be toxic. I will also outline what is known about the mechanisms by which alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal damage, and identify some of the current gaps in our knowledge about this subject. Finally, the therapeutic implications of toxicity of alpha-synuclein will be discussed.

AB  - Despite major advances in our understanding of the initiating factors that trigger many neurodegenerative disorders, to date, no novel disease-modifying therapies have been shown to provide significant benefit for patients who suffer from these devastating disorders. As most neurodegenerative disorders are late-onset, slowly progressive, and appear to have long relatively asymptomatic prodromal phases, it is possible that therapies optimally targeting the triggers of these disorders may have limited benefit when treatment is initiated in the symptomatic patient. Such therapies may work in the prodromal phase, or when given prophylactically, but in the symptomatic patient there simply may be too much damage to the neuronal networks to restore functionality by reducing or even eliminating the primary stressor. As functional neuronal demise and overt neuronal death are almost certainly the key factors that mediate the functional impairment, it is clear that preventing neuronal death and dysfunction will have a huge clinical benefit. Unfortunately, we lack a detailed understanding of neuronal death pathways in almost all neurodegenerative disorders. To rationally develop new disease modifying therapies that target steps in the degenerative cascade downstream of the disease trigger will require a number of factors. First, we need to refocus our basic research efforts on identifying the precise steps in the pathological cascade that lead to neuronal death in each neurodegenerative disease and, if possible, determine the relative placement of those events within a potentially very complex cascade. Second, we will need to determine which of these steps are potentially targetable. Finally, we will need to develop novel therapies that interfere with these steps and demonstrate that such therapies alone, or in combination with therapies that target the trigger of these devastating diseases, have clinical benefit.

   Method: The MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, ERIC, Social Sciences Abstracts, Social Sciences Citation Index, Social Services Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts databases were searched from 1970 (or their inception) to October 2007. Abstracts from 582 Studies were screened and 22 studies were found to meet inclusion criteria (published in the English language, reported results Of neuropsychological tests, or screening tests for cognitive dysfunction in homeless people aged 18 years or older). Two investigators independently reviewed each study and rated its quality based on well-defined criteria.
   Results: Ten studies were of good or fair quality. Studies that administered the Mini Mental State Examination indicate about 4% to 7% of homeless people exhibit global cognitive deficits. Focal deficits in verbal and visual memory, attention, speed of cognitive processing, and executive function were also apparent. No Studies of the functional implications of cognitive deficits were found.
   Conclusions: Cognitive deficits in homeless people likely have a significant mediating impact oil the effectiveness of skills training and rehabilitation programs. Clinicians Should be cognizant that cognitive deficits probably impair homeless patients' ability to maintain housing stability and follow treatment recommendations. Implications for housing options and health service delivery should also be considered. Research is lacking on interventions to improve cognitive functioning in the homeless.

Attackers manipulate search engines to reproduce their lies and threats for employers and clients to see, creating digital "scarlet letters" that ruin reputations.
   Today's cyber-attack groups update a history of anonymous mobs coming together to victimize and subjugate vulnerable people. The social science literature identifies conditions that magnify, dangerous group behavior and those that tend to defuse it. Unfortunately, Web 2.0 technologies accelerate mob behavior. With little reason to expect self-correction of this intimidation Of vulnerable individuals, the law must respond.
   General criminal statutes and tort law proscribe much of the mobs destructive behavior, but the harm they inflict also ought to be understood and addressed as civil rights violations. Civil rights suits reach the societal harm that would otherwise go unaddressed and would play a crucial expressive role in condemning online mob activity. Acting against these attacks does not offend First Amendment principles when they consist of defamation, true of threats, intentional infliction of emotional distress, technological sabotage, and bias-motivated abuse aimed to interfere with a victim's employment opportunities. To the contrary, it helps preserve vibrant online dialogue and promote a culture of political, social, and economic equality.

AB  - The combustion of fossil fuels and the resultant impacts on climate may now represent one of the largest environmental threats. In the Mediterranean Sea, changes in bio-chemical and physical seawater properties resulting from global warming are likely to alter marine biodiversity and productivity, trigger trophic web mismatches and encourage diseases, toxic algal bloom and propagation of thermophilic species. This review highlights the current and potential threats Of climate change to the Mediterranean marine ecosystems, including cetaceans, and stresses the emergent necessity for more integrated regulations and policies for the protection of marine biodiversity. For instance, in the Mediterranean Sea, the distribution and abundance of the small euphausid species Meganyctiphanes norvegica is correlated with specific hydrobiological parameters including seawater temperature, salinity and current patterns. Situated at the northern limit of its ecological tolerance, this species, which constitutes the only known food supply of the fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in this region, might be affected by climate change-induced alteration of ocean circulation.

AB  - The occupational epidemiological literature on extremely low frequency electric and magnetic fields (EMF) and health encompasses a large number of studies of design and quality that have addressed many health outcomes, including various cancers, cardiovascular disease, depression and suicide, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). At a 2006 workshop we studies of occupational EMF exposure with an on methodological weaknesses, and proposed analytical ways to address some of these. We also developed research priorities that we hope will address remaining uncertainties. Broadly speaking, extensive research conducted during the past 20 years on occupational EMF exposure does not indicate strong or consistent associations with cancer or any other health outcomes. Inconsistent results for many of the may be attributable to numerous shortcomings in the studies, most notably in exposure assessment. There however, no obvious correlation between exposure assessment quality and observed associations. Nevertheless, for future research, the highest priorities emerge in both the areas of exposure assessment and investigation of ALS. To better assess exposure, we for the development of a more complete job-exposure matrix that combines job title, work environment and and an index of exposure to electric fields, magnetic fields, spark discharge, contact current, and other chemical and physical agents. For ALS, we propose an international collaborative study capable of illuminating reported association with electrical occupations by disentangling the potential roles of electric shocks, magnetic fields and bias. Such a study will potentially to evidence-based measures to protect public health.

AB  - Aim: Early medical or behavioural intervention to slow cognitive decline might be a viable strategy for reducing disability and rates of institutional care in older persons. This paper details the published work supporting cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between vascular risk factors, depressive symptoms and progressive cognitive decline. Evidence for the beneficial effects of providing relevant interventions is assessed.
   Methods: Relevant published work from the areas of dementia research, 'vascular depression' and the cognitive benefits that might result from treating vascular risk factors, managing depression or promoting nutrition, cognitive or physical exercise was ascertained from electronic database searches and recent reviews of key areas.
   Results: The existing published work does not provide many examples of early intervention strategies that target vascular strategies or active treatment of depression to reduce the rate of cognitive decline. Most studies have major limitations including the evaluation of only single-risk-factor interventions, the observational designs and the inadequate measurement of cognition. An optimal early intervention strategy might be to target multiple risk factors within relevant experimental or health service frameworks.
   Conclusions: Early identification and multifaceted reduction of vascular risk factors, active management of depression, engagement in cognitive activity and physical exercise and promotion of better nutrition might together help to slow some forms of cognitive decline or progression to dementia. This health services approach now requires systematic evaluation.

AB  - Human functional brain mapping as we presently know it began when the experimental strategies of cognitive psychology were combined with modern brain-imaging techniques (first positron emission tomography and then functional magnetic resonance imaging) to examine how brain function supports mental activities. This marriage of disciplines and techniques galvanized the field of cognitive neuroscience, which has rapidly expanded to include a broad range of the social sciences in addition to basic scientists interested in the neurophysiology, cell biology and genetics of the imaging signals. Although much of this work has transpired over the past couple of decades, its roots can be traced back more than a century.

AB  - Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and memory are dependent on new protein synthesis. Recent advances obtained from genetic, physiological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies provide strong evidence that translational control plays a key role in regulating long-term changes in neural circuits and thus long-term modifications in behavior. Translational control is important for regulating both general protein synthesis and synthesis of specific proteins in response to neuronal activity. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent progress in the field and highlight the prospects for better understanding of long-lasting changes in synaptic strength, learning, and memory and implications for neurological diseases.

AB  - Excess free iron generates oxidative stress that hallmarks diseases of aging. The observation that patients with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease show a dramatic increase in their brain iron content has opened the possibility that disturbances in brain iron homeostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders. While the reason for iron accumulation is unknown, iron localization correlates with the production of reactive oxygen species in those areas of the brain that are prone to neurodegeneration. A role for iron is also proposed in atherosclerosis, a further frequent disorder of aging. We will review experimental evidences for an involvement of iron in these diseases and discuss some mouse models with impairment in iron-related genes that may be useful to study the role of iron in these disorders.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation has been described in the brain following an ischemic Insult. Superoxide anion is converted by superoxide dismutase into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the latter is then transformed into the toxic hydroxyl radical, through the Haber-Weiss reaction, converted to water by glutathione peroxidase (GPx) or dismuted to water and oxygen through catalase. Accumulation of H2O2 has been Suggested to exert neurotoxic effects, although recent in vitro studies have demonstrated either physiological or protective roles of this molecule in the brain. In particular, oxidative stress is critically involved in brain damage induced by transient cerebral ischemia. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of GPx by systemic (i.p.) administration of mercaptosuccinate (MS, 1.5-150 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduces brain infarct damage produced by transient (2 h) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in rat. Neuroprotection was observed when the drug was administered 15 min before the ischemic insult, whereas no effect was detected when the drug was injected 1 h before MCAo or upon reperfusion. Furthermore, application of MS (1 mM) to corticostriatal slices limited the irreversible functional derangement of field potentials caused by a prolonged (12 min) oxygen-glucose deprivation. This effect was reverted by concomitant bath application of the catalase inhibitor 3-aminotriazole (20 mM), suggesting the involvement of catalase in mediating the neuroprotective effects of MS.
   Thus, our findings demonstrate that MS is neuroprotective in both in vivo and in vitro ischemic conditions, through a mechanism which may involve increased endogenous levels of H2O2 and its consequent conversion to molecular oxygen by catalase.

AB  - There is growing appreciation that social decision making in humans is strongly influenced by hedonic and emotional processing. The field of social neuroeconomics has shown that neural systems important for reward are associated with social choice and social preferences in humans. Here, we show that the neurobiology of social preferences in a monogamous rodent species, the prairie vole, is also regulated by neural systems involved in reward and emotional processing. Specifically, we describe how mesolimbic dopamine transmission differentially mediates the formation and maintenance of monogamous pair bonds in this species. Thus, reward processing exerts tremendous regulation over social choice behaviors that serve as the foundation of a rather complex social organization. We conclude that prairie voles are an excellent model system for the neuroscience of social choice and that complex social decision-making can be robustly explained by reward and hedonic processing.

We begin by examining authentic leadership and its development, followed by work that takes a cognitive science approach. We then examine new-genre leadership theories, complexity leadership, and leadership that is shared, collective, or distributed. We examine the role of relationships through our review of leader member exchange and the emerging work on followership. Finally, we examine work that has been done on substitutes for leadership, servant leadership, spirituality and leadership, cross-cultural leadership, and e-leadership. This structure has the benefit of creating a future focus as well as providing an interesting way to examine the development of the field. Each section ends with an identification of issues to be addressed in the future, in addition to the overall integration of the literature we provide at the end of the article.

AB  - This chapter discusses penalty kicks in soccer, interpreted within the framework of behavioral economics. We present two behaviors of professional soccer players during penalty kicks that seem nonoptimal, and possibly indicate biases in decision making. We ask whether, despite the huge incentives involved in professional soccer and the possibility of learning through feedback from the outcomes of previous penalty kicks, goalkeepers and penalty kickers are not optimizing their actions. We suggest that they do indeed learn to optimize, but have a different utility function; goalkeepers are not solely interested in minimizing the chances of the goal, and kickers are not solely interested in maximizing these chances.
   We believe that, in general, in cases where decision makers have the ability to learn through feedback about the outcome of their actions but exhibit behavior that seems nonoptimal, it is possible that they do optimize, but that their utility function is different from the one assumed. We propose that such decision makers' behavior be reconceived as "socially rational,'' in the sense that their socia-environment seems to be incorporated into their utility functions. Finally, the concept of "socio-emotional rationality" is suggested to account for possible implications in future studies of motion-cognition interactions.

AB  - Depression is common among the elderly, and several factors need to be taken into account in selecting the appropriate antidepressant in this age group. Various physiologic changes occur in individuals as they age, potentially leading to changes in the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs in elderly individuals. The efficacy of various medications, their side-effect profiles, and the potential for drug-drug interactions may differ in older patients compared to younger ones. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are seen as being among the first-line agents for treatment of depression in elderly patients, have been shown to be effective but carry with them side effects and drug-drug interactions that warrant special attention when these medications are prescribed to older individuals. This review focuses on the pharmacology of SSRIs in elderly patients and on practical issues related to using these medications.

AB  - The study of culture and biology has long stood stratified within the social and natural sciences, a gap that physicist C.P. Snow (1959) famously called "the two cultures." Cultural neuroscience is an emerging, interdisciplinary field that examines the bidirectional influence of culture and genes to brain and behavior across multiple timescales. Integrating theory and methods from cultural psychology, brain sciences, and population genetics, cultural neuroscience is the study of how cultural values, practices and beliefs shape brain function and how the human brain gives rise to cultural capacities and their transmission across macro- (e.g., phylogeny, lifespan) and micro timescales (e.g., situation). The current article presents the aims and methods of cultural neuroscience, highlights recent empirical findings in the field, and discusses the potential implications of this field for bridging the social and natural sciences as well as informing interethnic ideology and population health concerns, more broadly construed

AB  - There is general agreement that DSM-IV and ICD-10 require major improvements in format and content to make them more valid, evidence-based and clinically useful. DSM-IV-TR currently includes a series of clinical features that provide potentially useful information on cross-sectional and longitudinal courses of bipolar disorder. This conceptual and data-driven review proposes changes in the current classification by removing, modifying and adding bipolar episode and course specifiers in DSM-V. Specifiers to be maintained would be 'with catatonic features', 'with melancholic features', 'with atypical features' and 'with rapid cycling'. The 'seasonal pattern' modifier should be amended to allow manic, hypomanic and mixed episodes to be included in the description. Some specifiers should likely be substantially reconceptualized ('severity/psychosis/remission') or removed ('with post-partum onset'). Age at onset (early, intermediate or late onset) and predominant polarity (manic, depressive) should be added for their relevance for course and outcome. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The roles of the nigrostriatal pathway are far beyond the simple control of motor functions. The tonic release of dopamine in the dorsal and ventral striatum controls the choice of proper actions toward a given environmental situation. In the striatum, a specific action is triggered by a specific stimulus associated with it. When the subject faces a novel and salient stimulus, the phasic release of dopamine allows synaptic plasticity in the cortico-striatal synapses. Neurons of different regions of cortical areas make synapses that converge to the same medium spine neurons of the striatum. The convergent associations form functional units encoding body parts, objects, locations, and symbolic representations of the subject's world. Such units emerge in the striatum in a repetitive manner, like a mosaic of broken mirrors. The phasic release of dopamine allows the association of units to encode an action of the subject directed to an object or location with the outcome of this action. Reinforced stimulus-action-outcome associations will affect future decision making when the same stimulus (object, location, idea) is presented to the subject in the future. In the absence of a minimal amount of striatal dopamine, no action is initiated as seen in Parkinson's disease subjects. The abnormal and improper association of these units leads to the initiation of unpurposeful and sometimes repetitive actions, as those observed in dyskinetic patients. The association of an excessive reinforcement of some actions, like drug consumption, leads to drug addiction. Improper associations of ideas and unpleasant outcomes may be related to traumatic and depressive symptoms common in many diseases, including Parkinson's disease. The same can be said about the learning and memory impairments observed in demented and nondemented Parkinson's disease patients.

AB  - Theory of mind is said to be uniquely human. Is this statement justified? Thirty years of research on a variety of species has produced differences in opinion, from unequivocal positive evidence to no evidence at all for mental attribution in animals. Our review concludes that animals are excellent ethologists, but on the whole, poor psychologists. Those studies that we believe present a good case for mental attribution all possess high ecological validity, including studies on food competition by chimpanzees and cache-protection strategies by corvids. Even though the current focus of research on prediction rather food explanation may be misplaced, we believe the field is now in a strong position to discover what animals really know about their fellow beings, be it based on simple associations, behavior reading, mind reading, or something else.

AB  - During aging, decline in memory and cognitive abilities as well as motor weakening is of great concern. The dopaminergic system mediates some aspects of manual dexterity, in addition to cognition and emotion, and may be especially vulnerable to aging. A common neurodegenerative disorder of this system, Parkinson's disease, is characterized by a selective, progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. This review includes studies quantifying age and Parkinson's-related changes of the substantia nigra, with emphasis on stereological studies performed in the substantia nigra pars compacta.

AB  - Dementia is becoming increasingly prevalent since elderly patients are living longer due to the development of treatments for other disease and conditions. The percent of our population over 60 is also increasing with the wave of aging baby boomers. Additionally, more individuals seek medical assistance for cognitive problems as visibility for treatments improves. This combination of factors results in the dementia syndromes becoming more common, causing physicians to encounter more patients with dementia as well as more caregivers of these patients.
   Of dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is thought to be the second most common subtype. DLB's typical symptoms include cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations, spontaneous parkinsonism, and fluctuating confusion. Supportive features include a variety of sleep disruptions that may occur before manifestations of dementia. Psychiatric symptoms include vivid visual hallucinations and depression. The clinical features of DLB are strikingly similar to those of dementia in Parkin's disease (PD).
   The underlying biology of DLB is complex, but the presence of alpha-synuclein containing Lewy bodies (LB) is a common factors. These inclusions also contain ubiquitin. PD dementia shares these pathological findings with DLB, as well as neural degeneration of the substantia nigra. DLB and dementia in PD may represent the same pathological process along a disease spectrum.
   Additionally, many DLB cases are also associated with beta-amyloid and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles, features that are associated with AD. Frequently, AD patients are also found to have LB. The reason for this overlap is unknown. However) the greater the Alzheimer's pathology in DLB patients, the more the clinical features of DLB overlaps with AD.
   In this chapter, we will review DLB including clinical, pathological, and radiological features as well as biomarkers and treatments.

The manifold is chosen in the form M = M-0 x M-1 x ... x M-n, where M-i are Einstein spaces (i >= 1). The sigma-model approach and exact solutions with intersecting composite branes (e.g. solutions with harmonic functions, S-brane and black brane ones) with intersection rules related to non-singular Kac-Moody (KM) algebras (e. g. hyperbolic ones) are reviewed. Some examples of solutions, e.g. corresponding to hyperbolic KM algebras: H-2(q, q), AE(3), HA(2)((1)), E-10 and Lorentzian KM algebra P-10 are presented.

AB  - The term stress is used, most often subjectively, with various meanings, the physiological definition, and appropriate term as responses in different situations. The flexibility of normal metabolism allows the development of responses to environmental changes which fluctuate regularly and predictable over daily and seasonal cycles. Thus every deviation of a factor form its optimum does not necessarily result in stress. Stress being with a constraint or with highly unpredictable fluctuations imposed on regular metabolic patterns that cause injury, disease, or aberrant physiology. Among the environmental stresses, drought stress is one of the most adverse factors of plant growth and productivity. The biochemical and molecular responses to drought is essential for a holistic perception of plant resistance mechanism to water limited condition in higher plants. In this review, we tried to describe some aspects of drought induced changes in water relations in higher plants.

AB  - Adaptive, goal-directed behavior requires that organisms evaluate their actions in terms of their outcomes. Neuroimaging studies show that unfavorable outcomes or situations with high level of conflict engage the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). Recording of event-related potentials revealed that these situations are accompanied by a negative deflection, the so-called error-related negativity (ERN), which appears after an erroneous response or after negative feedback. Both activation of the pMFC and the ERN are thought to represent a signal that indicates the need for behavioral adjustment, and to recruit other brain regions that implement these adjustments. While many fMRI and EEG studies have shed light on the anatomical structures and the cognitive processes involved in performance monitoring, only very recently have researchers begun to investigate the underlying neurochemical mechanisms. Drawing on the putative involvement of dopamine (DA) neurons in coding a reward prediction error, an influential theory has ascribed a pivotal role to DA in performance monitoring. However, although important, DA is certainly not the only neuromodulator involved. Recent studies point to a role for serotonin, norepinephrine and GABA, but also for adenosine in performance monitoring. Here, we review the evidence for neurotransmitter effects on this function in humans. In this light, we critically discuss currently debated models of performance monitoring and potential alternatives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Employment is a right of citizenship and a social determinant of health, but employment rates remain low for persons with disabilities. The purpose of this paper is to examine the principles and practices guiding work integration within the fields of intellectual disability ( ID), brain injury, and mental illness and to identify best practices to support transitions to employment across these three groups. This integrative review drew upon an occupational perspective to analyze the current literature. Findings reveal that the need and benefits of working are recognized across disability groups but that philosophical perspectives guiding work integration differ. In the area of mental illness, recovery is seen as a process within which work plays an important role, in ID work is viewed as a planned outcome that is part of the developmental process, and in the field of brain injury, outcomes of employability and employment are emphasized. A common theme across the three disability groups is that in order to facilitate work integration, the person, the job and the work environment are important factors in need of examination. Evidence pointing to the effectiveness of the supported employment model is increasing across these three populations. A framework for guiding the development of further research and for promoting changes to support work integration is presented.

AB  - The objective of this review is to assess the clinical evidence for or against ginseng as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We searched 20 databases from their inception to January 2009 and included all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of any type of Panax ginseng to treat human patients suffering from AD. Methodological quality was assessed using the Jadad score. Two RCTs met all inclusion criteria. They assessed the effectiveness of ginseng as an adjunct to drug therapy on cognitive function compared with conventional drug therapy. Their results suggested significant effect in favor of ginseng on the Mini-Mental Status Examination (n = 174, weight mean difference (WMD), 1.85; 95% confidence intervals, CIs 0.88 to 2.82, P = 0.0002) and on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale(ADAS)-cognitive (n = 174, WMD, 3.09; 95% CIs 1.08 to 5.09, P = 0.003). Both of these studies are burdened with serious methodological limitations. In conclusion, the evidence for ginseng as a treatment of AD is scarce and inconclusive. Further rigorous trials seem warranted.

AB  - Research into the aetiology of social phobia can contribute to the prevention and treatment of socially anxious people. Based on the theory of social skills deficits, we reviewed several studies that examined the adequacy of social behaviour through behavioural experiments with the purpose of evaluating the existence of lack of social skills in socially anxious people compared with the general population. In addition to electronic searches for papers published since 1970, using Medline, Scielo and Lilacs, references from articles were identified. In general, the results indicate that socially anxious people perform poorly in spontaneous social interactions than control participants, are classified by observers as less assertive, friendly and shy but present only discrete differences in structured situations. Social skills deficit seems to be more easily identified when children and adolescents are observed, since they probably still have not developed coping strategies. Differences between social phobics appear to be found on the more global measures of performance rather than specific skills measures.

AB  - Clinical characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the result of the degeneration of the neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Several mechanisms are implicated in the degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding, disturbances of dopamine (DA) metabolism and transport, neuroinflammation, and necrosis/apoptosis. The literature widely explores the neurotoxic models elicited by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Because of the models, it is known that basal ganglia, particularly substantia nigra, have been related to a diversity of functions, from motor to sleep regulation. Nevertheless, a current debate concerning the role of DA on the sleep-wake cycle is in progress. In summary, it is suggested that the dopaminergic system is implicated in the physiology of sleep, with particular regard to the influence of the SNpc neurons. The understanding of the functioning and connectivity of the SNpc neurons has become fundamental to discovering the neurobiology of these neurons.

AB  - Cultural neuroscience, the study of how cultural experience shapes the brain, is an emerging subdiscipline in the neurosciences. Yet, a foundational question to the study of culture and the brain remains neglected by neuroscientific inquiry: "How does cultural information get into the brain in the first place?" Fortunately, the tools needed to explore the neural architecture of cultural learning - anthropological theories and cognitive neuroscience methodologies - already exist; they are merely separated by disciplinary boundaries. Here we review anthropological theories of cultural learning derived from fieldwork and modeling; since cultural learning theory suggests that sophisticated imitation abilities are at the core of human cultural learning, we focus our review on cultural imitative learning. Accordingly we proceed to discuss the neural underpinnings of imitation and other mechanisms important for cultural learning: learning biases, mental state attribution, and reinforcement learning. Using cultural neuroscience theory and cognitive neuroscience research as our guides, we then propose a preliminary model of the neural architecture of cultural learning. Finally, we discuss future studies needed to test this model and fully explore and explain the neural underpinnings of cultural imitative learning.

AB  - Cyclical changes in production of neuroactive steroids during the oestrous cycle induce significant changes in GABA(A) receptor expression in female rats. In the periaqueductal grey (PAG) matter, upregulation of alpha 4 beta 1 delta GABA(A) receptors occurs as progesterone levels fall during late dioestrus (LD) or during withdrawal from an exogenous progesterone dosing regime. The new receptors are likely to be extrasynaptically located on the GABAergic interneurone population and to mediate tonic currents. Electrophysiological studies showed that when alpha 4 beta 1 delta GABAA receptor expression was increased, the excitability of the output neurones in the PAG increased, due to a decrease in the level of ongoing inhibitory tone from the GABAergic interneurones. The functional consequences in terms of nociceptive processing were investigated in conscious rats. Baseline tail flick latencies were similar in all rats. However, acute exposure to mild vibration stress evoked hyperalgesia in rats in LD and after progesterone withdrawal, in line with the upregulation of alpha 4 beta 1 delta GABA(A) receptor expression.

AB  - Basal ganglia neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), are characterized by not only spectrum of motor deficits, ranging form hypokinesia to hyperkinesia, but also emotional, cognitive, and psychiatric manifestations. The symptoms and pathogenic mechanism of these disorders Should be viewed as dysfunctions of specific corticosubcortical neurocircuits. Transgenic approaches using large genomic inserts, such as bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-mediated transgencis, due to its capacity to propagate large-size genomic DNA and faithful production of endogenous-like gene expression pattern/lever, have provided an ideal basis for the generation of transgenic mice as model for basal ganglia neurodegenerative disorders, as well as the functional and structural analysis Of neurocircuits. In this chapter, the basic concepts and practical approaches about application of BAC transgenic system are introduced. Existent major BAC transgenic mouse models for PD and HD are evaluated according to their construct, face, and predicative validity. Finally, considerations, possible solutions, and future perspectives of using BAC transgenic approach to study basal ganglia neurodegenerative disorders are discussed.

AB  - Research over the past several decades has documented psychosocial influences on the development and progression of several major medical illnesses. The field is now increasingly focused on identifying the biological and behavioral mechanisms underlying these effects. This review takes stock of the, knowledge accumulated in the biological arena to date and highlights conceptual and methodological approaches that have proven especially productive. It emphasizes the value of a disease-centered approach that "reverse engineers" adverse health outcomes into their specific biological determinants and then identifies psychologically modulated neuroendocrine and immunologic dynamics that modulate those pathological processes at the cellular and molecular levels.

AB  - The maximally-decoupled method has been considered as a theory to apply an basic idea of an integrability condition to certain multiple parametrized symmetries. The method is regarded as a mathematical tool to describe a symmetry of a collective submanifold in which a canonicity condition makes the collective variables to be an orthogonal coordinate-system. For this aim we adopt a concept of curvature unfamiliar in the conventional time-dependent (TD) self-consistent field (SCF) theory. Our basic idea lies in the introduction of a sort of Lagrange manner familiar to fluid dynamics to describe a collective coordinate-system. This manner enables us to take a one-form which is linearly composed of a TD SCF Hamiltonian and infinitesimal generators induced by collective variable differentials of a canonical transformation on a group. The integrability condition of the system read the curvature C = 0. Our method is constructed manifesting itself the structure of the group under consideration. To go beyond the maximaly-decoupled method, we have aimed to construct an SCF theory, i.e., nu (external parameter)-dependent Hartree-Fock (HF) theory. Toward such an ultimate goal, the nu-HF theory has been reconstructed on an affine Kac-Moody algebra along the soliton theory, using infinite-dimensional fermion. An infinite-dimensional fermion operator is introduced through a Laurent expansion of finite-dimensional fermion operators with respect to degrees of freedom of the fermions related to a nu-dependent potential with a Gamma-periodicity. A bilinear equation for the nu-HF theory has been transcribed onto the corresponding tau-function using the regular representation for the group and the Schur-polynomials. The nu-HF SCF theory on an infinite-dimensional Fock space F-infinity leads to a dynamics on an infinite-dimensional Grassmannian Gr(infinity) and may describe more precisely such a dynamics on the group manifold. A finite-dimensional Grassmannian is identified with a Gr(infinity) which is affiliated with the group manifold obtained by reducting gl(infinity) to sl(N) and su(N). As an illustration we will study an infinite-dimensional matrix model extended from the finite-dimensional su(2) Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model which is a famous exactly-solvable model.

AB  - This systematic review aimed to assess the effect of gender on the incidence of functional disability in the elderly. The search for publications in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Pro-Quest electronic databases from January 1990 to March 2008 identified 879 publications, from which 21 cohort studies were selected that evaluated gender as an independent variable and incidence of functional disability in elderly as the outcome. Review of the studies found that after adjusting for socioeconomic, health, and social relations indicators, incidence of functional disability was similar between genders. The main risk factors for functional disability in the elderly, regardless of gender, were: lack of schooling, living in rental housing, chronic diseases, arthritis, diabetes, visual impairment, body mass index above 25, poor self-perceived health, cognitive impairment, depression, slow gait, sedentary lifestyle, tiredness while performing daily activities, and limited diversity in social relations.

AB  - This article: (1) describes and reviews evidence for hypothesized biological and psychological mechanisms of winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD), (2) advocates for an integrative approach to studying SAD etiology that incorporates both biological and psychological mechanisms, and (3) delineates areas for future research from an integrative perspective. Exciting progress has been made within sub-paradigms testing candidate biological mechanisms (i.e., biological rhythm abnormalities, retinal subsensitivity to light, neurotransmitter alterations, and genetic variations) and psychological mechanisms (i.e., maladaptive cognitions and behaviors) of SAD. However, research from an integrative biological/psychological perspective is currently lacking. In contrast to a continued exclusive focus on micro-models, we argue that an integrative approach would maximize the capacity to predict and understand the onset, maintenance, and course of SAD. An integrative approach also provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for developing strategies to effectively treat acute SAD, maintain acute treatment gains throughout the winter, and prevent future episodes of this highly recurrent form of depression.

AB  - Background: Clinicians and researchers synthesize data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants to make conclusions about the efficacy of medications for depression. All treatments include nonspecific factors in addition to the specific effects of drugs, and study design may influence patient outcomes via nonspecific factors. This study investigated whether placebo control and treatment duration affect the outcome in antidepressant RCTs. Methods: Medline and the Cochrane Database were searched to identify RCTs of antidepressants for major depression approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Included studies enrolled outpatient participants aged 18-65, lasted 6-12 weeks, compared an antidepressant to placebo or another antidepressant and were published in English after 1985. Excluded trials enrolled inpatients, pregnant women and subjects with psychosis or mania. Mixed-effects logistic regression models including study type (placebo-controlled or comparator) and study duration (6, 8 or 12 weeks) as fixed effects determined whether these factors affected response and remission rates. Results: In the 90 trials analyzed, the odds of depression response (OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.45-2.17, p < 0.001) and remission (OR 1.53, 95% CI = 1.11-2.11, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in comparator relative to placebocontrolled trials. Trials lasting 8 (OR = 1.37, CI = 1.14-1.64, p = 0.001) and 12 (OR = 1.52, CI = 1.12-2.07, p = 0.008) weeks had significantly greater response rates than 6-week trials without differing themselves. Conclusions: Response and remission rates to antidepressants are significantly affected by study type and duration. Clinicians and researchers must consider the study design when interpreting and designing RCTs of antidepressant medications. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background: Bipolar disorder has generally been regarded as having a better functional outcome than schizophrenia. However, studies have suggested low functioning in bipolar patients even when they are in clinical remission. Our aim was to determine the degree of functioning and disability in bipolar patients. Secondly, we reviewed factors potentially associated with the low functioning of bipolar patients. Method: The authors conducted an extensive Medline and Pubmed search of the published literature from 1980 up to December 2007, using a variety of search terms to find relevant articles. Bibliographies of retrieved papers were further analysed for publications of interest. Articles that reported clinically significant findings on functioning and disability, and research reports were reviewed in detail. Results: From these articles, we determined that bipolar disorder is associated with significant impairment in work, family and social life, beyond the acute phases of the illness. The aspects that appear to increase the risk of low functioning and disability in bipolar patients are mainly subsyndromal symptoms and neurocognitive impairment, among others. Conclusions: Suitable pharmacological and psychological interventions may improve the level of functioning and reduce the disability in bipolar patients. Potential targets to be considered for intervention should be residual symptoms, comorbid conditions and neurocognitive deficits. Further research is required to better identify the factors that best predict functioning in bipolar patients. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - In modern economy the customer is confronted with a huge amount of consumer goods. In this situation, culturally based brands seem to play an important role in establishing strong emotional bonds between customers and goods and to guide people's economic behavior by biasing selections and preference decisions based on affect. Recently, neuroscientific approaches have demonstrated that cultural objects like brands or brand-related behavior may successfully be investigated with neuroimaging tools like fMRI. First studies suggested that structures associated with the reward circuit (striatum) and the dorsolateral part of the prefrontal cortex may be involved when perceiving a favorite brand. Hence, brands that have been associated with appetitive stimuli due to marketing efforts or cultural factors seem to engage similar brain networks than artificially associated reward stimuli. However, brands have different and complex meanings in our life far beyond representing objects of desire. For example, the possession of goods from certain kinds of brands often is used to mark the social state of the owner and to distinguish him or her from other groups. In particular, luxury goods often seem to have this function. Recent neuroimaging results support this observation by showing that viewing logos of luxury brands is associated with brain activity in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, a region known to be associated with self-centered cognitions. Thus, it seems that brands of luxury goods improve self-relevant thoughts, pointing to the role of luxury brands to mark the superior position of the owner in society. These results demonstrate that cultural symbols like brands can successfully be examined with neuroimaging approaches. Thus, along with advanced cultural theories, neuroeconomics may provide important contributions to the understanding of brand-related or economic behavior.

AB  - Diversion programs are initiatives in which persons with serious mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice system are redirected from traditional criminal justice pathways to the mental health and substance abuse treatment systems. This article is a review of the research literature conducted to determine whether the current evidence supports the use of diversion initiatives to reduce recidivism and to reduce incarceration among adults with serious mental illness with justice involvement. A structured literature search identified 21 publications or research papers for review that examined the criminal justice outcomes of various diversion models. The review revealed little evidence of the effectiveness of jail diversion in reducing recidivism among persons with serious mental illness. However, evidence was found that jail diversion initiatives can reduce the amount of jail time that persons with mental illness serve. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

Aims: To present an introduction to this field. Methods: Narrative review. Results: Preschool children appear to be capable of providing reliable testimony on highly salient personal experiences such as sexual abuse, though a substantial proportion of children may choose not to. However, suggestive interviewing practises, particularly when used with younger children, may elicit false allegations. There is little evidence to suggest that experiences from the preverbal period of life can later be meaningfully reconstructed by means of statements or clinical signs. Conclusions: Use of children as witnesses and informants requires special considerations, knowledge and skills.

AB  - In recent years, a number of functional and structural neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural bases of aggressive and violent behaviour in children and adolescents. Most functional neuroimaging studies have persued the hypothesis that pathological aggression is a consequence of deficits in the neural circuits involved in emotion processing. There is converging evidence for abnormal neural responses to emotional stimuli in youths with a propensity towards aggressive behaviour. In addition, recent neuroimaging work has suggested that aggressive behaviour is also associated with abnormalities in neural processes that subserve both the inhibitory control of behaviour and the flexible adaptation of behaviour in accord with reinforcement information. Structural neuroimaging studies in children and adolescents with conduct problems are still scarce, but point to deficits in brain structures in volved in the processing of social information and in the regulation of social and goal-directed behaviour. The indisputable progress that this research field has made in recent years notwithstanding, the overall picture is still rather patchy and there are inconsistencies between studies that await clarification. Despite this, we attempt to provide an integrated view on the neural abnormalities that may contribute to various forms of juvenile aggression and violence, and discuss research strategies that may help to provide a more profound understanding of these important issues in the future.

AB  - Does the cerebellum influence nonmotor behavior? Recent anatomical studies demonstrate that the output of the cerebellum targets multiple nonmotor areas in die prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex, as well as the cortical motor areas. The projections to different cortical areas originate from distinct output channels within the cerebellar nuclei. The cerebral cortical area that is the main target of each output channel is a major source of input to the channel. Thus, a closed-loop circuit represents the major architectural unit of cerebro-cerebellar interactions. The outputs of these loops provide the cerebellum with the anatomical substrate to influence the control of movement and cognition. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological data supply compelling support for this view. The range of tasks associated with cerebellar activation is remarkable and includes tasks designed to assess attention, executive control, language, working memory, learning, pain, emotion, and addiction. These data, along with the revelations about cerebro-cerebellar circuitry, provide a new framework for exploring the contribution of the cerebellum to diverse aspects of behavior.

AB  - Background: Measuring quality of life (QOL) is an important part in assessing the effects of treatments and health services on patients well-being. This kind of an assessment should be included when assessing the effects of preventive programmes. The aim was to explore whether QOL has been used as an outcome measure in fall prevention trials and to provide a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involve fall prevention interventions with an assessment of the effects on QOL among the aged. No previous systematic review about this topic among the aged was found. Methods: A search covering various medical databases was conducted to identify RCTs about the effects of fall prevention programmes on QOL. The 12 included studies were classified according to an appraisal of the population, the method of randomization, the intervention and control programmes, the QOL measures and the results. Methodological quality was assessed in relation to blinding at outcome assessment, length of follow-up and using intention to treat analysis. Results: Six studies out of 12 showed a positive effect on some dimensions of QOL (physical function, social function, vitality, mental health, environmental domain). The methods of interventions showing a positive effect varied. Conclusion: Only a few fall prevention studies reported a positive effect on QOL. Studies with larger sample sizes, longer follow-ups and multiple outcome measures are needed. QOL should be taken into account as an secondary outcome measure.

AB  - Although mankind stands to obtain great benefit from nanotechnology, it is important to consider the potential health impacts of nanomaterials (NMs). This consideration has launched the field of nanotoxicology, which is charged with assessing toxicological potential as well as promoting safe design and use of NMs. Although no human ailments have been ascribed to NMs thus far, early experimental studies indicate that NMs could initiate adverse biological responses that can lead to toxicological outcomes. One of the principal mechanisms is the generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidant injury. Because oxidant injury is also a major mechanism by which ambient ultrafine particles can induce adverse health effects, it is useful to consider the lessons learned from studying ambient particles. This review discusses the toxicological potential of NMs by comparing the possible injury mechanisms and adverse health effects of engineered and ambient ultrafine particles.

AB  - Cortical spreading depression (CSD) leads to dramatic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. However, mechanisms involved in promoting and counteracting cerebral vasodilator responses are unclear. Here we review the development and current status of this important field of research especially with respect to the role of perivascular nerves and nitric oxide (NO). It appears that neurotransmitters released from the sensory and the parasympathetic nerves associated with cerebral arteries, and NO released from perivascular nerves and/or parenchyma, promote cerebral hyperemia during CSD. However, the relative contributions of each of these factors vary according to species studied. Related to CSD, axonal and reflex responses involving trigeminal afferents on the pial surface lead to increased blood flow and inflammation of the overlying dura mater. Counteracting the cerebral vascular dilation is the production and release of constrictor prostaglandins, at least in some species, and other possibly yet unknown agents from the vascular wall. The cerebral blood flow response in healthy human cortex has not been determined, and thus it is unclear whether the cerebral oligemia associated with migraines represents the normal physiological response to a CSD-like event or represents a pathological response. In addition to promoting cerebral hyperemia, NO produced during CSD appears to initiate signaling events which lead to protection of the brain against subsequent ischemic insults. In summary, the cerebrovascular response to CSD involves multiple dilator and constrictor factors produced and released by diverse cells within the neurovascular unit, with the contribution of each of these factors varying according to the species examined.

AB  - In an effort to clarify how deductive reasoning is accomplished, an fMRI study was performed to observe the neural substrates of logical reasoning and mathematical calculation. Participants viewed a problem statement and three premises, and then either a conclusion or a mathematical formula. They had to indicate whether the conclusion followed from the premises, or to solve the mathematical formula. Language areas of the brain (Broca's and Wernicke's area) responded as the premises and the conclusion were read, but solution of the problems was then carried out by non-language areas. Regions in right prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobe were more active for reasoning than for calculation, whereas regions in left prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobe were more active for calculation than for reasoning. In reasoning, only those problems calling for a search for counterexamples to conclusions recruited right frontal pole. These results have important implications for understanding how higher cognition, including deduction, is implemented in the brain. Different sorts of thinking recruit separate neural substrates, and logical reasoning goes beyond linguistic regions of the brain. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The olivo-cerebellar system has been implicated in temporal coordination of task components. Here, we propose a novel model that enables the olivo-cerebellar system to function as a generator of temporal patterns. These patterns could be used for timing of motor, sensory and cognitive tasks, The proposed mechanism for the generation of these patterns is based on subthreshold oscillations in a network of inferior olivary neurons and their control by the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. Our model, which integrates a large body of anatomical and physiological observations, lends itself to simple, testable predictions and provides a new conceptual framework for olivo-cerebellar research.

AB  - Background
   Promoting the mental health of people bereaved through suicide is a key aim of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy.
   Aims
   To evaluate the effects of interventions to support people bereaved through suicide.
   Method
   We conducted a systematic review of data from controlled studies of interventions for people bereaved through suicide. Studies were identified using systematic searches, the methodological quality of included studies was assessed and narrative synthesis conducted.
   Results
   Eight studies were identified. None was UK-based and all but one study had substantial methodological limitations. when compared with no intervention, there was evidence of some benefit from single studies of a cognitive-behavioural family intervention of four sessions with a psychiatric nurse; a psychologist-led 10-week bereavement group intervention for children, and 8-week group therapy for adults delivered by a mental health professional and volunteer. The findings from studies comparing two or more active interventions were more equivocal.
   Conclusions
   Although there is evidence of some benefit from interventions for people bereaved by suicide, this is not robust. Further methodologically sound evidence is required to confirm whether interventions are helpful and, if so, for whom.

AB  - Cognitivism has dominated mainstream psychology for decades, but lately its position has been weakened. It has been criticized not only by behavior analysts but also by social and evolutionary psychologists, neuroscientists, and authors who are or used to be cognitivists themselves. At the same time, psychologists and neuroscientists in several fields are now rediscovering the necessity of understanding behavior in light of its functional relations. Hence a need for relevant knowledge is felt. Cognitive psychology has little to offer in this regard. Behavior analysis, on the other hand, possesses a wealth of relevant facts and theory. Though chances seem slight that mainstream psychology will return to behaviorism, a window of opportunity now exists for the reintegration of behavior-analytic research into the mainstream.

AB  - The increasing use of eye movement paradigms to assess the functional integrity of brain systems involved in sensorimotor and cognitive processing in clinical disorders requires greater attention to effects of pharmacological treatments on these systems. This is needed to better differentiate disease and medication effects in clinical samples, to learn about neurochemical systems relevant for identified disturbances, and to facilitate identification of oculomotor biomarkers of pharmacological effects. In this review, studies of pharmacologic treatment effects on eye movements in healthy individuals are summarized and the sensitivity of eye movements to a variety of pharmacological manipulations is established. Primary findings from these studies of healthy individuals involving mainly acute effects indicate that: (i) the most consistent finding across several classes of drugs, including benzodiazepines, first- and second-generation anti psychotics, anticholinergic agents, and anticonvulsant/mood stabilizing medications is a decrease in saccade and smooth Pursuit velocity (or increase in saccades during pursuit); (ii) these oculomotor effects largely reflect the general sedating effects of these medications on central nervous system functioning and are often dose-dependent; (iii) in many cases changes in oculomotor functioning are more sensitive indicators of pharmacological effects than other Measures; and (iv) other agents. including the antidepressant class of serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, direct serotonergic agonists, and Stimulants including amphetamine and nicotine, do not appear to adversely impact oculomotor functions in healthy individuals and may well enhance aspects of saccade and Pursuit performance. Pharmacological treatment effects on eye movements across several clinical disorders including schizophrenia, affective disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are also reviewed. While greater recognition and investigation into pharmacological treatment effects in these disorders is needed, both beneficial and adverse drug effects are identified. This raises the important caveat for oculomotor studies of neuropsychiatric disorders that performance differences from healthy individuals cannot be attributed to illness effects alone. In final Sections Of this review, Studies are presented that illustrate the utility Of eye movements for use as potential biomarkers in pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenetic studies. While more systematic studies are needed, we conclude that eye movement measurements hold significant promise as tools to investigate treatment effects on cognitive and sensorimotor processes in clinical populations and that their use may be helpful in speeding the drug development pathway for drugs targeting specific neural systems and in individualizing pharmacological treatments.

Autobiographical memories can be retrieved from either the 1st person perspective, in which individuals see the event through their own eyes, or from the 3rd person perspective, in which individuals see themselves and the event from the perspective of an external observer. A growing body of research suggests that the visual perspective from which a memory is retrieved has important implications for a person's thoughts, feelings, and goals, and is integrally related to a host of self-evaluative processes. We review the relevant research literature, present our theoretical model, and outline directions for future research. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Multimodal MR images can directly or indirectly help in identifying the substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, and raphe nuclei that contain monoamine neurons. Neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging can detect signal alterations in the substantia nigra pars compacta and/or locus ceruleus that occur in Parkinson's disease and psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. This technique seems to be promising for the noninvasive evaluation of the pathological or functional changes in the monoamine system that occur in degenerative and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin(IL)-1 beta is a main component in inflammatory pathways and is overexpressed in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Several studies report associations between IL-1 beta polymorphisms and AD, but findings from different studies are controversial. Our aim was to verify the correlation between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL-1 beta, at sites -511 and +3953, and AD by meta-analysis. Computerized bibliographic searches of PUBMED and AlzGene database (http://www.alzgene.org) were supplemented with manual searches of reference lists. There is evidence for association between IL-1 beta + 3953 SNP and AD, with an OR = 1.60 (95%C.I.: 1.16-2.22; Z = 2.83 p = 0.005) for TT genotype. No significant difference in genotype distribution of the IL-1 beta -511 SNP in AD was obtained, but high between-study heterogeneity was found. To reduce heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were performed using, as stratifying variables, characteristics of the population under study (age, gender, type of AD diagnosis, Mini Mental State Examination of the controls) and characteristics related to the study design (statistical power of individual studies). The frequency of the IL-1 beta -511 TT genotype resulted significantly higher than other genotypes only when the Caucasian studies with the highest statistical power were included in the subgroup analysis (OR = 1.32; 95% C.I.: 1.03-1.69; p = 0.03), with no evidence of between-study heterogeneity. our data support an association between the TT genotype of IL-1 beta +3953 SNP and AD, and suggest a possible association of the -511 TT genotype. Unreplicability of the results seems to be due mainly to the lack of statistical power of the individual studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thousands of man-made chemicals are annually released into the environment by agriculture, transport, industries, and other human activities. In general, chemical analysis of environmental samples used to assess the pollution status of a specific ecosystem is complicated by the complexity of the mixture, and in some cases by the very low toxicity thresholds of chemicals present. In that sense, a proteomics approach, capable of detecting subtle changes in the level and structure of individual proteins within the whole proteome in response to the altered surroundings, has obvious applications in the field of ecotoxicology. In addition to identifying new protein biomarkers, it can also help to provide an insight into underlying mechanisms of toxicity. Despite being a comparatively new field with a number of caveats, proteomics applications have spread from microorganisms and plants to invertebrates and vertebrates, gradually becoming an established technology used in environmental research. This review article highlights recent advances in the field of environmental proteomics, mainly focusing on experimental approaches with a potential to understand toxic modes of action and to identify novel ecotoxicological biomarkers.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to review the prevalence of polypharmacy with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in clinical practice, pharmacological reasons for such practice, and the evidence for and against such polypharmacy. Methods: Clinical trial reports, case reports, and reviews were identified by a PubMed literature search from 1966 through October 2006, with retrieved publications queried for additional references. We excluded reports on augmentation with non-antipsychotic medications and polypharmacy involving combinations of SGAs and first-generation (conventional) antipsychotics TGAs) or combinations of two FGAs. We identified 75 reports concerning SGA polypbarmacy, from which we extracted data on study design, sample size, medications, rating scales, outcome, and conclusions. Data from randomized controlled trials and larger case series are presented in detail and case reports are briefly discussed. Conclusions. Polypharmacy with SGAs is not uncommon, with prevalence varying widely (3.9%-50%) depending on setting and patient population, despite limited support from blinded, randomized, controlled trials or case reports that employed an A-B-A (monotherapy-combination therapy-monotherapy) design and adequate dosing and duration of treatment. Rather than prohibiting or discouraging co-prescription of SGAs, needs of patients and clinicians should be addressed through evidence-based algorithms. Based on unmet clinical needs and modest evidence from case reports, combinations of two SGAs may merit future investigation in efficacy trials involving patients with schizophrenia who have treatment-resistant illness (including partial response) or who are responsive to treatment but develop intolerable adverse effects. Other areas that may merit future research are efficacy of SGA polypharmacy for schizophrenia accompanied by comorbid conditions (e.g., anxiety, suicidal or self-injurious behavior, aggression) and for reducing length of stay in acute care settings.

AB  - Background
   It is unclear if research findings support clinical opinion that cannabis use leads to worse outcomes in people with psychosis, or whether this impression is confounded by other factors.
   Aims
   To systematically review the evidence pertaining to whether cannabis affects outcome of psychotic disorders.
   Method
   We searched 10 relevant databases (to November 2006) reference lists of included studies and contacted experts. We included 13 longitudinal studies from 15303 references. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently and in duplicate.
   Results
   Cannabis use was consistently associated with increased relapse and non-adherence. Associations with other outcome measures were more disparate. Few studies adjusted for baseline illness severity, and most made no adjustment for alcohol, or other potentially important confounders. Adjusting for even a few confounders often resulted in substantial attenuation of results.
   Conclusions
   Confidence that most associations reported were specifically due to cannabis is low. Despite clinical opinion, it remains important to establish whether cannabis is harmful, what outcomes are particularly susceptible, and how such effects are mediated. Studies to examine this further are eminently feasible.

AB  - Animals are motivated to choose environmental options that can best satisfy current needs. To explain such choices, this paper introduces the MOTIVATOR (Matching Objects To Internal VAlues Triggers Option Revaluations) neural model. MOTIVATOR describes cognitive-emotional interactions between higher-order sensory cortices and an evaluative neuraxis composed of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex. Given a conditioned stimulus (CS), the model amygdala and lateral hypothalamus interact to calculate the expected current value of the subjective outcome that the CS predicts, constrained by the current state of deprivation or satiation. The amygdala relays the expected value information to orbitofrontal cells that receive inputs from anterior inferotemporal cells, and medial orbitofrontal cells that receive inputs from rhinal cortex. The activations of these orbitofrontal cells code the subjective values of objects. These values guide behavioral choices. The model basal ganglia detect errors in CS-specific predictions of the value and timing of rewards. Excitatory inputs from the pedunculopontine nucleus interact with timed inhibitory inputs from model striosomes in the ventral striatum to regulate dopamine burst and dip responses from cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Learning in cortical and striatal regions is strongly modulated by dopamine. The model is used to address tasks that examine food-specific satiety, Pavlovian conditioning, reinforcer devaluation, and simultaneous visual discrimination, Model simulations successfully reproduce discharge dynamics of known cell types, including signals that predict saccadic reaction times and CS-dependent changes in systolic blood pressure.

AB  - Pesticides used in agriculture are designed to protect crops against unwanted species, such as weeds, insects, and fungus. Many compounds target the nervous system of insect pests. Because of the similarity in brain biochemistry, such pesticides may also be neurotoxic to humans. Concerns have been raised that the developing brain may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of neurotoxic pesticides. Current requirements for safety testing do not include developmental neurotoxicity. We therefore undertook a systematic evaluation of published evidence on neurotoxicity of pesticides in current use, with specific emphasis on risks during early development. Epidemiologic studies show associations with neurodevelopmental deficits, but mainly deal with mixed exposures to pesticides. Laboratory experimental studies using model compounds suggest that many pesticides currently used in Europe - including organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, ethylenebisdithiocarbamates, and chlorophenoxy herbicides - can cause neurodevelopmental toxicity. Adverse effects on brain development can be severe and irreversible. Prevention should therefore be a public health priority. The occurrence of residues in food and other types of human exposures should be prevented with regard to the pesticide groups that are known to be neurotoxic. For other substances, given their widespread use and the unique vulnerability of the developing brain, the general lack of data on developmental neurotoxicity calls for investment in targeted research. While awaiting more definite evidence, existing uncertainties should be considered in light of the need for precautionary action to protect brain development.

AB  - Neuropathological changes in Parkinson's disease progress slowly and spread according to a characteristic pattern. Recent papers have shed light on this progression of pathology by examining the fate of neurons grafted into the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. Two of these studies demonstrate that grafted healthy neurons can gradually develop the same pathology as host neurons in the diseased brains. According to these studies, implanted neurons developed alpha-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive Lewy bodies more than a decade after transplantation. We discuss the possible underlying mechanisms and their implications for how pathology spreads in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - It is not surprising that virtually all analyses of the Supreme Court stress the crucial role played by the swing, pivotal, or median Justice: in theory, the median should be quite poweful. In practice, however, some are far stronger than others. Just as there are "super precedents" and "super statutes "-those that are weightier or more entrenched than others-there are "super medians "-Justices so powerful that they are able to exercise significant control over the outcome and content of the Court's decisions.
   Conventional wisdom holds that Justices accumulate power by virtue of their personality, methodological approach, or even background characteristics. But our analysis suggests the opposite. Using sophisticated theoretical tools and systematically developed data, we demonstrate that the strength of the median has less to do with who occupies the center seat than with those Justices who sit close to the center. When median Justices are ideologically remote from their nearest colleagues, they will emerge as super medians. They will find themselves on the winning side of cases, breaking ties throughout the Term, and authoring opinions in key cases. But when medians are ideologically proximate to their closest colleagues, they will be far less dominant.
   This analysis has important implications for historical understandings of the Court, for identifying the best strategies for attorneys arguing before the Justices, and for predicting whether new appointees will affect the direction of the Court's decisions. We provide advice for advocates, as well as Presidents and senators contemplating judicial appointments, and identify plausible nominees for future Republican and Democratic administrations.

AB  - A neural model is presented that explains how outcome-specific learning modulates affect, decision-making. and Pavlovian conditioned approach responses. The model addresses how brain regions responsible for affective learning and habit learning interact and answers a central question: What are the relative contributions of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex to emotion and behavior? In the model. the amygdala calculates outcome value while the orbitofrontal cortex influences attention and conditioned responding by assigning value information to stimuli. Model simulations replicate autonomic. electrophysiological, and behavioral data associated with three tasks commonly used to assay these phenomena: Food consumption, Pavlovian conditioning, and visual discrimination. Interactions of the basal ganglia and amygdala with sensory and orbitofrontal cortices enable the model to replicate the complex pattern of spared and impaired behavioral and emotional capacities seen following lesions of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.

AB  - It is shown how w(infinity), w(1+infinity) gauge field theory actions in 2 D emerge directly from 4D gravity. Strings and membranes actions in 2 D and 3 D originate as well from 4D Einstein gravity after recurring to the nonlinear connection formalism of Lagrange-Finsler and Hamilton-Cartan spaces. Quantum gravity in 3D can be described by a W-infinity matrix model in D = 1 that can be solved exactly via the collective field theory method. We describe why a quantization of 4D gravity could be attained via a 2D quantum W-infinity gauge theory coupled to an infinite-component scalar-multiplet. A proof that noncritical W-infinity (super) strings are devoid of BRST anomalies in dimensions D = 27 ( D = 11), respectively, follows and which coincide with the critical (super) membrane dimensions D = 27 (D = 11). We establish the correspondence between the states associated with the quasifinite highest weights irreducible representations of W-infinity, (W) over bar (infinity) algebras and the quantum states of the continuous Toda molecule. Schrodinger-like quantum mechanics wave functional equations are derived and solutions are found in the zeroth-order approximation. Since higher-conformal spin W-infinity symmetries are very relevant in the study of 2D W-infinity gravity, the quantum Hall effect, large N QCD, strings, membranes,... it is warranted to explore further the interplay among all these theories.

AB  - The etiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is thought to involve interplay between environmental factors and predisposing genetic traits, although the identification of genetic risk factors remain elusive. The neurotoxicant, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidine (MPTP) produces parkinsonian-like symptoms and pathology in mice and humans. As sensitivity to MPTP is genetically determined in mice this provides an opportunity to identify genes and biological mechanisms that modify the response to an exogenous agent that produces a Parkinson's disease-like condition. MPTP primarily targets dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum and elicits changes in striatal gene expression. Therefore, we used Affymetrix(R) and qRT-PCR technology to characterize temporal mRNA changes in striatum in response to MPTP in genetically MPTP-sensitive, C57BL/6J, and MPTP-resistant Swiss Webster and BCL2-associated X protein (Bax)-/- mice. We identified three phases of mRNA expression changes composed of largely distinct gene sets. An early response (5 h) occurred in all strains of mice and multiple brain regions. In contrast, intermediate (24 h) and late (72 h) phases were striatum specific and much reduced in Swiss Webster, indicating these genes contribute and/or are responsive to MPTP-induced pathology. However, Bax-/- mice have robust intermediate responses. We propose a model in which the acute entry of MPP+ into dopaminergic nerve terminals damages them but is insufficient per se to kill the neurons. Rather, we suggest that the compromised nerve terminals elicit longer lasting transcriptional responses in surrounding cells involving production of molecules that feedback on the terminals to cause additional damage that results in cell death. In Swiss Webster, resistance lies upstream in the cascade of events triggered by MPTP and uncouples the acute events elicited by MPTP from the damaging secondary responses. In contrast, in Bax-/-mice resistance lies downstream in the cascade and suggests enhanced tolerance to the secondary insult rather than its attenuation. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background The assessment and treatment psychiatric disorders among individuals with developmental disorders is in a state of flux. Clinicians working in this field confront two heterogeneous conditions based on separate but overlapping biopsychosocial bodies of scientific and clinical experiences. Methods The paper is a review of the relevant literature and an effort to synthesize sokme of the major problem areas in differential diagnosis and treatment planning. Results There are many genetic, metabolic and neurobehavioral factors that influence both challenging behaviors and the emergence, recognition, and clinical course of mental disorders in people with developmental disorders. As such, clinicians need to redefine dichotomous thinking about boundaries between psychiatrics, neurologic, and behavioral disorders and therapies. Discussion Even though there are efforts to adapt our various systems of nomenclature for individuals with developmental disorders, most still rely on descriptive and categorical models. It may be time to reconsider models that incorporate etiological factors in the process of differential diagnosis and classification. By doing so, clinicians may enhance their capacity to match individuals with more finely tuned treatment plans.

AB  - The goal of this review is to critically examine contradictory findings in the study of visual search for emotionally expressive faces. Several key issues are addressed: Can emotional faces be processed preattentively and guide attention? What properties of these faces influence search efficiency? Is search moderated by the emotional state of the observer? The authors argue that the evidence is consistent with claims that (a) preattentive search processes are sensitive to and influenced by facial expressions of emotion, (b) attention guidance is influenced by a dynamic interplay of emotional and perceptual factors. and (c) visual search for emotional faces is influenced by the emotional state of the observer to some extent. The authors also argue that the way in which contextual factors interact to determine search performance needs to be explored further to draw sound conclusions about the precise influence of emotional expressions on search efficiency. Methodological considerations (e.g., set size, distractor background, task set) and ecological limitations of the visual search task are discussed. Finally. specific recommendations are made for future research directions.

AB  - This article presents a conceptual framework for the study of identity in the context of developmental and real-time. The framework consists of two dimensions related to the notion of time. One dimension involves the distinction between short- and long-term processes, or, as we call them, the micro- and macro-perspective on time. The second dimension focuses on the way time features in the explanation of change and development and concerns the distinction between static and dynamic approaches. Applying the framework to the existing literature on identity reveals empty slots in the descriptive space. Suggestions are given to fill one particular quadrant, the micro-dynamic field. Finally, we introduce dynamic systems theory as an integrative perspective on identity development. Dynamic systems theory serves as a basis to develop a theory of identity that does justice to the assumption that identity development is taking place on several interconnected time scales.

AB  - Back-to-school season can be an important time for enhancing dietary quality, which is vital to children's health and wellness. An abundance of scientific literature supports a critical role of proper nutrition in cognitive development, intellectual performance, and academic achievement. Improvement of nutrient intakes for children with inadequacies enhances mental functioning. Iron deficiency, which is the most common nutrient deficiency in the United States, has been implicated in poor cognition, and supplementation for iron-deficient children improves most scholastically related outcomes. School breakfast and lunch programs, which must adhere to the 2005 US Dietary Guidelines, offer a means to improve nutritional intake, particularly for children of low socioeconomic status. However, competing food and beverage sources, as well as refusal to consume healthful items of these meals, may reduce dietary advantages. Breakfast consumption is associated with many benefits in schoolchildren, including academic performance. Wholesome lunches and snacks can also be significant contributors to nutritional value over the course of a school day. Parents, teachers, and caregivers should be role models and advocates for health-promoting eating behaviors not only throughout the academic year but for a lifetime.

Method: This review was carried out on reports drawn from Medline, Web of Science and SciELO. Discussion: After the elucidation of the chemical structure of cannabidiol in 1963, the initial studies showed that cannabidiol was unable to mimic the effects of Cannabis. In the 1970's the number of publications on cannabidiol reached a first peak, having the research focused mainly on the interaction with delta9-THC and its antiepileptic and sedative effects. The following two decades showed lower degree of interest, and the potential therapeutic properties of cannabidiol investigated were mainly the anxiolytic, antipsychotic and on motor diseases effects. The last five years have shown a remarkable increase in publications on cannabidiol mainly stimulated by the discovery of its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects. These studies have suggested a wide range of possible therapeutic effects of cannabidiol on several conditions, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral ischemia, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, other inflammatory diseases, nausea and cancer Conclusion: In the last 45 years it has been possible to demonstrate that CBD has a wide range of pharmacological effects, many of which being of great therapeutic interest, but still waiting to be confirmed by clinical trials.

AB  - Global human population and urban development are increasing at unprecedented rates and creating tremendous stress on local, regional, and global air and water quality. However, little is known about how urban areas vary in their capacity to address effectively air and water quality impacts associated to urban development. There exists a need to better understanding the factors that mediate the interactions between urbanisation and variations of environmental quality. By synthesizing literatures on the relationship between urban development and air and water quality, we assess the amount of scholarship for each of these cities, characterize population growth rates in one hundred of the largest global cities, and link growth trends to changes in air and water quality. Our results suggest that, while there is a growing literature linking urbanisation and environmental quality, some regions of the globe are better represented than others, and that these trends are consistent with our characterization of population growth rates. In addition, the comparison between population growth rates and air and water quality suggest that multiple factors affect the environmental quality, and that approaching rates of urbanisation through the lens of 'resiliency' can be an effective integrative concept for studying the capacity of urban areas to respond to rapid rates of change. Based on these results we offer a framework for systematically assessing changes in air and water quality in megacities. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Future therapies for diseases associated with altered dopaminergic signaling, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and drug addiction or drug dependence may substantially build on the existence of intramembrane receptor-receptor interactions within dopamine receptor containing receptor mosaics (RM; dimeric or high-order receptor oligomers) where it is believed that the dopamine D-2 receptor may operate as the 'hub receptor' within these complexes. The constitutive adenosine A(2A)/dopamine D-2 RM, located in the dorsal striatopallidal GABA neurons, are of particular interest in view of the demonstrated antagonistic A(2A)/D-2 interaction within these heteromers; an interaction that led to the suggestion and later demonstration that A(2A) antagonists could be used as novel anti-Parkinsonian drugs. Based on the likely existence of A(2A)/D-2/mGluR5 RM located both extrasynaptically on striato-pallidal GABA neurons and on cortico-striatal glutamate terminals, multiple receptor-receptor interactions within this RM involving synergism between A(2A)/mGluR5 to counteract D-2 signaling, has led to the proposal of using combined mGluR5 and A(2A) antagonists as a future anti-Parkinsonian treatment. Based on the same RM in the ventral striato-pallidal GABA pathways, novel strategies for the treatment of schizophrenia, building on the idea that A(2A) agonists and/or mGluR5 agonists will help reduce the increased dopaminergic signaling associated with this disease, have been suggested. Such treatment may ensure the proper glutamatergic drive from the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus to the prefrontal cortex, one which is believed to be reduced in schizophrenia due to a dominance of D-2-like signaling in the ventral striatum. Recently, A(2A) receptors also have been shown to counteract the locomotor and sensitizing actions of cocaine and increases in A(2A) receptors have also been observed in the nucleus accumbens after extended cocaine self-administration, probably representing a compensatory up-regulation to counteract the cocaine-induced increases in dopamine D-2 and D-3 signaling. Therefore, A(2A) agonists, through antagonizing D-2 and D-3 signaling within A(2A)/D-2 and A(2)/D-3 RM heteromers in the nucleus accumbens, may be found useful as a treatment for cocaine dependence. Furthermore, antagonistic cannabinoid CB1/D-2 interactions requiring A(2A) receptors have also been discovered and possibly operate in CB1/D-2/A(2A) RM located principally on striatal glutamate terminals but also on some ventral striato-pallidal GABA neurons, thereby opening up a new mechanism for the integration of endocannabinoid, DA and adenosine mediated signals. Thus, A(2A), mGluR5 and/or CB1 receptors can form integrative units with D-2 receptors within RM displaying different compositions, topography and localization. Also galaninR/5-HT1A RM probably participates in the transmission of the ascending 5-hydroxytryptamine neurons, where galanin receptors antagonize 5-HT1A recognition and signaling. Subtype specific galanin receptor antagonists may therefore represent novel antidepressant drugs. These results suggest the importance of a complete understanding of the function of these RM with regard to disease.
   Ultimately receptor-recepor interactions within RM that modify dopaminergic and serotonergic signaling may give new strategies for treatment of a wide range of diseases associated with altered dopaminergic and serotonergic signaling. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These intermediate outcomes are supposed to predict work-related loss of productivity and disability at work. Methods: Original articles published in 1970 to 2005 were searched in MEDLINE and Psyc1NFO databases in a systematic manner The main search terms were leadership, job satisfaction, well-being, sick leave, and disability pension. Out of 303 references, 93 publications were retrieved. In addition, other sources produced 69 articles. The strength of. thoroughly analyzed; our conclu-evidence was evaluated comprehensively. Altogether, 109 articles were t sions are based on 27 articles providing the best evidence. Results: There was moderate evidence that leadership is associated with job well-being (risk ratio [RR] 1.40, range 1.36 to 1.57), sick leave (RR 0.73, range 0.70 to 0.89), and disability pension (RR 0.46, range 0.42 to 0.59). The evidence was weak on that leadership is associated with job satisfaction (median RR 2.23, range 1.30 to 3.51) but not with job performance (RR 1.13, range 0.55 to 1.20). Conclusions: There is a relative lack of well-founded prospective studies targeting the association between leadership and employee health, but the few, available good studies suggest an important role of leadership on employee job satisfaction, job well-being, sickness absences, and disability pensions. The relationship between leadership and job, performance remains nuclear.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Recently, PD research has been stimulated by the identification of genes that are implicated in rare familial forms of PD. However, despite these discoveries, the primary cause of PD is still unclear. Various pathogenic mechanisms may be involved including mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasomal dysfunction/protein aggregation, oxidative damage, environmental factors and genetic disposition. Furthermore, dopamine has also been implicated in contributing to the pathogenesis of PD. This review will focus on the genes that have been identified to be associated with PD and how they may impair dopamine metabolism. Understanding the role of these PD-related genes in dopamine neurobiology may provide insight into the underpinning pathogenic mechanisms of PD. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aluminum toxicity is an important stress factor for plants in acidic environments. During the last decade considerable advances have been made in both techniques to assess the potentially toxic Al species in environmental samples, and knowledge about the mechanisms of Al toxicity and resistance in plants. After a short introduction on Al risk assessment, this review aims to give an up-to-date glance into current developments in the field of Al toxicity and resistance in plants, also providing sufficient background information for non-specialists in aluminum research. Special emphasis is paid to root growth and development as primary targets for Al toxicity. Mechanisms of exclusion of Al from sensitive root tips, as well as tolerance of high Al tissue levels are considered. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article details the history and development of the National Highway and Safety Administration's Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. They are reviewed in terms of relevant scientific, psychometric, and legal issues. It is concluded that the research that supports their use is limited, important confounding variables have not been thoroughly studied, reliability is mediocre, and that their developers and prosecution-oriented publications have oversold the tests. Further, case law since their development has severed the tests from their validation data, so that they are not admissible on the criterion for which they were validated (blood alcohol concentration), and admissible for a criterion for which they were not (mental, physical, or driving impairment). Directions for further research are presented.

AB  - Retinoids are important signals in brain development. They regulate gene transcription by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and, as was discovered recently, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). Traditional ligands of PPAR are best known for their functions in lipid metabolism and inflammation. RAR and PPAR are ligand-activated transcription factors, which share members of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) family as heterodimeric partners. Both signal transduction pathways have recently been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Since inflammatory processes contribute to various neurodegenerative diseases, the anti-inflammatory activity of retinoids and PPAR gamma agonists recommends them as potential therapeutic targets. In addition, genetic linkage studies, transgenic mouse models and experiments with vitamin A deprivation provide evidence that retinoic acid signaling is directly involved in physiology and pathology of motoneurons, of the basal ganglia and of cognitive functions. The activation of PPAR/RXR and RAR/RXR transcription factors has therefore been proposed as a therapeutic strategy in disorders of the central nervous system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the alluring aspects of examining chromatin modifications in the role of modulating transcription required for long-term memory processes is that these modifications may provide transient and potentially stable epigenetic marks in the service of activating and/or maintaining transcriptional processes. These, in turn, may ultimately participate in the molecular mechanisms required for neuronal changes subserving long-lasting changes in behavior. As an epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional control, chromatin modification has been shown to participate in maintaining cellular memory (e. g., cell fate) and may underlie the strengthening and maintenance of synaptic connections required for long-term changes in behavior. Epigenetics has become central to several fields of neurobiology, where researchers have found that regulation of chromatin modification has a significant role in epilepsy, drug addiction, depression, neurodegenerative diseases, and memory. In this review, we will discuss the role of chromatin modifying enzymes in memory processes, as well as how recent studies in yeast genetics and cancer biology may impact the way we think about how chromatin modification and chromatin remodeling regulate neuronal function.

AB  - Background This is a companion paper to our earlier review of psychological treatments for people with personality disorder that examined the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Here, we report on the evidence of pharmacological treatments from RCTs for people with personality disorder. As in the previous report, this paper incorporates information from an earlier review that examined the evidence to 2002, and extends it to December 2006. As in the previous paper, this review restricts itself to the findings from RCTs, and excludes evidence from other study designs; however, details of these other studies will be posted in the National Personality Disorder Institute Website (http://www.pdinstitute.org.uk).
   Aim This study aimed to examine the evidence from RCTs to justify intervening with pharmacological treatments in people with personality disorder.
   Method Fifteen electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO) were searched to the end of December 2006 for any RCT of a pharmacological intervention for participants meeting DSM or ICD criteria for personality disorder. Outcomes were grouped using a similar symptomological categorization to that suggested by Soloff in 1998.
   Results This methodology identified 35 trials for inclusion. The main positive findings were those favouring the use of anticonvulsants to reduce aggression, and of anti-psychotics to reduce cognitive perceptual and mental state disturbance. However, there were major methodological deficiencies in the trial designs, including small numbers of participants and limited duration of treatment and follow-up.
   Conclusion This review identifies a very limited evidence base to justify intervening with drugs in this group. Reasons why this should be so are examined that relate to fundamentally differing conceptualizations of how any intervention might impact in an individual with personality disorder.

AB  - There has been an abundance of literature devoted to the involvement of noradrenaline in basic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep processes since the subject was first investigated in 1964. Nowadays, the great majority of studies highlight the need for silence in the locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons as a condition for the occurrence and maintenance of REM sleep. However, throughout the successive years of work on this topic, few researchers have consistently claimed that some amount of noradrenaline is essential for the appearance of this sleep stage. in the first part of this review, each of the papers published in this field is analyzed. Then, in the discussion, arguments supporting the requirement for a given level of noradrenaline for REM sleep occurrence are presented. This second part also examines, based on waking noradrenergic influences on higher integrated brain processes, the major consequences of noradrenergic neuron silence during REM sleep for mental functioning.

AB  - The cerebellum is a brain structure involved in the coordination, control and learning of movements, and elucidation of its function is an important issue. Japanese scholars have made seminal contributions in this field of neuroscience. Electrophysiological studies of the cerebellum have a long history in Japan since the pioneering works by Ito and Sasaki. Elucidation of the basic circuit diagram of the cerebellum in the 1960s was followed by the construction of cerebellar network theories and finding of their neural correlates in the 1970s. A theoretically predicted synaptic plasticity, long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fibre to Purkinje cell synapse, was demonstrated experimentally in 1982 by Ito and co-workers. Since then, Japanese neuroscientists from various disciplines participated in this field and have made major contributions to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying LTD. An important pathway for LTD induction is type-1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) and its downstream signal transduction in Purkinje cells. Sugiyama and co-workers demonstrated the presence of mGluRs and Nakanishi and his pupils identified the molecular structures and functions of the mGluR family. Moreover, the authors contributed to the discovery and elucidation of several novel functions of mGluR1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells. mGluR1 turned out to be crucial for the release of endocannabinoid from Purkinje cells and the resultant retrograde suppression of transmitter release. It was also found that mGluR1 and its downstream signal transduction in Purkinje cells are indispensable for the elimination of redundant synapses during post-natal cerebellar development. This article overviews the seminal works by Japanese neuroscientists, focusing on mGluR1 signalling in cerebellar Purkinje cells.

AB  - Hypobaric hypoxia (HH), a predisposing environmental condition at high altitude (HA) encountered by many mountaineers jeopardizes their normal physiology like motor coordination and cognitive functions. Our previous studies revealed that the HH induces oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, which is associated with spatial memory impairment in rats. However, the dendritic changes after exposure to different duration of HH remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the duration-dependent dendritic changes in CA1, CA3 and entorhinal cortex (EC) of hippocampus and layer II of prefrontal cortex (PFC) with spatial memory functions in rats on exposure to different duration of HH. The rats were exposed to simulated HA of 6 100 m for 3, 7, 14 and 21 days and the spatial reference memory was investigated using Morris water maze (MWM) and the morphological alteration of CA1, CA3, EC and layer II of PFC were investigated. There was a significant decrease in dendritic arborization and spine number along with increased number of damaged neurons, after 3, 7 and 14 days of HH but after 21 days of HH exposure the structural recovery was noted in all the regions. There was impairment of spatial memory after 3 and 7 days of exposure, but slight improvement of spatial memory was noted after 14 and 21 days of exposure. Our studies suggested that HH induces dendritic plasticity of PFC and hippocampal pyramidal neurons of rat brain, which might be associated with improvement of spatial memory function after 21 days of HH exposure.

Unfortunately, the first 30 years of candidate-based association studies have provided little information about the specific genetic contributors. This article reviews genetic association studies of suicidal phenotypes published to date. Possible theoretical, methodological, and operational challenges accounting for the modest success of association studies in the field are also discussed. The authors conclude that future research may benefit from using a more systematic and comprehensive selection of candidate genes and variants, examining gene-environment and gene-gene interactions, and investigating higher-order moderators.

AB  - Dopamine is a potentially toxic neurotransmitter that has long been speculated to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent work has demonstrated the importance of proper storage of dopamine in vesicles to maintain dopamine homeostasis, thus protecting neurons from the detrimental effects of dopamine accumulation and breakdown in the cytosol. These studies suggest that factors which affect dopamine storage might increase the susceptibility of dopamine neurons to further environmental or genetic insults, exacerbating the neuronal degeneration that characterizes PD. This review seeks to revisit the pathogenicity of cytosolic dopamine and further address the critical role of neurotransmitter storage in dopamine-mediated neurotoxicity.

AB  - Exercise that engages the cardiovascular system has a myriad of effects on the body; however, we usually do not give much consideration to the benefits it may have for our minds. An increasing body of evidence suggests that exercise can have some remarkable effects on the brain. In this article, we will introduce how exercise can impact the capacity for neurons in the brain to communicate with one another. To properly convey this information, we will first briefly introduce the field of synaptic plasticity and then examine how the introduction of exercise to the experimental setting can actually alter the basic properties of synaptic plasticity in the brain. Next, we will examine some of the candidate physiological processes that might underlay these alterations. Finally, we will close by noting that, taken together, this data points toward our brains being dynamic systems that are in a continual state of flux and that physical exercise may help us to maximize the performance of both our body and our minds.

AB  - Objectives. To review the current literature on the health effects of vitamin D, especially the effects on inhabitants living in the northern latitudes.
   Study Design. Literature review.
   Methods The scientific literature concerning health effects of vitamin D was reviewed and the current dietary recommendations for inhabitants living in northern latitudes were discussed.
   Results. Vitamin D is a steroid-structured hormone produced in the skin upon exposure to UVB-radiation or obtained from certain,food products (for example, liver). Its production,is mediated by the vitamin D receptor, which belongs to the nuclear receptor family, and exerts its function as a transcription factor regulating several target genes. Active metabolites of vitamin D play an important role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Deficiency of vitamin D results in diminished bone mineralization and an increased risk of fractures. In addition, vitamin D is connected to a variety of other diseases that include different cancer types, muscular weakness, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, schizophrenia and depression.
   Conclusions. Vitamin D plays a fundamental role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. A deficiency of vitamin D has been attributed to several diseases. Since its production in the skin depends on exposure to UVB-radiation via the sunlight, the level of vitamin D is of crucial importance for the health of inhabitants who live in the Nordic latitudes where there is diminished exposure to sunlight during the winter season. Therefore, fortification or supplementation of vitamin D is necessary for most of the people living in the northern latitudes during the winter season to maintain adequate levels of circulating 25(OH)D-3 to maintain optimal body function and prevent diseases.

AB  - Salt marshes are challenging habitats due to natural variability in key environmental parameters including temperature, salinity, ultraviolet light, oxygen, sulfides, and reactive oxygen species. Compounding this natural variation, salt marshes are often heavily impacted by anthropogenic insults including eutrophication, toxic contamination, and coastal development that alter tidal and freshwater inputs. Commensurate with this environmental variability, estuarine animals generally exhibit broader physiological tolerances than freshwater, marine, or terrestrial species. One factor that determines an organism's physiological tolerance is its ability to upregulate "stress-response genes" in reaction to particular stressors. Comparative studies on diverse organisms have identified a number of evolutionarily conserved genes involved in responding to abiotic and biotic stressors. We used homology-based scans to survey the sequenced genome of Nematostella vectensis, the starlet sea anemone, an estuarine specialist, to identify genes involved in the response to three kinds of insult-physiochemical insults, pathogens, and injury. Many components of the stress-response networks identified in triploblastic animals have clear orthologs in the sea anemone, meaning that they must predate the cnidarian-triploblast split (e.g., xenobiotic receptors, biotransformative genes, ATP-dependent transporters, and genes involved in responding to reactive oxygen species, toxic metals, osmotic shock, thermal stress, pathogen exposure, and wounding). However, in some instances, stress-response genes known from triploblasts appear to be absent from the Nematostella genome (e.g., many metal-complexing genes). This is the first comprehensive examination of the genomic stress-response repertoire of an estuarine animal and a member of the phylum Cnidaria. The molecular markers of stress response identified in Nematostella may prove useful in monitoring estuary health and evaluating coastal conservation efforts. These data may also inform conservation efforts on other cnidarians, such as the reef-building corals.

AB  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the main intracellular pathway for regulated protein turnover. This system is of vital importance for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is essential for neuronal functioning. It is therefore not surprising that impairment of this system is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including neurological disorders, which are pathologically characterized by the presence of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates. A direct correlation between intact neuronal functioning and the UPS is exemplified by a range of transgenic mouse models wherein mutations in components of the UPS lead to a neurodegenerative or neurological phenotype. These models have been proven useful in determining the role of the UPS in the nervous system in health and disease. Furthermore, recently developed in vivo models harboring reporter systems to measure UPS activity could also substantially contribute to understanding the effect of neurodegeneration on UPS function. The role of the UPS in neurodegeneration in vivo is reviewed by discussing the currently available murine models showing a neurological phenotype induced by genetic manipulation of the UPS.

AB  - Oxidative imbalance is a prominent feature in Alzheimer's disease and ageing. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can result in disordered cellular metabolism due to lipid peroxidation, protein-cross linking, DNA damage and the depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). NAD+ is a ubiquitous pyridine nucleotide that plays an essential role in important biological reactions, from ATP production and secondary messenger signalling, to transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. Chronic oxidative stress may be associated with NAD+ depletion and a subsequent decrease in metabolic regulation and cell viability. Hence, therapies targeted toward maintaining intracellular NAD+ pools may prove efficacious in the protection of age-dependent cellular damage, in general, and neurodegeneration in chronic central nervous system inflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, in particular.

AB  - Objective: To provide a comprehensive overview of the research on organizational changes aimed at improving health care for patients with severe mental illness and to learn lessons for mental health practice from the results.
   Method: We searched for systematic literature reviews published in English during 2000 to 2007 in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Systematic Reviews. Three reviewers independently selected and assessed the studies' quality. Studies involving changes of who delivers health care, how care is organized, or where care is delivered were included. We categorized the studies using an existing taxonomy of 6 broad categories of strategies for organizational change.
   Results: A total of 21 reviews were included. Among these, 17 had reasonably good methodological quality. Almost all reviews included or intended to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 6 reviews did not identify studies that met eligibility criteria. Multidisciplinary teams and integrated care models had been reviewed most frequently (a total of 15 reviews). In most studies, these types of changes showed better outcomes in terms of symptom severity, functioning, employment, and housing, compared with conventional services. Different results were found on cost savings. Other types of organizational changes, such as changing professional roles or introducing quality management or knowledge management, were much less frequently reviewed. Very few reviews looked at effects of organizational changes on professional performance.
   Conclusions: There is a fairly large body of evidence of the positive impact of multidisciplinary teams and integrated care changes on symptom severity, functioning, employment, and housing of people with severe mental illness, compared with conventional services. Other strategies, such as changes in professional roles, quality or knowledge management, have either not been the subject of systematic reviews or have not been evaluated in RCTs. There is still a lack of insight in the so-called black box of change processes and the impact of change on professional performance.

AB  - Aging is the most important risk factor for common neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Aging in the central nervous system has been associated with elevated mutation load in mitochondrial DNA, defects in mitochondrial respiration and increased oxidative damage. These observations support a 'vicious cycle' theory which states that there is a feedback mechanism connecting these events in aging and age-associated neurodegeneration. Despite being an extremely attractive hypothesis, the bulk of the evidence supporting the mitochondrial vicious cycle model comes from pharmacological experiments in which the modes of mitochondrial enzyme inhibition are far from those observed in real life. Furthermore, recent in vivo evidence does not support this model. In this review, we focus on the relationship among the components of the putative vicious cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of mitochondrial defects on oxidative stress.

AB  - We study observables in a conformal field theory which are very closely related to the ones used to describe hadronic events at colliders. We focus on the correlation functions of the energies deposited on calorimeters placed at a large distance from the collision. We consider initial states produced by an operator insertion and we study some general properties of the energy correlation functions for conformal field theories. We argue that the small angle singularities of energy correlation functions are controlled by the twist of non-local light-ray operators with a definite spin. We relate the charge two point function to a particular moment of the parton distribution functions appearing in deep inelastic scattering. The one point energy correlation functions are characterized by a few numbers. For N = 1 superconformal theories the one point function for states created by the R-current or the stress tensor are determined by the two parameters a and c characterizing the conformal anomaly. Demanding that the measured energies are positive we get bounds on a/c. We also give a prescription for computing the energy and charge correlation functions in theories that have a gravity dual. The prescription amounts to probing the falling string state as it crosses the AdS horizon with gravitational shock waves. In the leading, two derivative, gravity approximation the energy is uniformly distributed on the sphere at infinity, with no fluctuations. We compute the stringy corrections and we show that they lead to small, non-gaussian, fluctuations in the energy distribution. Corrections to the one point functions or antenna patterns are related to higher derivative corrections in the bulk.

AB  - Background: Approximately two-thirds of patients with depression experience physical pain symptoms. Coexisting pain complicates the treatment of depression and is associated with worse depression outcomes. Objective: The authors reviewed the effect of newer antidepressants on pain in patients with depression. Method: The authors searched systematically for trials of second-generation antidepressants that enrolled depression patients and reported pain outcomes, pooling changes on the pain visual-analog scale (VAS), using random-effects models. Results: Eight trials were eligible. Pooled analysis of head-to-head trials showed no difference in VAS between duloxetine and paroxetine. Both drugs were superior to placebo. Conclusion: The authors found insufficient evidence to support the choice of one second-gene ration antidepressant over another in patients with pain accompanying depression.

AB  - Objective: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a ubiquitous and debilitating phenomenon for patients both during and after treatment for cancer of all types. This review will outline the complex neurobiological mechanisms underlying CRF and their relevance to various treatment routes. It will cover aspects of screening, diagnosis and treatment, including both pharmacological and behavioral interventions for CRF. The goal of the article was not to perform a comprehensive literature review or meta-analysis, but rather to integrate clinically relevant information from different areas of research related to cancer fatigue, including etiology, diagnosis and management for a nonspecialist audience.
   Method: The methodology used involved broadly surveying the literature available on Medline using such search terms as "cancer," "fatigue," "cytokine" and "depression," exploring relevant articles over the past 15 years and relevant citations from these articles and focusing on recent advances in the study of CRF.
   Results: CRF occurs at high prevalence rates during and subsequent to cancer treatment. Multidisciplinary approaches are available for the assesment and management of fatigue including underlying contributory factors.
   Conclusions: An increasing base for evidence is present to guide the management of CRF. Additional research is warranted to understand the neurobiological mechanisms, etiology and risk factors for fatigue. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rates of tobacco use among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia have been estimated as high as 80%. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the high rate of tobacco use among this vulnerable group. This study examined the tobacco industry's efforts to establish and promulgate beliefs about schizophrenic individuals' need to smoke and the hazards of quitting. The current study analyzed previously secret tobacco industry documents. The initial search was conducted during January-July 2005 in the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library. The search yielded 280 records dating from 1955 to 2004. Documents indicate the tobacco industry monitored or directly funded research supporting the idea that individuals with schizophrenia were less susceptible to the harms of tobacco and that they needed tobacco as self-medication. The tobacco industry promoted smoking in psychiatric settings by providing cigarettes and supporting efforts to block hospital smoking bans. The tobacco industry engaged in a variety of direct and indirect efforts that likely contributed to the slowed decline in smoking prevalence in schizophrenia via slowing nicotine dependence treatment development for this population and slowing the rate of policy implementation vis-a-vis smoking bans on psychiatric units.

AB  - The aim of the present paper was to describe the mechanisms and management of anti psychotic-induced weight gain in schizophrenia patients. A comprehensive literature review of all available articles on the mechanisms and management of antipsychotic-induced weight gain was done by searching databases PsychINFO and PubMed. A summary of the available guidelines for monitoring of anti psychotic-induced weight gain and metabolic syndrome is also provided. There has been a substantial increase in the number of studies investigating the mechanisms and management of antipsychotic-induced weight gain after 2002. These include advances in the understanding of pharmacogenomics of weight gain and several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating pharmacological and psychological treatments to promote weight loss. The most effective strategy for prevention of weight gain is the choice of antipsychotic medication with low weight gain potential. In individuals with established weight gain and metabolic issues, switching to an antipsychotic agent with lower weight gain potential and/or lifestyle modifications with physical activity are most effective in promoting weight loss. Pharmacological agents such as orlistat and sibutramine are effective in general obesity but have not been sufficiently evaluated in anti psychotic-induced weight gain. The case to prescribe routine pharmacological treatment to promote weight loss is weak. Long-term, pragmatic studies are required to inform clinical practice. Weight gain in schizophrenia is associated with significant physical and psychological morbidity. Achieving an optimal trade-off between effectiveness and side-effects of antipsychotic agents, although difficult, is achievable. This should be based on three main principles: (i) a shared decision-making model between the patient, clinician and carer(s) when choosing an antipsychotic; (ii) a commitment to baseline and follow-up monitoring with explicit identification of the responsible individual or team; and (iii) the adoption of clear structured protocols for clinicians to follow in case of clinically significant weight gain and metabolic issues, which should incorporate greater collaboration between various health professionals from psychiatric and medical specialist services.

AB  - Convincing evidence supports a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases. The model includes the formation of radical oxygen species (ROS) and the misassembly and aggregation of proteins when three tiers of cellular defence are insufficient: (a) direct antioxidative systems, (b) molecular damage repairing systems, and (c) compensatory chaperone synthesis. The aim of the present overview is to introduce (a) the basics of free radical and antioxidant metabolism, (b) the role of the protein quality control system in protecting cells from free radical damage and its relation to chronic diseases, (c) the basics of the ultraweak luminescence as marker of the oxidant status of biological systems, and (d) the research in human photon emission as a non-invasive marker of oxidant status in relation to chronic diseases. In considering the role of free radicals in disease, both their generation and their control by the antioxidant system are part of the story. Excessive free radical production leads to the production of heat shock proteins and chaperone proteins a a second line of protection against damage. Chaperones at the molecular level facilitate stress regulation vis-a-vis protein qualify control mechanisms. The manifestation of misfolded proteins and aggregates is a hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, arnylotrophic lateral sclerosis, polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, diabetes and many others. Each of these disorders exhibits aging-dependent onset and a progressive, usually fatal clinical course.
   The second part reviews the current status of human photon emission techniques and protocols for recording the human oxidative status. Sensitive photornultiplier tubes may provide a tool for non-invasive and continuous monitoring of oxidative metabolism. In that respect, recording ultraweak luminescence has been favored compared to other indirect assays. Several biological models have been used to illustrate the technique in cell cultures and organs in vivo. This initiated practical applications addressing specific human pathological issues. Systematic studies on human emission have presented information on: (a) procedures for reliable measurements, and spectral analysis, (b) anatomic intensity of emission and left-right symmetries, (c) biological rhythms in emission, (d) physical and psychological influences on emission, (e) novel physical characteristics of' emission, and (f) the identification of ultraweak photon emission with the staging of ROS-related damage and disease.
   It is concluded that both patterns and physical properties of ultraweak photon emission hold considerable promise as measure for the oxidative status.

AB  - Background: Systematic reviews based on efficacy trials are inconclusive about which second generation antipsychotic drug (SGA) should be preferred in normal clinical practice, and studies with longer duration and more pragmatic designs are called for. Effectiveness studies, also known as naturalistic, pragmatic, practical or real life studies, adhere to these principles as they aim to mimic daily clinical practice and have longer follow-up.
   Objective: To review the head-to-head effectiveness of SGAs in the domains of global outcomes, symptoms of disease, and tolerability.
   Methods: Searches were made in Embase, PubMED, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials for effectiveness studies published from 1980 to 2008, week 1. Different combinations of the keywords antipsychotic*, neuroleptic* AND open, pragmatic, practical, naturalistic, real life, effectiveness, side effect*, unwanted effect*, tolera* AND compar* AND random* were used.
   Results: Sixteen different reports of randomized head-to-head comparisons of SGA effectiveness were located. There were differences regarding sample sizes, inclusion criteria and follow-up periods, as well as sources of financial sponsorship. In acute-phase and first-episode patients no differences between the SGAs were disclosed regarding alleviating symptoms of disease. Olanzapine was associated with more weight gain and adverse effects on serum lipids. In the chronic phase patients olanzapine groups had longer time to discontinuation of treatment and better treatment adherence compared to other SGAs. The majority of studies found no differences between the SGAs in alleviating symptoms of psychosis in chronically ill patients. Olanzapine was associated with more metabolic adverse effects compared to the others SGAs. There were surprisingly few between-drug differences regarding side effects. First generation antipsychotics were associated with lower total mental health care costs in 2 of 3 studies on chronically ill patients, but were also associated with more extrapyramidal side effects compared to the SGAs in several studies.
   Conclusion: In chronically ill patients olanzapine may have an advantage over other SGAs regarding longer time to treatment discontinuation and better drug adherence, but the drug is also associated with more metabolic side effects. More effectiveness studies on first-episode psychosis are needed.

AB  - It is widely accepted that the complexity and adaptability of neuronal communication, which is necessary for integrative and higher functions of the brain, is amply represented by plastic changes occurring at synaptic level. Therefore, long-term modifications of synaptic efficacy between neurons have been considered the cellular basis of learning and memory. Accordingly, there is a plethora of experimental evidence supporting this contention. Indeed, synaptic modifications in the hippocampus, the cerebral and cerebellar cortices regulate composite neuronal functions such those related to cognition, awareness, memory storage, and motion.
   In recent years, the concept that enduring changes of excitatory glutamatergic synaptic potentials [long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)] are not limited to the hippocampus and cortices but occur also in other brain areas has emerged. For instance, plasticity at different excitatory pathways has been clearly demonstrated in the basal ganglia.
   Here we present an overview of the experimental data regarding synaptic plasticity in the basal ganglia and highlight how results reported in the literature are often contradictory, especially when compared to those obtained in the hippocampal area. In trying to propose possible explanations to some of these contradictions, we present a holistic approach that re-interprets the basal ganglia synaptic plasticity in terms of expression of physiological and pathological phenomena and therapeutic effects of drugs.

AB  - The ability to share the other's feelings, known as empathy, has recently become the focus of social neuroscience studies. We review converging evidence that empathy with, for example, the pain of another person, activates part of the neural pain network of the empathizer, without first hand pain stimulation to the empathizer's body. The amplitude of empathic brain responses is modulated by the intensity of the displayed emotion, the appraisal of the situation, characteristics of the suffering person such as perceived fairness, and features of the empathizer such as gender or previous experience with pain-inflicting situations. Future studies in the field should address inter-individual differences in empathy, development and plasticity of the empathic brain over the life span, and the link between empathy, compassionate motivation, and prosocial behavior.

AB  - Progress in ecotoxicological research documents that crustaceans are highly vulnerable to diverse chemicals and toxicants in the environment. In particular, pollutants affecting endocrine homeostasis in crustaceans (i.e., endocrine disruptors) are intensively studied, and serious reproductive disorders have been documented. In this review, current knowledge about the endocrine regulation of the crustacean reproduction is put together with the published ecotoxicological data with an attempt to summarize the potential of xenobiotics to affect crustacean reproduction. Following gaps and trends were identified: (1) Studies are required in the field of neurohormone (serotonin and dopamine) regulation of the reproduction and possible modulations by environmental toxicants such as antidepressant drugs. (2) Molting-related parameters (regulated by ecdysteroid hormones) axe closely coordinated with the development and reproduction cycles in crustaceans (cross-links with methyl farnesoate signalling), and their susceptibility to toxicants should be studied. (3) Other biochemical targets for xenobiotics were recently discovered in crustaceans and these should be explored by further ecotoxicological studies (e.g., new information about ecdysteroid receptor molecular biology). (4) Some sex steroid hormones known from vertebrates (testosterone, progesterone) have been reported in crustaceans but knowledge about their targets (crustacean steroid receptors) and signalling is still limited. (5) Determination of the sex in developing juveniles (affecting the sex ratio in population) is a sensitive parameter to various xenobiotics (including endocrine disruptors) but its modulation by general environmental stress and non-specific toxicity should be further studied.

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has quickly become the most prominent tool in cognitive neuroscience. In this article, I outline some of the limits on the kinds of inferences that can be supported by fMRI, focusing particularly on reverse inference, in which the engagement of specific mental processes is inferred from patterns of brain activation. Although this form of inference is weak, newly developed methods from the field of machine learning offer the potential to formalize and strengthen reverse inferences. I conclude by discussing the increasing presence of fMRI results in the popular media and the ethical implications of the increasing predictive power of fMRI.

Electrophysiological studies in rodents offer a useful starting point for developing models of hippocampal processing in the spatial domain. Here we review one such model that points to an essential role for the hippocampus in the construction of mental images. We explain how this neural-level mechanistic account addresses some of the current controversies in the field, such as the role of the hippocampus in imagery and short-term memory, and discuss its broader implications for the neural bases of episodic memory.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder and in most patients its aetiology remains unknown. Molecular genetic studies in familial forms of the disease identified key proteins involved in PD pathogenesis, and support a major role for mitochondrial dysfunction, which is also of significant importance to the common sporadic forms of PD. While current treatments temporarily alleviate symptoms, they do not halt disease progression. Drugs that target the underlying pathways to PD pathogenesis, including mitochondrial dysfunction, therefore hold great promise for neuroprotection in PD. Here we summarize how the proteins identified through genetic research (alpha-synuclein, parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2 and HTRA2) fit into and add to our current understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD. We highlight how these genetic findings provided us with suitable animal models and critically review how the gained insights will contribute to better therapies for PD.

AB  - Background: The pandemic of HIV/AIDS is actually a composite of many regional and national-level epidemics. The progress made in many parts of the developed and developing world is tempered by the continued devastating consequences of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This review focuses on the ways in which children and adolescents are impacted by the epidemic, giving particular attention to their mental health. Methods: A health promotion framework is adopted to guide analysis. Three issues are covered: prevention of HIV infection, care and treatment of children infected with HIV, and care of children whose caregivers are ill or have died of AIDS. Existing reviews and literature search engines were used to review the scientific literature, focusing on the past five years. Results: Preventive interventions continue to manifest limited benefits in behavioral changes. More complex causal models and improved behavioral measures are needed. In the African context, the time has come to view pediatric AIDS as a chronic disease in which the mental health of caregivers and children influences important aspects of disease prevention and management. Increasingly sophisticated studies support earlier findings that social and psychological functioning, educational achievement and economic well-being of children who lose parents to AIDS are worse than that of other children. Conclusions: Important changes are taking place in SSA in increased access to HIV testing and antiretroviral therapies. To be effective in promoting mental health of children and adolescents, interventions require a more fundamental understanding of how to build HIV competence at personal and community levels. A key recommendation calls for the design and execution of population-based studies that include both multilevel and longitudinal features. Such rigorous conceptual and empirical investigations that assess the capacities of children are required to mobilize children, families and communities in comprehensive actions plans for prevention, treatment and care in response to the enduring HIV/AIDS pandemic.

AB  - Objectives: In the last 20 years, an increasing number of articles have been published about effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on memory. Here, we review autobiographical memory studies in particular because there have been conflicting reports about the extent and persistence of ECT effects and the period before treatment from which memories are most likely to be affected.
   Methods: Five psychological and medical databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, and Web of Knowledge) were searched from 1980 to 2007, yielding 15 studies of ECT and autobiographical memory.
   Results: Evidence suggests that autobiographical memory impairment does occur as a result of ECT. Objective measures found memory loss to be relatively short term (<6 months posttreatment), whereas subjective accounts reported amnesia to be more persistent (>6 months post-ECT). Electroconvulsive therapy predominantly affects memory of prior personal events that are near the treatment (within 6 months). Autobiographical memory loss is reduced by using brief pulse ECT rather than sine wave-unilateral positioning of electrodes rather than bilateral-and by titrating electrical current relative to the patient's own seizure threshold.
   Conclusions: Further research is required to determine memory loss associated with ECT, controlling for the direct effects of the depressive state.

AB  - Objective: Facing an adverse physical or psychosocial situation, an individual is forced to adapt in order to survive. Allostasis is the term used to refer to adapting processes used to maintain the stability of an organism through active processes. When allostatic response is excessive or inefficient, the organism develops an allostatic load. The cascade of molecular and neurobiological effects associated with childhood abuse and neglect could be an example of allostatic response that could precipitate allostatic load in organism still vulnerable during its development. This article reviews the psychobiological consequences related to childhood abuse and neglect. Method: A selective review with a systematic procedure was performed to investigate studies showing explicit association between childhood maltreatment and psychobiological/neurobiological consequences. We searched electronic database MedLine-PubMed to identify English-language articles from 1990 to 2007. Results: From 115 articles we selected 55 studies from MedLine and 30 from their reference lists, in a total of 85 articles (JCR IF range: 1-31.4; median: 5.88). Only 29 studies showed direct and explicit association between them. Conclusion: Structural consequences of childhood maltreatment include disruptive development of corpus callosum, left neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdale; functional consequences include increased electrical irritability in limbic areas, frontal lobe dysfunctions and reduced functional activity of the cerebellar vermis; and neurohumoral consequences include the reprogramming activity of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and subsequently the stress response.

AB  - Objective: Community-based care for mental disorders places considerable burden on families and carers. Measuring their experiences has become a priority, but there is no consensus on appropriate instruments. We aimed to review instruments carers consider relevant to their needs and assess evidence for their use.
   Method: A literature search was conducted for outcome measures used with mental health carers. Identified instruments were assessed for their relevance to the outcomes identified by carers and their psychometric properties.
   Results: Three hundred and ninety two published articles referring to 241 outcome measures were identified, 64 of which were eligible for review (used in three or more studies). Twenty-six instruments had good psychometric properties; they measured (i) carers' well-being, (ii) the experience of caregiving and (iii) carers' needs for professional support.
   Conclusion: Measures exist which have been used to assess the most salient aspects of carer outcome in mental health. All require further work to establish their psychometric properties fully.

AB  - A major component of consolidation theory holds that protein synthesis is required to produce the synaptic modification needed for long-term memory storage. Protein synthesis inhibitors have played a pivotal role in the development of this theory. However, these commonly used drugs have unintended effects that have prompted some to reevaluate the role of protein synthesis in memory consolidation. Here we review the role of protein synthesis in memory formation as proposed by consolidation theory calling special attention to the controversy involving the non-specific effects of a group of protein synthesis inhibitors commonly used to study memory formation in vivo. We argue that molecular and genetic approaches that were subsequently applied to the problem of memory formation confirm the results of less selective pharmacological studies. Thus, to a certain extent, the debate over the role of protein synthesis in memory based on interpretational difficulties inherent to the use of protein synthesis inhibitors may be somewhat moot. We conclude by presenting avenues of research we believe will best provide answers to both long-standing and more recent questions facing field of learning and memory. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Incapacitation of dangerous individuals has conventionally entailed the exercise of physical control over an actual body: the state confines the person in jail. But advances in technology have changed that convention. A variety of new technologies-such as GPS tracking bracelets, biometric scanners, online offender indexes, and DNA databases-give the government power to control dangerous persons without relying on any exertion of physical control. The government can track the location of a person in real time, receive remote notification that an individual has ingested alcohol, or electronically zone someone into a home or out of a public park. It can prove conclusively that a particular person wore a hat or took a sip from a discarded soda can, or identify a single face in a ten thousand-person crowd. In this day and age, restraint of the dangerous can be as much about keeping people out of a place as it used to be about locking them up in one.
   But whereas physical incapacitation of dangerous persons has always invoked some measure of constitutional scrutiny, virtually no legal constraints circumscribe the use of its technological counterpart. Across legal doctrines, courts erroneously treat physical deprivations as the archetypal "paradigm of restraint," and thus largely overlook the significant threat to liberty posed by technological measures. Similarly, little academic attention has been paid to the state's use of targeted forms of non-physical control. Much scholarly interest has focused on the increased use of physical incapacitation as a means of exerting regulatory control over, for example, illegal immigrants, pretrial detainees, or the mentally ill. And an equally vibrant debate surrounds the protection of information privacy in general society. Yet nearly no attention has been paid to the connection between these two developments.
   This Article examines the generally unheeded intersection between two well-documented trends: the state's increasing desire to preventively regulate targeted classes of individuals, and its increasing capacity to use innovative technologies, rather than physical incapacitation, to realize that desire. This Article identifies four loosely grouped emerging technologies of control: DNA databasing, electronic monitoring, electronic indexing, and biometric scanning. It then reviews the legal landscape on which they operate and demonstrates that, across the range of doctrines, courts unduly focus on the physical world as the relevant metric against which all restraints are judged. As a result, technologies of restraint are imposed without necessary procedural safeguards. This Article then outlines four concerns peculiar to these kinds of restraints and illustrates how significant concerns are wholly overlooked when the physical world is the determinant referent of comparison. The Article closes by urging greater judicial scrutiny of technological restraint and by laying out a series of potential inquiries that might aid in such an effort.

Methods Using electronic searches and previous reviews, selected and reviewed published studies in which immunological changes related to psychological interventions were assessed in pediatric samples. Results Eight studies were identified and included in the review. These utilized a range of interventions (e.g., disclosure and hypnosis) and included a variety of pediatric samples (e.g., those with asthma, HIV infection, or lupus). Conclusions Results suggest that psychological intervention can influence immune function in pediatric samples. Recommendations for advancing our knowledge by studying populations for whom the immune system plays an active role in disease pathophysiology, measuring disease-relevant immune mediators, studying pediatric patients under times of stress, and focusing on interventions aimed at altering the stress system are provided.

AB  - Water is vital for plant growth and development. Water-deficit stress, permanent or temporary, limits the growth and the distribution of natural vegetation and the performance of cultivated plants more than any other environmental factors do. Although research and practices aimed at improving water-stress resistance and water-use efficiency have been carried out for many years, the mechanism involved is still not clear. Further understanding and manipulating plant-water relations and water-stress tolerance at the scale of physiology and molecular biology can significantly improve plant productivity and environmental quality. Currently, post-genomics and metabolomics are very important to explore anti-drought gene resource in different life forms, but modern agricultural sustainable development must be combined with plant physiological measures in the field, on the basis of which post-genomics and metabolomics will have further a practical prospect. In this review, we discussed the anatomical changes and drought-tolerance strategies under drought condition in higher plants.

AB  - The concept of intuition has, until recently, received scant scholarly attention within and beyond the psychological sciences, despite its potential to unify a number of lines of inquiry. Presently, the literature on intuition is conceptually underdeveloped and dispersed across a range of domains of application, from education, to management, to health. In this article, we clarify and distinguish intuition from related constructs, such as insight, and review a number of theoretical models that attempt to unify cognition and affect. Intuition's place within a broader conceptual framework that distinguishes between two fundamental types of human information processing is explored. We examine recent evidence from the field of social cognitive neuroscience that identifies the potential neural correlates of these separate systems and conclude by identifying a number of theoretical and methodological challenges associated with the valid and reliable assessment of intuition as a basis for future research in this burgeoning field of inquiry.

AB  - Objective: To critically appraise the published evidence for risk factors for injuries and deaths relating to work-related road traffic crashes.
   Design: Systematic review.
   Data sources: Electronic databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Transport database, and the Australian Transport and Road Index (ATRI) database. Additional searches included websites of relevant organizations, reference lists of included studies, and issues of major injury journals published within the past 5 years.
   Inclusion criteria: Studies were included if they investigated work-related traffic crashes or related injuries or deaths as the outcome, measured any potential risk factor for work-related road traffic crash as an exposure, included a relevant comparison group, and were written in English.
   Methods: Included studies were critically appraised using the GATE-lite critical appraisal form (www.epiq.co.nz). Meta-analysis was not attempted because of the heterogeneity of the included studies.
   Findings: Of 25 studies identified, three of four robust (case-control and case-crossover) studies found an increased injury risk (i) among workers after extended shifts, (ii) for tractor-trailers with brake and steering defects, and (iii) for "double configuration'' trucks. The fourth study showed that alcohol and drug use were not risk factors in an industry with a random testing policy. The best cross-sectional studies showed associations between injury and sleepiness, time spent driving, occupational stress, non-insulin-dependent uncomplicated diabetes, and use of narcotics and antihistamines.
   Conclusions: Modifiable behavioral and vehicle-related risk factors are likely to contribute to work-related traffic injury. Fatigue and sleepiness-the most commonly researched topics-were consistently associated with increased risk.

AB  - Objectives: Depressive episodes and symptoms are common in bipolar disorder and are often treated with medication. The aim of this literature review is to critically examine the empirical evidence supporting the pharmacological treatment options in bipolar depression.
   Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with parallel-group design of medications for bipolar depression were identified using PubMed. Reference sections were searched for publications of additional RCTs. The quality of the trials was rated.
   Results: We identified 35 studies. Most trials are of moderately good quality, underpowered and use active comparators of uncertain merit. Large and replicated clinical trials support the efficacy of quetiapine and the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine. One very large trial found olanzapine alone to be efficacious. One study found lamotrigine to be superior to placebo on some outcome measures, but several negative lamotrigine trials have remained unpublished. The efficacy of lithium is supported by small trials in mixed samples. There is no convincing evidence that antidepressants are effective in bipolar depression, with the possible exception of tranylcypromine.
   Conclusion: Quetiapine, and olanzapine alone or in combination with fluoxetine, are well documented treatments for bipolar depression. The evidence in favour of lithium and lamotrigine is weaker. Commonly prescribed antidepressants are probably unhelpful.

AB  - In his Yasenkanna and other writings Zen master Hakuin Ekaku (1686-1769) relies on two seemingly conflicting analogies to speak of the art of nourishing life (yojo). On the one hand, he maintains that vital energy (ki) must be stored in the cinnabar field (tanden). On the other hand, he maintains that one must circulate vital energy in the body by engaging in labor lest it become stagnant. A similar tension can be observed in Kaibara Ekken's (1630-1714) immensely popular manual of nourishing life, Yojokun. Although Shigehisa Kuriyama points to the industrious revolution and what he calls the "anxiety of stagnation" that swept through the Tokugawa populace as a possible cause for the rise of this tension, the present article will suggest a fundamental redefinition of labor (ro) and, more specifically, reading practices that took place during this period as another possible factor behind this development. Labor, be it meditation or reading, had to demonstrate a sense of self-mastery for it to be true labor and failure to do so would result in exhaustion (ro) or what Hakuin preferred to call the malady of meditation (zenbyo).

AB  - While the importance of vasopressin (Avp) in the neuroendocrine regulation of behaviour is clear, most of Avp's effects on behaviour have been linked to its action via its 1a receptor (Avpr1a) subtype. There is, however, emerging evidence and cross-species consensus that the vasopressin 1b receptor (Avpr1b) is also important in mediating the effects of Avp on behaviour. The Avpr1b is highly expressed in the anterior pituitary where it is thought to play a role in the neuroendocrine response to stress. The Avpr1b is also prominently expressed in the pyramidal cells of the CA2 hippocampal area. Interestingly, in mice, Avpr1b mRNA within the pyramidal neurons of the CA2 field is unaffected by restraint stress or adrenalectomy. Avpr1b knockout mice (-/-) have provided strong, consistent evidence that the Avpr1b plays a critical role in the regulation of social behaviour. Avpr1b(-/-) mice display reduced levels of social forms of aggression, reduced social motivation and impaired social memory (including the Bruce effect). Avpr1b(-/-) mice, however, have normal main olfactory ability, spatial memory and defensive and predatory behaviours. Mice lacking a functional accessory olfactory system display many of these same behavioural deficits, suggesting that Avpr1b(-/-) mice may have a deficit in the processing, perception and/or integration of olfactory stimuli detected by the accessory olfactory system. We suggest that the role of the Avpr1b is to couple socially relevant accessory olfactory cues with the appropriate behavioural response. Furthermore, given its prominence in the CA2 field of the hippocampus, we hypothesize that Avpr1b may be important for the formation or recall of memories that have an olfactory-based social component.

AB  - Background. The "Soteria paradigm" attempts to support people diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using a minimal medication approach. Interest in this approach is growing in the United Kingdom, several European countries, North America, and Australasia. Aims: To summarize the findings from all controlled trials that have assessed the efficacy of the Soteria paradigm for the treatment of people diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Methods: A systematic search strategy was used to identify controlled studies (randomized, pseudorandomized, and nonrandomized) employing the Soteria paradigm to treat adults and adolescents meeting the criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders according to International Classification of Diseases and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders criteria. Results: We identified 3 controlled trials involving a total of 223 participants diagnosed with first- or second-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. There were few major significant differences between the experimental and control groups in any of the trials across a range of outcome measures at 2-year follow-up, though there were some benefits in specific areas. Conclusions: The studies included in this review suggest that the Soteria paradigm yields equal, and in certain specific areas, better results in the treatment of people diagnosed with first- or second-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders (achieving this with considerably lower use of medication) when compared with conventional, medication-based approaches. Further research is urgently required to evaluate this approach more rigorously because it may offer an alternative treatment for people diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

AB  - Mutations in the SNCA gene are causal for familial Parkinson disease/Lewy body disease. alpha-Synuclein is a small acidic protein that binds loosely to the surface of vesicles and may play a role in synaptic dynamics, although its normal function remains somewhat unclear. What is clear is that point mutations or increased expression of wild type alpha-synuclein causes disease. A great deal of literature supports the overall hypothesis that alpha-synuclein is damaging to neurons because it is inherently prone to aggregation; mutations or increased concentration of the protein both increase this tendency. An unproven, but popular, contention is that the toxic species are small oligomers that are relatively soluble, which may react with membranes to damage key processes within the cell. The details of this process, especially in determining the order of events and the requirement of particular processes in cell death, are unclear. Derangements in vesicle processing, including synaptic function, protein turnover, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, have all been suggested to occur. Whether there is a sequence of events or whether these are interacting effects is unclear, but the outcome is to trigger cell death, by both apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms depending on the system studied. In this article, we develop a framework for thinking about alpha-synuclein in terms of initiating events and secondary processes that are required to trigger neuronal dysfunction and cell death.

AB  - In this review, the functional interactions between serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) neuronal systems are discussed with the focus on microdialysis studies in the rodent brain (mainly rats). 5-HT by itself is involved both directly and indirectly via actions on complex neuronal circuitry, in the regulation of DA release through multiple 5-HT receptors, playing a critical role in the development of normal and abnormal behaviours. Recent evidence suggests that dysfunction of dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems contributes to various disorders including depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. Here we summarize recent neurochemical works that have extensively explored the role of 5-HT receptors in the control of DA central systems in both basal and drug-induced conditions, using in vivo microdialytic techniques. Several 5-HT receptor subtypes, including the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors, act to facilitate DA release, while the 5-HT2C receptor mediates an inhibitory effect of 5-HT on DA release. Taken together, neurochemical approaches using microdialysis can not only contribute to clarification of the physiological role of the serotonergic neuronal systems but may also be a powerful pharmacological approach for the development of therapeutic strategies to the treatment of depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and drug abuse.

AB  - Mitochondrial diseases (encephalomyopathies) have traditionally been ascribed to defects of the respiratory chain, which has helped researchers explain their genetic and clinical complexity. However, other mitochondrial functions are greatly important for the nervous system, including protein importation, organellar dynamics, and programmed cell death. Defects in genes controlling these functions are attracting increasing attention as causes not only of neurological (and psychiatric) diseases but also of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. After discussing some pathogenic conundrums regarding the neurological manifestations of the respiratory chain defects, we review altered mitochondrial dynamics in the etiology of specific neurological diseases and in the physiopathology of more common neurodegenerative disorders.

The review sought to 1) synthesize findings related to the scale's normative scores, reliability, and validity (factorial, convergent, and predictive), and 2) examine the objective and subjective subscales' performance. A literature search yielded 158 studies reporting findings for the SIS. Psychometric properties were summarized. Studies supported the scale's reliability, especially that of the subscale assessing self-reported (versus circumstantial indicators) of intent. Mixed findings emerged regarding convergent and predictive validity. The review identified shortcomings in factorial validity and the subscales' performance, especially for adolescents. The Suicide Intent Scale has some strengths, but the weaknesses require further investigation into how to better measure intent to die in attempted suicide.

TI  - Midbrain dopaminergic neuron fate specification: Of mice and embryonic stem cells
AB  - The midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area play a fundamental role in the control of voluntary movement and the regulation of emotion, and are severely affected in Parkinson's disease. Recent advances in mouse genetics and vertebrate development have provided us with insight into the genetic cascades involved in the development of mDA neurons, including the induction of mDA neuron progenitors in the ventral mesencephalon, the specification of the mDA neuronal fate and the maintenance of postmitotic mDA neurons. In parallel, rapid progress has been made in the generation of DA neurons from pluripotent stem cells and the development of stem cell-based therapies for Parkinson's disease. Here, we summarize the new findings via the developmental progression of mDA neurons and outline how this knowledge has been exploited to develop novel paradigms for the in vitro generation of these neurons from embryonic stem cells.

AB  - Despite decades of societal investment in artificial learning systems, truly "intelligent" systems have yet to be realized. These traditional models are based on input-output pattern optimization and/or cognitive production rule modeling. One response has been social robotics, using the interaction of human and robot to capture important cognitive dynamics such as cooperation and emotion; to date, these systems still incorporate traditional learning algorithms. More recently, investigators are focusing on the core assumptions of the brain "algorithm" itself-trying to replicate uniquely "neuromorphic" dynamics such as action potential spiking and synaptic learning. Only now are large-scale neuromorphic models becoming feasible, due to the availability of powerful supercomputers and an expanding supply of parameters derived from research into the brain's interdependent electrophysiological, metabolomic and genomic networks. Personal computer technology has also led to the acceptance of computer-generated humanoid images, or "avatars", to represent intelligent actors in virtual realities. In a recent paper, we proposed a method of virtual neurorobotics (VNR) in which the approaches above (social-emotional robotics, neuromorphic brain architectures, and virtual reality projection) are hybridized to rapidly forward-engineer and develop increasingly complex, intrinsically intelligent systems. In this paper, we synthesize our research and related work in the field and provide a framework for VNR, with wider implications for research and practical applications.

AB  - Scientists in many different fields have been attracted to the study of habits because of the power habits have over behavior and because they invoke a dichotomy between the conscious, voluntary control over behavior, considered the essence of higher-order deliberative behavioral control, and lower-order behavioral control that is scarcely available to consciousness. A broad spectrum of behavioral routines and rituals can become habitual and stereotyped through learning. Others have a strong innate basis. Repetitive behaviors can also appear as cardinal symptoms in a broad range of neurological and neuropsychiatric illness and in addictive states. This review suggests that many of these behaviors could emerge as a result of experience-dependent plasticity in basal ganglia-based circuits that can influence not only overt behaviors but also cognitive activity. Culturally based rituals may reflect privileged interactions between the basal ganglia and cortically based circuits that influence social, emotional, and action functions of the brain.

AB  - Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare genetically based neurodevelopmental disorder which is associated with mental retardation and a distinctive cognitive and behavioural profile, including weaknesses in visuospatial processing but preserved language abilities and face recognition. Relative to the cognitive characteristics of WS, there is a dearth of research into the movement problems associated with this syndrome. This is despite the evidence from clinical and experimental studies that indicate disordered movement may be an important neuromotor characteristic of WS. This article reviews the current neuroanatomical and behavioural literature on visuomotor deficits in WS, and examines the differential role of fronto-parietal and cerebellar regions in motor dysfunction. The role of these brain regions in disturbances of visuomotor control is discussed in the context of the important interaction with attention, executive and planning deficits in WS. Finally, directions are provided for future research emphasising the need to examine developmental changes in motor functioning across a range of movement parameters and to investigate the functional correlates of abnormal neural connectivity in WS. It is concluded that further investigation of motor dysfunction in WS may provide us with a greater understanding of how important movement-related brain regions develop and operate.

Our review, the first in this series to survey cognitive theory and research spanning the entire field of industrial and organizational psychology, considers theoretical, empirical, and methodological advances across 10 substantive domains; of application. Two major traditions, the human factors and organizational traditions, have dominated cognitively oriented research in this field. Our central message is that the technological and human systems underpinning contemporary organizational forms are evolving in ways that demand greater cooperation among researchers across both traditions. Such cooperation is necessary in order to gain theoretical insights of sufficient depth and complexity to refine the explanation and prediction of behavior in organizations and derive psychologically sound solutions to the unprecedented information-processing burdens confronting the twenty-first century workforce.

AB  - Ethical considerations in psychiatric genetics are highly complex and fluid. This review introduces the reader to the wide range of ethical considerations in this field by examining four characteristics of genetic information. First, genetic information may, to a greater or lesser extent, predict a person's future health. Second, learning about one's genotype may have profound psychosocial consequences. Third, genetic information pertains to a person's biological relatives and thus can affect family members, communities, and population groups. Finally, psychiatric genetics is a rapidly evolving field. None of these characteristics is necessarily "exceptional" or unique to genetics, but they provide a useful framework for teasing apart a complex set of ethical considerations. This article reviews conceptual and empirical data that speak to these four characteristics and then presents a set of conceptual frameworks that can be used to systematically analyze the ethics of psychiatric genetic research and clinical genotyping. Finally, directions for future study are described-including the urgent need to gather data on actual risks and benefits of psychiatric genetic research and clinical applications, so that their utility can be assessed and appropriate ethical safeguards identified.

AB  - Whereas semiclassical gravity is based on the semiclassical Einstein equation with sources given by the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of quantum fields, stochastic semiclassical gravity is based on the Einstein-Langevin equation, which has, in addition, sources due to the noise kernel. The noise kernel is the vacuum expectation value of the (operator-valued) stress-energy bitensor, which describes the fluctuations of quantum-matter fields in curved spacetimes. A new improved criterion for the validity of semiclassical gravity may also be formulated from the viewpoint of this theory. In the first part of this review we describe the fundamentals of this new theory via two approaches: the axiomatic and the functional. The axiomatic approach is useful to see the structure of the theory from the framework of semiclassical gravity, showing the link from the mean value of the stress-energy tensor to the correlation functions. The functional approach uses the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path effective action methods. In the second part, we describe three applications of stochastic gravity. First, we consider metric perturbations in a Minkowski spacetime, compute the two-point correlation functions of these perturbations and prove that Minkowski spacetime is a stable solution of semiclassical gravity. Second, we discuss structure formation from the stochastic-gravity viewpoint, which can go beyond the standard treatment by incorporating the full quantum effect of the inflaton fluctuations. Third, using the Einstein-Langevin equation, we discuss the backreaction of Hawking radiation and the behavior of metric fluctuations for both the quasi-equilibrium condition of a black-hole in a box and the fully nonequilibrium condition of an evaporating black hole spacetime. Finally, we briefly discuss the theoretical structure of stochastic gravity in relation to quantum gravity and point out directions for further developments and applications.

AB  - Locomotion in humans and other vertebrates is based on spinal pattern generators, which are regulated by supraspinal control. Most of our knowledge about the hierarchical network of supraspinal locomotion centres derives from animal experiments, mainly in the cat. Here we summarize evidence that the supraspinal network of quadrupeds is conserved in humans despite their transition to bipedalism. By use of mental imagery of locomotion in fMRI we found (1), locomotion modulates sensory systems and is itself modulated by sensory signals. During automated locomotion in healthy subjects cortical sensory inhibition occurs in vestibular and somatosensory areas; this inhibition is cancelled in the congenitally blind; (2), we delineated separate and distinct areas in the brainstem and cerebellum which are remarkably similar to the feline locomotor network. The activations found here include homologues to the pacemakers for gait initiation and speed regulation in the interfastigial cerebellum and bilateral midbrain tegmentum (cerebellar and mesencephalic locomotor regions), their descending target regions in the pontine reticular formation, and the rhythm generators in the cerebellar vermis and paravermal cerebellar cortex. This conservation of the basic organization of supraspinal locomotor control during vertebrate phylogeny opens new perspectives for both, the diagnosis and treatment of common gait disorders. It is conceivable that electrical stimulation of locomotor brain stem centres may initiate and improve gait in selected patients suffering from Parkinson's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy.

AB  - Psychiatric practice is becoming increasingly more complex in terms of the available treatment options, use of new technologies for assessments, and a need for psychiatric patients and their caregivers to be familiar with general medical procedures. This trend will only intensify in the years to come. Routine methods of providing information relevant to clinical decision making about healthcare evaluations or management are often suboptimal. Relatively little research has been done on enhancing the capacity of psychiatric patients and the caregivers to make truly informed decisions about management.
   In this paper, we review studies that compared the effects of multimedia (video- or computer-based) educational aids with those of routine procedures to inform healthcare consumers about medical evaluations or management. Although most of these investigations were conducted in non-psychiatric patients, the results should be relevant for psychiatric practice of tomorrow. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL bibliographic databases. Randomized controlled trials that used objective measures of knowledge or understanding of the information provided were selected. Studies were rated as positive if the multimedia educational aid resulted in a greater improvement in knowledge or understanding than the control condition. The quality of each study was also rated using a newly developed Scale for Assessing Scientific Quality of Investigations (SASQI). A total of 37 randomized controlled trials were identified. Nearly two-thirds of the studies (23/37) in diverse patient populations and for varied medical assessments and treatments reported that multimedia educational aids produced better understanding of information compared to routine methods. SASQI scores for the positive and negative studies were comparable, suggesting that lower quality was not related to positive findings.
   In conclusion, multimedia educational aids hold promise for improving the provision of complex medical information to patients and caregivers. It is likely that as psychiatric patients and their treating clinicians face increasingly complex choices regarding mental health treatment, multimedia decisional aids could become an effective supplement to the clinician patient interaction in near future.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disorder with multiple facets, including the impairment of learning and memory. Recent evidence suggests that information is processed and represented by multiple interacting memory systems in the brain, including prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobe. These structures are critical in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Whereas executive and declarative memory dysfunctions are well known in schizophrenia, habit learning deficits related to the basal ganglia are less clear, despite the fact that dopaminergic and other neurochemical processes in the basal ganglia may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of schizophrenia. In this article, I propose that the investigation of different classification learning functions, including reward- and feedback-guided learning and acquired equivalence learning, may shed light on the neuropsychology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and behavioral genetics of schizophrenia.

AB  - The basal ganglia have been a target for neuromodulation surgery since Russell Meyers' pioneering works in the late 1930s. Contemporary movement disorder surgery on the brain has evolved from empiric observations on movement behavior after neurological lesions. So too has the development of psychiatric surgical procedures followed the observation of lesions in the brain on cognitive and affective behavior. Just as deep brain stimulation (DBS) has revolutionized the practice of movement disorder surgery, its application to psychiatric illness has become the cutting edge of functional and restorative neurosurgery. The fundamental concept of the cortico-striatal-pallido-thalamocortical loop will be explored in the context of psychiatric disorders. DBS targeting this circuitry appears from initial evidence in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to be a promising option for patients with neuropsychiatric illness resistant to conventional therapies. Further exploring the anatomic interconnectivity of the physiologically relevant cortical and subcortical areas will inevitably lead to better applications of DBS for the treatment of OCD, major depression (MD) and potentially for other psychiatric disorders. Implementing such therapies optimally will require the creation of treatment centers with specialized expertize in the psychiatric, neurosurgical, and ethical issues that arise with these populations.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disorder, which is often associated with severe loss of functioning and shortened life expectancy. Suicides and accidents are well-known causes of the excess mortality, but patients with schizophrenia have also been reported to be three times as likely to experience sudden unexpected death as individuals from the general population. This review is aimed to offer an update of the prevalence and mechanisms for sudden cardiac death in schizophrenia. The PubMed database was searched from 1966 up to May 2007 with key words schizophrenia AND sudden cardiac death OR autonomic dysfunction OR torsades de pointes. Part of the high death rates may be explained by long-lasting negative health habits, disease- and treatment-related metabolic disorders, and consequent increased frequencies of cardiovascular diseases. The antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk as some antipsychotics may cause prolongation of QT-time, serious ventricular arrhythmias and predispose to sudden death. Autonomic dysfunction seen as low heart rate variability and decreased baroreflex sensitivity may also contribute via malignant arrhythmias. Due to the complex interaction of various risk factors for sudden death, the patients need a comprehensive follow-up of their physical health. In addition, more studies on the role and prevalence of autonomic dysfunction in psychotic patients are needed.

KW  - work-related stress at sea
KW  - concept of triangulation
AB  - The present concept of stress is related with the necessity of triangulation in research. Triangulation means collecting evidence of stress from at least three sources: a) precursors - perception and feeling ( moderating factors), b) direct consequences, c) state of health. Is it possible to implement triangulation in the investigations of workrelated stress at sea?
   In the present paper, possibilities of collecting data on the work at sea are analyzed as regards individual aspects - stages of triangulation. The employment of triangulation principles to examine stress in persons working at sea requires both time and application of certain corrections to methodology of examinations carried out in Poland. When examining seafarers, we deal mainly with subjective information on perception of work and individual feeling of work-related stress. A proposition to expand the methodological workshop of examining stress at sea according to triangulation principles has been presented.

AB  - Neuroeconomics has further bridged the once disparate fields of economics and psychology. Such convergence is almost exclusively attributable to changes within economics. Neuroeconomics has inspired more change within economics than within psychology because the most important findings in neuroeconomics have posed more of a challenge to the standard economic perspective. Neuroeconomics has primarily challenged the standard economic assumption that decision making is a unitary process-a simple matter of integrated and coherent utility maximization-suggesting instead that it is driven by the interaction between automatic and controlled processes. This article reviews neuroeconomic research in three domains of interest to both economists and psychologists: decision making under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, and social decision making. In addition to reviewing new economic models inspired by this research, we also discuss how neuroeconomics may influence future work in psychology.

AB  - Introduction. Whenever a new scale is created or translated from another language, it must be validated, establishing its reliability for the new population where it will be used. Sleep quality concept is a construct that can be evaluated using self-report scales. Resulting elements vary depending on the individuals surveyed. This type of evaluation is mainly subjective and includes quantitative aspects such as sleep duration, number of awakenings, latency time, and qualitative aspects such as rest sensation, mood and oneiric content (Valencia, 2000). In the present study we made a critical review of the sleep scales designed for child, adolescent and adult populations that have been validated and the difficulties they might present.
   Methodology. Between September 2005 and May 2006 a bibliographical search was made within pubmed, ovid, and the data base of the periodical and book library of the Ramon de la Fuente Muniz National Institute of Psychiatry, using and combining the following key words: sleep, sleep questionnaire, sleep scale, sleep inventory, adolescent, adolescent sleep scale. The most relevant papers to our study were selected. The search was limited to Spanish and English articles, although there was no year or geographical origin limit. Articles that did not include clinimetrical data where excluded.
   Conclusions. Based on our bibliographical search aind our discussion, we suggested the design and validation of a Spanish scale to evaluate adolescent population which avoids a time interval between awakening and the answering of the instrument in order to decrease recall bias.

AB  - Background: Our purpose was to examine the use of classification and diagnostic systems in the field of psychiatry ( CDSP) from a bibliometric perspective, over the period 1980-2005. Methods: We selected ( in EMBASE and MEDLINE databases) documents that contained, in any of their sections, the descriptors 'psychiatr*', 'DSM*', 'ICD*', or 'diagnostic criteria', as well as other more specific descriptors. As a bibliometric indicator of production we applied Price's law. We also calculated the national participation index ( PI) and correlated it with overall PI in biomedical and health sciences, and with PI in the discipline of psychiatry. Results: We obtained 20,564 original documents; 15,743 referred to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM) and 3,106 to the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD). Our results indicate non-fulfilment of Price's law, since scientific production on CDSP does not undergo exponential growth ( correlation coefficient r = 0.9651, vs. r = 0.9927 after linear adjustment). Of the 10 journals with the highest impact factor in the field of psychiatry, the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry has the highest PI in the DSM subgroup ( PI = 14.77), and the British Journal of Psychiatry in the ICD subgroup ( PI = 1.54). The principal producer country is the United States ( PI = 37.9), though in proportion to its production in the psychiatric field the ranking is headed by Finland. Only 10 countries, of the 20 major producers in health sciences, surpass their own PI in the field of psychiatry ( Brazil, Italy, Japan, Austria, Spain, Germany, France, India, Switzerland, and China). Conclusions: Over recent years, the use of CDSP ( basically the DSM or ICD) in the scientific literature has increased. Nevertheless, the abstracts to these studies, included in the principal databases, should always specify the diagnostic criteria employed, with a view to increasing information levels and reliability for the reader.

AB  - In normal observers, visual search is facilitated for targets with salient attributes. We compared how two different types of cue (expression and colour) may influence search for face targets, in healthy subjects (n = 27) and right brain-damaged patients with left spatial neglect (n = 13). The target faces were defined by their identity (singleton among a crowd of neutral faces) but could either be neutral (like other faces), or have a different emotional expression (fearful or happy), or a different colour (red-tinted). Healthy subjects were the fastest for detecting the colour-cued targets, but also showed a significant facilitation for emotionally cued targets, relative to neutral faces differing from other distracter faces by identity only. Healthy subjects were also faster overall for target faces located on the left, as compared to the right side of the display. In contrast, neglect patients were slower to detect targets on the left (contralesional) relative to the right (ipsilesional) side. However, they showed the same pattern of cueing effects as healthy subjects on both sides of space; while their best performance was also found for faces cued by colour, they showed a significant advantage for faces cued by expression, relative to the neutral condition. These results indicate that despite impaired attention towards the left hemispace, neglect patients may still show an intact influence of both low-level colour cues and emotional expression cues on attention, suggesting that neural mechanisms responsible for these effects are partly separate from fronto-parietal brain systems controlling spatial attention during search.

AB  - Although much progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease ( AD), the current therapeutic approaches are merely symptomatic, intended for the treatment of cognitive symptoms, such as disturbances in memory and perception. Novel promising strategies suggest the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants including natural occurring plant flavonoids, iron-complexing molecules, neurotrophic factor delivery, inhibitors of the amyloid-beta protein precursor processing secretases, gamma and beta, that generate amyloid-beta peptides and the interference with lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Human epidemiological and new animal data suggest that tea drinking may decrease the incidence of dementia, AD and Parkinson's disease. In particular, its main catechin polyphenol constituent (-)- epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been shown to exert neuroprotective/neurorescue activities in a wide array of cellular and animal models of neurological disorders. This review provides a detailed overview on the multimodal activities of green tea polyphenols with emphasis on their iron chelating, neurorescue/neuroregenerative and mitochondrial stabilization action.

We discuss the origins of the El concept, define El, and describe the scope of the field today. We review three approaches taken to date from both a theoretical, and methodological perspective. We find that Specific-Ability and Integrative-Model approaches adequately conceptualize and measure El. Pivotal in this review are those studies that address the relation between EI measures and meaningful criteria including social outcomes, performance,, and psychological and physical well-being. The Discussion section is followed by a list of summary points and recommended issues for future research.

AB  - The last few decades have seen the hippocampal formation at front and center in the field of synaptic transmission. However, much of what we know about hippocampal short-and long-term plasticity has been obtained from research at one particular synapse; the Schaffer collateral input onto principal cells of the CA1 subfield. A number of recent studies, however, have demonstrated that there is much to be learned about target-specific mechanisms of synaptic transmission by study of the lesser known synapse made between the granule cells of the dentate gyrus; the so-called mossy fiber synapse, and its targets both within the hilar region and the CA3 hippocampus proper. Indeed investigation of this synapse has provided an embarrassment of riches concerning mechanisms of transmission associated with feedforward excitatory and inhibitory control of the CA3 hippocampus. Importantly, work from a number of labs has revealed that mossy fiber synapses possess unique properties at both the level of their anatomy and physiology, and serve as an outstanding example of a synapse designed for target-specific compartmentalization of synaptic transmission. The purpose of the present review is to highlight several aspects of this synapse as they pertain to a novel mechanism of bidirectional control of synaptic plasticity at mossy fiber synapses made onto hippocampal stratum lucidum interneurons. It is not my intention to pour over all that is known regarding the mossy fiber synapse since many have explored this topic exhaustively in the past and interested readers are directed to other fine reviews (Henze et al., 2000; Urban et al., 2001; Lawrence and McBain, 2003; Bischofberger et al., 2006; Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005).

AB  - Objective: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most common psychotherapy approach for the treatment of PTSD. Nevertheless, previous reviews on the efficacy of several types of psychotherapy were unable to detect differences between CBT and other psychotherapies. The purpose of this study was to conduct systematic review on the efficacy of CBT in comparison with studies that used other psychotherapy techniques. Method: Databases were searched using the following terms: posttraumatic stress disorder/stress disorder, treatment/psychotherapy/behavior cognitive therapy, randomized trials, and adults. Randomized clinical trials published between 1980 and 2005 and that compared CBT with other treatments for PTSD was included. The main outcomes were remission, clinical improvement, dropout rates and changes in symptoms. Results: The 23 clinical trials included in the review comprised 1,923 patients: 898 in the treatment group and 1,025 in the control group. CBT had better remission rates than EMDR (RR = 0.35; 95%CI: 0.16; 0.79; p = 0.01) or supportive therapies (RR = 0.43; 95%CI: 0.25; 0.74; p = 0.002, completer analysis). CBT was comparable to Exposure Therapy (ET) (RR = 0.90; 95%CI: 0.58; 1.40; p = 0.64), and cognitive therapy (CT) (RR = 1.01; 95%CI: 0.67; 1.51; p = 0.98) in terms of efficacy and compliance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that specific therapies, such as CBT, exposure therapy and cognitive therapy are equally effective, and more effective than supportive techniques in the treatment of PTSD.

AB  - Although Parkinson's disease (PD) has been considered to primarily affect motor abilities, increasing emphasis is being placed on cognitive and behavioural impairment in this disorder. Depression, dementia, psychosis and impulse control disorders have a major impact on quality of life for both patients and families. This article reviews cognitive and behavioural disturbances in PD and their relation to affective and motor symptoms, treatment of dementia associated with PD, and treatment approaches to psychosis in PD. We also discuss similarities between the dementia of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies.

AB  - By comparing benthic foraminiferal and macrofaunal responses to sewage sludge disposal in the Firth of Clyde (Scotland), we wanted to investigate the possibility of using foraminifera as bio-indicators of marine environmental degradation. Both groups present a similar distributional pattern, with poor faunas composed of species tolerant to strong oxygen depletion near to the disposal site, surrounded by high density of opportunistic species. Farther away, faunal density decreases and equilibrium taxa gradually replace opportunistic species. No more environmental impact is perceptible beyond 3 km. Nevertheless, some differences exist: foraminifera appear to be more impacted at the disposal site, probably as a consequence of the low pH, a supplementary stress factor for organisms provided with a calcareous test. At 3 kin west of the disposal site, macrofauna is comparable to the reference station, whereas foraminifera still indicate environmental degradation, suggesting their higher sensitivity to this type of pollution. It appears that benthic foraminifera may add valuable information to open marine environmental monitoring. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes via stereotactic neurosurgery has become a standard procedure for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. More recently, the range of neuropsychiatric conditions and the possible target structures suitable for DBS have greatly increased. The former include obsessive compulsive disease, depression, obesity, tremor, dystonia, Tourette's syndrome and cluster-headache. In this article we argue that several of the target structures for DBS (nucleus accumbens, posterior inferior hypothalamus, nucleus subthalamicus, nuclei in the thalamus, globus pallidus internus, nucleus pedunculopontinus) are located at strategic positions within brain circuits related to motivational behaviors, learning, and motor regulation. Recording from DBS electrodes either during the operation or post-operatively from externalized leads while the patient is performing cognitive tasks tapping the functions of the respective circuits provides a new window on the brain mechanisms underlying these functions. This is exemplified by a study of a patient suffering from obsessive-compulsive disease from whom we recorded in a flanker task designed to assess action monitoring processes while he received a DBS electrode in the right nucleus accumbens. Clear error-related modulations were obtained from the target structure, demonstrating a role of the nucleus accumbens in action monitoring. Based on recent conceptualizations of several different functional loops and on neuroimaging results we suggest further lines of research using this new window on brain functions.

AB  - Objective: 'Stockholm syndrome' is a term used to describe the positive bond some kidnap victims develop with their captor. High-profile cases are reported by the media although the diagnosis is not described in any international classification system. Here we review the evidence base on 'Stockholm syndrome'.
   Method: Databases (PubMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) were systematically searched. We compared features of cases widely reported in the English language media to identify common themes which may form a recognizable syndrome.
   Results: We identified 12 papers that met inclusion criteria. The existing literature consists mostly of case reports; furthermore there is ambiguity in the use of the term. No validated diagnostic criteria have been described. Four common features were found between the five cases studied.
   Conclusion: There is little published academic research on 'Stockholm syndrome' although study of media reports reveals similarities between well publicized cases. This may be due to reporting and publication bias.

AB  - A century of research has passed since the discovery and definition of Alzheimer's disease ( AD), the primary common dementing disorder worldwide. However, AD lacks definite diagnostic approaches and effective cure at the present. Moreover, the currently available diagnostic tools are not sufficient for an early screening of AD in order to start preventive approaches. Recently the emerging field of nanotechnology has promised new techniques to solve some of the AD challenges. Nanotechnology refers to the techniques of designing and manufacturing nanosize (1-100 nm) structures through controlled positional and/or self-assembly of atoms and molecules. In this report, we present the promises that nanotechnology brings in research on the AD diagnosis and therapy. They include its potential for the better understanding of the AD root cause molecular mechanisms, AD's early diagnoses, and effective treatment. The advances in AD research offered by the atomic force microscopy, single molecule fluorescence microscopy and NanoSIMS microscopy are examined here. In addition, the recently proposed applications of nanotechnology for the early diagnosis of AD including bio-barcode assay, localized surface plasmon resonance nanosensor, quantum dot and nanomechanical cantilever arrays are analyzed. Applications of nanotechnology in AD therapy including neuroprotections against oxidative stress and anti-amyloid therapeutics, neuroregeneration and drug delivery beyond the blood brain barrier (BBB) are discussed and analyzed. All of these applications could improve the treatment approach of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. The complete cure of AD may become feasible by a combination of nanotechnology and some other novel approaches, like stem cell technology.

AB  - Retinal ganglion cell axons within the globe are functionally specialized being richly provided with many mitochondria. The mitochondria produce the high energy requirement for nerve conduction in the unmyelinated part of the ganglion cell axons. We have proposed that in the initiation of glaucoma, an alteration in the quality of blood flow dynamics in the optic nerve head causes a compromise in the retinal ganglion cell axon energy requirement, rendering the ganglion cells susceptible to additional insults. One secondary insult might be light entering the eye to further affect ganglion cell axon mitochondrial function. Other insults to the ganglion cells might be substances (e.g., glutamate, nitric oxide, TNF-alpha) released from astrocytes. These effects ultimately cause ganglion cell death because of the inability of mitochondria to maintain normal function. We therefore suggest that ganglion cell apoptosis in glaucoma is both receptor and mitochondrial mediated. Agents targeted specifically at enhancing ganglion cell mitochondrial energy production should therefore be beneficial in a disease like glaucoma. Ganglion cell death in glaucoma might therefore, in principle, not be unlike the pathophysiology of numerous neurological disorders involving energy dysregulation and oxidative stress.
   The trigger(s) for ganglion cell apoptosis in glaucoma is/are likely to be multifactorial, and the rationale for targeting impaired energy production as a possibility of improving a patient's quality of life is based on logic derived from laboratory studies where neuronal apoptosis is shown to occur via different mechanisms. Light-induced neuronal apoptosis is likely to be more relevant to ganglion cell death in glaucoma than, for example, neuronal apoptosis associated with Parkinson's disease. Logic suggests that enhancing mitochondrial function generally will slow down ganglion cell apoptosis and therefore benefit glaucoma patients. On the basis of our laboratory studies, we suggest that supplements such as creatine, alpha-lipoic acid, nicotinamide, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), all of which counteract oxidative stress induced by light and other triggers, are worthy of consideration for the treatment of such patients as they can be taken orally to reach the retina without having significant side effects.

AB  - Our understanding and conceptualization of the placebo effect has shifted in emphasis from a focus on the inert content of a physical placebo agent to the overall simulation of a therapeutic intervention. Research has identified many types of placebo responses driven by different mechanisms depending on the particular context wherein the placebo is given. Some placebo responses, such as analgesia, are initiated and maintained by expectations of symptom change and changes in motivation/emotions. Placebo factors have neurobiological underpinnings and actual effects on the brain and body. They are not just response biases. Other placebo responses result from less conscious processes, such as classical conditioning in the case of immune, hormonal, and respiratory functions. The demonstration of the involvement of placebo mechanisms in clinical trials and routine clinical practice has highlighted interesting considerations for clinical trial design and opened up opportunities for ethical enhancement of these mechanisms in clinical practice.

AB  - Mitochondria are key cytoplasmic organelles, responsible I-or generating cellular energy, regulating intracellular calcium levels. altering the reduction-oxidation potential of cells. and regulating cell death. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria play a central role in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Freidriech ataxia. Further, several lines of evidence Suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event in most late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Biochemical and animal model studies of inherited neurodegenerative diseases have revealed that mutant proteins of these diseases are associated with mitochondria. Mutant proteins are reported to block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins and disrupt the electron transport chain, induce free radicals, Cause mitochondrial dysfunction. and, ultimately, damage neurons. This article discusses critical issues of mitochondria causing dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and discusses the potential of developing mitochondrial medicine, particularly mitochondrially targeted antioxidants. to treat aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - THE BURIAL OF HERODES ATTICUS: ELITE IDENTITY, URBAN SOCIETY, AND PUBLIC MEMORY IN ROMAN GREECE
KW  - ATHENS
KW  - PHILOSTRATUS
KW  - TOMB
AB  - This paper discusses the burial of Herodes Atticus as a well-attested case of elite identification through mortuary practices. It gives a close reading of Philostratus' account of Herodes' end in c. 179 (VS 2.1.15) alongside the evidence of architecture, inscriptions, sculpture, and topography at Marathon, Cephisia and Athens. The intended burial of Herodes and the actual burials of his family on the Attic estates expressed wealth and territorial control, while his preference for Marathon fused personal history with civic history. The Athenian intervention in Herodes' private funeral, which led to his magnificent interment at the Panathenaic Stadium, served as a public reception for a leading citizen and benefactor. Herodes' tomb should be identified with a long foundation on the stadium's east hill that might have formed an eccentric altar-tomb, while an elegant kline sarcophagus found nearby might have been his coffin. His epitaph was a traditional distich that stressed through language and poetic allusion his deep ties to Marathon and Rhamnous, his euergetism and his celebrity. Also found here was an altar dedicated to Herodes 'the Marathonian hero' with archaizing features (IG II2 6791). The first and last lines of the text were erased in a deliberate effort to remove his name and probably the name of a relative. A cemetery of ordinary graves developed around Herodes' burial site, but by the 250s these had been disturbed, along with the altar and the sarcophagus. This new synthesis of textual and material sources for the burial of Herodes contributes to a richer understanding of status and antiquarianism in Greek urban society under the Empire. It also examines how the public memory of elites was composite and mutable, shifting through separate phases of activity - funeral, hero-cult, defacement, biography - to generate different images of the dead.

AB  - The present paper reviews the methodology and clinical results of recording, by laser Doppler flowmetry, the hemodynamic response of the optic nerve head elicited by visual stimulation. The basic mechanism underlying this novel technique (which is called here functional laser Doppler flowmetry (FLDF)) is the coupling between visually evoked neural activity and vascular activity within the neural tissue of the optic nerve (neurovascular coupling). The blood flow responses elicited by various visual stimuli (luminance and chromatic flicker, focal and pattern stimulation) have been characterized in humans by FLDF. These responses are similar to those assessed by electrophysiological methods (flicker and pattern electroretinography) evoked by the same stimuli. In addition, a significant correlation has been demonstrated between the hemodynamic responses and the neural activity induced electrical signals arising from the inner retina, providing evidence in support of the presence of a neurovascular coupling in humans. The application of FLDF in patients with ocular hypertension and early glaucoma demonstrates that the visually evoked hyperemic responses are significantly depressed even when neural retinal activity may be still relatively preserved, suggesting that abnormal optic nerve head autoregulation in response to visual stimuli may be altered early in the disease process. FLDF may open new avenues of investigation in the field of glaucoma and other neuro-ophthalmic disorders, providing new pathophysiological data and outcome measures for potential neuro-protective treatments.

AB  - Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of irreversible vision loss characterized by progressive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In the course of glaucoma, RGC death may be the consequence of energy impairment that triggers secondary excitotoxicity and free radical generation. There is substantial evidence also that a number of free radical scavengers and/or agents that improve mitochondrial function may be useful as therapies to ameliorate cell death in various neurological disorders including glaucoma. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an essential cofactor of the electron transport chain, has been reported to afford neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and its protective effect has been attributed in part to its free radical scavenger ability and to a specific regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Using an established animal model of transient retinal ischemia, we have conclusively identified a role for abnormal elevation of extracellular glutamate in the mechanisms underlying RGC death that occurs, at least in part, via activation of the apoptotic program. Under these experimental conditions, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor antagonists, nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, and CoQ10 afford retinal protection supporting an important role for excitotoxicity in the mechanisms underlying RGC death.

AB  - Objective: There is little guidance for optimal pharmacotherapy for comorbid major depression and substance use disorder, the most frequently encountered comorbidity in clinical settings. We reviewed current evidence for effective treatments as reported by pharmacological trials specifically conducted to address this comorbidity.
   Data Sources: Studies were identified through computerized literature searches and from refereed articles from January 1966 through January of 2007. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials and open-label studies with large samples or those reporting novel approaches were selected for this review.
   Data Synthesis: The search identified twenty-seven studies, 23 of which were randomized,double-blind, placebocontrolled trials. Overall, treatment response was inconsistent among the different trials. More trials reported improvement for depression than improvement for substance use and rarely reported improvement in both outcomes. Trials with non-serotonergic reuptake inhibitor antidepressants reported more positive findings than those with SSRI's. Response varied by type of medication and study design.
   Conclusions: Antidepressants may provide improvement for depression when comorbid with substance use. There is less evidence of improvement for the substance use outcome, and there was rarely improvement on both outcomes. Addressing methodological challenges in future clinical trials is crucial for providing more consistent results that allow the construction of evidence-based algorithm for optimized interventions in this population.

KW  - NAME
AB  - Background: The term ' mental retardation' ( MR) is outdated and has changed to ' intellectual disability' (ID). Unfortunately, this decision did not follow a nosology approach. The aim of this overview is twofold: (1) to provide a conceptual background and framing on the ID/ MR field to other psychiatrists, and (2) to provide a nosology- based perspective to the debate on the name and concept of MR/ ID. Method: This conceptual paper is based on a literature review and on an iterative process of debate within the WPA Section ' Psychiatry of Mental Retardation'. Results: ID may be regarded not as a disease or as a disability but as a syndrome grouping (metasyndrome) similar to the construct of dementia. It includes a heterogeneous group of clinical conditions, ranging from genetic to nutritional, infectious, metabolic or neurotoxic conditions. The ID metasyndrome is characterized by a deficit in cognitive functioning prior to the acquisition of skills through learning. The intensity of the deficit is such to interfere in a significant way with individual normal functioning as expressed in limitations in activities and restriction in participation (disabilities). Conclusions: The name ' developmental cognitive impairment' is here suggested to coexist with ID for naming the metasyndrome previously called MR following a polysemic- polynomious approach.

AB  - Intellectual disability (ID) is a complex condition that has not aroused very much interest in the health sciences and medical fields. As a result, a large part of the responsibility for caring for individuals with ID has fallen in the areas of education, social services and volunteering. Nevertheless, intellectual disability is a very significant health problem,whether because of its prevalence, the costs to the public health system, the families and society in general or due to related health complications. ID should be a priority area of study and action in the health field. This article reviews the conceptual, diagnostic and etiological problems that affect intellectual disability, as well as factors related with the health of the persons who are affected. In addition, some recommendations are outlined for improving health care for this population group.

AB  - Objective: An increasing body of literature examines the association of religious factors with posttraumatic stress as well as posttraumatic growth. This review of selected empirical studies describes religious and spiritual factors that have been examined in their association with the consequences of trauma. A comprehensive model is proposed to explain the complex interrelationship. Method: We performed a qualitative review of empirical research in August 2006, updated in February 2008, using Medline (1950-present), PsychInfo (1806-present), Web of Science (1900-present), and PILOTS (1960-present). We searched the terms posttraumatic, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and religion, religious, spirituality, spiritual, meditation, and forgiveness. Based on supporting data from reviewed literature, we then developed a model for key religious factors derived from this review predictive of the response to trauma over time. Results: Twenty-three studies were identified that describe religious pre-trauma characteristics, religious trauma-appraisal and post-trauma adjustment factors. The association of these factors with posttraumatic stress and growth is described. Conclusions: Intrinsic religious orientation, in particular, appears to be a useful construct in measuring religiosity in the association with the consequences of trauma. There are preliminary indications that the association between intrinsic religiosity and the consequences of trauma may change depending on the time after the event. Future studies should stratify outcome by the time after trauma or use longitudinal designs.

AB  - Glaucoma, once thought as a single disease, is actually a group of diseases of the optic nerve involving loss of retinal ganglion cells. The process of cell death occurs in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy, a broad term for a certain pattern of damage to the optic nerve (the bundle of nerve fibers that carries information from the eye to the brain). Untreated glaucoma leads to permanent damage of the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss, which can progress to blindness. Worldwide, it is estimated that about 66.8 million people have visual impairment as a result of glaucoma, with 6.7 million suffering from blindness.

AB  - Continuous depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer has resulted in an increase in ultraviolet-B (UV-B; 280-315 nm) radiation on the earth's surface which inhibits photochemical and photobiological processes. However, certain photosynthetic organisms have evolved mechanisms to counteract the toxicity of ultraviolet or high photosynthetically active radiation by synthesizing the UV-absorbing/screening compounds, such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and scytonemin besides the repair of UV-induced damage of DNA and accumulation of carotenoids and detoxifying enzymes or radical quenchers and antioxidants. Chemical structure of various MAAs, their possible biochemical routes of synthesis and role as photoprotective compounds in various organisms are discussed.

This is the first study assessing these two types of decisions in patients with mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) by means of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and a newly developed, Probability-Associated Gambling (PAG) task. While rules for gains and losses are implicit in the IGT, in the PAG task rules are explicit and winning probabilities, which change from trial to trial, can be estimated. Results of the IGT indicated that DAT patients made more disadvantageous decisions than healthy controls. Patients also shifted more frequently among decks, i.e. under ambiguity decisions were taken randomly and no advantageous strategy was established over time by DAT patients. Thus, not only actual choices but also development of advantageous strategies may be revealing about decision making in the IGT. Compared to controls, patients demonstrated less advantageous choices in the PAG task as well. They gambled more often in the low winning probabilities and less frequently in the high probabilities than healthy participants. Patients' performance on both tasks correlated with measures of executive functions. Findings of the present investigation are consistent with the early pathological cerebral changes and related (cognitive, emotional) deficits reported for DAT. As suggested by our study, decisions under ambiguity as well as decisions under risk are impaired in mild DAT. It may thus be expected that patients with Mild DAT have difficulties in taking decisions in every-day life situations, both in cases of ambiguity (information on probability is missing or conflicting, and the expected utility of the different options is incalculable) and in cases of risk (outcomes can be predicted by well-defined or estimable probabilities).

AB  - Background: The Illness Attitude Scales (IAS) were developed by Robert Kellner as a clinimetric index for measuring hypochondriacal fears and beliefs (worry about illness, concerns about pain, health habits, hypochondriacal beliefs, thanatophobia, disease phobia, bodily preoccupations, treatment experience and effects of symptoms). The IAS have been extensively used in the past two decades, but there has been no comprehensive review of their properties and applications. Methods: A review of the literature using both computerized (Medline, PsycINFO) and manual searches was performed. Results: The IAS were found to successfully discriminate between hypochondriacal patients and control subjects, and between patients with various manifestations of illness behaviour. They showed a high test-retest reliability in normal subjects, and changed in the expected direction after treatment of hypochondriasis. The IAS were also positively related to other hypochondriasis-related measures, and yielded important information in a variety of medical and surgical settings. Their content has paved the way for the development of some of the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research. Conclusions: The clinimetric properties and high sensitivity of the IAS make them the gold standard for the self-rated assessment of hypochondriacal fears and beliefs. Copyright (c) 2008 S.

AB  - Each movement we make activates our own sensory receptors, thus causing a problem for the brain: the spurious, movement-related sensations must be discriminated from the sensory inputs that really matter, those representing our environment. Here we consider circuits for solving this problem in the primate brain. Such circuits convey a copy of each motor command, known as a corollary discharge (CD), to brain regions that use sensory input. In the visual system, CD signals may help to produce a stable visual percept from the jumpy images resulting from our rapid eye movements. A candidate pathway for providing CD for vision ascends from the superior colliculus to the frontal cortex in the primate brain. This circuit conveys warning signals about impending eye movements that are used for planning subsequent movements and analyzing the visual world. Identifying this circuit has provided a model for studying CD in other primate sensory systems and may lead to a better understanding of motor and mental disorders.

AB  - Compelling evidence from epidemiological studies suggests beneficial roles of dietary phytochemicals in protecting against chronic disorders such as cancer, and inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. Emerging findings suggest that several dietary phytochemicals also benefit the nervous system and, when consumed regularly, may reduce the risk of disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The evidence supporting health benefits of vegetables and fruits provide a rationale for identification of the specific phytochemicals responsible, and for investigation of their molecular and cellular mechanisms of action. One general mechanism of action of phytochemicals that is emerging from recent studies is that they activate adaptive cellular stress response pathways. From an evolutionary perspective, the noxious properties of such phytochemicals play an important role in dissuading insects and other pests from eating the plants. However at the subtoxic doses ingested by humans that consume the plants, the phytochemicals induce mild cellular stress responses. This phenomenon has been widely observed in biology and medicine, and has been described as 'preconditioning' or 'hormesis.' Hormetic pathways activated by phytochemicals may involve kinases and transcription factors that induce the expression of genes that encode antioxidant enzymes, protein chaperones, phase-2 enzymes, neurotrophic factors, and other cytoprotective proteins. Specific examples of such pathways include the sirtuin-FOXO pathway, the NF-kappa B pathway, and the Nrf-2/ARE pathway. In this article, we describe the hormesis hypothesis of phytochemical actions with a focus on the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway as a prototypical example of a neuroprotective mechanism of action of specific dietary phytochemicals.

AB  - The cognitive critique of the goals and desires that are input into the implicit calculations that result in instrumental rationality is one aspect of what has been termed broad rationality (Elster, 1983). This cognitive critique involves, among other things, the search for rational integration (Nozick, 1993) - that is, consistency between first-order and second-order preferences. Forming a second-order preference involves metarepresentational abilities made possible by mental decoupling operations. However, these decoupling abilities are separable from the motive that initiates the cognitive critique itself. I argue that Velleman (1992) has identified that motive ("the desire to act in accordance with reasons"), and that it might be operationalisable as a thinking disposition at a very superordinate cognitive level. This thinking disposition, the Master Rationality Motive, is likely to be of particular importance in explaining individual differences in the tendency to seek rational integration. Preliminary research on related constructs suggests that this construct is measurable.

AB  - The high demand for molecular oxygen, the enrichment of polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane phospholipids, and the relatively low abundance of antioxidant defense enzymes are factors rendering cells in the central nervous system (CNS) particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. Excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain has been implicated as a common underlying factor for the etiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. While ROS are generated by enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions in the C mitochondria and Cytoplasm under normal conditions, excessive production under pathological conditions is associated with activation of Ca2+-dependent enzymes including proteases, phospholipases, nucleases, and alterations of signaling pathways which subsequently lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, release of inflammatory factors, and apoptosis. In recent years. there is considerable interest to investigate antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds from different botanical sources. In this review, we describe oxidative mechanisms associated with AD, PD, and stroke, and evaluate neuroprotective effects of phenolic compounds, such as resveratrol from grape and red wine, curcumin from turmeric, apocynin from Picrorhiza kurroa, and epi-gallocatechin from green tea. The main goal is to provide a better understanding of the mode of action of these compounds and assess their use as therapeutics to ameliorate age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Posture and movements are out, only physical means of interacting with the environment. As we express Our thoughts and emotions through posture and movements, they indicate our will or intentions. Locomotion is representative of purposeful goal-directed behaviors that are initiated by signals arising from either volitional processing in the cerebral cortex or emotional processing in the limbic system. Regardless of whether the locomotion is volitional or emotional, it is accompanied by automatically controlled movement processes such as the adjustment of postural muscle tone and rhythmic limb movements that are unconsciously executed. Sensori-motor integration at the level of the brainstem and spinal cord plays major roles in this automatic control. Signals processed in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum act on the cerebral cortex, the limbic system and the brainstem so that locomotor behaviors are appropriately and precisely regulated depending on the behavioral context. The purpose of this review is to describe how purposeful locomotor behaviors are initiated, executed and regulated so as to enable locomotive subjects to interact with and adapt to the environment.

AB  - Objective: To review the data concerning insomnia in Thailand that have been published in international journals. Methods: A search was made through PubMed using the word "insomnia in Thailand" or "insomnia in Thai". Other data were obtained from the staff of the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University. Results: The prevalence of frequent night waking in three-month-old infants was 51.5%. Frequent night waking was independently associated with various factors of parental practices related to infant sleep such as the use of a swinging or rocking cradle or falling asleep while feeding. The overall prevalence of insomnia in healthy adults and the elderly Thai population was 40.8% and 46.3% respectively. Data from the older Thai population found that insomnia problems increased significantly with advancing age with depression and poor perceived health as the most significant associated factors. Conclusion: Insomnia and night waking are common in the Thai population. Further research is needed and a comprehensive programme to detect and prevent sleep problems in all age groups should be considered.

AB  - During the last decade, identification of the genes involved in familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) has advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of different aspects of PD. However the available animal models still remain as the main limiting factor for the development of neuroprotective therapies that can halt the progression of the disease, through which we wish to provide a better quality of life for the PD patients. Here, we review the recently developed animal models based on overexpression of PD-associated genes using recombinant viral vectors. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, in particular, have been very useful in targeting the nigral dopamine neurons both in the rodent and the primate brain. In order to provide insights into the establishment of these models in the laboratory, we will not only give an overview of the results from these studies but also cover practical issues related to the production and handling of the viral vectors, which are critical for the successful application of this approach.

AB  - The judgement of personality change following acquired brain injury (ABI) is a powerful subjective and social action, and has been shown to be associated with a range of serious psychosocial consequences. Traditional conceptualisations of personality change (e.g., Lishman, 1998) have largely derived from individualist concepts of personality (e.g., Eysenck, 1967). These assume a direct link between neurological damage and altered personhood, accounting predominantly for their judgements of change. This assumption is found as commonly in family accounts of change as in professional discourse. Recent studies and perspectives from the overlapping fields of social neuroscience, cognitive approaches to self and identity and psychosocial processes following ABI mount a serious challenge to this assumption. These collectively identify a range of direct and indirect factors that may influence the judgement or felt sense of change in personhood by survivors of ABI and their significant others. These perspectives are reviewed within a biopsychosocial framework: neurological and neuropsychological deficits, psychological mechanisms and psychosocial processes. Importantly, these perspectives are applied to generate a range of clinical interventions that were not identifiable within traditional conceptualisations of personality changes following ABI.

AB  - The mesolimbic dopaminergic (ML-DA) system has been recognized for its central role in motivated behaviors, various types of reward, and, more recently, in cognitive processes. Functional theories have emphasized DA's involvement in the orchestration of goal-directed behaviors and in the promotion and reinforcement of learning. The affective neuroethological perspective presented here views the ML-DA system in terms of its ability to activate an instinctual emotional appetitive state (SEEKING) evolved to induce organisms to search for all varieties of life-supporting stimuli and to avoid harms. A description of the anatomical framework in which the ML system is embedded is followed by the argument that the SEEKING disposition emerges through functional integration of ventral basal ganglia (BG) into thalamocortical activities. Filtering cortical and limbic input that spreads into BG, DA transmission promotes the "release" of neural activity patterns that induce active SEEKING behaviors when expressed at the motor level. Reverberation of these patterns constitutes a neurodynamic process for the inclusion of cognitive and perceptual representations within the extended networks of the SEEKING urge. In this way, the SEEKING disposition influences attention, incentive salience, associative learning, and anticipatory predictions. In our view, the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse are, in part, caused by the activation of the SEEKING disposition, ranging from appetitive drive to persistent craving depending on the intensity of the affect. The implications of such a view for understanding addiction are considered, with particular emphasis on factors predisposing individuals to develop compulsive drug seeking behaviors.

Methods: A PubMed search was performed using the following keywords: carotid surgery, carotid stenosis, cognition, and cognition disorders. Bibliographies were cross referenced and related-articles searches were performed once an article of interest had been identified. Results: Twentytwo studies have been identified from the literature since 1998. Seventeen articles evaluated carotid endarterectomy (CEA), four evaluated carotid stenting, and one compared CEA to stenting. Eight studies found improvements in mood and/or cognition after revascularization, 11 studies showed mixed results, and 3 studies found declines. Conclusions: There is no consensus within the current literature as to the effect of carotid revascularization on neurocognitive function. Further research - with attention to laterality of neurocognitive effects, patients' symptomatology at the time of presentation, the role of perioperative embolization, and trial design including adequate control groups and comparison between open surgery and stenting factors-is necessary in order to clarify the effects of carotid revascularization on cognition.

   Method: A literature search of English language articles published between January 1990 and December 2006 was undertaken to identify: i) scales used most frequently to assess social functioning in schizophrenia; and ii) the most frequently used social functioning scales in randomized, controlled trials of antipsychotics. A further search (without time limits) examined their psychometric properties.
   Results: A total of 301 articles employed social functioning scales in the assessment of schizophrenia. These contained 87 potentially relevant measures. Only 14 randomized, controlled studies of antipsychotic agents were identified that examined social functioning. Scales varied greatly in terms of measurement approach, number and types of domains covered and scoring systems. A striking lack of data on psychometric properties was observed.
   Conclusion: Limited consensus on the definition and measurement of social functioning exists. The Personal and Social Performance Scale is proposed as a useful tool in future research.

AB  - This essay assesses the two most significant changes in psychology over the past century: the attempt to localize psychological phenomena in restricted brain sites and the search for genetic contributions to behavior and psychopathology. Although there are advantages to these new developments, they are accompanied by some questionable assumptions. Because the investigators in these domains often relate variation in their biological measures to variation in personality traits evaluated with questionnaires, an analysis of the unique properties of the verbal-report questionnaires is presented. It is suggested that future research on human personality should try to combine semantic reports with behaviors and biological data in order to arrive at more fruitful constructs.

AB  - Meaning-system analyses presently dominate the literature on religious conversion and spiritual transformation (Paloutzian & Park, 2005). To complement (not contradict) meaning-system analyses this three-article series proposes the construction of a new approach to the study of the affective basis of spiritual transformation, moral motive analysis. The objective of this final article is to outline a specific moral motive analysis of transformation, a "social intuitionist" (Haidt, 2001) approach that both complements and elaborates the theological tradition of orthokardia (Runyon, 1998). This article first summarizes the central hermeneutic and defining features of orthodardia, and then relates them to concepts in contemporary moral motivation theory. Second, following the Murphy-MacIntyrean framework (telos, problem, purpose), it proposes three core postulates concerning the role of moral emotions in spiritual transformation: moral telos as emerging love and the capable character, moral problem as the duplicitous heart and diminished capacity to love; and moral process as implicit relational transformation. Collectively, these postulates delineate an approach to relational affect transformation (virtue-acquisition and vice-diminishment) that is consistent with the sensibilities of Aristotelean virtue ethics (MacIntyre, 1984), contemporary moral motive theory (Emmons & McCullough, 2004), and the apophatic approach to change (Jones, 2002), thus providing a metapsychology of implicit relational spirituality for theory, research, and practice.

AB  - The use of the control construct is widespread in research about chronic illness. Our aim was to analyse the relationship between perceived control and health outcomes in people with cancer. A search of databases (Medline, PsycINFO and Psicodoc) for articles published between 1966 and 2006 were conducted. Key words related to cancer, control beliefs and health outcomes were combined and searched resulting in the identification of 716 studies; 44 of the articles located met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The review showed that, firstly, selfefficacy beliefs had more power over patients' adaptation than the other belief constructs. Secondly, locus of control beliefs were the most frequently assessed beliefs in the 44 studies; however, there was a lack of association between locus of control and health outcomes. Internal locus of control was the dimension with the most positive relationship with emotional status and quality of life.

AB  - Background: Recent studies suggest that the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with newer antidepressant drugs that simultaneously enhance norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission might result in higher response and remission rates than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The goal of our work was to compare response rates among patients with MDD treated with either of these two broad categories of antidepressant drugs.
   Methods: Medline/Pubmed, EMBase, clinical trial registries, program syllabi from major psychiatric meetings held since 1995, and documents from relevant pharmaceutical companies were searched for double-blind, randomized trials comparing a newer serotonergic-noradrenergic antidepressant drug (venlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, mianserin, or moclobemide) with an SSRI for MDD.
   Results: Ninety-three trials (n = 17,036) were combined using a random-effects model. Treatment with serotonergic + noradrenergic antidepressant drugs was more likely to result in clinical response than the SSRIs (risk ratio [RR] = 1.059; response rates 63.6% versus 59.3%; p = .003). There was no evidence for heterogeneity among studies combined (p = 1.0). Excluding each individual agent did not significantly alter the pooled RR. With the exception of duloxetine (.985), RRs for response for each individual serotonergic + noradrenergic antidepressant drug were within the 95% confidence interval of the pooled RR (1.019-1.101).
   Conclusions: Serotonergic-noradrenergic antidepressant drugs seem to have a modest efficacy advantage compared with SSRIs in MDD. With the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) statistic as one indicator of clinical significance, nearly 24 patients would need to be treated with dual-action antidepressant drugs instead of SSRIs in order to obtain one additional responder. This difference falls well below the mark of NNT = 10 suggested by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Clinical Excellence but nonetheless might be of public health relevance given the large number of depressed patients treated with SSRI/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant drugs. Further research is needed to examine whether larger differences between classes of antidepressant drugs might exist in specific MDD sub-populations or for specific MDD symptoms.

AB  - In recent years, research on interferon (IFN)-induced depressive symptoms in antivirally treated patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has considerably intensified. Profound scientific knowledge of this complication is of great relevance with regard to adherence, compliance, and premature therapy discontinuation.
   Presently, there is considerable variability of both, the frequency and extent of IFN-induced depression reported in different cohorts of patients.
   The aim of the presented study was to systematically review recent literature of research within this field; and particularly (1) to identify to what extent methodological bias contributed to inconsistent results in different studies, (2) to critically appraise methods and results of studies published so far, and (3) to suggest directions for future work, especially with respect to alternative and improved methodological approaches.
   The results of this critical review suggest that the variability of findings seem to be largely due to different study populations, treatment regimens, methodological approaches, and sometimes arbitrary or at least poorly defined choice of screening instruments for depression, particularly criteria for clinically relevant depression (cut-off criteria).
   Study designs and methodological approaches to investigate IFN-alfa-induced depression in patients with CHC have been incoherent. Future research in this field needs agreement on the use of standardized assessment of IFN-induced depression in CHC. Furthermore, objective criteria and guidelines for the treatment of IFN-induced depression in these patients are needed in clinical practice. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - There is now general consensus that climate change is a global threat and a challenge for the 21st century. More and more information is available demonstrating how increased temperature may affect aquatic ecosystems and living resources or how increased water levels may impact coastal zones and their management. Many ecosystems are also affected by human releases of contaminants, for example from land based sources or the atmosphere, which also may cause severe effects. So far these two important stresses on ecosystems have mainly been discussed independently. The present paper is intended to increase awareness among scientists, coastal zone managers and decision makers that climate change will affect contaminant exposure and toxic effects and that both forms of stress will impact aquatic ecosystems and biota. Based on examples from different ecosystems, we discuss risks anticipated from contaminants in a rapidly changing environment and the research required to understand and predict how on-going and future climate change may alter risks from chemical pollution.

AB  - For the past 50 years, adults who were adopted during infancy have been research participants for empirical studies with goals ranging from twill studies for heritability to adjustment following adoption, to attachment. While the research body is broad, it has given little attention to counseling practices with adopted adults. Because empirical research and clinical practice can inform each other this article integrates literatures in both areas so that counseling practice with adopted adults call guide research, just as research guides practice. The authors grouped the clinically relevant literature into three main areas: identity (including genealogical and transracial adoption issues), search and reunion, and long-term outcomes. Within each section, the authors critiqued the literature as it informs counseling practice, used case studies to depict clinical implications, and suggested treatment strategies for use with adult adoptees. Epidemiological research found adequate adjustment for adopted adults. However, clinicians and researchers must address the consistent finding that a subset of adoptees struggles and copes with issues different than their nonadopted counterparts. The authors identify best clinical practices and a future research agenda related to adult adoptees and propose an adoption-sensitive paradigm for research and practice.

AB  - Glutamate and its synthetic analogues N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate, and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) are potent dilator agents in the cerebral circulation. The close linkage between neural activity-based release and actions of glutamate on neurons and the related decrease in cerebral vascular resistance is a classic example in support of the concept of tight coupling between increased neural activity and cerebral blood flow. However, mechanisms involved in promoting cerebral vasodilator responses to glutamatergic agents are controversial. Here we review the development and current status of this important field of research especially in respect to cerebrovascular responses to NMDA receptor activation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The human brain is not a passive organ simply waiting to be activated by external stimuli. Instead, we propose that the brain continuously employs memory of past experiences to interpret sensory information and predict the immediately relevant future. The basic elements of this proposal include analogical mapping, associative representations and the generation of predictions. This review concentrates on visual recognition as the model system for developing and testing ideas about the role and mechanisms of top-down predictions in the brain. We cover relevant behavioral, computational and neural aspects, explore links to emotion and action preparation, and consider clinical implications for schizophrenia and dyslexia. We then discuss the extension of the general principles of this proposal to other cognitive domains. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The lifespan of people with schizophrenia is shortened compared to the general population. We reviewed the literature on comorbid physical diseases in schizophrenia to provide a basis for initiatives to fight this unacceptable situation.
   Method: We searched MEDLINE (1966 - May 2006) combining the MeSH term of schizophrenia with the 23 MeSH terms of general physical disease categories to identify relevant epidemiological studies.
   Results: A total of 44 202 abstracts were screened. People with schizophrenia have higher prevalences of HIV infection and hepatitis, osteoporosis, altered pain sensitivity, sexual dysfunction, obstetric complications, cardiovascular diseases, overweight, diabetes, dental problems, and polydipsia than the general population. Rheumatoid arthritis and cancer may occur less frequently than in the general population. Eighty-six per cent of the studies came from industrialized countries limiting the generalizability of the findings.
   Conclusions: The increased frequency of physical diseases in schizophrenia might be on account of factors related to schizophrenia and its treatment, but undoubtedly also results from the unsatisfactory organization of health services, from the attitudes of medical doctors, and the social stigma ascribed to the schizophrenic patients.

Methods PsycInfo, Medline and reference lists were searched. This yielded 27 eligible reports. Effect sizes (Hedges' d) were computed to estimate the impact of SB. Results Overall, the effects of SB were small to negligible on the affective dimensions of parents relationships. The few effects that were found tended to be positive. The most important negative effects of SB were found in the parent-child relationship (parenting stress and overprotection). Conclusions Support was found for the resilience-disruption hypothesis, the role-division hypothesis and the miscarried-helping hypothesis, but not for the marital-disruption hypothesis or the marginality hypothesis.

AB  - Gastrointestinal disorders are common in pregnant women. These disorders are often treated with antiemetic medications that block central dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopamine antagonists can cause akathisia. Hormonal changes and otherfactors may place pregnant women at increased risk for the development of severe antiemetic-induced akathisia. The mental symptoms that can accompany akathisia can be misinterpreted as primary mental illness. The author reports on the case of a pregnant woman who attempted to injure herself after developing severe antiemetic-induced akathisia.

AB  - The therapeutic alliance has long been recognized as an important component of successful psychotherapy for adults; research has established robust links to outcome. Until recently, however, research on the alliance between youth and their therapists has been sparse. The present review synthesizes the existing findings regarding the youth alliance and utilizes the adult alliance literature and the child and adolescent developmental literatures to suggest future avenues of research. Weak alliance was found to predict premature termination, and strong alliance predicted symptom reduction, with some support for differential effects of the youth-therapist and parent-therapist alliances. In addition, the youth alliance is moderated by several patient and therapist characteristics, including the particular problems of patients and the interpersonal skills of therapists. The field has yet to coalesce around a single definition of the youth alliance, however, making it difficult to assess research results. Adult models of the alliance continue to be used heuristically despite some evidence that the alliance operates differently for youth. Tightening the operational definition of the youth alliance and addressing methodological issues will be essential in future efforts to understand how the alliance develops and what role it may play in the treatment process for youth.

AB  - Visual system circuitry, a canonical model system for the study of experience-dependent development, matures before and following the onset of vision. Sensory experience or deprivation during an early critical period results in substantial plasticity and is a crucial factor in establishing the mature circuitry. In adulthood, plasticity has been thought to be reduced or absent. However, recent studies point to the potential for change in neuronal circuits within the mature brain, raising the possibility that aberrant circuit function can be corrected. In this review, we will discuss recent exciting findings in the field of experience-dependent plasticity that advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying the activation, expression, and closure of critical periods in the visual system.

AB  - Fear is arguably the most commonly investigated emotion in domestic animals. In the current review we attempt to establish the level of repeatability and validity found for fear tests used on cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry and horses. We focus the review on the three most common types of fear tests: the arena test (open field), the novel object test, and the restraint test. For some tests, e.g. tonic immobility in poultry, there is a good and broad literature on factors that affect the outcome of the test, the validity of the test and its age dependency. However, there are comparatively few of these well defined and validated tests and what is especially missing for most tests is information on the robustness, i.e., what aspects can be changed without affecting the validity of the tests. The relative absence of standardized tests hampers the development of applied ethology as a science. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measuring HPA axis activity is the standard approach to the study of stress and welfare in farm animals. Although the reference technique is the use of blood plasma to measure glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol or corticosterone), several alternative methods such as the measurement of corticosteroids in saliva, urine or faeces have been developed to overcome the stress induced by blood sampling itself. In chronic stress situations, as is frequently the case in studies about farm animal welfare, hormonal secretions are usually unchanged but dynamic testing allows the demonstration of functional changes at several levels of the system, including the sensitization of the adrenal cortex to ACTH and the resistance of the axis to feedback inhibition by corticosteroids (dexamethasone suppression test). Beyond these procedural aspects, the main pitfall in the use of HPA axis activity is in the interpretation of experimental data. The large variability of the system has to be taken into consideration, since corticosteroid hormone secretion is usually pulsatile, follows diurnal and seasonal rhythms, is influenced by feed intake and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, age and physiological state, just to cite the main sources of variation. The corresponding changes reflect the important role of glucocorticoid hormones in a number of basic physiological processes such as energy metabolism and central nervous system functioning. Furthermore, large differences have been found across species, breeds and individuals, which reflect the contribution of genetic factors and environmental influences, especially during development, in HPA axis functioning. Usually, these results will be integrated with data from behavioral observation, production and pathology records in a comprehensive approach of farm animal welfare. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Clinical and epidemiologic evidence demonstrates sex differences in the prevalence and course of various psychiatric disorders. Understanding sex-specific brain differences in healthy individuals is a critical first step toward understanding sex-specific expression of psychiatric disorders. Here, we evaluate evidence on sex differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function using imaging methodologies, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (WRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in mentally healthy individuals. MEDLINE searches of English-language literature (11980 -Novernber 2006) using the terms sex, gender, PET, SPECT, MRI, fMRI, morphometry, neurochemistry, and neurotransmission were performed to extract relevant sources. The literature suggests that while there are many similarities in brain structure, function, and neurotransmission in healthy men and women, there are important differences that distinguish the male from the female brain. Overall, brain volume is greater in men than women; yet, when controlling for total volume, women have a higher percentage of gray matter and men a higher percentage of white matter. Regional volume differences are less consistent. Global cerebral blood flow is higher in women than in men. Sex-specific differences in dopaminergic, serotonergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic markers indicate that male and female brains are neurochemically distinct. Insight into the etiology of sex differences in the normal living human brain provides an important foundation to delineate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders and to guide the development of sex-specific treatments for these devastating brain disorders.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to determine the conceptual basis of measures of the patient-professional relationship used in routine mental health services research by reviewing their face, content and construct validity.
   Method: A comprehensive literature search identified measures of the relationship used in mental health services research. The conceptual basis of each identified measure was identified by a review of measures' authors assessments of face, content and construct validity plus item analysis of the measures themselves.
   Result: The search identified 15 measures. The seven developed in psychotherapy were likely to be better validated conceptually; most were based on therapeutic alliance models. Measures developed specifically for mental health services were based on a wider range of models including global assessments of the relationship.
   Conclusion: Most of the better validated measures originate in psychotherapy, but there is limited evidence for their validity in general mental health services. Four measures are recommended.

AB  - A systematic literature review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of interventions that aim to prevent back pain and back injury in nurses. Ten relevant databases were searched; these were examined and reference lists checked. Two reviewers applied selection criteria, assessed methodological quality and extracted data from trials. A qualitative synthesis of evidence was undertaken and sensitivity analyses performed. Eight randomised controlled trials and eight non-randomised controlled trials met eligibility criteria. Overall, study quality was poor, with only one trial classified as high quality. There was no strong evidence regarding the efficacy of any interventions aiming to prevent back pain and injury in nurses. The review identified moderate level evidence from multiple trials that manual handling training in isolation is not effective and multidimensional interventions are effective in preventing back pain and injury in nurses. Single trials provided moderate evidence that stress management programs do not prevent back pain and limited evidence that lumbar supports are effective in preventing back injury in nurses. There is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise interventions and the provision of manual handling equipment and training. This review highlights the need for high quality randomised controlled studies to examine the effectiveness of interventions to prevent back pain and injury in nursing populations. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review published clinical trials of the pharmacotherapy of neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD).
   Method: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for published English-language medical literature. Our review focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and corresponding metaanalyses.
   Results: The pharmacotherapy of neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD has been studied with numerous RCTs. The largest number of studies has focused on antipsychotics. Data are of reasonably high quality and indicate that risperidone and olanzapine are more effective than placebo for institutionalized patients with severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis. The efficacy of antipsychotics is counterbalanced by safety concerns that include cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine appear to have modest benefits for patients with mildly to moderately severe symptoms. Antidepressants are effective for treating depression in AD, but more data are required to determine the efficacy of trazodone and citalopram for agitation and aggression. Carbamazepine appears to be efficacious, although side effects and concerns about drug-drug interactions limit its use. The data do not support the use of valproate. Benzodiazepines should only be used for short-term, as-needed use. There are insufficient data on other pharmacologic interventions, such as beta blockers, buspirone, and estrogen preparations.
   Conclusions: Although there have been numerous well-designed studies of the pharmacotherapy of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD, safer and more effective treatments are urgently needed.

AB  - Twenty years ago, striatal cholinergic neurons were central figures in models of basal ganglia function. But since then, they have receded in importance. Recent studies are likely to lead to their re-emergence in our thinking. Cholinergic interneurons have been implicated as key players in the induction of synaptic plasticity and motor learning, as well as in motor dysfunction. In Parkinson's disease and dystonia, diminished striatal doparninergic signalling leads to increased release of acetylcholine by interneurons, distorting network function and inducing structural changes that undoubtedly contribute to the symptoms. By contrast, in Huntington's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, there is a fall in striatal cholinergic markers. This review gives an overview of these recent experimental and clinical studies, placing them within the context of the pathogenesis of movement disorders.

AB  - Context: Despite improvements in mental health services in recent decades, it is unclear whether the risk of mortality in schizophrenia has changed over time.
   Objective: To explore the distribution of standardized mortality ratios ( SMRs) for people with schizophrenia.
   Data Sources: Broad search terms were used in MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify all studies that investigated mortality in schizophrenia, published between January 1, 1980, and January 31, 2006. References were also identified from review articles, reference lists, and communication with authors.
   Study Selection: Population- based studies that reported primary data on deaths in people with schizophrenia.
   Data Extraction: Operationalized criteria were used to extract key study features and mortality data.
   Data Synthesis: We examined the distribution of SMRs and pooled selected estimates using random- effects meta- analysis. We identified 37 articles drawn from 25 different nations. The median SMR for all persons for all- cause mortality was 2.58 ( 10%- 90% quantile, 1.185.76), with a corresponding random- effects pooled SMR of 2.50 ( 95% confidence interval, 2.18- 2.43). No sex difference was detected. Suicide was associated with the highest SMR ( 12.86); however, most of the major causes- ofdeath categories were found to be elevated in people with schizophrenia. The SMRs for all- cause mortality have increased during recent decades ( P=. 03).
   Conclusions: With respect to mortality, a substantial gap exists between the health of people with schizophrenia and the general community. This differential mortality gap has worsened in recent decades. In light of the potential for second- generation antipsychotic medications to further adversely influence mortality rates in the decades to come, optimizing the general health of people with schizophrenia warrants urgent attention.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review published clinical trials of the pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer disease (AD).
   Method: We searched MEDLINE for published English-language medical literature, using Alzheimer disease and treatment as key words. No other search engine was used. Our review focused on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and corresponding metaanalyses.
   Results: Although there are many RCTs for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), none have been successful in their primary analysis. The cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine have demonstrated efficacy in 3- to 12-month placebo-controlled RCTs assessing cognitive, functional, behavioural, and global outcomes in patients with mildly to moderately severe AD. Recent data from patients with severe stages of AD demonstrate the efficacy of donepezil on cognitive and functional measures but not on behaviour. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine has been demonstrated to be effective in 6-month, placebo-controlled RCTs of 6 months duration assessing cognitive, functional, and global outcomes of inpatients with moderate-to-severe AD (defined as a Mini Mental State Examination score below 20). Post hoc analyses have demonstrated a benefit in regard to agitation and (or) aggression, but this needs to be confirmed in a prospective RCT across Canada. Disease-modifying treatments are being tested in mild stages of AD in 18-month RCTs with cognitive and global outcomes as primary efficacy outcomes, primarily with drugs reducing amyloid synthesis or aggregation. Successful treatment in mild stages of AD could lead to RCTs in MCI and, possibly, in genetically high-risk asymptomatic individuals.
   Conclusion: The significant advances in the symptomatic pharmacotherapy of AD may be followed by disease-modification treatments.

A reciprocal interaction of the neuropeptides growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone (GHRH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays a key role in sleep regulation. At least in males GHRH is a common stimulus of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and GH and inhibits the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) hormones, whereas CRH exerts opposite effects. Furthermore CRH may enhance rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). Changes in the GHRH:CRH ratio in favor of CRH appear to contribute to sleep EEG and endocrine changes during depression and normal ageing. In women, however, CRH-like effects of GHRH were found. Besides CRH somatostatin impairs sleep, whereas ghrelin, galanin and neuropeptide Y promote sleep. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide appears to be involved in the temporal organization of human sleep. Beside of peptides, steroids participate in sleep regulation. Cortisol appears to promote REMS. Various neuroactive steroids exert specific effects on sleep. The beneficial effect of estrogen replacement therapy in menopausal women suggests a role of estrogen in sleep regulation. The GABAA receptor or GABAergic neurons are involved in the action of many of these hormones. Recently synthetic GABAA agonists, particularly gaboxadol and the GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine were shown to differ distinctly in their action from allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor like benzodiazepines as they promote slow-wave sleep, decrease wakefulness and do not affect REMS.

AB  - The purpose of the present paper was to review the current models of mental health service delivery used in the emergency department (ED) setting. A search was conducted of the nursing and medical literature from 1990 to 2007 for relevant articles and reports. Consideration was also given to the global and local context influencing contemporary mental health services. Wider sociopolitical and socioeconomic influences and systemic changes in health-care delivery have dictated a considerable shift in attention for mental health services worldwide. The ED is a topical location that has attracted interest and necessitated a response. The mental health liaison nurse (MHLN) role embedded within the ED structure has demonstrated the most positive outcomes to date. This model aims to raise mental health awareness and address concerns over patient-focused outcomes such as reduced waiting times, therapeutic intervention and more efficient coordination of care and follow up for individuals presenting to the ED in psychological distress. Further research is required into all methods of mental health service delivery to the ED. The MHLN role is a cost-effective approach that has gained widespread approval from ED staff and mental health patients and is consistent with national and international expectations for mental health services to become fully integrated within general health care. The mental health nurse practitioner role situated within the ED represents a potentially promising alternative for enhanced public access to specialized mental health care.

AB  - objective: Since the diagnosis of delayed-onset posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was introduced in DSM-III, there has been controversy over its prevalence and even its existence. The authors sought to resolve discrepant find cerning the prevalence of delayed-onset PTSD by conducting a systematic review of the evidence.
   Method: A literature search was conducted for case reports and group studies with adequate measurement of delayed-onset PTSD according to DSM criteria. Studies that met inclusion criteria were examined for the defined length of delay for delayed-onset PTSD, presence of symptoms before full diagnostic criteria were met, length of follow-up, prevalence estimates, and other variables. Studies were also examined for differences between immediate-onset PTSD, delayed-onset PTSD, and no-PTSD cases.
   Results: Ten case studies and 19 group studies met criteria for inclusion in the review. Studies consistently showed that delayed-onset PTSD in the absence of any prior symptoms was rare, whereas delayed onsets that represented exacerbations or reactivations of prior symptoms accounted on average for 38.2% and 15.3%, respectively, of military and civilian cases of PTSD.
   Conclusions: The discrepant findings in the literature concerning prevalence can be largely, but not completely, explained as being due to definitional issues. Little is known about what distinguishes the delayed-onset and immediate-onset forms of the disorder. Continuing scientific study of delayed-onset PTSD would benefit if future editions of DSM were to adopt a definition that explicitly accepts the likelihood of at least some prior symptoms.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the available scientific literature for answers to clinically relevant questions regarding the effectiveness and tolerability of antidepressant drugs (ADs) for the acute phase treatment of depression and to assess the degree to which the literature supports the findings.
   Methods: We used several sources to identify primary reviews: MEDLINE (1955 to April 2006), EMBASE (1980 to April 2006), PsyclNFO (1980 to April 2006), and the Cochrane Library 2006 Issue 1. Additional searches were also carried out on the following databases of the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination: Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment, and Turning Research into Practice. We also searched the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidance website. We carried out a metareview of selected high-quality systematic reviews of short-term pharmacologic interventions with ADs for major depression. To assess efficacy, we followed the hierarchy of evidence proposed by the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (Oxford), including only reviews of randomized controlled trials. To assess tolerability, we also considered observational data when randomized evidence was not available.
   Results: There was randomized evidence that ADs are efficacious in primary care settings and that there may be small, but clinically important, differences in efficacy between ADs. There was no good evidence that an AD combined with an antipsychotic is superior to AD monotherapy in cases of psychotic depression or that intravenous administration leads to more rapid response. There was evidence that monoamine oxidase inhibitors are superior to tricyclic antidepressants, but not to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), in treating atypical depression. There is some evidence of harm related to the use of SSRIs in pregnancy but not to their use when breastfeeding. There is evidence that SSRIs may increase suicidal thoughts, but not actual suicide, in early-phase therapy.
   Conclusions: We found a substantial body of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ADs in the treatment of depressive disorder. Nonetheless, there remains considerable residual uncertainty. The evidence is inadequate for generally applicable recommendations; in most cases, the balance between risks and benefits will need to be considered for individual patients. Clinicians should also be guided by the recommendations and warnings issued by drug regulatory authorities.

AB  - Objective: To examine the available scientific evidence for answers to clinically relevant questions on the effectiveness and tolerability of antidepressant drugs (ADs) for the long-term treatment of depression.
   Method: The Cochrane Library was searched up to July 2006. When no complete Cochrane review was available, we looked in PubMed for relevant systematic reviews or individual randomized controlled trials.
   Results: There was no good evidence that increasing the dosage of the initial AD is an effective strategy for patients with no, or partial, response to acute-phase treatment. There was no good evidence that switching between chemical classes of antidepressant was more effective than switching within a class. There was limited support from randomized trials for several augmentation strategies. There was good evidence for the effectiveness of long-term therapy to prevent relapse in patients who remitted after acute-phase treatment. The application of principles of evidence-based medicine suggested that thoughtful, individualized application of evidence is more appropriate than general statements.
   Conclusions: Available evidence provides some support for the effectiveness of several augmentation strategies in the management of patients with no, or partial, response to acute-phase treatment and for the individualized application of groupwise robust evidence for maintenance treatment with ADs to prevent relapses. However, side effects of these long-term treatments with ADs are poorly studied and reported.

AB  - Employers' duties of care under both common and statute law include the need to take reasonable care of the health and safety of the workforce. This includes both the moral and legal duties to consider the psychological needs of personnel following exposure to traumatic events related to the workplace. While this has been recognized within many high-risk occupations such the police, fire and rescue services and the military, there is also evidence that post-trauma support in the workplace is increasingly commonly provided not only among health and social services agencies, but within many private sector organizations. Over the past decade, however, there has been considerable controversy over the provision of early psychological support to personnel in the form of critical incident stress management ( CISM) processes. In particular, one aspect of CISM, the use of psychological debriefing ( PD) has come under scrutiny and criticism as two studies indicated that PD was ineffective and had the potential to do harm. Inevitably, this has provoked much uncertainty and confusion among some organizations as what should be the most appropriate support. It has also led to misconceptions and misunderstandings as to the aims and purpose of PD, together with inaccuracies of terminology, for example describing PD as 'counselling'. Despite the controversy, both CISM and PD continue to be provided on a widespread basis, often utilizing a framework of voluntary peer group support. This paper intends to ( i) present a review of the current status of CISM practices, including the use of PD within various organizations in the UK and ( ii) provide a clear framework and understanding of the main issues and to clarify conceptual misunderstandings. The history, principles and background of the use of post-trauma support in the workplace, charting trends over the past two decades, previous research, problems with the evidence base and current thinking and practice in the field are reviewed. The relevance and implications of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence Guidelines on the Assessment and Management of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which make recommendations for early interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder are discussed. Reference is made to the use of CISM and PD within both statutory and voluntary organizations in an international context.

TI  - Landscape Planning to Promote Well Being: Studies and Examples from Sweden
KW  - STRESS RECOVERY
KW  - RESTORATION
AB  - There has been a rapid increase in knowledge regarding the importance of the external environment to our health. Eight characteristics of the outdoor environment (serene, wild, lush, spacious, the common, the pleasure garden, festive/ centre, and culture) have been identified as fulfilling recreational needs through a number of environmental psychology studies carried out at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Alnarp, Sweden, between 1995 and 2005. The external environment has become an increasingly decisive factor in people's choices regarding where to live and work; the landscape has become a competitive factor in attempts made by companies and local authorities to attract well-educated, mobile manpower and housing. Knowledge-based companies predominate in the resund Region of Sweden and Denmark, which at present has substantial recreational values making it an attractive area in which to live and work. The region's annual population growth is approximately 20,000 to 25,000 inhabitants. The prime ministers of Sweden and Denmark have expressed a common objective that the resund Region be one of Europe's cleanest metropolitan regions. The objective of this article is to present methods for implementing the eight characteristics as indicators for impact assessment in planning projects. The article presents case studies of the application of environmental impact assessments in the municipalities of Malm and Svedala, which are situated in the immediate vicinity of the resund Bridge. Development plans are being evaluated through impact assessment. Mitigation and compensation measures are being created to achieve the environmental quality goals defined by the eight characteristics. The case studies referred to in this article are in very early planning phases, either the feasibility or pre-feasibility phase. This article does not present complete investigations of balancing, but discusses some principal ways of defining values and suggests measures for mitigating and compensating for negative impacts on existing values.

AB  - This paper draws on a governmentality framing to consider the global fight against corruption and the role of accounting in that fight. Specifically it examines two contrasting modes of thought or 'mentalities' in the anticorruption field and the manner in which they shape, envision, and constitute the cultural and technological practice of accounting. The first of these-the orthodox mentality-is evident in the programmatic discourses and academic research of the major anticorruption organizations (esp., the World Bank, United Nations, IMF, OECD, and Transparency International). This mentality has us envision accounting's involvement in the fight as part of a relatively unproblematic if not noble cause. The second, radical mentality draws on race- , gender-, and class-based commentaries and has us see accounting's involvement in more ambivalent terms: as a potential enabler but also a potential constrainer of economic accountability and the achievement of the liberal republican dream.

AB  - Considering the multi-etiological character of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the current pharmacological approaches using drugs oriented towards a single molecular target possess limited ability to modify the course of the disease and thus, offer a partial benefit to the patient. In line with this concept, novel strategies include the use of a cocktail of several drugs and/or the development of a single molecule, possessing two or more active neuroprotective-neurorescue moieties that simultaneously manipulate multiple targets involved in AD pathology. A consistent observation in AD is a dysregulation of metal ions (Fe2+, CU2+ and Zn2+) homeostasis and consequential induction of oxidative stress, associated with beta-amyloid aggregation and neurite plaque formation. In particular, iron has been demonstrated to modulate the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor holo-protein expression by a pathway similar to that of ferritin L-and H-mRNA translation through iron-responsive elements in their 5'UTRs. This review will discuss two separate scenarios concerning multiple therapy targets in AD, sharing in common the implementation of iron chelation activity: (i) novel multimodal brain-permeable iron chelating drugs, possessing neuroprotective-neurorescue and amyloid precursor protein-processing regulatory activities; (ii) natural plant polyphenols (flavonoids), such as green tea epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and curcumin, reported to have access to the brain and to possess multifunctional activities, such as metal chelation-radical scavenging, anti-inflammation and neuroprotection.

AB  - Background Black and minority ethnic (BME) patients are disproportionately detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. There has been no systematic exploration of differences within and between ethnic groups, nor of the explanations put forward for this excess.
   Aims To systematically review detention and ethnicity, with meta-analyses of detention rates for BME groups, and to explore the explanations offered for ethnic differences in detention rates.
   Method Literature search and meta-analysis. Explanations offered were categorised, supporting literature was accessed and the strength of the evidence evaluated.
   Results In all, 49 studies met inclusion criteria; of these, 19 were included in the meta-analyses. Compared with White patients, Black patients were 3.83 times, BME patients 3.35 times and Asian patients 2.06 times more likely to be detained. The most common explanations related to misdiagnosis and discrimination against BME patients, higher incidence of psychosis and differences in illness expression. Many explanations, including that of racism within mental health services, were not supported by clear evidence.
   Conclusions Although BME status predicts psychiatric detention in the UK, most explanations offered for the excess detention of BME patients are largely unsupported.

AB  - The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) coordinate various stress responses. Although the effects of stressors on mPFC and BLA activity have been previously examined, it remains unclear to what extent stressors affect functional interactions between these regions. In vivo electrophysiology in the anesthetized rat was used to examine mPFC and BLA activity simultaneously in response to FG-7142, a benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist that mimics various stress responses, in an attempt to model the effects of stressors on corticolimbic functional connectivity. Extracellular unit and local field potential (LFP) recordings, using multielectrode arrays positioned in mPFC and BLA, were conducted under basal conditions and in response to systemic FG-7142 administration. This drug increased mPFC and BLA unit firing at the lowest dose tested, whereas higher doses of FG-7142 decreased various burst firing parameters in both regions. Moreover, LFP power was attenuated at lower (<1 Hz) and potentiated at higher frequencies in mPFC (1-12 Hz) and BLA (4-8 Hz). Interestingly, FG-7142 diminished synchronized unit firing, both within and between mPFC and BLA. Finally, FG-7142 decreased LFP synchronization between these regions. In a separate group of animals, pretreatment with the selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil blocked the changes in burst firing, LFP power and synchronized activity induced by FG-7142, confirming direct benzodiazepine receptor-mediated effects. These results indicate that FG-7142 disrupts corticolimbic network interactions via benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonism. Perturbation of mPFC-BLA functional connectivity induced by FG-7142 may provide a useful model of corticolimbic dysfunction induced by stressors.

AB  - Oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and excitotoxicity are frequently considered distinct but common hallmarks of several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Although neuron degeneration and death are the ultimate consequences of these pathological processes, it is now widely accepted that alterations in the function of surrounding glial cells are key features in the progression of these diseases. In response to alteration in their local environment, microglia, commonly considered the resident immune cells of the nervous parenchyma, become activated and release a variety of soluble factors. Among these, proinflammatory cytokines and free radicals actively participate in the degenerative insults. In addition, excitotoxic neuronal damage resulting from excessive glutamate is frequently associated with impaired handling of extracellular glutamate by gliotic astrocytes. Although several research projects have focused on the biochemical mechanisms of the regulation of glial glutamate transporters, a relationship between activation of microglia and modulation of astrocytic glutamate uptake is now suggested. The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the data showing an influence of inflammatory mediators and related free radicals on the expression and activity of glial glutamate transporters.

   Method: Meta-analyses were undertaken by using data from all relevant randomized-controlled trials identified by a comprehensive literature search. The primary outcome was relative risk (RR) of response.
   Results: We identified 27 studies containing 35 comparisons and 1744 participants. At post-treatment, psychotherapy was significantly superior (RR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.18-1.65, P = 0.0001, number-needed to treat 4.3). There was an evidence of the existence of small study effects, including a publication bias (P < 0.001). The superiority of psychotherapy was no longer statistically significant (1.18 [0.94-1.47], P = 0.15) at 6-month follow-up. None of the studies reported adverse effects or cost-effectiveness outcomes.
   Conclusion: Although the findings were biased by some small positive trials, psychotherapies appear to help depressed youths for the short term, but are no longer significantly favourable at 6-month follow-up.

KW  - philosophy
KW  - mind
AB  - Without special examination the brain offers no clue that it is the organ of the mind. From the dawn of time man thus either ignored the problem as to the source of thought, or attributed it to a variety of anatomical structures, usually the heart. The brain held no place in such intuitions, and in most languages it is analogized to bone marrow. Furthermore, nothing in early medical systems claimed any intellectual capacity for the brain; and the Egyptians, so fastidious in care for their afterlife, heedlessly discarded the brain in funerary practice. It was thus a unique event in world history when Alkmaion of Kroton (Alcmaeon, ca. 500 BC), based on anatomical evidence, proposed that the brain was essential for perception. Although no writings of Alkmaion survived, it was probably via a fortuitous linkage that his idea of the mental primacy of the brain was transmitted to, and preserved within, the teachings of the Hippocratic school. Nothing, of course, was secure as to mechanism, two millennia unfolding until the search for mind passed from the ventricles to the cerebral cortex. Nonetheless, Alkmaion was the beginning, and the ensuing understanding that he initiated is still transforming humanity's perception of the natural world, and their place within it. (c) 2007 IBRO.

AB  - Objectives: Several MRI studies have investigated the anterior cingulate in schizophrenia, as this is a key region for emotional processing and higher executive performances. A systematic review of structural MRI studies and a meta-analysis were conducted to explore whether anterior cingulate volumes are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia.
   Method: A systematic search strategy was used to identify eligible MRI studies. Thereafter, a meta-analysis was carried out by using a random effect model. Also, a meta-regression analysis was used to assess the influence of age, gender and slice thickness on effect sizes.
   Results: The meta-analysis was performed on seven studies. These results showed that the anterior cingulate volumes were significantly reduced in patients compared to healthy controls. Significant heterogeneity between these studies was observed. The meta-regression demonstrated that the effect size was significantly related only to slice thickness.
   Conclusions: Our work confirmed the presence of abnormally reduced anterior cingulate volumes in schizophrenia. However, several methodological issues limited the interpretation of these findings. Among these were different MR acquisition parameters and the small size of the sample, which was mostly composed of chronic patients. Future MRI studies should be planned to better understand the functional expression of anterior cingulate structural abnormalities. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ongoing discussion of potential benefits and risks of antidepressant treatment with respect to suicidal behaviors includes many ecological, or population-based, correlational studies of temporal or regional trends in suicide rates and rates of usage of modern antidepressants including serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Since this body of research has not been compiled and evaluated, we used computerized literature searching to identify 19 relevant published studies. They yielded heterogeneous findings: only 8/19 found significant inverse correlations between rising sales of modern antidepressants in the 1990s and falling suicide rates not anticipated in the 1980s. Average reductions in suicide rates in the 1990s (10.7%) and 1980s (10.0%) differed little in 11 studies with data from both eras. Reduction of suicide rates in the 1990s was unrelated to geographic region, population size, units of analysis, publication year, or growth in antidepressant usage, but was greater with higher initial suicide rates, in men, and in older persons. In the same decade, suicides rates decreased in only half of 79 large countries. Overall, these findings yield limited and inconsistent support for the hypothesis that increased use of modern antidepressants might limit suicide risk, and no evidence that the risk increased. Suicidal risk is determined by complex factors, including access to clinical services, in general, and more comprehensive treatment of depression, in particular. Overall, as with findings from randomized trials and cohort or case-control studies, evidence of specific antisuicidal effects of antidepressant treatment from ecological analyses remains elusive.

AB  - The neural membranes contain phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol, and proteins. Glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids are precursors for lipid mediators involved in signal transduction processes. Degradation of glycerophospholipids by phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) generates arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DNA). Arachidonic acid is metabolized to eicosanoids and DHA is metabolized to docosanoids. The catabolism of glycosphingolipids generates ceramide, ceramide 1-phosphate, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. These metabolites modulate PLA(2) activity. Arachidonic acid, a product derived from glycerophospholipid catabolism by PLA(2), modulates sphingomyelinase (SMase), the enzyme that generates ceramide and phosphocholine. Furthermore, sphingosine 1-phosphate modulates cyclooxygenase, an enzyme responsible for eicosanoid production in brain. This suggests that an interplay and cross talk occurs between lipid mediators of glycerophospholipid and glycosphingolipid metabolism in brain tissue. This interplay between metabolites of glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism may play an important role in initiation and maintenance of oxidative stress associated with neurologic disorders as well as in neural cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies indicate that PLA(2) and SMase inhibitors can be used as neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic agents. Development of novel inhibitors of PLA(2) and SMase may be useful for the treatment of oxidative stress, and apoptosis associated with neurologic disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and head and spinal cord injuries.

AB  - Aims - To explore the current state of Italian social psychiatry research as evidenced by original papers published in peer-reviewed journals 2004-2006. Methods - Electronic databases and hand searches of leading peer-reviewed journals were used to identify original research papers published in 2004-2006, addressing a social psychiatric issue, having at least one Italian author, and reporting data from Italian samples. Results - A total of 174 papers were identified. A substantial proportion reported findings of international collaborative research. Quantitative methods dominated, with 86 papers on cross-sectional surveys. Only 18 papers showed results of intervention trials with pre and post measures. Most common target group were psychiatric patients in community mental health services which featured in 93 papers. Conclusions - There is a critical mass of Italian social psychiatry research, dominated by a few research centres and with considerable amount of international collaboration. The findings of this survey might reflect the relative shortage of national funding for social psychiatry research.

AB  - The Val158Met polymorphism of the COMT gene is functional, easily detectable, and significantly related to metabolism of catecholamines, which underlie pathogenesis of a significant number of mental disorders. Evidence for the role of this polymorphism in schizophrenia, substance dependence, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is summed up in this review article. The results make it unlikely that the COMT gene plays an important role in these mental disorders, although a minor effect can not be excluded. Future studies on the COMT gene in mentally ill subjects should be stratified by clinical subtypes of the disorder, gender and ethnicity. Studies of endophenotypes instead of the complex disorder seem to be another promising research strategy. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions should also be considered. The COMT gene is probably not "a gene for" any mental disorder, but the Val158Met polymorphism appears to have pleiotropic effects on human behavior. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Genetic factors underlying alcoholism, substance abuse, antisocial and violent behaviour, psychosis, schizophrenia and psychopathy are emerging to implicate dopaminergic and cannabinoid, but also monoaminergic and glutamatergic systems through the maze of promoter genes and polymorphisms. Candidate gene association studies suggest the involvement of a range of genes in different disorders of CNS structure and function. Indices of comorbidity both complicate the array of gene-involvement and provide a substrate of hazardous interactivity. The putative role of the serotonin transporter gene in affective-dissociative spectrum disorders presents both plausible genetic variation and complication of comorbidity. The position of genetic variation is further complicated through ethnic, contextual and social factors that provide geometric progressions in the comordity already underlying diagnostic obstacles. The concept of shared biological susceptibilty to two or more disorder conditions of comorbidity seems a recurring observation, e.g., bipolar disorder with alcoholism or schizophrenia with alcohol/ substance abuse or diabetes with schizopsychotic disorder. Several lines of evidence seem to suggest that the factors influencing variation in one set of symptoms and those affecting one or more disorders are observed to a marked extent which ought to facilitate the search for susceptibility genes in comorbid brain disorders. Identification of regional genetic factors is awaited for a more compelling outline that ought eventually to lead to greater efficacy of symptom-disorder arrangements and an augmentation of current pharmacological treatment therapies.

AB  - No sensory stimulus is an island unto itself; rather, it can only properly be interpreted in light of the stimuli that surround it in space and time. This can result in entertaining illusions and puzzling results in psychological and neurophysiological experiments. We concentrate on perhaps the best studied test case, namely orientation or tilt, which gives rise to the notorious tilt illusion and the adaptation tilt after-effect. We review the empirical literature and discuss the computational and statistical ideas that are battling to explain these conundrums, and thereby gain favour as more general accounts of cortical processing.

AB  - Social neuroscience is a new, interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding how biological systems implement social processes and behavior. Social neuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses social and behavioral constructs and data to inform and refine theories of neural organization and function. We focus here on the progress and potential of social neuroscience in the area of mental health. Research in social neuroscience has grown dramatically in recent years. Among the most active areas of research we found are brain-imaging studies in normal children and adults; animal models of social behavior; studies of stroke patients; imaging studies of psychiatric patients; and research on social determinants of peripheral neural, neuroendocrine, and immunological processes. We also found that these areas of research are proceeding along largely independent trajectories. Our goals in this article are to review the development of this field, examine some currently promising approaches, identify obstacles and opportunities for future advances and integration, and consider how this research can inform work on the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.

AB  - The purpose of the present paper was to compare currently available diagnostic guidelines for juvenile bipolar disorder with respect to utility in research and clinical practice. A systematic search of psychiatric, medical and psychological databases was conducted using the terms 'juvenile bipolar disorder', 'paediatric bipolar disorder' and 'guidelines'. Three main sets of guidelines issued by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (UK), The National Institute of Mental Health (USA) and Child Psychiatric Workshop (USA) were found. There were key differences in the recommendations made by each regarding the diagnosis and symptomatic presentation of juvenile bipolar disorder. Although the diagnosis of juvenile bipolar disorder is gaining increased recognition, its definition remains controversial. It is recommended that clinicians and researchers need to develop diagnostic guidelines that have clinical salience and can be used for future research by incorporating key features of those that are currently available.

AB  - Mutations in PARKIN, PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and DJ-1 are found in autosomal recessive forms and some sporadic cases of Parkinson's disease. Recent work on these genes underscores the central importance of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease. In particular, pink1 and parkin loss-of-function mutants in Drosophila show similar phenotypes, and pink1 acts upstream of parkin in a common genetic pathway to regulate mitochondrial function. DJ-1 has a role in oxidative stress protection, but a direct role of DJ-1 in mitochondrial function has not been fully established. Importantly, defects in mitochondrial function have also been identified in patients who carry both PINK1 and PARKIN mutations, and in those who have sporadic Parkinson's disease. Future studies of the biochemical interactions between Pink1 and Parkin, and identification of other components in this pathway, are likely to provide insight into Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, and might identify new therapeutic targets.

AB  - Objective: One of the most popular approaches in cognitive neuroscience has been to study the normal adult human brain. However, there are likely to be limits to the knowledge that can be obtained from such studies. If we assume that no single approach can ever provide us with knowledge of causative processes whereby the mind emerges from the brain, then we need to consider how to combine more disparate approaches. I aim to illustrate here how the parallel study of brain phylogeny, ontogeny and dysfunction may bring us towards an integrative understanding of fundamental aspects of cognitive neuroscience.
   Methods: A review of published literature in these research areas was carried out and representative articles selected.
   Results: Comparative approaches, utilizing the extraordinary behavioural abilities as well as the structural and functional variants that evolution has thrown up across diverse groups of species, can inform the core neural systems that may be necessary and sufficient to support specific cognitive processes. Similarly, detailed studies of human brain development, focusing on structural and functional maturation correlated with temporal mapping of cognitive processes as they come 'on-line', may provide unique mechanistic insights. Finally, the study of brain dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression, may have the beneficial side-effect of greatly enhancing our understanding of healthy brain function.
   Conclusion: Each approach has its own epistemological advantages and disadvantages, but combined they may lead to more sophisticated, and empirically testable, models. In this review, I outline evidence for their utility, illustrate the approaches using specific examples and suggest how new advances in fields such as genomics, neurophysiology and neuroimaging may provide unprecedented opportunities in cognitive neuroscience.

AB  - Objective: To critically examine the relationship between evolutionary and developmental influences on human neocortex and the properties of the conscious mind it creates.
   Methods: Using PubMed searches and the bibliographies of several monographs, we selected 50 key works, which offer empirical support for a novel understanding of the organization of the neocortex.
   Results: The cognitive gulf between humans and our closest primate relatives has usually been taken as evidence that our brains evolved crucial new mechanisms somehow conferring advanced capacities, particularly in association areas of the neocortex. In this overview of neocortical development and comparative brain morphometry, we propose an alternative view: that an increase in neocortical size, alone, could account for novel and powerful cognitive capabilities. Other than humans' very large brain in relation to the body weight, the morphometric relations between neocortex and all other brain regions show remarkably consistent exponential ratios across the range of primate species, including humans. For an increase in neocortical size to produce new abilities, the developmental mechanisms of neocortex would need to be able to generate an interarchy of functionally diverse cortical domains in the absence of explicit specification, and in this respect, the mammalian neocortex is unique: its relationship to the rest of the nervous system is unusually plastic, allowing great changes in cortical organization to occur in relatively short periods of evolution. The fact that even advanced abilities like self-recognition have arisen in species from different mammalian orders suggests that expansion of the neocortex quite naturally generates new levels of cognitive sophistication. Our cognitive and behavioural sophistication may, therefore, be attributable to these intrinsic mechanisms' ability to generate complex interarchies when the neocortex reaches a sufficient size.
   Conclusion: Our analysis offers a parsimonious explanation for key properties of the human mind based on evolutionary influences and developmental processes. This view is perhaps surprising in its simplicity, but offers a fresh perspective on the evolutionary basis of mental complexity.

   Methods: A MEDLINE search (1985-2006) was performed, using the terms "electroconvulsive therapy," "anticonvulsants," "epilepsy," carbamazepine," "gabapentin," "lamotrigine," "topiramate," and valproate," supplemented by manual searches of guidelines and textbooks on ECT.
   Results: To date, no prospective, randomized and controlled trials examining outcome and safety of the AC-ECT combination have been published. Existing data are from case reports on the use of ECT for psychiatric conditions that are simultaneously treated with AC, and from case reports of patients treated with ECT and AC for epilepsy or for psychiatric conditions with comorbid epilepsy. Apart from an occasional difficulty in eliciting seizures, no severe adverse effects or complications are reported.
   Conclusions: The literature that is currently available indicates that ECT can be safely and effectively administered to patients treated with various AC. There is, however, no evidence to combine the 2 treatment modalities to augment therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Apoptosis of nigral dopaminergic neurons by various mechanisms is an emerging phenomenon involved in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways seems to be involved in death of nigral neurons, intrinsic pathway however, seems to be more important due to the energy crisis. Apoptosis by intrinsic pathway is executed by several initiators and effector caspases, which have been found activated in PD patients, experimental models as well as in neuronal cultures. Nitric oxide (NO) seems to be a central molecule due to its ability to modulate both pro and antiapoptotic phenomenon. The review focuses on the diverse extrinsic and intrinsic factors, signaling pathways and their modulation by NO leading to the death of dopaminergic neurons.

   Method: Articles published between 1966 and March 2006 were searched through electronic databases and hand search. A systematic review of comparative studies of structured implementation of specific psychiatric guidelines was performed. Rates of guideline adherence, provider performance data, illness detection and diagnostic accuracy rates were extracted in addition to patient relevant outcome data.
   Results: Eighteen studies (nine randomized-controlled trials, six non-randomized-controlled studies and three quasiexperimental before-and-after studies) were identified. Effects on provider performance or patient outcome were moderate and temporary in most cases. Studies with positive outcomes used complex multifaceted interventions or specific psychological methods to implement guidelines.
   Conclusions: There is insufficient high-quality evidence to draw firm conclusions on the effects of implementation of specific psychiatric guidelines.

AB  - Early psychosis (EP), in which the terms first-episode psychosis or first-break psychosis are also considered, is an area of developing research intensity. Although it is apparent that considerable progress has been made in establishing best practice criteria and protocols for EP in general, the particular issues pertaining to rural areas have not received the same attention. The purpose of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature of early psychosis programmes, initiatives and research in rural areas in order to help establish the best available evidence. The authors conducted a systematic search of major electronic databases, based on the NHMRC hierarchy of evidence, an established scale, for identified early psychosis cross-referenced with multiple rural terms, between the years 1995 and 2005. A total of 637 articles met the initial search criteria; 206 were identified as having primary significance; three dealt specifically with rural areas. There is a paucity of research findings or published literature concerning the specific needs or characteristics of early psychosis practice or service delivery in rural areas. A number of inferences and suggestions for further research, investigations and policy directions are put forward for consideration.

AB  - The purpose of the present paper was to determine what is currently documented about Indigenous Australians' understandings of mental health and mental disorders through a meta-synthesis of peer-reviewed qualitative empirical research. The following databases were electronically searched (1995-April 2006): AOA-FT and AIATSIS, Blackwell Synergy, CINAHL and Pre CINHAL, Health source: nursing/academic edition, Medline, Proquest health and medical complete, Psyclnfo, Science Direct, Synergy and HealthlnfoNet. Eligible studies were those written in English and published in peer-reviewed journals, empirical studies that considered Indigenous people's understandings of mental health and provided details on methodology. Five articles from four qualitative studies met these criteria. Meta-ethnography was used to identify common themes emerging from the original studies. Reciprocal translation was used to synthesize the findings to provide new interpretations extending beyond those presented in the original studies. An overarching theme emerged from the synthesis: the dynamic interconnectedness between the multi-factorial components of life circumstances. Reciprocal translations and synthesis regarding Indigenous understandings of mental health and illness resulted in five themes: (i) culture and spirituality; (ii) family and community kinships; (iii) historical, social and economic factors; (iv) fear and education; and (v) loss. The application of a meta-synthesis to these qualitative studies provided a deeper insight into Indigenous people's understandings of mental health and illness. The importance of understanding Indigenous descriptions and perceptions of mental health issues is crucial to enable two-way understandings between Indigenous people's constructs of wellness and Western biomedical diagnostic labels and treatment pathways for mental disorders and mental health problems.

AB  - Freshwater turtles overwintering in ice-covered ponds in North America may be exposed to prolonged anoxia, and survive this hostile environment by metabolic depression. Here, we review their cardiovascular function and regulation, with particular emphasis on the factors limiting cardiac performance. The pronounced anoxia tolerance of the turtle heart is based on the ability to match energy consumption with the low anaerobic ATP production during anoxia. Together with a well- developed temporal and spatial energy buffering by creatine kinase, this allows for cellular energy charge to remain high during anoxia. Furthermore, the turtle heart is well adapted to handle the adverse effects of free phosphate arising when phosphocreatine stores are used. Anoxia causes tenfold reductions in heart rate and blood flows that match the metabolic depression, and blood pressure is largely maintained through increased systemic vascular resistance. Depression of the heart rate is not driven by the autonomic nervous system and seems to arise from direct effects of oxygen lack and the associated hyperkalaemia and acidosis on the cardiac pacemaker. These intra- and extracellular changes also affect cardiac contractility, and both acidosis and hyperkalaemia severely depress cardiac contractility. However, increased levels of adrenaline and calcium may, at least partially, salvage cardiac function under prolonged periods of anoxia.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies of autobiographical memory have grown dramatically in recent years. These studies are important because they can investigate the neural correlates of processes that are difficult to study using laboratory stimuli, including: W complex constructive processes, (ii) recollective qualities of emotion and vividness, and (iii) remote memory retrieval. Constructing autobiographical memories involves search, monitoring and self-referential processes that are associated with activity in separable prefrontal regions. The contributions of emotion and vividness have been linked to the amygdala and visual cortex respectively. Finally, there is evidence that recent and remote autobiographical memories might activate the hippocampus equally, which has implications for memory-consolidation theories. The rapid development of innovative methods for eliciting personal memories in the scanner provides the opportunity to delve into the functional neuroanatomy of our personal past.

AB  - The striatum represents the main input into the basal ganglia. Neurons projecting from the striatum receive a large convergence of afferents from all areas of the cortex and transmit neural information to the basal ganglia output structures. Corticostriatal transmission is essential in the regulation of voluntary movement, in addition to behavioural control, cognitive function and reward mechanisms. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), the two main forms of synaptic plasticity, are both represented at corticostriatal synapses and strongly depend on the activation of dopamine receptors. Here, we discuss possible feedforward and feedback mechanisms by which striatal inter-neurons, in association with striatal spiny neurons and endogenous dopamine, influence the formation and maintenance of both UP and LTD. We also propose a model in which the spontaneous membrane oscillations of neurons projecting from the striatum (named 'up' and 'down' states), in addition to the pattern of release of endogenous dopamine, bias the synapse towards preferential induction of LTP or LTD. Finally, we discuss how endogenous dopamine crucially influences changes in synaptic plasticity induced by pathological stimuli, such as energy deprivation.

AB  - Objective: To investigate recent evidence suggesting that social factors are causally related to the development of schizophrenia.
   Method: I conducted a sytematic review of MEDLINE to identify possibly relevant studies. The search was limited to peer-reviewed studies and review articles appearing in English-language journals since 1996. Studies were included if they used standardized diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia or standardized assessment instruments for psychotic symptoms.
   Results: Studies of migrants to western Europe provide compelling support for the notion that social factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Findings such as excessively high risk for schizophrenia in second-generation immigrants are difficult to explain solely in terms of biological or genetic factors. A growing number of studies implicate childhood exposure to social adversity as a risk factor for schizophrenia, although few studies have used prospective designs. The increased incidence of schizophrenia risk associated with urban birth and (or) urban upbringing suggests possible social causation, but these findings are more ambiguous. Thus far, no studies have explored actual mechanisms by which exposure to social factors might generate psychotic symptoms, although animal experiments suggest that social defeat or social exclusion may cause dopamine dysregulation or sensitization.
   Conclusions: The accumulating evidence suggesting a role for social factors in the development of schizophrenia arises primarily from studies of migrants conducted in Europe. The mechanisms by which social factors exert their influence remain unknown. Future investigations of social causation should clarify the temporal relation between exposure to social defeat and (or) social adversity and the development of psychotic symptoms.

AB  - There are several brain regions that have been implicated in the control of motivated behavior and whose disruption leads to the pathophysiology observed in major psychiatric disorders. These systems include the ventral hippocampus, which is involved in context and focus on tasks, the amygdalla, which mediates emotional behavior, and the prefrontal cortex, which modulates activity throughout the limbic system to enable behavioral flexibility. Each of these systems has overlapping projections to the nucleus accumbens, where these inputs are integrated under the modulatory influence of dopamine. Here, we provide a systems-oriented approach to interpreting the function of the dopamine system, its modulation of limbic-cortical interactions and how disruptions within this system might underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and drug abuse.

AB  - Objective: To review the North American literature with respect to the role of social factors in the etiology of psychosis, including schizophrenia.
   Method: Relevant publications were identified through a search of MEDLINE from 1966 to 2006. Identified studies and articles had to originate in Canada or the United States to be included in the review. Articles written prior to 1966 were identified by cross-referencing bibliographies and reference lists. Articles were considered relevant if they discussed ethnoracial or other social factors as being causal or contributing to the development of psychosis or schizophrenia.
   Results: The relation between the etiology of psychosis and such social factors as poverty, migration, and racial discrimination has been neglected in the North American psychiatric literature for the last 40 years. In Canada and the United States, there is a dearth of research on these issues: the study of social causes of psychosis has been replaced by a focus on the clinical encounter, in which clinician bias is presumed to be responsible for widespread misdiagnosis of psychosis in minority (mainly African-American) populations. The reasons for neglecting social causes of psychosis in the North American psychiatric literature are obscure but may have to do with the rise of genetic-biological paradigms in recent decades.
   Conclusions: The neglect of social causes of psychosis in the North American psychiatric literature has been coincident with an increase in scholarly concern among European clinicians and researchers. Careful reading of the European literature may reveal helpful avenues for future investigation in the North American context. In addition, drawing on social science literature and methods may help to clarify mechanisms underlying poverty, migration, and racial discrimination that contribute to psychosis in vulnerable individuals and groups.

AB  - All organisms are adapted to well-defined extracellular salinity ranges. Osmoregulatory mechanisms spanning all levels of biological organization, from molecules to behavior, are central to salinity adaptation. Functional genomics and proteomics approaches represent powerful tools for gaining insight into the molecular basis of salinity adaptation and euryhalinity in animals. In this review, we discuss our experience in applying such tools to so-called `non-model' species, including euryhaline animals that are well-suited for studies of salinity adaptation. Suppression subtractive hybridization, RACE-PCR and mass spectrometry-driven proteomics can be used to identify genes and proteins involved in salinity adaptation or other environmental stress responses in tilapia, sharks and sponges. For protein identification in non-model species, algorithms based on sequence homology searches such as MSBLASTP2 are most powerful. Subsequent gene ontology and pathway analysis can then utilize sets of identified genes and proteins for modeling molecular mechanisms of environmental adaptation. Current limitations for proteomics in non- model species can be overcome by improving sequence coverage, N- and C-terminal sequencing and analysis of intact proteins. Dependence on information about biochemical pathways and gene ontology databases for model species represents a more severe barrier for work with non-model species. To minimize such dependence, focusing on a single biological process (rather than attempting to describe the system as a whole) is key when applying `omics' approaches to non-model organisms.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this review was to update the information on prevention and early intervention programmes for depression in adolescents.
   Method: We searched the literature to the end of July 2006 for published randomized controlled trials of psychological interventions specifically designed to prevent the onset of depression among children and adolescents (aged 5 to 19 years) who did not already meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of depressive illness.
   Results: Findings have been mixed. Positive results after intervention and at follow-up have been reported in a number of targeted studies, although an attempt to replicate findings in a school and in a primary care setting were unsuccessful. Most studies of universal interventions have shown a short-term effect that did not persist at follow-up. There are a number of methodological problems with studies to date. Issues that have not been addressed include taking into account the placebo effect, measuring the incidence of depressive disorder following intervention and ensuring the quality and fidelity of intervention is adequate. Interventions to date may have been too short to create durable change.
   Conclusions: There is no clear evidence to date that depression prevention is effective and implementation of depression prevention programmes would be premature on current evidence. However, given the positive finding in some studies, and the cost of depressive disorder, further research is warranted. Attempts to reduce depressive disorder in the community should address wider social issues, as well as improving on the narrower interventions focusing on individual protective and risk factors.

AB  - Lesioning and psychopharmacological studies suggest a wide range of behavioral functions for ascending midbrain dopaminergic systems. However, electrophysiological and neurochemical studies during specific behavioral tasks demonstrate a more restricted spectrum of dopamine-mediated changes. Substantial increases in dopamine-mediated activity, as measured by electrophysiology or voltammetry, are related to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli. A somewhat slower, distinct electrophysiological response encodes the uncertainty associated with rewards. Aversive events produce different, mostly slower, electrophysiological dopamine responses that consist predominantly of depressions. Additionally, more modest dopamine concentration fluctuations, related to punishment and movement, are seen at 200-18 000 times longer time courses using voltammetry and microdialysis in vivo. Using these responses, dopamine neurotransmission provides differential and heterogeneous information to subcortical and cortical brain structures about essential outcome components for approach behavior, learning and economic decision-making.

AB  - Parkinson's disease arises from genetic and possibly neurotoxic causes that produce massive cell death of the neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Loss of these neurons is essential for the diagnostic parkinsonian features. Although many genetic mutations have been suggested as causes or risk factors for Parkinson's disease, the low penetrance of some mutations and the low disease concordance in relatives suggests that there must be interactions between multiple factors. We suggest that 'multiple hits' that combine toxic stress, for example, from dopamine oxidation or mitochondrial dysfunction, with an inhibition of a neuroprotective response, such as loss of function of parkin or stress-induced autophagic degradation, underlie selective neuronal death. We discuss the properties of substantia nigra dopamine neurons that might make them particular targets of such multiple hits.

AB  - Students identified by talent search programs were studied to determine whether spatial ability could uncover math-science promise. In Phase 1, interests and values of intellectually talented adolescents (617 boys, 443 girls) were compared with those of top math-science graduate students (368 men, 346 women) as a function of their standing on spatial visualization to assess their potential fit with math-science careers. In Phase 2, 5-year longitudinal analyses revealed that spatial ability coalesces with a constellation of personal preferences indicative of fit for pursuing scientific careers and adds incremental validity beyond preferences in predicting math-science criteria. In Phase 3, data from participants with Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores were analyzed longitudinally, and a salient math-science constellation again emerged (with which spatial ability and SAT-Math were consistently positively correlated and SAT-Verbal was negatively correlated). Results across the 3 phases triangulate to suggest that adding spatial ability to talent search identification procedures (currently restricted to mathematical and verbal ability) could uncover a neglected pool of math-science talent and holds promise for refining our understanding of intellectually talented youth.

The objective of the current article is to review the evidence for the rationale and benefit of LCn-3PUFA in the treatment of common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.
   Methods: A search of Psychlit, PubMed and Cochrane Databases was conducted using the terms child, adolescent, bipolar, depression, psychosis, first-episode psychosis, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, psychiatric, omega-3, n-3, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. Further studies were identified from the bibliographies of published reviews.
   Results: One small randomized controlled trial with LCn-3PUFA supplementation in depression in children found a small beneficial effect over placebo. Four placebo-controlled trials showed uncertairi benefit of LCn-3PUFA for ADHD. Single placebo-controlled trials showed no benefit in autism or bipolar disorder. There is an absence of studies examining benefit for first-episode psychosis or schizophrenia in children and adolescents
   Conclusions: While children and adolescents are receiving LCn-3PUFA for a range of psychiatric indications, there is only evidence of likely benefit for unipolar depression.

AB  - The renaissance of synaesthesia research has produced many insights regarding the aetiology and mechanisms that might underlie this intriguing phenomenon, which abnormally binds features between and within modalities. Synaesthesia is interesting in its own right, but whether it contributes to our knowledge of neurocognitive systems that underlie non-synaesthete experience is an open question. In this review, we show that results from the field of synaesthesia can constrain cognitive theories in numerical cognition, automaticity, crossmodal interaction and awareness. Therefore, research of synaesthesia provides a unique window into other domains of cognitive neuroscience. We conclude that the study of synaesthesia could advance our understanding of the normal and abnormal human brain and cognition.

AB  - Aims - This study aimed to explore psychiatric patients' experiences of involuntary admission and treatment by reviewing qualitative studies. Method - Qualitative studies investigating patients' experiences of involuntary treatment were identified. Relevant databases were searched and authors were contacted. Thematic analysis was applied for the synthesis of emerging issues. Results - Five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The main areas that appear to be of importance are: patients' perceived autonomy and participation in decisions for themselves, their feeling of whether or not they are being cared for and their sense of identity. In these areas both negative and positive consequences from involuntary admission were mentioned. However, methodological weaknesses were also found, such as small sample sizes. Furthermore, it is not described whether these themes are mentioned by all participants as negative and positive aspects of their experience or whether they reflect views supported by distinct groups. Conclusions - Although the perceived impact of involuntary treatment is fairly clearly described, differences between distinct patient groups are not examined. Future research should investigate such differences in order to inform relevant policy decisions for particular groups.

AB  - Background: There is a wide range of literature on stigmatization and discrimination of people with mental illness. Most studies, however, derive from Western countries. This review aims at summarizing results from developing countries in Asia published between 1996-2006.
   Method: Medline search focusing on English-speaking literature.
   Results: Comparable to Western countries, there is a widespread tendency to stigmatize and discriminate people with mental illness in Asia. People with mental illness are considered as dangerous and aggressive which in turn increases the social distance. The role of supernatural, religious and magical approaches to mental illness is prevailing. The pathway to care is often shaped by scepticism towards mental health services and the treatments offered. Stigma experienced from family members is pervasive. Moreover, social disapproval and devaluation of families with mentally ill individuals are an important concern. This holds true particularly with regards to marriage, marital separation and divorce. Psychic symptoms, unlike somatic symptoms, are construed as socially disadvantageous. Thus, somatisation of psychiatric disorders is widespread in Asia. The most urgent problem of mental health care in Asia is the lack of personal and financial resources. Thus, mental health professionals are mostly located in urban areas. This increases the barriers to seek help and contributes to the stigmatization of the mentally ill. The attitude of mental health professionals towards people with mental illness is often stigmatizing.
   Conclusion: This review revealed that the stigmatization of people with mental illness is widespread in Asia. The features of stigmatization - beliefs about causes of and attitudes towards mental illness, consequences for help-seeking - have more commonalities than differences to Western countries.

AB  - Whereas structural information regarding anatomical abnormalities found in the brains of individuals with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) has been thoroughly investigated, few functional neuroimaging studies have been performed. The major structural anomalies are outlined and the results of the functional neuroimaging studies are described in detail. Links between the anatomical region of impairment, functional impairment, and the cognitive dysfunction found in FASD are proposed. A literature search revealed only five studies of functional neuroimaging in individuals with FASD. One study used positron emission tomography (PET), three used single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and one used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate brain metabolism and function. Of these, only fMRI actually examined task-related functional changes in the brain related to cognition. Although there is significant variability in the results, due to the heterogeneity of the syndrome and the few studies performed to date, clear regions of impairment related to cognitive dysfunction are described. The most consistent results involve the impairment of the frontal cortex, specifically the prefrontal cortex and medial frontal lobe, which is related to executive function, working memory, response inhibition, and attention. Consistent impairment was also noted in the temporal brain region, implicated in problems with emotions, memory, learning, and language functions.

AB  - Oxidative DNA lesions, such as 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), accumulate in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes during aging, and such accumulation can increase dramatically in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To counteract oxidative damage to nucleic acids, human and rodents are equipped with three distinct enzymes. One of these, MTH1, hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine triphosphate and 2-hydroxy-2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate, to their monophosphate forms. The other two enzymes are 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase encoded by the OGG1 gene and adenine/2-hydroxyadenine DNA glycosylase encoded by the MUTYH gene. We have shown a significant increase in 8-oxoG in mitochondrial DNA as well as an elevated expression of MTH1, OGG1, and MUTYH in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons of PD patients, suggesting that the buildup of these lesions may cause dopamine neuron loss. We established MTH1-null mice and found that MTH1-null fibroblasts were highly susceptible to cell death caused by H2O2 characterized by pyknosis and electron-dense deposits in the mitochondria, and that this was accompanied by an ongoing accumulation of 8-oxoG in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. We also showed that MTH1-null mice exhibited an increased accumulation of 8-oxoG in striatal mitochondrial DNA, followed by more extreme neuronal dysfunction after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine administration than that of wild-type mice. In conclusion, oxidative damage in nucleic acids is likely to be a major risk factor for Parkinson's disease, indicating that a solid understanding of the defense mechanisms involved will enable us to develop new strategies for protecting the brain against oxidative stress.

AB  - The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), which is important for higher cognitive activity, is also concerned with motivational operations; this is exemplified by its activity in relation to expectancy of rewards. In the LPFC, motivational information is integrated with cognitive information, as demonstrated by the enhancement of working-memory-related activity by reward expectancy. Such activity would be expected to induce changes in attention and, subsequently, to modify behavioral performance. Recently, the effects of motivation and emotion on neural activities have been examined in several areas of the brain in relation to cognitive-task performance. Of these areas, the LPFC seems to have the most important role in adaptive goal-directed behavior, by sending top-down attention-control signals to other areas of the brain.

AB  - Decisions about the classification of eating disorders have significant scientific and clinical implications. The eating disorder diagnoses in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) reflect the collective wisdom of experts in the field but are frequently not supported in empirical studies and do not capture the disorders of eating experienced by most people with an eating disorder. Statistical approaches to classification such as latent class analysis and taxometrics can help to create a classification system with greater scientific validity and clinical utility. The field would benefit from direct empirical comparisons of different classification schemes with various clinical and scientific validators. Such studies would enable the creators of the next DSM eating disorder classification to increase understanding of the advantages and disadvantages associated with choosing various diagnostic criteria sets for the eating disorders.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of assertive community treatment in the rehabilitation of homeless persons with severe mental illness using a meta-analysis.
   Method: A structured literature search identified studies for review. Inclusion criteria were the use of an assertive community treatment-based rehabilitation treatment in an experimental or quasi-experimental model, exclusive treatment of homeless subjects, and follow- up of housing and psychiatric outcomes. Two reviewers independently abstracted data on methodology and outcomes from included studies. The authors calculated effect differences, summary effects and confidence intervals (CIs) for housing, and hospitalization and symptom severity outcomes.
   Results: Of the 52 abstracts identified, 10 (19%) met inclusion criteria. Of these, six were randomized controlled trials, and four were observational studies, totaling 5,775 subjects. In randomized trials, assertive community treatment subjects demonstrated a 37% (95% CI= 18%-55%) greater reduction in homelessness and a 26% (95% CI= 7%-44%) greater improvement in psychiatric symptom severity compared with standard case management treatments. Hospitalization outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. In observational studies, assertive community treatment subjects experienced a 104% (95% CI= 67%-141%) further reduction in homelessness and a 62% (95% CI= 0%-124%) further reduction in symptom severity compared with pretreatment comparison subjects.
   Conclusions: Assertive community treatment offers significant advantages over standard case management models in reducing homelessness and symptom severity in homeless persons with severe mental illness.

AB  - The phrase primum non nocere ("first, do no harm") is a well-accepted credo of the medical and mental health professions. Although emerging data indicate that several psychological treatments may produce harm in significant numbers of individuals, psychologists have until recently paid little attention to the problem of hazardous treatments. I critically evaluate and update earlier conclusions regarding deterioration effects in psychotherapy, outline methodological obstacles standing in the way of identifying potentially harmful therapies (PHTs), provide a provisional list of PHTs, discuss the implications of PHTs for clinical science and practice, and delineate fruitful areas for further research on PHTs. A heightened emphasis on PHTs should narrow the scientist-practitioner gap and safeguard mental health consumers against harm. Moreover, the literature on PHTs may provide insight into underlying mechanisms of change that cut across many domains of psychotherapy. The field of psychology should prioritize its efforts toward identifying PHTs and place greater emphasis on potentially dangerous than on empirically supported therapies.

AB  - Objective: Delirium is highly prevalent in general hospitals but remains underrecognized and undertreated despite its association with increased morbidity, mortality, and health services utilization. To enhance its management, we developed guidelines covering all aspects, from risk factor identification to preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions in adult patients. Methods: Guidelines, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCT), and cohort studies were systematically searched and evaluated. Based on a synthesis of retrieved high-quality documents, recommendation items were submitted to a multidisciplinary expert panel. Experts scored the appropriateness of recommendation items, using an evidence-based, explicit, multidisciplinary panel approach. Each recommendation was graded according to this process' results. Results: Rated recommendations were mostly supported by a low level of evidence (1.3% RCT and systematic reviews, 14.3% nonrandomized trials vs. 84.4% observational studies or expert opinions). Nevertheless, 71.1% of recommendations were considered appropriate by the experts. Prevention of delirium and its nonpbarmacological management should be fostered. Haloperidol remains the first-choice drug, whereas the role of atypical antipsychotics is still uncertain. Conclusions: While many topics addressed in these guidelines have not yet been adequately studied, an explicit panel and evidence-based approach allowed the proposal of comprehensive recommendations for the prevention and management of delirium in general hospitals.

   Method: A systematic literature search was conducted, supplemented by a manual search, and a search of public online information on paediatric antidepressant trials reviewed by regulatory agencies.
   Results: Data gathered from published and unpublished randomized controlled trials vary in their findings, with most of the studies showing a lack of efficacy characterized by a high placebo response rate.
   Conclusion: Differences from efficacy results with the same drugs in adult depression may be because of neurobiological developmental correlates, developmental differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, high rates of placebo response in children, and a number of methodological influences. There are several areas needing more attention in paediatric antidepressant clinical trials. Judicious use of published and unpublished studies to assess who may benefit from treatment with antidepressants seems warranted.

AB  - Objective. To conduct a systematic review of workplace stress management intervention studies that have incorporated process evaluation.
   Data Source. Electronic databases such as PsycINFO and MEDline were searched.
   Study Inclusion Criteria. The inclusion criteria included interventions published in the English language that were focused on either individual- or organizational-level stress management interventions at the workplace, with an outcome evaluation.
   Data Extraction. Each article was coded on key process-relevant variables, including context, recruitment, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, implementation, and participant's attitudes toward the intervention. Studies that reported on at Least one of these process variables were also coded on the following study characteristics: participants, setting, evaluation design, intervention content, intervention format, and study outcomes.
   Data Synthesis. Statistical Package for the Social Science was used to analyze the data with descriptive statistics.
   Results. Of the 84 studies identified that met the study inclusion criteria, 52 (61.9%) reported findings on at least one of the key relevant process-relevant variables. Variables most frequently included were recruitment (30%), intervention dose received (22%), participants' attitudes toward intervention (19%), and program reach (13%). Fewer than half of the studies presented any findings linking process evaluation and outcome evaluation.
   Conclusions. The incomplete reporting of information relevant to Process evaluation makes it difficult to identify reliable determinants of effective intervention implementation or outcomes.

AB  - Recently, more empirical studies have been devoted to the investigation of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in children and adolescents. Against this background, the purpose of the current review is to compare research findings on diagnostic-related phenomena in child and adolescent samples with those in adult samples to establish the utility of the BPD construct in childhood and adolescence. A search of relevant publications reported in Pubmed and PsycInfo from 1940 (the first clinical descriptions of BPD in childhood) to 2006 was carried out. A total of 58 studies were included. The review of the adult literature was not exhaustive but relied on excellent existing and comprehensive reviews of the adult literature carried out in the past 5 years. Although significant differences seem to exist between juveniles and adults in diagnostic-related phenomena associated with BPD, these can be explained by the principle of heterotypic continuity in development. Moreover, enough overlap between juvenile and adult BPD has been observed to warrant further empirical investigation into the construct of juvenile BPD. Specific areas for future research in juvenile BPD suggested by this review include studies of comorbidity, measure development, and the use of neurobiological measures such as functional neuroimaging (Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic, 711[2], 85-114).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature to determine whether racial disparities exist in the diagnosis and treatment of depression in the United States. A literature search using PubMed of potentially relevant articles in English that include data from population-based studies examining the diagnosis and/or treatment of depression; or data from prospective studies stratifying the rates of diagnosis and/or treatment of depression by race/ethnicity and ethnic comparisons between Caucasians, African Americans and/or Hispanics. Initial searches identified 2,396 articles. On the basis of our criteria, 14 articles were eligible for inclusion in this review. Four included data on the diagnosis of depression in different ethnic groups; their results were not consistent. Twelve included data on treatment variability in the treatment of depression; overall these suggested lower rates of treatment for African Americans and Hispanics than for Caucasians. More research is needed focusing on ethnic variation in the diagnosis of depression. Racial disparities exist in the treatment of depression.

   Methods: Both a computerized (Medline) and a manual search of the literature were performed.
   Results: In a substantial proportion of patients with depression a prodromal phase can be identified. There is a relationship between residual and prodromal symptomatology (the roll-back phenomenon).
   Conclusions: Appraisal of prodromal phase of major depression has important implications as to pathophysiological models of disease and relapse prevention. It may allow a staging system of depressive illness that may yield more enduring results in the therapeutic efforts.

AB  - Manganese is an essential trace element for the development and function of the central nervous system. Alterations in manganese concentrations, whether excessive or deficient, can be accompanied by convulsions. This article represents a systematic review of available quantitative evidence that might clarify this issue. We searched The Cochrane Library, Medline and LILACS databases from January 1966 through June 2006 and reviewed all resulting English and Spanish language publications, as well as those possibly relevant in other languages based on their abstracts. The final selection included for this review comprises all investigations in humans and animals that compared manganese levels in any tissue of a group with spontaneous or induced convulsions (with or without antiepileptic treatment) and a convulsion-free control group. The literature search identified thirteen publications since then relevant to the issue, four of which failed to meet our criteria for inclusion. of the remaining nine, six were in humans and three in rodents. At present, there is no satisfactory explanation for the relationship between low manganese levels and the presence of convulsions. There is a documented correlation between low blood manganese levels and the presence of convulsions in both humans and animals. The lack of evidence indicating whether this is a cause or an effect of the convulsions clearly justifies more detailed follow-up investigations in humans. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-parkinsonism dementia complex (ALS-PDC) is a unique neurodegenerative disease found on the island of Guam. This disease presents as a spectrum of neurological disorders characterized by features of ALS, parkinsonism, dementia, or a combination. The strongest epidemiological link has been to the consumption of the seeds from the cycad plant that purportedly contained a neurotoxin. Mice fed washed cycad flour show signs that mimic ALS-PDC, which include progressive deficits in motor, cognitive, and olfactory functions associated with neuron loss in the spinal cord, nigrostriatal system, cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Through a series of chemical extractions of washed cycad flour, we identified steryl glycoside molecules as bioactive molecules that are neurotoxic in culture and in mice. A detailed review of this class of molecule revealed that the molecules are abundant in the environment, particularly in plants and bacteria. Lipid analysis showed that some bacteria that are associated with some forms of neurodegenerative disorders have the capacity to synthesize steryl glycosides. Furthermore, certain steryl glycosides have been found to be a cell stress mediator and may have some immunomodulary effects. We hypothesize that steryl glycosides are putative neurotoxins involved in the etiopathogenesis of several age-related neurodegenerative disorders. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a comprehensive literature review of the area of neural stem cells and neuro psychiatry.
   Methods: 'Neural stem cells' (NSCs) and 'neurogenesis' were used as keywords in Medline (1966 - November 2006) to identify relevant papers in the areas of Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease (PD). This list was supplemented with papers from reference lists of seminal reviews.
   Results: The concept of a 'stem cell' continues to evolve and is currently defined by operational criteria related to symmetrical renewal, multipotency and functional viability. In vivo adult mammalian neurogenesis occurs in discrete niches in the subventricular and subgranular zones - however, functional precursor cells can be generated in vitro from a wide variety of biological sources. Both artificial and physiological microenvironment is therefore critical to the characteristics and behaviour of neural precursors, and it is not straightforward how results from the laboratory can be extrapolated to the living organism. Transplant strategies in PD have shown that it is possible for primitive neural tissue to engraft into neuropathic brain areas, become biologically functional and lead to amelioration of clinical signs and symptoms. However, with long-term follow-up, significant problems related to intractable side-effects and potential neoplastic growth have been reported. These are therefore the potentials and pitfalls for NSC technology in neuropsychiatry. In AD, the physiology of amyloid precursor protein may directly interact with NSCs, and a role in memory function has been speculated. The role of endogenous neurogenesis has also been implicated in the etiology of depression. The significance of NSCs and neurogenesis for schizophrenia is still emerging.
   Conclusions: There are a number of technical and conceptual challenges ahead before the promise of NSCs can be harnessed for the understanding and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further research into fundamental NSC biology and how this interacts with the neuropsychiatric disease processes is required.

AB  - A decade has yielded much progress in understanding polar disturbance and community recovery-mainly through quantifying ice scour rates, other disturbance levels, larval abundance and diversity, colonization rates and response of benthos to predicted climate change. The continental shelf around Antarctica is clearly subject to massive disturbance, but remarkably across so many scales. In summer, millions of icebergs from sizes smaller than cars to larger than countries ground out and gouge the sea floor and crush the benthic communities there, while the highest wind speeds create the highest waves to pound the coast. In winter, the calm associated with the sea surface freezing creates the clearest marine water in the world. But in winter, an ice foot encases coastal life and anchor ice rips benthos from the sea floor. Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years, glaciations have done the same on continental scales-ice sheets have bulldozed the seabed and the zoobenthos to edge of shelves. We detail and rank modern disturbance levels (from most to least): ice; asteroid impacts; sediment instability; wind/wave action; pollution; UV irradiation; volcanism; trawling; non-indigenous species; freshwater inundation; and temperature stress. Benthic organisms have had to recolonize local scourings and continental shelves repeatedly, yet a decade of studies have demonstrated that they have (compared with lower latitudes) slow tempos of reproduction, colonization and growth. Despite massive disturbance levels and slow recolonization potential, the Antarctic shelf has a much richer fauna than would be expected for its area. Now, West Antarctica is among the fastest warming regions and its organisms face new rapid changes. In the next century, temperature stress and non-indigenous species will drastically rise to become dominant disturbances to the Antarctic life. Here, we describe the potential for benthic organisms to respond to disturbance, focusing particularly on what we know now that we did not a decade ago.

AB  - Farmworkers are low-paid, uninsured employees in an extremely hazardous industry, and they provide an essential service for U.S. society. This review evaluates the delivery of health services to farmworkers. It describes the farmworker population in the United States, noting characteristics (e.g., migratory and immigration status) that limit their access to and utilization of health services. It describes the health services needs of this population, including occupational health, mental health, oral health, and chronic disease treatment. Cultural, structural, legal, financial, and geographic barriers to health services utilization are described. Existing research on health services utilization among farmworkers is discussed. Programs that have been developed to address the barriers to health services utilization among farmworkers are reviewed. Finally, research needed to improve knowledge of farmworker health services utilization is suggested. These research needs include formal evaluations of existing programs and basic research to characterize the health services utilization patterns of farmworkers.

TI  - Housing, place or social networks: What's more important for relocating tenants?
AB  - Urban regeneration is increasingly used by Australian governments as a means of physically upgrading ageing public dwelling stock, but little is known about the social implications of regeneration projects. For public tenants involuntarily relocated for urban regeneration, relocation risks added stress and disruption for an already disadvantaged population. However, it also has the potential to improve residential satisfaction. Moving may provide an opportunity to improve the quality of housing in terms of room size, space and other physical characteristics, the opportunity to live in a better or safer neighbourhood, access to better services and a broadening of social networks. This paper reports on the findings of a research project investigating the comparative influences-quality of housing, residential environment, and social networks-on residential satisfaction after relocation. Tenants were interviewed before and after relocation from Ferryden Park in South Australia as part of The Parks Urban Regeneration Project, to date Australia's largest regeneration project. The study found that in determining the self-perceived success of relocation, at least for this group of tenants, the quality of the post relocation housing was the most important factor. The implication for planners is that although familial and friendship networks are still important, the quality of post relocation housing is likely to have a greater influence on whether or not tenants are satisfied with moving as part of urban regeneration projects.

They embody the results of a systematic review of all available clinical and scientific evidence pertaining to the treatment of unipolar depressive disorders and offer practical recommendations for general practitioners encountering patients with these conditions. The guidelines cover disease definition, classification, epidemiology and course of unipolar depressive disorders and the principles of management in the acute, continuation and maintenance phase. They deal primarily with biological treatment (including antidepressants, other psychopharmacological and hormonal medications, electro convulsive therapy, light therapy).

AB  - Objective: Up to 15% of depression patients eventually present with treatment-resistant or refractory depression (TRD), a condition that causes significant social and economic burdens. Our paper aims to summarize the current medical literature on the conceptual and methodologic issues involved in the definition, assessment, and staging of TRD.
   Method: We reviewed the recently published medical literature to identify papers that specifically discuss TRD. For this, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for potentially relevant English-language articles published between January 1996 and June 2006.
   Results: Recent methodologic and conceptual advances have contributed to the achievement of an acceptable level of theoretical consensus on the general meaning of TRD. Accordingly, depression is usually considered resistant or refractory when at least 2 trials with antidepressants from different pharmacologic classes (adequate in terms of dosage, duration, and compliance) fail to produce a significant clinical improvement. Regarding diagnostic assessments, an accurate and systematic evaluation should be made to elicit the potential role of several contributing factors, such as medical and psychiatric comorbidity.
   Conclusion: Recently, 3 staging methods for TRD have been described, but they currently require extensive empirical support. Future research on TRD should include prospective studies addressing the validity of the proposed criteria, the impact of depression comorbid with other psychiatric disorders and (or) physical conditions, and the possible predictors of treatment outcome. There is an important and clear need for studies that empirically test current definitions, assessment strategies, and staging methods of TRD.

AB  - Background. Extensive monitoring programs on chemical contamination are run in many European river basins. With respect to the implementation of the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD), these programs are increasingly accompanied by monitoring the ecological status of the river basins. Assuming an impact of chemical contamination on the ecological status, the assignment of effects in aquatic ecosystems to those stressors that cause the effects is a prerequisite for taking political or technical measures to achieve the goals of the WFD. Thus, one focus of present European research is on toxicant identification in European river basins in order to allow for a reduction of toxic pressure on aquatic ecosystems according to the WFD.
   Main Features. An overview is presented on studies that were performed to link chemical pollution in European river basins to measurable ecotoxic effects. This includes correlation-based approaches as well as investigations that apply effect-directed analysis (EDA) integrating toxicity testing, fractionation and non-target chemical analysis. Effect-based key toxicants that were identified in European surface waters are compiled and compared to EU priority pollutants. Further needs for research are identified.
   Results. Studies on the identification of effect-based key toxicants focused on mutagenicity, aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated effects, endocrine disruption, green algae, and invertebrates. The identified pollutants include priority pollutants and other well-known environmental pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, furans, and biphenyls, nonylphenol, some pesticides and tributyltin, but also other compounds that were neither considered as environmental pollutants before nor regulated such as substituted phenols, natural or synthetic estrogens and androgens, dinaphthofurans, 2-(2-naphthalenyl)benzothiophene, and N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine.
   Discussion. Individual studies at specific sites in a European river basin demonstrated the power of combined biological and chemical analytical approaches and, particularly, of effect-directed analysis. However, the available information on effect-based key toxicants is very limited with respect to the entirety of rivers possibly at risk due to chemical contamination and with respect to toxicological endpoints considered at a specific site. A relatively broad basis of information exists only for estrogenicity and aryl hydrocarbon Ah-receptor-mediated effects.
   Conclusions. The development of tools and strategies for an identification of key toxicants on a broader scale are a challenging task for the next years. Since investigations dealing with toxicant identification are too labor and cost-intensive for monitoring purposes, they have to be focused on the key sites in a river basin. These should include hot spots of contamination, particularly if there is evidence that they might pose a risk for downstream areas, but may also involve accumulation zones in the lower reach of a river in order to get an integrated picture on the contamination of the basin.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. While EDA is almost exclusively based on measurable effects in in vitro and in vivo biotests to date, an increasing focus in the future should be on the integration of EDA into Ecological Risk Assessment and on the development of tools to confirm EDA-determined key toxicants as stressors in populations, communities and ecosystems. Considering these requirements and applied in a focused way, toxicant identification may significantly help to implement the Water Framework Directive by providing, evidence on the main stressors and possible mitigation measures in order to improve the ecological status of a river ecosystem.

As a field, we have largely neglected the oldest subset of the population, with only a few scholars focusing specifically on elder issues or systematically including elders in their studies. The current article is a call to research. It first outlines why elders should be considered as a specific subset of the population even though they have not been an area of focus in the field. Second, the article provides suggestions for integrating elder issues into more common psychology-law research as well as some new areas for research. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Empirical research since the year 2000 on trauma and autobiographical memory in adults is reviewed and related to four enduring controversies in the field: Whether traumatic memories are inherently different from other types of autobiographical memory; whether memory for trauma is better or worse than memory for non-traumatic events; whether traumas can be forgotten and then recalled later in life; and whether special mechanisms such as repression or dissociation are required to account for any such forgetting. The review concludes that trauma and non-trauma memories differ substantially, but only in clinical and not in healthy populations. Whereas involuntary memory is enhanced in clinical populations, voluntary memory is likely to be fragmented, disorganised, and incomplete. Progress in experimental and neuroimaging research will depend on analysing how task performance is affected by the interaction of voluntary and involuntary memory and by individual tendencies to respond to trauma with increased arousal versus dissociation.

AB  - Although extensive research has already been done on the genetic bases of psychiatric disorders, little is known about polygenetic influences in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This article reviews molecular genetic studies relating to PTSD that were found in a literature search in Medline, Embase and Web of Science. Association studies have investigated 8 major genotypes in connection with PTSD. They have tested hypotheses involving key candidate genes in the serotonin (5-HTT), dopamine (DRD2, DAT), glucocorticoid (GR), GABA (GABRB), apolipoprotein systems (APOE2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). The studies have produced inconsistent results, many of which may be attributable to methodological shortcomings and insufficient statistical power. The complex aetiology of PTSD, for which experiencing a traumatic event forms a necessary condition, makes it difficult to identify specific genes that substantially contribute to the disorder. Gene-finding strategies are difficult to apply. Interactions between different genes and between them and the environment probably make certain people vulnerable to developing PTSD. Gene-environmental studies are needed that focus more narrowly on specific, distinct endophenotypes and on influences from environmental factors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It analyzes the main developments in the field, the critiques that they raised, the responses that they have generated and the current challenges faced by the field. Currently, the most plausible working hypothesis is that at least chimpanzees know what others can and cannot see. Using tasks with a high ecological validity and mapping out key concepts such association and inference are postulated as fundamental steps to further advance our knowledge in this area.

AB  - Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling) share overlapping co-morbidity, familial transmission, and phenomenology. However, the extent to which these disorders share a common cognitive phenotype has yet to be elucidated using patients without confounding co-morbidities. Aim: To compare neurocognitive functioning in co-morbidity-free patients with OCD and trichotillomania, focusing on domains of learning and memory, executive function, affective processing, reflection-impulsivity and decision-making. Method: Twenty patients with OCD, 20 patients with trichotillomania, and 20 matched controls undertook neuropsychological assessment after meeting stringent inclusion criteria. Results: Groups were matched for age, education, verbal IQ, and gender. The OCD and trichotillomania groups were impaired on spatial working memory. Only OCD patients showed additional impairments on executive planning and visual pattern recognition memory, and missed more responses to sad target words than other groups on an affective go/no-go task. Furthermore, OCD patients failed to modulate their behaviour between conditions on the reflection-impulsivity test, suggestive of cognitive inflexibility. Both clinical groups showed intact decision-making and probabilistic reversal learning. Conclusions: OCD and trichotillomania shared overlapping spatial working memory problems, but neuropsychological dysfunction in OCD spanned additional domains that were intact in trichotillomania. Findings are discussed in relation to likely fronto-striatal neural substrates and future research directions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. The aim of the study was to review empirical studies of the influence of neurocognitive dysfunctions on work capacity (i.e. the ability to obtain and maintain competitive work as well as different aspects of work behaviour and skills in relation to job requirements) in schizophrenia patients. An investigation of the extent of symptoms compared to neurocognitive functioning on work capacity in schizophrenia patients is included. Method. A literature search for studies in the English language was made in the databases PubMed, PsycInfo and EMBASE. Twenty-one studies were selected for thorough evaluation. Results. Neurocognitive functioning influences employment, work rehabilitation, work skills and work behaviour in various ways among schizophrenia patients. Moreover, symptoms seem less important to work capacity than neurocognitive functioning. Some guidelines can be drawn from the research studies to provide clinicians with indicators for the assessment of neurocognitive functioning in relation to work capacity and rehabilitation. Conclusions. Despite different methodological limitations in the reviewed studies, evidence is presented for a crucial relationship between neurocognitive functioning and work capacity among patients with schizophrenia. At present, the evidence is strong enough to argue that the individual neurocognitive profile should be taken into account before planning work rehabilitation.

AB  - Purpose. -In the past decades, the effects of problem-solving therapy (PST) for depression have been examined in several randomized controlled studies. However, until now no meta-analysis has tried to integrate the results of these studies.
   Methods. -We conducted a systematic literature search and identified 13 randomized studies examining the effects of PST, with a total of 1133 subjects. The quality of studies varied.
   Results. -The mean standardized effect size was 0.34 in the fixed effects model and 0.83 in the random effects model, with very high heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses indicated significantly lower effects for individual interventions in studies with subjects who met criteria for major depression, studies in which intention-to-treat analyses were conducted instead of completers-only analyses, and studies with pill placebo and care-as-usual control groups. Heterogeneity was high, and the subgroup analyses did not result in clear indications of what caused this high heterogeneity. This indicates that PST has varying effects on depression, and that it is not known to date what determines whether PST has larger of smaller effects.
   Conclusion. -Although there is no doubt that PST can be an effective treatment for depression, more research is needed to ascertain the conditions and subjects in which these positive effects are realized. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. -Reviews of the relative efficacy of psychotherapy and combined therapy (psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy) for depression have yielded contradicting conclusions. This may be explained by the clinical heterogeneity of the studies reviewed.
   Aims. -To conduct a meta-analysis with an acceptable level of homogeneity in order to investigate the relative efficacy of psychotherapy and combined therapy in the acute treatment of depression.
   Method. -A systematic search was performed for RCTs published between 1980 and 2005 comparing psychotherapy and combined therapy in adult psychiatric outpatients with non-psychotic unipolar major depressive disorder. The studies were classified according to the chronicity and severity of the depression. Data were pooled by means of meta-analysis and statistical tests were conducted to measure heterogeneity.
   Results. -The meta-analysis included seven studies looking at a total of 903 patients. None of the heterogeneity tests established significance. This indicates a lack of evidence for the heterogeneity of the results. The dropout rates did not differ significantly between the two treatment modalities (25% in combined therapy and 24% in psychotherapy, p = 0.77). At treatment termination, the intention-to-treat remission rate for combined therapy (46%) was better than for psychotherapy (34%) (p = 0.0007); Relative Risk 1.32 (95% CI: 1.12-1.56), Odds Ratio 1.59 (95% CI: 1.22-2.09). In moderate depression, the difference between the remission rate for combined therapy and psychotherapy was statistically significant (47% compared to 34% respectively, p = 0.001). This was not the case in mild major depression (42% compared to 37% respectively, p = 0.29). The difference was also statistically significant in chronic major depression (48% compared to 32%, p < 0.001), but not in non-chronic major depression (43% compared to 37%, p = 0.22). On a more specific level, no differences were found in the remission rates for the treatment modalities in mild or moderate non-chronic depression. Combined therapy led to significantly better results than psychotherapy in moderate chronic depression only (48% compared to 32%, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions. -In the acute treatment of adult psychiatric outpatients with major depressive disorder, patient compliance with combined therapy matches compliance with psychotherapy alone. Combined therapy is more efficacious than psychotherapy alone. However, these results depend on severity and chronicity. Combined therapy outperformed psychotherapy in moderate chronic depression only. No differences were found in mild and moderate non-chronic depression. No data were found for mild chronic depression and for severe depression. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - A substantial body of evidence has accumulated showing that exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) affects pain sensitivity (nociception) and pain inhibition (analgesia). Consistent inhibitory effects of acute exposures to various EMFs on analgesia have been demonstrated in most studies. This renders examinations of changes in the expression of analgesia and nociception a particularly valuable means of addressing the biological effects of and mechanisms underlying the actions of EMFs. Here we provide an overview of the effects of various EMFs on nociceptive sensitivity and analgesia, with particular emphasis on opioid-mediated responses. We also describe the analgesic effects of particular specific EMFs, the effects of repeated exposures to EMFs and magnetic shielding, along with the dependence of EMF effects on lighting conditions. We further consider some of the underlying cellular and biophysical mechanisms along with the clinical implications of these effects of various EMFs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - More than 500 alien species were listed from the Mediterranean Sea. Though no extinction of a native species is known, sudden decline in abundance, and even local extirpations, concurrent with proliferation of aliens, had been recorded. Examination of the profound ecological impacts of some of the most conspicuous invasive alien species underscores their role, among multiple anthropogenic stressors, in altering the infralittoral communities. Local population losses and niche contraction of native species may not induce immediate extirpation, but they augur reduction of genetic diversity, loss of functions, processes, and habitat structure, increase the risk of decline and extinction, and lead to biotic homogenization. The relevant environmental policy and management framework is discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three-dimensional spatial distributions of hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations associated with sleep paralysis were used to investigate the internal representation of space. Left-right asymmetries in human preferences and abilities are well established. Parallel effects are also observed as lower-upper asymmetries. These parallels could reflect common underlying mechanisms or additive effects of independently evolved horizontal and vertical asymmetries. This study adds to the growing literature on multidimensional spatial biases in a context free from the influence of task-related factors. We present evidence of an oblique bias in the projection of both sensory and motor hallucinations toward lower-left and especially upper-right external space exceeding that accounted for by an additive model of separate horizontal and vertical biases. These observations are consistent with theories regarding a systematic functional relation of hemispheric with ventral and dorsal cerebral organization. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mental representation of absent objects and events is a major cognitive achievement. Research is presented that explores how toddlers (2- to 3-year-old children) search for hidden objects and understand out-of-sight events. Younger children fail to use visually obvious cues, such as a barrier that blocks a moving object's path. Spatiotemporal information provided by movement cues directly connected to the hidden object is more helpful. A key problem for toddlers appears to be difficulty in representing a spatial array involving events with multiple elements.

AB  - Climate change is. a reality. A warming climate will have large effects on lakes of the Boreal Shield. Our ability to forecast these effects, however, is hampered by a very incomplete understanding of the actual interactions between weather and many aspects of lake ecosystems. Climate change will affect lakes in very complex ways. Changing weather conditions will have direct effects on thermal habitats; however, there will also be very important indirect effects on lake ecosystems through influences on watershed processes that affect the thermal and chemical characteristics of lakes. Altered habitat conditions will affect the resident biota in both positive and negative ways and may favour range expansions of some native and non-native species. Our understanding of the altered biological interactions that will structure lake communities in a warmer climate is still limited, making the prediction of biological outcomes very difficult. Modelling efforts, experiments and empirical analyses of relationships between important attributes of lakes, lake communities, and weather conditions in the past are beginning to further our ability to predict likely future effects. Much more work is needed in all these research areas to further our understanding of the probable effects of climate change on Boreal Shield lakes. Because of the potential interactions of climate with other large-scale environmental stressors such as UV-B irradiance, exotic species invasions, base cation depletion, and acidification, future studies need to consider multiple stressor effects.

There are several hypotheses on the underlying cognitive or emotional processes associated with organic factors of delusional disorders, depending on the patient groups examined and the methods used. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review and critical assessment of the various, rather heterogeneous theories in this field. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The Freudian idea of inhibited anger being central to the pathogenesis of depression has been one of the cornerstones of psychiatric thinking. The aim of this article is to review the literature on psychotherapy theory and the relevant research with regard to the association of anger and depression, and to discuss clinical implications in treating depressive patients. Choice of research articles was based on systematic search of databases. Psychotherapy theories are mostly found in books not included in databases. Literature on psychotherapy theory was selectively chosen. Over-control, under-control and mixtures of the two may be present in depression, indicating problems in anger regulation. The links between anger and depression form a complex network. When treating patients with depression, explicit or implicit dealing with anger often seems to be helpful. In clinical reality, the relative amounts of elicitation of anger experience and training in expressive control needed by depressive patients may vary between different types of patients, different phases of depressive disorder, and different phases of therapy.

AB  - A variety of gene mutations can cause familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the synaptic protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) cause PD. Mutations in the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) cause ALS. The mechanisms of human mutant alpha-Syn and SOD1 toxicity to neurons are not known. Transgenic (tg) mice expressing human mutant alpha-Syn or SOD1 develop profound fatal neurologic disease characterized by progressive motor deficits, paralysis, and neurodegeneration. Ala-53 -> Thr (A53T)-mutant alpha-Syn and Gly-93 -> Ala (G93A)-mutant SOD1 tg mice develop prominent mitochondrial abnormalities. Interestingly, although nigral neurons in A53T mice are relatively preserved, spinal motor neurons (MNs) undergo profound degeneration. In A53T mice, mitochondria degenerate in neurons, and complex IV activity is reduced. Furthermore, mitochondria in neurons develop DNA breaks and have p53 targeted to the outer membrane. Nitrated alpha-Syn accumulates in degenerating- MNs in A53T mice. mSOD1 mouse MNs accumulate mitochondria from the axon terminals and generate higher levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species than MNs in control mice. mSOD1 mouse MNs accumulate DNA single-strand breaks prior to double-strand breaks occurring in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Nitrated and aggregated cytochrome c oxidase subunit-I and nitrated SOD2 accumulate in mSOD1 mouse spinal cord. Mitochondria in mSOD1 mouse MNs accumulate NADPH diaphorase and inducible NOS (iNOS)-like immunoreactivity, and iNOS gene deletion significantly extends the lifespan of G93A-mSOD1 mice. Mitochondrial changes develop long before symptoms emerge. These experiments reveal that mitochondrial nitrative stress and perturbations in mitochondrial trafficking may, be antecedents of neuronal cell death in animal models of PD and ALS.

AB  - The structure of dendritic spines is highly plastic and responds to synaptic activity, including activity patterns that induce long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). Induction of LTP causes enlargement of spine heads, while LTD causes spine head shrinkage. In addition, spine structure is well associated with synaptic weight and the extent of synaptic plasticity, such that structural changes of the spine may represent forms of memory storage. While the correlation between structural and functional plasticity appears to be simple, the underlying mechanisms of spine plasticity are intricate. Spine plasticity requires multiple molecular interactions, and is affected by the surrounding environment and by cellular metabolic state. Here, I synthesize the latest progress in this field by defining six determinants of spine plasticity, and discuss the role of each factor in memory storage.

AB  - There is growing recognition of the need to consider the effect of mental health treatments on functional independence/abilities, in addition to any effects on primary symptoms. A variety of performance-based measures of functional living skills have appeared in the medical literature over the past 25 years in discipline-specific journals, but there has been little attempt to synthesize this information to guide mental health clinicians and researchers in choosing among the available measures. Thus, the goal of the present review was (1) to identify and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of currently available performance-based assessments of functional living skills for adult populations, and (2) to make specific recommendations regarding use of currently available instruments as well as recommendations for future instrument development. Through a comprehensive search of electronic citation databases for English-language articles on performance-based instruments, as well as via cross-referenced articles in the bibliography of each initially identified article, we identified 94 relevant articles covering 31 instruments, including 20 multi-domain instrument batteries, and 11 additional domain-specific performance-based instruments. Most identified instruments provided evidence of adequate reliability, but empirical data regarding the predictive validity of each scale in terms of actual "real world functioning" was less prevalent. Several good performance-based measures have been developed for individuals with dementia, psychiatric illnesses, and older healthy individuals. Future instrument development may benefit from a focus on brevity, empirical item selection as determined by patients/caregivers, predictive validity with an emphasis on change in functioning over time, and the relationship of performance to levels of competency required for the completion of everyday tasks.

AB  - Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanisms for increased cardiovascular risk in obesity are still unclear. Inflammation and increased oxidative stress are two potential mechanisms proposed to play a major role in the morbidity associated with obesity. Studies that investigate these mechanisms rely on biomarkers, but validated biomarkers for obesity-related cardiovascular outcomes are lacking. By finding optimal biomarkers, diagnostic criteria for cardiovascular diseases can be refined in the obese beyond "traditional" risk factors to identify early pathologic processes. The objective of this review is to identify potential early biomarkers resulting from obesity and associated with cardiovascular disease. Studies were initially identified through the search engine PubMed by using the keywords "obesity" and "biomarker." Subsequently, combinations of the keywords "obesity," "biomarker," "cardiovascular risk," "adipose tissue," "adipokine," "adipocytokine," and "oxidative stress" were used. The SOURCE database and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) were used to obtain more information on the biomarkers. Results of the searches yielded a large number of potential biomarkers that occur in obesity and which either correlate with traditional cardiovascular risk factors or predict subsequent cardiovascular events. Several biomarkers are promising regarding their biologic properties, but they require further validation in humans.
