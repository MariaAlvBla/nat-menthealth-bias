TI  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with cerebral small vessel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis
AB  - Background Cerebral small vessel disease, a common cause of vascular dementia, is often considered clinically silent before dementia or stroke become apparent. However, some individuals have subtle symptoms associated with acute MRI lesions. We aimed to determine whether neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms vary according to small vessel disease burden.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for articles published in any language from database inception to Jan 24, 2020. We searched for studies assessing anxiety, apathy, delirium, emotional lability, fatigue, personality change, psychosis, dementia-related behavioural symptoms or cognitive symptoms (including subjective memory complaints), and radiological features of cerebral small vessel disease. We extracted reported odds ratios (OR), standardised mean differences (SMD), and correlations, stratified outcomes by disease severity or symptom presence or absence, and pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses, reporting adjusted findings when possible. We assessed the bias on included studies using the Risk of Bias for Non-randomized Studies tool. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018096673.
   Findings Of 7119 papers identified, 81 studies including 79 cohorts in total were eligible for inclusion (n=21 730 participants, mean age 69.2 years). Of these 81 studies, 45 (8120 participants) reported effect estimates. We found associations between worse white matter hyperintensity (WMH) severity and apathy (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.89) and the adjusted SMD in apathy score between WMH severities was 0.38 (95% CI 0.15-0.61). Worse WMH severity was also associated with delirium (adjusted OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.12-7.55) and fatigue (unadjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.20-2.22). WMHs were not consistently associated with subjective memory complaints (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.61-2.94) and unadjusted SMD for WMH severity between these groups was 0.08 (95% CI -0.31 to 0.47). Anxiety, dementia-related behaviours, emotional lability, and psychosis were too varied or sparse for meta-analysis; these factors were reviewed narratively. Overall heterogeneity varied from 0% to 79%. Only five studies had a low risk of bias across all domains.
   Interpretation Apathy, fatigue, and delirium associated independently with worse WMH, whereas subjective cognitive complaints did not. The association of anxiety, dementia-related behaviours, emotional lability, and psychosis with cerebral small vessel disease require further investigation. These symptoms should be assessed longitudinally to improve early clinical detection of small vessel disease and enable prevention trials to happen early in the disease course, long before cognition declines.

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorders in children and young people are common and bring significant personal and societal costs. Over the last two decades, there has been a substantial increase in research evaluating psychological and pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people and exciting and novel research has continued as the field strives to improve efficacy and effectiveness, and accessibility of interventions. This increase in research brings potential to draw together data across studies to compare treatment approaches and advance understanding of what works, how, and for whom. There are challenges to these efforts due largely to variation in studies' outcome measures and variation in the way study characteristics are reported, making it difficult to compare and/or combine studies, and this is likely to lead to faulty conclusions. Studies particularly vary in their reliance on child, parent, and/or assessor-based ratings across a range of outcomes, including remission of anxiety diagnosis, symptom reduction, and other domains of functioning (e.g., family relationships, peer relationships). Methods: To address these challenges, we convened a series of international activities that brought together the views of key stakeholders (i.e., researchers, mental health professionals, young people, parents/caregivers) to develop recommendations for outcome measurement to be used in treatment trials for anxiety disorders in children and young people. Results and Conclusions: This article reports the results of these activities and offers recommendations for selection and reporting of outcome measures to (a) guide future research and (b) improve communication of what has been measured and reported. We offer these recommendations to promote international consistency in trial reporting and to enable the field to take full advantage of the great opportunities that come from data sharing going forward.

AB  - Comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) in schizophrenia (SZ; SZ-MDD) has been identified as a major prognostic factor. However, the prevalence and associated factors of SZ-MDD have never been explored in a metaanalysis. All studies assessing the prevalence of SZ-MDD in stabilized outpatients with a standardized scale or with structured interviews were included. The Medlin, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases were searched. Using random effects models, we calculated the pooled estimate of the prevalence of SZ-MDD. We used meta-regression and subgroup analyses to evaluate the potential moderators of the prevalence estimates, and we used the leave-one-out method for sensitivity analyses. Of the 5633 potentially eligible studies identified, 18 studies (n = 6140 SZ stabilized outpatients) were retrieved in the systematic review and included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of the prevalence of SZ-MDD was 32.6% (95% CI: 27.9-37.6); there was high heterogeneity (F = 92.6%), and Egger's test did not reveal publication bias (P = .122). The following factors were found to be sources of heterogeneity: publication in or after 2015, the inclusion of patients from larger studies, the assessment tools, the inclusion of patients with substance use disorder or somatic chronic diseases, age, education level, the lifetime number of hospitalizations, and antidepressant use. Two-thirds of the extracted variables could not be explored due to an insufficient amount of published data. The prevalence of MDD is high among SZ individuals. Healthcare providers and public health officials should have an increased awareness of the burden of SZ-MDD.

KW  - HEALTH
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with eating disorders and coexisting depression often rely on the Internet, and digital voice assistants (VAs) as methods of searching for health-related information regarding their conditions. However, the quality of information provided by VAs is questionable. We evaluated the quality of information on eating disorders and coexisting depression from 4 commonly-used VAs (Google Assistant [Google LLC, Menlo Park, CA, USA]; Siri [Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA]; Cortana [Microsoft Corporation, Albuquerque, NM, USA]; Bixby [Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, Suwon, South Korea]) and Google Search (Google LLC, USA).
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Forty-four questions on eating disorders and coexisting depression were evaluated. Their responses were evaluated by two raters for accuracy (score: 2), source expertise (score: 1), underlying references cited (score: 2) and comprehensiveness (score: 2) using a scoring matrix (score: 8). Descriptive statistics and odds ratios were used for analysis. Cohen Kappa was used to measure inter-rater agreement.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Cortana (mean=5.23 +/- 2.01) and Siri (mean=4.42 +/- 2.50) scored the highest and lowest for overall quality, respectively. Cortana (41/44, 93.2%) and Bixby (32/44, 72.7%) provided the most and least number of relevant sources (41/44, 93.2% versus 32/44, 72.7%, P<0.0001), and the highest and lowest mean accuracy scores (1.82 +/- 0.54 versus 1.43 +/- 0.89, P=0.0016) respectively. Bixby was the most reliable in terms of source expertise (mean=0.43 +/- 0.50) and underlying references cited (mean=0.93 +/- 0.50). Google Search scored the highest in terms of comprehensiveness, while Siri performed the worst for comprehensiveness, source expertise and underlying references cited.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most of the sources provided by the VAs were accurate and comprehensive, but not as reliable. Patients should be cautious when using VAs to search for information on eating disorders and coexisting depression.

AB  - Background: Medication overuse headache (MOH) is one of the highly disabling headache disorder and affects about 1% of the population of the world. It is associated with the development of headache for 15 days or more, with consumption of acute symptomatic medications for 10-15 days (depending on the class of drug, like, simple analgesics, triptans, and opioids) in a month, used for relief of headache for three or more months, in a known patient of primary headache disorder.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to review the topic of MOH and present the details of this disorder with an emphasis on recent updates in the field of pathophysiology and treatment.
   Material and Methods: Literature search was performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane database with appropriate keywords and relevant full-text articles were reviewed for writing this article.
   Results: Over the years, the concept of MOH has evolved, although the exact pathophysiology is still being explored. In a susceptible individual interplay of genetics, change in pain pathways, changes in areas of the brain associated with the perception of pain, and changes in the neurotransmitters have been implicated. It has to be differentiated from other secondary chronic daily headache disorders, by a careful history, targeted examination, details of intake of medications. Treatment predominantly involves patient education, removal of the offending agent, and initiation of prophylactic medications for primary headache disorder in the outpatient or inpatient services.
   Conclusions: MOH is a secondary headache disorder, which should be considered in any chronic headache patient. There are various pathophysiological mechanisms attributed to its development. Management includes educating the patients about the disorder, detoxification, and prophylactic therapy.

AB  - There exists a normative representation of family meals in contemporary Western societies which is promoted as imperative through public health programs, larger discourses and by some studies in the nutritional and public health research fields. Family meals, also called domestic commensality, are represented as convivial events and are associated with positive health and wellbeing outcomes but there is minimal evidence to show they are beneficial for family members and it is not known which aspect of the family meal could be responsible for these alleged benefits. This normative family meal image is based on a representation of the family as a peaceful unit exempt from external constraints. This narrative literature review of qualitative studies of family meals seeks to put forward the underlying premises of this representation and compare it with reports about actual practices. The results emphasize that eating together is still practiced and remains valued by family members, which is in contrast to discourses lamenting the decline of the family meal. However, the valorisation and recurrence of family meals depends on class, gender and cultural positions. There is a gap between the norm of healthy or convivial and achievable family meals, which can reinforce the so-called "mental load" and "emotion work" of those in charge of feeding the family and heighten inequalities within the household. In fact, there are many challenges to family meals which originate from external constraints or are inherent aspects of family life. The results from this review suggest that we should focus on family meals by taking into account the food work surrounding it and focussing on the interactional aspects of family meals. Ethnographic methods allow the researcher to observe the diversities and complexities of commensality as well as family dynamics and, in doing so, could provide more realistic representations of eating within the family.

AB  - Context: Tokophobia is an intense fear of childbirth that may result in considerable outcomes. This phenomenon may also be observed in fathers. However, studies are infrequent on tokophobia frequency and its related factors in fathers. Therefore, this study aimed to address tokophobia in fathers.
   Evidence Acquisition: A comprehensive literature search was performed in databanks such as Ovid and Google Scholar, as well as electronic databases including PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Science, Science Direct, Magiran, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Barakat (IranMedex), without time limit. Articles were published between 1988 and 2020.
   Results: Initially, 150 studies were recruited, and finally, 55 of them remained for the final appraisal after omitting unrelated studies. The findings from related studies were organized as the epidemiology of tokophobia in men, biopsychosocial etiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of tokophobia in men. Considering the tendency of fathers to hide tokophobia, providing suitable knowledge and support from health providers can probably retain the trust in this population and help them cope with tokophobia.
   Conclusions: During pregnancy, fathers may suffer from fear of childbirth that can impact their health and abilities. Thus, during counseling and prenatal care, the providers should pay attention to fathers.

TI  - Gendered working environments as a determinant of mental health inequalities: a systematic review of 27 studies
KW  - gender
KW  - mental health
KW  - public health
AB  - Background
   'Gendered working environments' describes the ways in which (1) differential selection into work, (2) variations in employment arrangements and working hours, (3) differences in psychosocial exposures and (4) differential selection out of work may produce varied mental health outcomes for men and women. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to understand gender differences in mental health outcomes in relation to the components of gendered working environments.
   Methods
   The review followed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search approach and focused on studies published in 2008-2018. The protocol for the review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019124066).
   Findings
   Across the 27 cohort studies included in the review, we found that (1) there was inconclusive evidence on the effect of occupational gender composition on the mental health of men and women, (2) women's mental health was more likely to be affected by long working hours than men's; however, precarious employment was more likely to be negatively associated with men's mental health, (3) exposure to traditional constructs of psychosocial job stressors negatively affected the mental health of both women and men, and (4) unemployment and retirement are associated with poorer mental health in both genders.
   Interpretation
   The findings from this review indicate that gendered working environments may affect the mental health of both men and women, but the association is dependent on the specific exposure examined. There is still much to be understood about gendered working environments, and future research into work and health should be considered with a gender lens.

AB  - Background. Burnout syndrome is a social and health problem in college students. Objective. To synthesize evidence from previous studies on the prevalence of burnout syndrome in university students in their three-dimensional approach. Method. The search strategies followed the PRISMA guidelines and were based on the following descriptive terms: "burnout," "studies," "prevalence," "students." Pubmed, Web of Science Core Collection, PsicINFO, and Scielo were consulted. An evaluation of the quality of the information was carried out applying the STROBE positioning guidelines. Results. We found 1,406 studies that were reduced to 46 studies for final analysis using the STROBE statement, eventually leaving 20 studies. One study (5%) was conducted in North America, five (25%) in Asia, nine (45%) in Latin America, and five (25%) in Europe. Of the 20 studies evaluated in the systematic review, those that had the best overall evaluation in the STROBE analysis were selected for discussion, corresponding to 10 (out of 75% of STROBE). Overall prevalence of each dimension of the syndrome was estimated at 55.4% for emotional exhaustion, 31.6% for cynicism, and 30.9% for academic efficacy. Discussion and conclusion. Moderate levels of burnout syndrome prevail in the different populations of university students of different careers worldwide. In only a few studies is the prevalence low and this could be due to multiple evaluative variables.

AB  - Along with the increased interest in and volume of social cognition research. there has been higher awareness of a lack of agreement on the concepts and taxonomy used to study social processes. Two central concepts in the field, empathy and Theory of Mind (ToM), have been identified as overlapping umbrella terms for different processes of limited convergence. Here, we review and integrate evidence of brain activation, brain organization, and behavior into a coherent model of social-cognitive processes. We start with a meta-analytic clustering of neuroimaging data across different social-cognitive tasks. Results show that understanding others' mental states can be described by a multilevel model of hierarchical structure, similar to models in intelligence and personality research. A higher level describes more broad and abstract classes of functioning, whereas a lower one explains how functions are applied to concrete contexts given by particular stimulus and task formats. Specifically, the higher level of our model suggests 3 groups of neurocognitive processes: (a) predominantly cognitive processes, which are engaged when mentalizing requires self-generated cognition decoupled from the physical world; (b) more affective processes, which are engaged when we witness emotions in others based on shared emotional, motor, and somatosensory representations; (c) combined processes, which engage cognitive and affective functions in parallel. We discuss how these processes are explained by an underlying principal gradient of structural brain organization. Finally, we validate the model by a review of empathy and ToM task interrelations found in behavioral studies.

AB  - Aim: To characterize physical exercise programs for older adults in Latin America. Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. A search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between the years 2015 and 2020 was performed in the Scopus, MedLine and SciELO databases. Results: A total of 101 RCTs were included. A large percentage of the studies had an unclear risk of bias in the items: selection, performance, detection and attribution. Furthermore, a heterogeneous level of compliance was observed in the CERT items. A total sample of 5013 older adults (79% women) was included. 97% of the studies included older adults between 60-70 years, presenting an adherence to the interventions of 86%. The studies were mainly carried out in older adults with cardiometabolic diseases. Only 44% of the studies detailed information regarding the place of intervention; of these studies, 61% developed their interventions in university facilities. The interventions were mainly based on therapeutic physical exercise (89% of the articles), with a duration of 2-6 months (95% of the articles) and a frequency of 2-3 times a week (95% of the articles) with sessions of 30-60 min (94% of the articles) led by sports science professionals (51% of the articles). The components of physical fitness that were exercised the most were muscular strength (77% of the articles) and cardiorespiratory fitness (47% of the articles). Furthermore, only 48% of the studies included a warm-up stage and 34% of the studies included a cool-down stage. Conclusions: This systematic review characterized the physical exercise programs in older adults in Latin America, as well the most frequently used outcome measures and instruments, by summarizing available evidence derived from RCTs. The results will be useful for prescribing future physical exercise programs in older adults.

AB  - This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy for the parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. PsychInfo, CINAHL, PubMed, Science Direct, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection were searched using the terms "acceptance and commitment", "autism" and "parent". A total of eight articles met the eligibility criteria. One study was a randomized controlled trial, one was quasi-experimental, and the other six were exploratory. Study outcomes concerned ACT processes, mental health, and quality of life. These studies showed that ACT interventions can be helpful for the parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Nevertheless, as this field of research is relatively new, future research would benefit from creating a standard procedure and larger randomized controlled trials .

AB  - Antidepressants are drugs with a direct action on the brain's biochemistry through their interaction with the neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The increasing worldwide contamination from these drugs may be witnessed through their increasing presence in the urban water cycle. Furthermore, their occurrence has been detected in non-urban water, such as rivers and oceans. Some endemic aquatic animals, such as certain fish and mollusks, have bioaccumulated different antidepressant drugs in their tissues. This problem will increase in the years to come because the present COVID-19 pandemic has increased the general worldwide occurrence of depression and anxiety, triggering the consumption of antidepressants and, consequently, their presence in the environment. This work provides information on the occurrence of the most administrated antidepressants in urban waters, wastewater treatment plants, rivers, and oceans. Furthermore, it provides an overview of the analytical approaches currently used to detect each antidepressant presented. Finally, the ecotoxicological effect of antidepressants on several in vivo models are listed. Considering the information provided in this review, there is an urgent need to test the presence of antidepressant members of the MA01 and TCA groups. Furthermore, incorporating new degradation/immobilization technologies in WWTPs will be useful to stop the increasing occurrence of these drugs in the environment (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Supportive peer relationships (SPR) are crucial for mental and physical health. Early adolescence is an especially important period in which peer influence and school environment strongly shape psychological development and maturation of core social-emotional regulatory functions. Yet, there is no integrated evidence based model of SPR in this age group to inform future research and practice. The current meta-analysis synthetizes evidence from 364 studies into an integrated model of potential determinants of SPR in early adolescence. The model encompasses links with 93 variables referring to individual (identity, skills/strengths, affect/well-being, and behavior/health) and environmental (peer group, school, family, community, and internet/technology) potential influences on SPR based on cross-sectional correlational data. Findings suggest the central importance of identity and social-emotional skills in SPR. School environment stands out as a compelling setting for future prevention programs. Finally, we underscore an alarming gap of research on the influence of the virtual and online environment on youth's social realm given its unquestionable importance as a globally expanding social interaction setting. Hence, we propose an integrated model that can serve as organizational framework, which may ultimately lead to the adoption of a more structured and integrated approach to understanding peer relationship processes in youth and contribute to overcoming marked fragmentation in the field.

Coercive measures are controversial and can lead to negative consequences, including negative emotions, retraumatization, injuries, or death. The article summarizes the last 10 years of literature regarding methods and strategies used for reducing seclusions and restraints in child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units, and reports on their outcomes. The literature was reviewed by searching PubMed and PsycInfo for English-language articles published between May 2010 and May 2020. Eighteen articles were found that described methods or strategies aimed at reducing restraint or seclusion utilization in child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units. The following interventions were evaluated: Trauma-Informed Care (TIC), Six Core Strategies, Child and Family Centered Care (CFCC), Collaborative & Proactive Solutions (CPS), Strength-Based Care, Modified Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (M-PBIS), Behavioral Modification Program (BMP), Autism Spectrum Disorder Care Pathway (ASD-CP), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), sensory rooms, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Training (MBSR) of staff, and Milieu Nurse-Client Shift Assignments. Most of the interventions reduced the use of seclusions and/or restraints. Two child-centered and trauma-informed initiatives eliminated the use of mechanical restraints. This review shows that the use of coercive measures can be reduced and should be prioritized. Successful implementation requires ongoing commitment on all levels of an organization and a willingness to learn. To facilitate comparisons, future models should evaluate different standardized parameters.

AB  - Climate change not only directly impacts marine environments by shifting water temperatures, salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen concentrations, but may also indirectly contribute to the emergence of additional ecosystem stressors, such as infectious diseases, including bivalve disseminated neoplasia. Disseminated neoplasia, a form of cancer found in some bivalves -recently discovered to be transmissible in at least six species -has been shown to impair bivalve health and fitness, with occasional mass outbreaks causing high levels of mortality. As the ability of the host bivalve to respond to disseminated neoplasia, and the survival and transmissibility of disseminated neoplasia both depend on environmental factors, it is crucial to understand the interaction between climate change and disseminated neoplasia epidemiology. Furthermore, with bivalves being species of high ecological and economic importance, there is a rising need for the development of efficient disseminated neoplasia diagnostic tools in order to detect, mitigate and potentially prevent deleterious disseminated neoplasia outbreaks. Therefore, in this study, we reviewed the current knowledge of climate impacted environmental parameters on disseminated neoplasia and identified best practices and methodology for the detection of transmissible disseminated neoplasia in the wild. By exploring the potential effects changing climate has on disseminated neoplasia dynamics, we identified future research directions in order to advance the field. This included using state of the art disease detection methods and taking into account species' ecological niches to understand the dynamic of disseminated neoplasia outbreaks in the wild and to investigate whether disseminated neoplasia is present in freshwater ecosystems. Finally, we provided a comprehensive step-by-step guideline for an evidence-based detection of this disease in marine ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: People living in rural and remote areas have poorer access to mental health services than those living in cities. They are also less likely to seek help because of self-stigma and entrenched stoic beliefs about help seeking as a sign of weakness. E-mental health services can span great distances to reach those in need and offer a degree of privacy and anonymity exceeding that of traditional face-to-face counseling and open up possibilities for identifying at-risk individuals for targeted intervention.
   Objective: This scoping review maps the research that has explored text-based e-mental health counseling services and studies that have used language use patterns to predict mental health status. In doing so, one of the aims was to determine whether text-based counseling services have the potential to circumvent the barriers faced by clients in rural and remote communities using technology and whether text-based communications, in particular, can be used to identify individuals at risk of psychological distress or self-harm.
   Methods: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search of PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and Web of Science databases for articles published in English through November 2020.
   Results: Of the 9134 articles screened, 70 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that text-based, real-time communication with a qualified therapist is an effective form of e-mental health service delivery, particularly for individuals concerned with stigma and confidentiality. There is also converging evidence that text-based communications that have been analyzed using computational linguistic techniques can be used to accurately predict progress during treatment and identify individuals at risk of serious mental health conditions and suicide.
   Conclusions: This review reveals a clear need for intensified research into the extent to which text-based counseling (and predictive models using modern computational linguistics tools) may help deliver mental health treatments to underserved groups such as regional communities, identify at-risk individuals for targeted intervention, and predict progress during treatment. Such approaches have implications for policy development to improve intervention accessibility in at-risk and underserved populations.

AB  - Considering the importance of evidence on interventions to tackle mental health problems in healthcare workers (HCWs) during pandemics, we conducted a systematic review, aiming to identify and summarize the implemented interventions to deal with mental health issues of HCWs during infectious disease outbreaks and report their effectiveness. Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, CINAHL and PsycInfo electronic databases were searched until October 2nd, 2020. Primary-data articles, describing any implemented interventions and their effectiveness were considered pertinent. Studies were screened according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria and subsequently data extraction was performed. Twenty-four articles, referring to SARS, Ebola, Influenza AH1N1 and COVID-19 were included. Interventions addressing mental health issues in HCWs during pandemics/epidemics were grouped into four categories: 1) informational support (training, guidelines, prevention programs), 2) instrumental support (personal protective equipment, protection protocols); 3) organizational support (manpower allocation, working hours, re-organization of facilities/structures, provision of rest areas); 4) emotional and psychological support (psychoeducation and training, mental health support team, peer-support and counselling, therapy, digital platforms and tele-support). These results might be helpful for researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers to develop evidence-based sustainable interventions and guidelines, aiming to prevent or reduce the immediate and long-term effect of pandemics on mental health status of HCWs.

AB  - Background: A significant concern for patients treated for cancer is fear of cancer recurrence (FCR). Although a common experience, some patients report high levels of FCR that are difficult to manage and result in over vigilant checking and high use of health services. There has been speculation about the relationship of FCR with gender with mixed reports from several systematic reviews.
   Aims: To determine the association of FCR with gender in previous reported studies and investigate the strength of this relationship with various moderators including year of publication, type of cancer and measurement attributes of self-reported FCR instruments.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted with searches of the literature from the MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases following PRISMA guidelines. All the included papers were divided into two groups, namely: "pure" that comprise only of patients with cancer types that both men and women can contract and "mixed" that report on patients with a variety of cancer types. The association between gender and FCR level was assessed by meta-analysis. A meta-regression was performed to investigate the moderating effects of factors including: the year of publication, cancer type, mean age of the sample and the length of the FCR scale measurement. This review was registered with PROSPERO, ID: CRD42020184812.
   Results: Finally, 29 studies were included. The N size of pooled participants was 33,339. The meta-analysis showed females to have an overall higher level of FCR than males (ES = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23, 0.36). The meta-regression of moderating or control variables found little, if any, systematic variation in effect-sizes.
   Conclusion: This systematic review has clarified a potentially confused pattern of previous results in understanding the relationship between gender and FCR. Women report higher levels of FCR than men and this feature is one that clinicians and researchers can factor into their practice and future studies. The effect size is moderate, hence there is ample variation in FCR level, independent of gender, that requires further investigation.

AB  - Several mood-stabilizing atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants weakly block serotonin (5-HT) receptor type-7 (5-HT7R); however, the contributions of 5-HT7R antagonism to clinical efficacy and pathophysiology are yet to be clarified. A novel mood-stabilizing antipsychotic agent, lurasidone exhibits predominant binding affinity to 5-HT7R when compared with other monoamine receptors. To date, we have failed to discover the superior clinical efficacy of lurasidone on schizophrenia, mood, or anxiety disorders when compared with conventional mood-stabilizing atypical antipsychotics; however, numerous preclinical findings have indicated the possible potential of 5-HT7R antagonism against several neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as the generation of novel therapeutic options that could not be expected with conventional atypical antipsychotics. Traditional experimental techniques, electrophysiology, and microdialysis have demonstrated that the effects of 5-HT receptor type-1A (5-HT1AR) and 5-HT7R on neurotransmission are in contrast, but the effect of 5-HT1AR is more predominant than that of 5-HT7R, resulting in an insufficient understanding of the 5-HT7R function in the field of psychopharmacology. Accumulating knowledge regarding the pharmacodynamic profiles of 5-HT7R suggests that 5-HT7R is one of the key players in the establishment and remodeling of neural development and cytoarchitecture during the early developmental stage to the mature brain, and dysfunction or modulation of 5-HT7R is linked to the pathogenesis/pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review, to explore candidate novel applications for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, schizophrenia, and other cognitive disturbance disorders, we discuss perspectives of psychopharmacology regarding the effects of 5-HT7R antagonism on transmission and intracellular signaling systems, based on preclinical findings.

AB  - The upsurge of technological advancement and the introduction of the internet has impacted face to face communication.
   Background: The advances in this field have gained much interest in implying increased technology usage on various psychosocial factors, mainly mental health and changing communication patterns in the family system.
   Methodology: This paper provides a systematic review of the literature published between 1990?2020, examining the relationship between technology usage and its impact on family factors like communication and family relationships.
   Results: A database search was conducted using certain keywords, and in total, 20 papers were selected according to inclusion criteria. The results are categorized into domains of 1) technology use of the family, 2) family communication 3) family bonding 4) rules for technology use 5) boundaries maintained by the family members related to technology use.
   Conclusion: The results indicate that technology usage in families is very high, and maximum daily communication happens through technology. Family leisure time, offline family bonding and communication is negatively affected due to technology use. A model was developed which has implications in the family psychiatry field and specifically in working with families having difficulties managing healthy use of technology.

KW  - meta-analysis
AB  - Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in mood disorders is associated with unfavorable outcomes, including more frequent mood episodes, and increased risk of suicide. The reported prevalence of ADHD in individuals with mood disorders varies widely.
   Methods: We searched PsycInfo and PubMed for articles published before September 21(st), 2020, using search terms for ADHD and mood disorders. We included original data on the prevalence of ADHD in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). We estimated the prevalence of ADHD, by developmental period and disorder using random-effects meta-analyses. We also compared the rate of ADHD in people with MDD and BD, and with and without mood disorders.
   Results: Based on 92 studies including 17089 individuals, prevalence of ADHD in BD is 73% (95% CI 66-79) in childhood, 43% (95% CI 35-50) in adolescence, and 17% (95% CI 14-20) in adulthood. Data from 52 studies with 16897 individuals indicated that prevalence of ADHD in MDD is 28% (95% CI 19-39) in childhood, 17% (95% CI 12-24) in adolescence, and 7% (95% CI 4-11) in adulthood. ADHD was three times more common in people with mood disorders compared to those without and 1.7 times more common in BD compared to MDD.
   Conclusion: People with mood disorders are at a significant risk for ADHD. ADHD should be assessed and treated in individuals with BD and MDD. Comprehensive assessment strategies are needed to address challenges of diagnosing ADHD alongside mood disorders.

KW  - Common method bias
KW  - Diagnostic misclassification
AB  - In the last decade, many studies have examined associations between poor psychosocial work environment and depression. We aimed to assess the evidence for a causal association between psychosocial factors at work and depressive disorders. We conducted a systematic literature search from 1980 to March 2019. For all exposures other than night and shift work and long working hours, we limited our selection of studies to those with a longitudinal design. We extracted available risk estimates for each of 19 psychosocial exposures, from which we calculated summary risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals (PROSPERO, identifier CRD42019130266). 54 studies were included, addressing 19 exposures and 11 different measures of depression. Only data on depressive episodes were sufficient for evaluation. Heterogeneity of exposure definitions and ascertainment, outcome measures, risk parameterization and effect contrasts limited the validity of meta-analyses. Summary risk estimates were above unity for all but one exposure, and below 1.60 for all but another. Outcome measures were liable to high rates of false positives, control of relevant confounding was mostly inadequate, and common method bias was likely in a large proportion of studies. The combination of resulting biases is likely to have inflated observed effect estimates. When statistical uncertainties and the potential for bias and confounding are taken into account, it is not possible to conclude with confidence that any of the psychosocial exposures at work included in this review is either likely or unlikely to cause depressive episodes or recurrent depressive disorders.

AB  - A systematic literature review was conducted to explore worldwide prevalence studies on student suicide, the risks and protective factors related to student suicide, and university-based interventions to combat it. The search of four major databases identified 60 studies published in peer-reviewed academic journals between 2015 and 2020. Majority of these publications were from the United States, followed by China and the United Kingdom. Studies in South Africa and the African Continent as a whole were limited in terms of meeting the selection criteria of the review. The findings indicate that most of the publications ranged from describing suicide risk factors innate to students, such as their demographic and mental health features, to social and university stressors. Although the studies on protective factors were limited, several psychological, social, and behavioural elements to prevent student suicide were identified. I adopted the Three-Step Theory of suicide to discuss the implications of the findings by presenting several campus-based strategies to combat student suicides.

AB  - Background: Music has been used as agent in medicine for decades. The applications of music in health span from music therapy to music listening interventions to mere music listening. Music may reduce stress and improve health in people living with dementia (PwD), but the exact underpinnings of these effects are unclear. It is proposed that beneficial effects of music are mediated by a reduction in psychobiological stress. Therefore, the present review aims to shed light on the potential psychobiological mechanisms underlying the health-beneficial effects of music in PwD.
   Methods: We searched for studies investigating health-beneficial effects of music in PwD by means of psychobiological stress measures using the PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and by hand-searching.
   Results: The inclusion criteria were met by 12 studies. Seven of the included studies investigated effects of music therapy on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis or the immune system in patients with mild to moderate dementia. Results showed decreased ANS activity as measured by heart rate variability but no effect on alpha-amylase. Effects on blood pressure were mixed. Concerning the secretion of cortisol, one study found decreased HPA axis activity whereas two studies found no significant effects. No effects were found on salivary immunoglobin A. Three studies investigated the effects of music listening interventions in patients with severe dementia by means of predominantly ANS parameters with evidence indicating increased parasympathetic activation after music listening. Two studies investigated the effects of mere music listening on skin conductance using experimental designs. One study found increases in arousal due to music listening, whereas the other study found no effect. Discussion and Conclusion: These very preliminary results indicate effects of music on central stress pathways in PwD, but also highlight the need for further research focussing on a comprehensive assessment of autonomic, endocrine and immunological parameters in response to music. Furthermore, future studies should directly compare music therapy to music listening interventions and mere music listening in samples of PwD of varying disease severity and varying care settings.

AB  - Introduction: Broadly considered a transdiagnostic feature of psychological disorders, rumination is associated with lower treatment response, slower recovery rates, and higher relapse rates. Accordingly, research has focused on the development of interventions to alleviate rumination. Recently, transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising tool to do so.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review of sham-controlled tDCS studies targeting rumination among healthy participants or patients with psychiatric disorders, investigating the effectiveness of tDCS in reducing rumination, and assessing the research quality of this nascent field.
   Results: We identified nine studies, with five reporting a significant impact of tDCS on rumination. We also outlined a few tDCS parameters (e.g., stimulation duration, electrode size) and research methods' features (e.g., within- versus between-research designs) characterizing those positive-finding studies. However, these studies were characterized by substantial heterogeneity (e.g., methodological flaws, lack of open science practices), precluding any definite statement about the best way to target rumination via tDCS. Moreover, several strong methodological limitations were also present across those studies.
   Discussion: Although our systematic review identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the available research about the impact of tDCS on rumination, it calls for strong efforts to improve this nascent field's current methodological caveats. We discuss how open science practices can help to usher this field forward. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Following hurricanes, there can be increases in exacerbations of chronic diseases, such as asthma. Asthma is common among children, and many asthma exacerbations can be prevented. This systematic literature review assessed literature describing the impact of hurricanes on children with asthma in the United States. Medline, Embase, Global Health, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language articles published January 1990 to June 2019 that described the effect of a hurricane on children with asthma. This search identified 212 articles; 8 met inclusion criteria. All 8 were related to Hurricane Katrina, but research questions and study design varied. Articles included information on asthma after hurricanes from cross-sectional surveys, retrospective chart review, and objective clinical testing. Four articles described discontinuity in health insurance, asthma-related health care, or asthma medication use; and 3 articles examined the relationship between mold exposure and asthma symptoms and reported varying results. The eighth study quantified the burden of asthma among people visiting mobile medical units but did not describe factors associated with asthma symptoms. These results highlight opportunities for future research (eg, on more recent hurricanes) and disaster preparedness planning (eg, strategies to prevent health-care discontinuity among children with asthma).

In addition to its cosmetic effect, the neurotoxin has been shown to have a positive influence on mood and affect. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have examined the effect of botulinum toxin on the treatment of depression. Combining the results of the five RCTs in a random effects meta-analysis revealed that patients treated with BTX showed a more intense improvement of depressive symptoms in comparison to subjects that received placebo injections (d = 0.98). Despite methodological limitations, the results of this study emphasize the effectiveness of BTX in the treatment of depression and therefore pave the way for its use in the field of psychiatry.

AB  - Countertransference towards suicidal patients may blur healthcare professionals' clinical judgment and lead to suboptimal decision-making. We conducted a systematic review of the quantitative studies on this topic. Following PRISMA guidelines, various databases were searched for studies measuring countertransference in healthcare professionals treating suicidal patients. Two authors independently performed screening and the quality of included studies was formally assessed. Ten studies were identified (3/5/2 of low/intermediate/high quality, respectively). Cross-sectional studies showed evidence for specific and adverse countertransference (e.g., disinterest, anxiety, overwhelming, rejection, helplessness or distress) towards suicidal patients. Furthermore, countertransference was prospectively associated with suicidal behavior and ideation in studies that explored this issue, but the meaning of this association remains to be clarified. Healthcare professionals' characteristics (e.g. professional background, gender, personality traits) influenced countertransference. Suicidal patients elicit adverse countertransference, which should be addressed in clinical practice and through dedicated training.

AB  - Psychotic disorders are highly debilitating and constitute a major public health burden. Identifying markers of psychosis risk and resilience is a necessary step toward understanding etiology and informing prevention and treatment efforts in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. In this context, it is important to consider that neural risk markers have been particularly useful in identifying mechanistic determinants along with predicting clinical outcomes. Notably, despite a growing body of supportive literature and the promise of recent findings identifying potential neural markers, the current work on CHR resilience markers has received little attention. The present review provides a brief overview of brain-based risk markers with a focus on predicting symptom course. Next, the review turns to protective markers, examining research from nonpsychiatric and schizophrenia fields to build an understanding of framing, priorities, and potential, applying these ideas to contextualizing a small but informative body of resiliency-relevant CHR research. Four domains (neurocognition, emotion regulation, allostatic load, and sensory and sensorimotor function) were identified and are discussed in terms of behavioral and neural markers. Taken together, the literature suggests significant predictive value for brain-based markers for individuals at CHR for psychosis, and the limited but compelling resiliency work highlights the critical importance of expanding this promising area of inquiry.

AB  - Objectives: Impaired awareness of cognitive and functional deficits is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although a lack of awareness has been suggested to be a protective factor against experiencing affective symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and apathy which are common in AD, there is conflicting evidence about the links between them. This systematic review examines the evidence for an association between impaired awareness and depressive, anxiety, and apathy symptoms in mild to moderate AD.
   Method: We searched four databases (OvidMedline, Embase, PsycInfo, and PsycArticles) using terms encompassing awareness, apathy, depression, anxiety, and mild-moderate AD. We included studies that assessed the relationship between awareness and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or apathy. We assessed included papers for quality and report results using a narrative approach, prioritizing high quality studies.
   Results: We identified 1,544 articles, and twenty-seven studies fulfilled inclusion criteria (high-quality = 15; moderate-quality = 12). Most high-quality studies reported that impaired awareness in early-stage AD is cross-sectionally linked with fewer depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms (correlation ranged from -0.3 to -0.7), but with more apathy.
   Conclusions: High-quality studies suggested that in people with early AD, impaired awareness is related to fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms and to more apathy. Future research should focus on elucidating causality among impaired awareness and these symptoms in AD.

AB  - Axonal varicosities are enlarged, heterogeneous structures along axonal shafts, profoundly affecting axonal conduction and synaptic transmission. They represent a key pathological feature believed to develop via slow accumulation of axonal damage that occurs during irreversible degeneration, for example in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Here this review first discusses recent in vitro results showing that axonal varicosities can be rapidly and reversibly induced by mechanical stress in cultured primary neurons from the central nervous system (CNS). This notion is further supported by in vivo studies revealing the induction of axonal varicosities across various brain regions in different mTBI mouse models, as a prominent feature of axonal pathology. Limited progress in understanding intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms of axonal varicosity induction and development is further highlighted. Rapid and reversible formation of axonal varicosities likely plays a key role in CNS neuron mechanosensation and is a new form of neural plasticity. Future investigation in this emerging research field may reveal how to reverse axonal injury, contributing to the development of new strategies for treating brain injuries and related neurodegenerative diseases.

KW  - Functioning
KW  - Disability
AB  - Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious and debilitating condition often associated with significant impairments in daily functioning. To date, research on the complexity of functional impairment in individuals with PTSD is scarce and only limited. Yet, a quantitative synthesis and comprehensive review of existing evidence is needed to better characterize the magnitude of functional impairment in PTSD in distinct domains
   . We conducted a systematic literature search including observational studies comparing functioning of individuals with and without PTSD. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for the different functional domains according to the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The protocol followed the MOOSE guidelines for systematic reviews.
   A total of thirty-four studies comprising 14 206 participants were included in the study. Compared to healthy individuals, subjects with PTSD showed significant (ps < 0.001) impairments with large to very large effect sizes (ds > 1) in all domains. Subjects with, compared to without, PTSD showed significant (ps < 0.001) impairments with medium to large effect sizes (ds > 0.5) in the domains General Tasks and Demands, Mobility, Self Care, Domestic Life, Interpersonal Interactions and Relationships, Major Life Areas and Community, Social and Civic Life. Significant impairments with small to medium effect sizes in the same domains were observed comparing PTSD to other mental disorders.
   In conclusion, PTSD has a significant impact on most areas of daily functioning as conceptualized in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) of the WHO. Early detection and targeted treatment of functional deficits is warranted in this patient population.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease whose manifestations span motor, sensorimotor, and sensory domains. While current therapies for PD include pharmacological, invasive, and physical interventions, there is a constant need for developing additional approaches for optimizing rehabilitation gains. Mental imagery is an emerging field in neurorehabilitation and has the potential to serve as an adjunct therapy to enhance patient function. Yet, the literature on this topic is sparse. The current paper reviews the motor, sensorimotor, and sensory domains impacted by PD using gait, balance, and pain as examples, respectively. Then, mental imagery and its potential for PD motor and non-motor rehabilitation is discussed, with an emphasis on its suitability for addressing gait, balance, and pain deficits in people with PD. Lastly, future research directions are suggested.

AB  - Technostress is a widespread model used to study negative effects of using information communication technologies at work. The aim of this review is to assess the role of socioeconomic position (SEP) in research on work-related technostress. We conducted systematic searches in multidisciplinary databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, PsycArticles) in June 2020 and independently screened 321 articles against eligibility criteria (working population, technostress exposure, health or work outcome, quantitative design). Of the 21 studies included in the narrative synthesis, three studies did not collect data on SEP, while 18 studies operationalised SEP as education (eight), job position (five), SEP itself (two) or both education as well as job position (three). Findings regarding differences by SEP are inconclusive, with evidence of high SEP reporting more frequent exposure to overall technostress. In a subsample of 11 studies reporting data on educational attainment, we compared the percentage of university graduates to World Bank national statistics and found that workers with high SEP are overrepresented in nine of 11 studies. The resulting socioeconomic sampling bias limits the scope of the technostress model to high SEP occupations. The lack of findings regarding differences by SEP in technostress can partly be attributed to limitations in study designs. Studies should aim to reduce the heterogeneity of technostress and SEP measures to improve external validity and generalisability across socioeconomic groups. Future research on technostress would benefit from developing context-sensitive SEP measures and quality appraisal tools that identify socioeconomic sampling biases by comparing data to national statistics.

AB  - A 'culture of celebrity' began to emerge in the twentieth century, profoundly impacting the social world. Recent years have seen the publication of an increasing wealth of literature focusing on people who are enthralled with celebrities - often to the point of obsession - termed 'celebrity worshippers'. The current paper systematically reviews this literature to gain a comprehensive understanding of the various factors associated with celebrity worship and to identify gaps in the literature. Papers were identified through a systematic literature search and 62 were deemed relevant for inclusion in the review. These provided evidence that celebrity worship may be related to demographic factors (e.g. age); personality factors (e.g. dimensions of the psychoticism-extraversion-neuroticism model, materialism); religiosity; behavioural and cognitive-behavioural factors (e.g. fantasy proneness, obsessive behaviours); feelings about the self or the world (e.g. self-esteem); cognitive factors (e.g. cognitive flexibility, critical thinking); relationships with others (e.g. attachment style, romantic relationship style); attitudes towards the body, eating, and cosmetic surgery; and psychological wellbeing (e.g. depression, anxiety). The results are used to help researchers understand the individual and psychosocial factors associated with celebrity worship, and directions for future research in this area are identified.

AB  - The shift towards early intervention in borderline personality disorder (BPD) has introduced a clinical staging approach in the treatment for young persons with BPD. Complementary to staging is profiling: the identification of psychological, social and biological risk variables that may predict prognosis. The aim of this paper is to provide a risk profile for BPD by systematically reviewing literature on potential risk markers for poor prognosis for BPD. An extensive literature search revealed evidence for seven categories of risk factors: adverse childhood experiences, BPD symptom profile, associated mental disorders, personality impairments and traits, current interpersonal context, biological disposition and socio-demographics. Including these markers within the current staging approach, to compose individual risk profiles for poor BPD prognosis, may assist in personalizing treatment for young people with BPD and in refining research protocols for treatment outcome studies.

AB  - Introduction: Behavioural activation is an effective treatment for depression, but little is known about its working mechanisms. Theoretically, its effect is thought to rely on an interplay between activation and environmental reward. Objective: The present systematic review examines the mediators of behavioural activation for depression. Methods: A systematic literature search without time restrictions in Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL resulted in 14 relevant controlled and uncontrolled prospective treatment studies that also performed formal mediation analyses to investigate their working mechanisms. After categorising the mediators investigated, we systematically compared the studies' methodological quality and performed a narrative synthesis of the findings. Results: Most studies focused on activation or environmental reward, with 21 different mediators being investigated using questionnaires that focused on psychological processes or beliefs. The evidence for both activation and environmental reward as mediators was weak. Conclusions: Non-significant results, poor methodological quality of some of the studies, and differences in questionnaires employed precluded any firm conclusions as to the significance of any of the mediators. Future research should exploit knowledge from fundamental research, such as reward motivation from neurobiology. Furthermore, the use of experience sampling methods and idiographic analyses in bigger samples is recommended to investigate potential causal pathways in individual patients.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to examine the prevalence of burnout-related symptoms in Brazilian schoolteachers who work in public schools. The literature search was conducted using the following databases: PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Peer-reviewed studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese were considered for inclusion. A total of 2106 records were identified through database searching and 7 additional studies were identified through other sources. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 19 studies were included in the systematic review. Burnout syndrome prevalence was assessed through seven distinct questionnaires. Overall, the majority of the studies presented high methodological quality. Brazilian schoolteachers exhibited high levels of emotional exhaustion (21-69%), high or moderate degrees of depersonalization (8-32%), and high levels of personal realization and enthusiasm toward the job (30-90%). From these data, it is possible to infer that Brazilian schoolteachers are, in general, affected by burnout syndrome. However, and, surprisingly, they seem to be motivated and idealistic, as demonstrated by their high levels of personal realization and enthusiasm toward the job (30-90%). This likely favors the implementation of programs designed to avoid or reduce burnout, deal with stress, and enhance teaching quality.

AB  - COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan city of China, and since then it has spread worldwide taking a heavy toll on human life and economy. COVID-19 infection is commonly associated with symptoms like coughing, fever, and shortness of breath, besides, the reports of muscle pain, anosmia, hyposmia, and loss of taste are becoming evident. Recent reports suggest the pathogenic invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS, that could thereby result in devastating long term complications, primarily because some of these complications may go unnoticed for a long time. Evidence suggest that the virus could enter the CNS through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, neuronal transport, haematogenous route, and nasal route via olfactory bulb, cribriform plate, and propagates through trans-synaptic signalling, and shows retrograde movement into the CNS along nerve fiber. COVID-19 induces CNS inflammation and neurological degenerative damage through a diverse mechanism which includes ACE-2 receptor damage, cytokine-associated injury or cytokine storm syndrome, secondary hypoxia, demyelination, blood-brain barrier disruption, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Viral invasion into the CNS has been reported to show association with complications like Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disorder, meningitis, encephalopathy, anosmia, hyposmia, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, stroke, etc. This review provides a detailed discussion of the CNS pathogenesis of COVID-19. Authors conclude that the COVID-19 cannot just be considered as a disorder of the pulmonary or peripheral system, rather it has a significant CNS involvement. Therefore, CNS aspects of the COVID-19 should be monitored very closely to prevent long term CNS complications, even after the patient has recovered from COVID-19.

Big data research of social media data may also support standard surveillance approaches and provide decision-makers with usable information. These data can be analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect signs of mental disorders that need attention, such as depression and suicide ideation. This article presents the recent trends and tools that are used in this field, the different means for data collection, and the current applications of ML and NLP in the surveillance of public mental health. We highlight the best practices and the challenges. Furthermore, we discuss the current gaps that need to be addressed and resolved.

AB  - Objective:
   Ketamine is a potential rapid-acting treatment for depression. Studies have suggested that the side effects are minimal and temporary, but the psychotic symptom side effects have yet to be fully examined. This study investigated whether ketamine infusion in the treatment of mood disorders is associated with increases in positive symptoms and whether these symptom effects endure over time.
   Methods:
   A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of ketamine in the treatment of depression. Embase and Medline databases were searched for studies including (a) participants with major affective disorders, (b) 0.4 or 0.5 mg intravenously administered ketamine, (c) measurement of positive symptoms using BPRS+, and (d) a within-subject repeated-measures design with participants serving as their own baseline.
   Results:
   Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 458 participants. The meta-analyses examined symptom change occurring within the first 4 h, after 1 day, and after 3 days. Results showed significant BPRS+ increases within the first 30-60 min in 72% of studies, followed by a return to baseline levels.
   Conclusion:
   Peak symptom change occurred within the first hour post infusion. There are limited data to determine if ketamine is safe in the longer term, but there were no indications that psychotic symptoms re-occurred after the first hour and in the days following administration.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the potential efficacy of meditation-based mind-body interventions (MBIs) within mental health care. We conducted a systematic metareview of the published randomized control trial (RCT) evidence. MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycARTICLES and EMBASE were searched from inception to 06/2020 examining MBIs (mindfulness, qigong, tai chi, yoga) as add-on or monotherapy versus no treatment, minimal treatment and passive and active control conditions in people with a mental disorder. The quality of the methods of the included meta-analyses using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and the methodological quality of the RCTs using AMSTAR-Plus. Sixteen (94%) of 17 meta-analyses had good overall methodological quality. The content validity of the included RCTs was considered good in 9 (53%) meta-analyses. In meta-analyses with good methodological quality (AMSTAR 8 <=) and content validity (AMSTAR+ 4 <=), large effect sizes (0.80 or higher) were observed for mindfulness in schizophrenia and in ADHD, a moderate (0.50 <= 0.80) effect size for mindfulness in PTSD and a small (0.20 < 0.50) effect size for yoga in schizophrenia No serious adverse events were reported (n RCTs = 43, n in the MBI arms = 1774), while the attrition rates were comparable with the rates in passive and active control conditions. Our meta-review demonstrates that mindfulness and to a lesser extent yoga may serve as an efficacious supplement to pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy and can be complementary in healthy lifestyle interventions for people with mental disorders. Metaanalytic evidence of high methodological quality and content validity of included trials is currently lacking for qigong and tai chi.

AB  - Stress encompasses profound psychological and physiological changes that are observable on all levels, from cellular mechanisms, humoral changes, and brain activation to subjective experience and behavior. While the impact of stress on health has already been studied for decades, a more recent field of research has revealed effects of stress on human social cognition and behavior. Initial studies have attempted to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of these stress-induced effects by measuring physiological responses or by using pharmacological approaches. We provide an overview of the current state of research on the effects of acute stress induction or pharmacological manipulations of stress-related neuro circuitry on social cognition and behavior. Additionally, we discuss the methodological challenges that need to be addressed in order to gain further insight into this important research topic and facilitate replicability of results. Future directions may help to disentangle the complex interplay of psychological and biological stress variables and their effects on social cognition and behavior on health and in disorders with social deficits.

AB  - (1) Background: This article examines whether connection to digital technologies helps connect young Indigenous people in Australia to culture, community and country to support good mental health and well-being and protect against indirect and potentially long-term effects of COVID-19. (2) Method: We reviewed literature published between February and November 2020 and policy responses related to digital strategies. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, government policy websites and key Indigenous literature sources, identifying 3460 articles. Of these, 30 articles and 26 policy documents were included and analysed to identify existing and expected mental health outcomes among Indigenous young people associated with COVID-19 and more broadly. (3) Results: There are inequities in affordable access to digital technologies. Only 63% of Indigenous people have access to internet at home. Digital technologies and social media contribute to strong cultural identity, enhance connections to community and country and improve mental health and social and emotional well-being outcomes. (4) Discussion: Access to digital technologies can facilitate healing and cultural continuity, self-determination and empowerment for young people to thrive, not just survive, in the future. (5) Conclusion: More targeted policies and funding is urgently needed to promote digital technologies to enhance Indigenous young people's access to mental health and well-being services, maintain cultural connections and evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives using Indigenous well-being indicators.

   Methods:
   A systematic review of Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, and gray literature was conducted. Studies describing the effectiveness of interventions provided to first responders to prevent and/or treat the mental health effects of responding to a disaster were included. Quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist.
   Results:
   Manuscripts totaling 3869 met the initial search criteria; 25 studies met the criteria for in-depth analysis, including 22 quantitative and 3 qualitative studies; 6 were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); 18 studies evaluated a psychological intervention; of these, 13 found positive impact, 4 found no impact, and 1 demonstrated worsened symptoms after the intervention. Pre-event trainings decreased psychiatric symptoms in each of the 3 studies evaluating its effectiveness.
   Conclusions:
   This review demonstrates that there are likely effective interventions to both prevent and treat psychiatric symptoms in first responders in high-, medium-, and low-income countries.

AB  - The efficacy of ketamine in reducing suicidal ideation (SI) has been previously reported. We aimed to evaluate acute anti-SI effects of single-dose ketamine in different formulations/routes of administration by pooling results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search was conducted on Cochrane, Embase, Medline, and PubMed from inception to July 1st, 2020. Studies were selected based on pre-determined eligibility criteria. Effect sizes of different formulations/routes at various time points were computed using random-effects models. With data from nine eligible RCTs (n = 197), the pooled effect size for anti-SI effects at the 24-h time point was 1.035 (N = 6, CI: 0.793 to 1.277, p < 0.001) for intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine and 1.309 (N = 1, CI: 0.857 to 1.761, p < 0.001) for intranasal (IN) esketamine. An additional five RCTs were available for qualitative analysis. RCTs were identified for oral/sublingual ketamine for depression, however, none of these trials reported anti-SI effects preventing quantitative analysis for these routes of delivery. No RCTs for intramuscular (IM) ketamine were identified. The findings suggest that single-dose IV ketamine/IN esketamine is associated with robust reductions in suicidal thoughts at 2-h, 4-h, and 24-h post-intervention. In addition, future studies on IM/oral/sublingual ketamine and comparative studies are warranted to evaluate the anti-SI efficacy of distinct formulations and routes of administration.

AB  - The demand for simple, accurate and time-efficient screens to detect cognitive decline at point-of-care is increasing. Sorting tests are often used to detect the 'executive' deficits that are commonly associated with behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), but their potential for use as a cognitive screen with older adults is unclear. A comprehensive search of four databases identified 142 studies that compared the sorting test performance (e.g. WCST, DKEFS-ST) of adults with a common neurodegenerative disorder (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, bvFTD, Parkinson's disease) and cognitively-healthy controls. Hedges' g effect sizes were used to compare the groups on five common test scores (Category, Total, Perseveration, Error, Description). The neurodegenerative disorders (combined) showed large deficits on all scores (g-1.0 to-1.3), with dementia (combined subtypes) performing more poorly (g-1.2 to-2.1), although bvFTD was not disproportionately worse than the other dementias. Overall, sorting tests detected the cognitive impairments caused by common neurodegenerative disorders, especially dementia, highlighting their potential suitability as a cognitive screen for older adults.

AB  - Objective: To investigate putative neurobiological mechanisms that link longer-term physical activity interventions to mental health and cognitive outcomes using randomised controlled trials in children, adolescents and young adults.
   Data sources: A range of medical and psychological science electronic databases were searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, PsychINFO).
   Review methods: Original research studies were selected, data were extracted and quality was appraised. Results: Sixteen primary papers were included, ranging from healthy and community samples to subclinical and clinical populations across a variety of age ranges and using different neurobiological measures (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, cortisol, brain-derived neurotropic factor).
   Discussion: The majority of studies report improvement in mental health and cognition outcomes following longer-term physical activity interventions which coincide with neurobiological alterations, especially neuroimaging alterations in activation and electrophysiological parameters in frontal areas. Future research should include measures of pre-existing fitness and target those who would benefit the most from this type of intervention (e.g. those with a lower level of fitness and at risk for or with mental health problems).

AB  - The patho-etiology of mental disorders with onset in childhood or adolescence remains largely unknown. We conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses (MAs) on environmental factors associated with mental disorders with onset in childhood/adolescence. We searched Pubmed-MEDLINE/EMBASE/PsycInfo databases, last search April 29th, 2020. Quality of MAs was measured with AMSTAR-2. Out of 6851 initial references, ten articles met inclusion criteria, providing 23 associations between 12 potential environmental factors and nine disorders (cases: 8884; N = 3,660,670). While almost half of the associations were nominally significant, none of them met criteria from either convincing or highly suggestive evidence. A single association was supported by suggestive evidence (maternal exposure to lithium or antipsychotics with neuromotor deficits), but it was affected by confounding by indication. Ten more associations had weak evidence, and 12 associations were not statistically significant. Quality of meta-analyses was rated as high in two, moderate in one, low in four, critically low in two, and not pertinent in one (individual participant data). Methodologically-sound research is needed in this field.

AB  - Background Suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt are warning signs for and determine the prognosis of completed suicide. These suicidal behaviors are much more pronounced in people living with HIV/AIDS. Despite this, there is a scarcity of aggregate evidence in Africa. This study was therefore aimed to fill this gap. Methods we extensively searched Psych-info, PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE to obtain eligible studies. Further screening for a reference list of articles was also done. Meta XL package was used to extract data and the Stata-11 was also employed. Cochran's Q- and the Higgs I-2 test were engaged to check heterogeneity. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis were implemented. Egger's test and funnel plots were used in detecting publication bias. Results The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 21.7% (95% CI 16.80, 26.63). The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, and South Africa was 22.7%, 25.3%, 9.8%, and 18.05% respectively. The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was larger; 27.7% in studies that used Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) than Mini-international Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI); 16.96%. Moreover, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in studies with a sample size of < 400 was 23.42% whereas it was 18.3% in studies with a sample size >= of 400 participants. The pooled prevalence of suicidal attempts in this study was 11.06% (95% CI 6.21, 15.92). A suicidal attempt was higher in Ethiopia (16.97%) and Nigeria (16.20%) than Uganda (3.51%). This pooled prevalence of suicidal attempt was higher among studies that used a smaller sample (< 400 participants) (15.5%) than studies that used a larger sample size (>= 400 participants) (8.4%). The pooled prevalence of suicidal attempt was 3.75%, and 16.97% in studies that used MINI and CIDI respectively. Our narrative synthesis revealed that advanced stages of AIDS, co-morbid depression, perceived HIV stigma, and poor social support was among the factors strongly associated with suicidal ideation and attempt. Conclusion The pooled magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempt was high and factors like advanced stages of AIDS, co-morbid depression, perceived stigma, and poor social support were related to it. Clinicians should be geared towards this mental health problem of HIV patients during management.

AB  - Depiction of groundwater is accelerated due to an increase in water demand for applications in urbanized areas, agriculture sectors, and energy extraction, and dwindling surface water during changing climate. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is one of the several methods that can help achieve long-term water sustainability by inch asing the natural recharge of groundwater reservoirs with water from non-traditional supplies such as excess surface water, stormwater, and treated wastewater. Despite the multiple benefits of MAR, the wide-scale implementation of MAR is lacking, partly because of challenges to select the location for MAR implementation and identify the MAR type based on site conditions and needs. In this review, we provide an overview of MAR types with a basic framework to select and implement specific MAR at a site based on water availability and quality, land use, source type, soil, and aquifer properties. Our analysis of 1127 MAR projects shows that MAR has been predominantly implemented in sites with sandy clay loam soil (soil group C) and with access to river water for recharge. Spatial analysis reveals that many regions with depleting water storage have opportunities to implement MAR projects. Analyzing data from 34 studies where stormwater was used for recharge, we show that MAR can remove dissolved organic carbon, most metals, E. col/ but not efficient at removing most trace organics, and entenococci. Removal efficiency depends on the type of MAR. In the end, we highlight potential challenges for implementing MAR at a site and additional benefits such as minimizing land subsidence, flood risk. augmenting low dry-season flow, and minimizing salt-water intrusion. These results could help identify locations in the water-stressed regions to implement specific MAR for water sustainability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this review was to determine whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) affect the ability to conceive in men and women of reproductive age, as well as to find out whether there are certain differencies between them in terms of effects on fertility.
   Methods: Our review was based on systematic search of literature in four online databases: Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science and SCIndex (Serbian Citation Index).
   Results: Several clinical studies reported that SSRIs can decrease the number and viability of sperm, and cause a disruption of their morphological structure. Regarding the effect of these antidepressants on female fertility, some experimental findings suggest that paroxetine and escitalopram may have a negative effect on the ability to conceive due to their stimulatory effect on fallopian tube motility. However, several observational studies favor the use of SSRIs in women with depression/anxiety undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) given their efficiency in suppressing these unpleasant symptoms without a relevant negative impact on IVF outcomes.
   Conclusions: SSRIs should be avoided male patients of reproductive age who wish to conceive, while the use of these antidepressants seems to be justified in women with depression or anxiety who have undergone IVF.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have indicated that childhood maltreatment (CM) may potentially influence the clinical symptomatology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, we aimed to quantify the relationship between CM and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) and depressive symptoms in OCD through a meta-analysis.
   Method: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PsycARTICLES databases for articles reporting the association between CM and OCD on April 15, 2020. Random-effect models were used to quantify the relationship between CM and the severity of OCS and depressive symptoms in OCD.
   Results: Ten records with 1,611 OCD patients were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed that CM is positively correlated with the severity of OCS [r = 0.10, 95%Confidence Interval (CI): 0.01-0.19, P = 0.04] as well as depressive symptoms in OCD (r = 0.15, 95%CI: 0.07-0.24, P = 0.0002). For the subtypes of CM, childhood emotional abuse (CEA) and childhood sexual abuse (CSA) was related with the severity of OCS (r = 0.11, 95%CI: 0.03-0.19, P = 0.009) and obsession (r = 0.13, 95%CI: 0.03-0.23, P = 0.01), respectively.
   Conclusion: Our meta-analysis indicates that OCD patients who suffered more CM may exhibit more severe OCS and depressive symptoms.

AB  - Black mothers with young children have encountered pernicious, multidetermined, racial disparities in the United States for centuries. However, disorders, risks, and stressors among Black mothers with young children are presented in the extant literature with little attention to their strengths, supports, or culturally appropriate ways to intervene and this furthers racism and White supremacy. Further, incomplete and negative narratives about Black mothers are perpetuated. Therefore, this article uses the Afrocentric perspective to better understand the state of Black maternal mental health and supports for mental health. Culturally centered recommendations are presented to move the field of infant mental health toward racial justice-oriented practice, policy, and research.

KW  - social dominance
KW  - behavior
KW  - systematic review
KW  - meta-analysis
KW  - reproducibility
KW  - preclinical
KW  - experimental design
AB  - Background: Social dominance status (e.g., dominant or subordinate) is often associated with individual differences in behavior and physiology but is largely neglected in experimental designs and statistical analysis plans in biomedical animal research. In fact, the extent to which social dominance status affects common experimental outcomes is virtually unknown. Given the pervasive use of laboratory mice and culminating evidence of issues with reproducibility, understanding the role of social dominance status on common behavioral measures used in research may be of paramount importance.
   Methods: To determine whether social dominance status-one facet of the social environment-contributes in a systematic way to standard measures of behavior in biomedical science, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature searching the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Experiments were divided into several domains of behavior: exploration, anxiety, learned helplessness, cognition, social, and sensory behavior. Meta-analyses between experiments were conducted for the open field, elevated plus-maze, and Porsolt forced swim test.
   Results: Of the 696 publications identified, a total of 55 experiments from 20 published studies met our pre-specified criteria. Study characteristics and reported results were highly heterogeneous across studies. A systematic review and meta-analyses, where possible, with these studies revealed little evidence for systematic phenotypic differences between dominant and subordinate male mice.
   Conclusion: This finding contradicts the notion that social dominance status impacts behavior in significant ways, although the lack of an observed relationship may be attributable to study heterogeneity concerning strain, group-size, age, housing and husbandry conditions, and dominance assessment method. Therefore, further research considering these secondary sources of variation may be necessary to determine if social dominance generally impacts treatment effects in substantive ways.

AB  - Psychophysiological research methods allow important insights into normative and pathological functioning of the human organism. This position paper briefly reviews existing studies, investigating the psychophysiological concomitants of personality pathology, with an emphasis on developmental aspects. Focussing on measures, indexing autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity at rest, and its reactivity to experimental challenge, the narrative synthesis of the literature highlights current challenges in the field. Findings on the psychophysiological concomitants of personality pathology are mixed. Inconsistencies among studies arise from differences between disorders and heterogeneity within distinct diagnostic categories. The majority of studies addressed borderline personality disorder, illustrating robust alterations in ANS function linked to severe experiences of early maltreatment and trauma, and associated symptoms of dissociation. However, important life-style and secondary health-related factors (i.e. physical activity, smoking) influencing ANS function are frequently neglected. Adapting a dimensional approach to personality pathology and longitudinal research designs seem promising to advance the filed in the years to come.

AB  - Microplastics receive significant societal and scientific attention due to increasing concerns about their impact on the environment and human health. Marine mammals are considered indicators for marine ecosystem health and many species are of conservation concern due to a multitude of anthropogenic stressors. Marine mammals may be vulnerable to microplastic exposure from the environment, via direct ingestion from sea water, and indirect uptake from their prey. Here we present the first systematic review of literature on microplastics and marine mammals, composing of 30 studies in total. The majority of studies examined the gastrointestinal tracts of beached, bycaught or hunted cetaceans and pinnipeds, and found that microplastics were present in all but one study, and the abundance varied between 0 and 88 particles per animal. Additionally, microplastics in pinniped scats (faeces) were detected in eight out of ten studies, with incidences ranging from 0% of animals to 100%. Our review highlights considerable methodological and reporting deficiencies and differences among papers, making comparisons and extrapolation across studies difficult. We suggest best practices to avoid these issues in future studies. In addition to empirical studies that quantified microplastics in animals and scat, ten studies out of 30 (all focussing on cetaceans) tried to estimate the risk of exposure using two main approaches; i) overlaying microplastic in the environment (water or prey) with cetacean habitat or ii) proposing biological or chemical biomarkers of exposure. We discuss advice and best practices on research into the exposure and impact of microplastics in marine mammals. This work on marine ecosystem health indicator species will provide valuable and comparable information in the future. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.Y

AB  - Recent pharmacoepidemiologic studies suggest that pharmacological neuroenhancement (pNE) and mood enhancement are globally expanding phenomena with distinctly different regional characteristics. Sociocultural and regulatory aspects, as well as health policies, play a central role in addition to medical care and prescription practices. The users mainly display self-involved motivations related to cognitive enhancement, emotional stability, and adaptivity. Natural stimulants, as well as drugs, represent substance abuse groups. The latter comprise purines, methylxanthines, phenylethylamines, modafinil, nootropics, antidepressants but also benzodiazepines, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and cannabis. Predominant pharmacodynamic target structures of these substances are the noradrenergic/dopaminergic and cholinergic receptor/transporter systems. Further targets comprise adenosine, serotonin, and glutamate receptors. Meta-analyses of randomized-controlled studies in healthy individuals show no or very limited verifiability of positive effects of pNE on attention, vigilance, learning, and memory. Only some members of the substance abuse groups, i.e., phenylethylamines and modafinil, display positive effects on attention and vigilance that are comparable to caffeinated drinks. However, the development of new antidementia drugs will increase the availability and the potential abuse of pNE. Social education, restrictive regulatory measures, and consistent medical prescription practices are essential to restrict the phenomenon of neuroenhancement with its social, medical, and ethical implications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the highly dynamic field of pharmacological neuroenhancement and elaborates the dramatic challenges for the medical, sociocultural, and ethical fundaments of society.

AB  - Personalized medicine is among the most exciting innovations in recent clinical research, offering the opportunity for tailored screening and management at the individual level. Biomarker-enriched clinical trials have shown increased efficiency and informativeness in cancer research due to the selective exclusion of patients unlikely to benefit.
   In acute stress situations, clinically significant decisions are often made in time-sensitive manners and providers may be pressed to make decisions based on abbreviated clinical assessments. Up to 30% of trauma survivors admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) will develop long-lasting posttraumatic stress psychopathologies. The long-term impact of those survivors with posttraumatic stress sequelae are significant, impacting both long-term psychological and physiological recovery. An accurate prognostic model of who will develop posttraumatic stress symptoms does not exist yet. Additionally, no scalable and cost-effective method that can be easily integrated into routine care exists, even though especially the acute care setting provides a critical window of opportunity for prevention in the so-called golden hours when preventive measures are most effective. In this review, we aim to discuss emerging machine learning (ML) applications that are promising for precisely risk stratification and targeted treatments in the acute care setting.
   The aim of this narrative review is to present examples of digital health innovations and to discuss the potential of these new approaches for treatment selection and prevention of posttraumatic sequelae in the acute care setting. The application of artificial intelligence-based solutions have already had great success in other areas and are rapidly approaching the field of psychological care as well. New ways of algorithm-based risk predicting, and the use of digital phenotypes provide a high potential for predicting future risk of PTSD in acute care settings and to go new steps in precision psychiatry.

AB  - Although there has been an increment in neuroimaging research in somatoform disorders (SD), to date little is known about the neural correlates of these diseases. Therefore, in this systematic, review we aimed at summarizing the existing evidence of structural brain alterations in SD as per DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria. Three electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science) were searched. Only case-control studies using structural neuroimaging were included. Forty-five out of 369 articles fulfilled inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Compared to controls, subjects with SD showed morphological alterations encompassing motor, limbic and somatosensory circuits. Although far from being conclusive, the results suggested that SD are characterized by selective alterations of large-scale brain networks implicated in cognitive control, emotion regulation and processing, stress and somatic-visceral perception. This review highlights the need for further multimodal neuroimaging studies with longitudinal designs, in larger and better-characterized samples, to elucidate the temporal and causal relationship between neuroanatomical changes and SD, which is paramount for informing tailored treatments.

AB  - The depression gap refers to higher rates of depression among women than men. Change in the depression gap over time might elucidate social causes of this disparity-such as unequal college attendance or employment status. We conducted a meta-regression analysis to estimate variation in the depression gap over time by age, accounting for potential sources of variation between studies. Electronic databases and bibliographies were searched for English-language studies from January 1980 through October 2019; 144 independent estimates from US-representative samples met selection criteria (n = 813,189). The depression gap was summarized as prevalence ratios among studies using diagnostic instruments and as standardized mean differences among symptom-based studies. Primary study measures were baseline study year (range, 1982-2017) and age (age groups ranging, in years, from 10-59 and 60 or older). Compared with respondents aged >= 60 years, depression prevalence was greater among respondents aged 10-19 (prevalence ratio = 1.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.56). Over time, the depression gap did not change among adults, but it increased among adolescents (age-by-time interaction prevalence ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.08). Results were similar for symptom-based studies. The present study finds no evidence of a change in the depression gender gap for US adults; however, the gap increased among adolescents. Greater attention to factors driving this widening disparity in adolescent depression is needed.

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most commonly reported mental health consequence following disasters and traumatic events, either natural or man-made. Nothing is written regarding its pooled prevalence and pooled estimate of factors. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of PTSD and estimate the pooled effect of associated factors.
   Methods: An English version of published articles will be retrieved using the following; PubMed/Medline, Africa-wides, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Global Health, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and psycINFO. Research reports will be searched from October 10/2020 to November 10/2020. The research reports quality will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Relevant information from the searched research reports will be extracted in a Microsoft Excel format. After extraction, the data will be imported to STATA version 14.0 for analysis. An appropriate guideline for a systematic review and meta-analysis report will be used, i.e. the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses. A random-effects meta-analysis model will be used to estimate the Der Simonian and Laird's pooled prevalence of PTSD and its associated factors.
   Discussion: This study aims to determine the pooled prevalence of PTSD and estimate the pooled effect of associated factors. Several kinds of research have reported the increasing magnitude of PTSD and its determinants in a different population. This might be due to reasons, such as little attention being given to the issue. Therefore, this study will try to fill this gap by giving new evidence-based results to attract policymakers' attention.

To date, there has been no comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature on the extent, range, and implementation contexts of these SMS text message interventions.
   Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to map and categorize gaps in the current body of peer-reviewed research around the use of SMS text messaging-based interventions for mental health and addiction services among adolescents.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted according to Levac's adaptation of Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for scoping reviews in six iterative stages. A search strategy was cocreated and adapted for five unique databases. Studies were screened using Covidence software. The PICO (patient, intervention, comparator, outcome) framework and input from multiple stakeholder groups were used to structure and pilot a data extraction codebook. Data were extracted on study methodology and measures, intervention design, and implementation characteristics, as well as policy, practice, and research implications.
   Results: We screened 1142 abstracts. Of these, 31 articles published between 2013 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion. Intervention engagement was the most common type of outcome measured (18/31), followed by changes in cognitions (16/31; eg, disease knowledge, self-awareness) and acceptability (16/31). Interventions were typically delivered in less than 12 weeks, and adolescents received 1-3 messages per week. Bidirectional messaging was involved in 65% (20/31) of the studies. Limited descriptions of implementation features (eg, cost, policy implications, technology performance) were reported.
   Conclusions: The use of SMS text messaging interventions is a rapidly expanding area of research. However, lack of large-scale controlled trials and theoretically driven intervention designs limits generalizability. Significant gaps in the literature were observed in relation to implementation considerations, cost, clinical workflow, bidirectionality of texting, and level of personalization and tailoring of the interventions. Given the growth of mobile phone based interventions for this population, a rigorous program of large-scale, well-designed trials is urgently required.

AB  - The present article is a systematic review of literature, examining the extent to which there is interest in old age of people with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and the issues in this field that are analyzed. The focus was on psychosocial aspects of functioning. The conducted literature review, using databases, covered the years 2000-2019. As a result of a search, a total of 7728 records were selected. Thirty-two articles meeting the search criteria were qualified for detailed analysis. The reviewed papers focused on the mental dimension of functioning, including cognitive processes of the elderly and mental disorders. Researchers also verified changes in difficult behavior and autistic traits. Issues regarding the social functioning of the elderly with ASD are almost absent.

AB  - BackgroundPsychosis can be a sufficiently traumatic event to lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous research has focussed on the trauma of first episode psychosis (FEP) and the only review to date of PTSD beyond the first episode period was not systematic and is potentially outdated.MethodsWe searched electronic databases and reference lists using predetermined inclusion criteria to retrieve studies that reported prevalence rates and associated factors of psychosis-related PTSD across all stages of the course of psychosis. Studies were included if they measured PTSD specifically related to the experience of psychosis. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Results were synthesised narratively.ResultsSix papers met inclusion criteria. Prevalence estimates of psychosis-related PTSD varied from 14 to 47%. Studies either assessed first-episode samples or did not specify the number of episodes experienced. Depression was consistently associated with psychosis-related PTSD. Other potential associations included treatment-related factors, psychosis severity, childhood trauma, and individual psychosocial reactions to trauma.ConclusionsPsychosis-related PTSD is a common problem in people with psychosis. There is a lack of published research on this beyond first episode psychosis. Further research is needed on larger, more generalizable samples. Our results tentatively suggest that prevalence rates of psychosis-related PTSD have not reduced over the past decade despite ambitions to provide trauma-informed care.Prospero registration number: CRD42019138750.

AB  - BackgroundIndigenous populations have remained strong and resilient in maintaining their unique culture and values, despite centuries of colonial oppression. Unfortunately, a consequential result of facing years of adversity has led Indigenous populations to experience a disproportionate level of poorer health outcomes compared to non-Indigenous populations. Specifically, the rate of Indigenous chronic disease prevalence has significantly increased in the last decade. Many of the unique issues Indigenous populations experience are deeply rooted in their colonial history and the intergenerational traumas that has subsequently impacted their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. With this, to better improve Indigenous health outcomes, understanding the local context of their challenges is key. Studies have begun to use modes of community engagement to initiate Indigenous partnerships and design chronic disease-based interventions. However, with the lack of a methodological guideline regarding the appropriate level of community engagement to be used, there is concern that many interventions will continue to fall short in meeting community needs.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to investigate the how various community engagement strategies have been used to design and/or implement interventions for Indigenous populations with chronic disease.MethodsA scoping review guided by the methods outlined by Arksey and O'Malley was conducted. A comprehensive search was completed by two reviewers in five electronic databases using keywords related to community engagement, Indigenous health and chronic disease. Studies were reviewed using a descriptive-analytical narrative method and data was categorized into thematic groups reflective of the main findings.ResultsWe identified 23 articles that met the criteria for this scoping review. The majority of the studies included the use a participatory research model and the procurement of study approval. However, despite the claimed use of participatory research methods, only 6 studies had involved community members to identify the area of priority and only five had utilized Indigenous interview styles to promote meaningful feedback. Adapting for the local cultural context and the inclusion of community outreach were identified as the key themes from this review.ConclusionMany studies have begun to adopt community engagement strategies to better meet the needs of Indigenous Peoples. With the lack of a clear guideline to approach Indigenous-based participatory research, we recommend that researchers focus on 1) building partnerships, 2) obtaining study approval and 3) adapting interventions to the local context.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this article was to describe the findings from a systematic review, quality review, and meta-analysis of risk factors for postpartum depression among adult Latinas in the United States. Methods Databases were searched from inception to May 2020 for studies published in English related to Latina/Hispanic mothers and risk factors of postpartum depression. Of 115 abstracts screened, 10 met the inclusion criteria for the review and meta-analysis. Eleven risk factors from these studies were included: acculturation, age, economic stress, education, marital status, number of children, prenatal depression, recent and remote intimate partner violence (IPV), general social support, and partner/father's social support. Results Partner/father's social support had a large effect size. Prenatal depression and recent IPV had medium effect sizes, while education, economic stress, general social support and remote IPV had small effect sizes. Negligible effect sizes were found for age, marital status, number of children, and acculturation. Conclusions Prenatal depression, IPV, social support (general and from partner/father), economic stress and education are risk factors that should be screened for when working with perinatal Latinas. Future directions for clinical practice and research are discussed.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The US Preventative Services Taskforce recommends screening adults for depression in primary care where adequate systems are established to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment and follow-up. However, there is currently no consensus on which screening tool is most suitable for use in primary healthcare. We aim to systematically review the literature for operating characteristics of depression screening tools capable of self-administration in primary healthcare and meta-analyse the psychometric characteristics of these tools to determine their performance and accuracy.
   Methods: An electronic literature search of EMBASE, Medline and CINAHL Complete was conducted from January 1982 to September 15, 2019 using the keywords: depression, screening, primary healthcare and adult. General and psychometric characteristics were extracted for screening tools studied in primary healthcare only when assessed against a 'reference-standard'.
   Results: Eighty-one studies from 22 countries were included in the review. Forty unique depression screening tools suitable for self-administration were identified in studies yielding 138 psychometric data sets. Based on ease of administration, 18 screening tools were suitable for use in primary healthcare. Of the tools meta-analysed, only the PHQ-9 and WHO-5 displayed superior accuracy and were easily administered.
   Conclusion: Although numerous depression screening tools are suitable for use in primary care based on ease of administration, the PHQ-9 was the most widely assessed tool and displayed superior DOR, a-ROC, specificity and LR + - Our review supports the use of the PHQ-9 as a brief, easily administered depression screening tool with superior discriminatory performance and robust psychometric characteristics in primary care settings.

AB  - To investigate the effectiveness of interventions that aim to improve the mental health of mothers of children with disabilities. Seven databases were searched. Interventions incorporated primarily cognitive-behavioural, psychoeducation, mindfulness or support-group approaches. The Template-for-Intervention-Description-and-Replication guided descriptions. Meta-analyses using a random effect model of randomized controlled trials assessed intervention effects on parenting stress and mental health. Of the 1591 retrieved papers, 31 met criteria to be appraised and 17 were included in the meta-analysis. Cognitive-behavioural approaches reduced parenting stress [2 studies, n = 64, pooled Standardized-Mean-Difference (SMD) = 0.86, 95% CI (0.43, 1.29)] and improved mental health [3 studies, n = 186, pooled SMD = 1.14, 95% CI (0.12, 2.17)], psychoeducation approaches improved mental health [2 studies, n = 165, SMD = 0.60, 95% CI (0.17, 1.03)]. Cognitive-behavioural and psychoeducation interventions are effective. Further research and clinical guidelines are warranted.

AB  - Aim: The onset of mental illness is most common in adolescence, therefore mental health promotion efforts frequently target this age group. Evaluation literature in this area is largely segmented into specific domains in terms of settings, countries, and/or groups of young people, but an overall understanding and comparison across these areas is lacking. The current review aims to provide such an overview of interventions/programs which attempt to improve adolescents' mental health literacy, attitudes/stigma and behaviours.
   Methods: A systematic mapping review synthesized the strengths and weaknesses of published interventions/programs to improve mental health outcomes in youth. Ten databases and grey literature sources were searched, and results were categorized according to sample, location/setting, type of information presented, delivery and testing procedures, mental health outcome/s evaluated, and limitations.
   Results: One hundred and forty articles met the inclusion criteria; 126 were original records and 14 were reviews. Mental health literacy and attitudes/stigma were examined most frequently, and studies were predominantly conducted in school-based environments and high income economies. Intervention/program effectiveness varied across outcome/s measured, setting, and control group usage, with mental health literacy exhibiting the most positive changes overall. Common limitations included no long-term follow up or control group inclusion.
   Conclusions: Despite generally positive changes seen throughout studies in this area, effectiveness differed across a range of methodological domains. Most research is conducted in schools and higher income economies, but the lack of investigation in other contexts (i.e., internet or community) or lower income countries suggests our understanding in this area is constrained.

AB  - This paper aims to summarise peer-reviewed literature into the mental health of transgender young people within a secondary schooling environment. A scoping review was conducted using literature across four databases. The search was limited to English language peer-reviewed articles that reported upon the association between school factors and the mental health outcomes of transgender young people in secondary schools. The review resulted in seven relevant studies, which reported numerous school factors related to mental health outcomes for transgender young people. The factors that related to mental health of transgender young people in schools include peer victimisation and bullying, perceived safety and a sense of school belonging or connectedness. Clinical and practical implications are provided for policy makers, educational institutions and school mental healthcare professionals. It is recommended that future research is needed to investigate the mental health services provided within the schooling environment.

AB  - Introduction Rotation work, characterised by travelling long distances to work in isolated areas where workers typically rotate consecutive days working and living on-site with periods at home, is increasingly used in the resources and construction sectors globally. Such employment practices may have an impact on workers' health and well-being. This systematic review explores the impact rotation work has on mental and physical outcomes in rotation workers in the resources and construction sectors. Method The PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases were systematically searched on 1 May 2020 to identify quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies addressing the health of rotation workers published in peer-reviewed journals. Findings from the studies were summarised narratively. Results Of 6268 studies retrieved, 90 studies were included in the review. Studies suggested higher prevalence of psychological distress in onshore rotation workers and higher overweight/obesity rates among rotation workers as compared with the general population. We found more sleep problems and higher levels of smoking during work periods compared with off-site days; and higher alcohol intake during off-site days compared with on-site days. Workers generally perceived their physical health status as good. High-perceived job demands (such as workload, repetitive work) were associated with mental distress and exhaustion, sleep problems and perceived poor physical health status, while high-perceived job resources (such as job clarity/control, support) were associated with low mental distress and exhaustion, less smoking and alcohol intake, and better sleep. Conclusion Rotation work is associated with several poorer health behaviours and outcomes, such as sleep problems, smoking, alcohol consumption and overweight/obesity. Interventions needed to improve rotation workers' health should include maximising available job resources and reducing job demands. Further longitudinal studies are needed to explore the long-term health effects of rotation work and the short-term contextual effects of the different aspects of rotation work.

AB  - Despite clinical evidence of poor oral health and hygiene in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the mouth is often overlooked by both patients and the medical community, who generally focus on motor or psychiatric disorders considered more burdensome. Yet, oral health is in a two-way relationship with overall health-a weakened status triggering a decline in the quality of life. Here, we aim at giving a comprehensive overview of oral health disorders in PD, while identifying their etiologies and consequences. The physical (abnormal posture, muscle tone, tremor, and dyskinesia), behavioral (cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders), and iatrogenic patterns associated with PD have an overall detrimental effect on patients' oral health, putting them at risk for other disorders (infections, aspiration, pain, malnutrition), reducing their quality of life and increasing their isolation (anxiety, depression, communication issues). Interdisciplinary cooperation for prevention, management and follow-up strategies need to be implemented at an early stage to maintain and improve patients' overall comfort and condition. Recommendations for practice, including (non-)pharmacological management strategies are discussed, with an emphasis on the neurologists' role. Of interest, the oral cavity may become a valuable tool for diagnosis and prognosis in the near future (biomarkers). This overlooked but critical issue requires further attention and interdisciplinary research.

AB  - Much of the adult chronic pain literature addresses pain in typical pain cohorts of middle-aged to older individuals. To date, little research has focused on chronic pain in younger adults, who likely have a completely different pain experience. This scoping review aimed to address this gap by describing the emerging adult (18-29 years) chronic pain experience regarding prevalence, associated factors, outcomes, and pain management. Searches of primary electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were performed on February 26, 2020, restricting the publication date from database inception to December 31, 2019. The search strategy, conducted in English, covered search term combinations of "chronic pain" and "young adults." A total of 6,612 records were considered-3,141 after removing duplicates. These records were screened by title and abstract; 871 through full-text screening. Of these, 78 articles covered the topic of emerging adults with chronic pain. Collectively, results indicated that between 5% and 30% of emerging adults experience chronic pain, depending on the sample and exact chronic pain definition. The most consistent associated factors were female sex, familial chronic pain, and previous experiences of chronic pain in childhood. Anxiety, depression, and sleep issues appeared associated both before and after the onset of chronic pain. Outcomes of pain included interruptions to study and work, poorer physical functioning, and pain-related interference to socializing. We observed that few pain treatments have been tested specifically in this cohort. A greater ongoing focus on chronic pain in emerging adults is required to improve long-lasting outcomes.

AB  - Background: Physical, psychological, and social changes in the aging lead to new needs in the care of the elderly. The Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE) evaluates older adults' care needs. This study aimed to assess the types of needs of the elderly using the CANE questionnaire.
   Study design: A systematic review.
   Methods: This systematic review included all cross-sectional studies. International databases, including Web of Sciences, Medline, Scopus, and ProQuest were searched up to June 2021. Such keywords as aged OR ageing OR "older adults" OR "older people" OR "older person" OR elderly, AND need OR "needs assessment" OR "met needs" OR "unmet needs" were used to design the search strategy. A 95% CI was calculated using the exact method, and the meta-analysis of proportion (metaprob) module was used for data analysis.
   Results: In total, 769 studies were retrieved in this review. At the following stages, 760 articles were excluded upon checking the duplicates; moreover, the titles and abstracts did not meet the eligibility criteria. Finally, nine studies remained. The mean +/- SD age of 2200 participants was obtained at 78.4 +/- 5.9 years. The highest and lowest met needs were related to the physical (45%) and social (21%) dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, the highest unmet needs were observed in the physical and social dimensions (0.07%), and the lowest unmet needs were related to the psychological and environmental dimensions (0.04%).
   Conclusions: The CANE is sensitive enough to identify unmet needs in different samples and settings. Therefore, a new care model and appropriate interventions for the elderly can be designed based on the CANE results.

AB  - Parkinson's disease has been found to significantly affect health-related quality of life. The gender differences of the health-related quality of life of subjects with Parkinson's disease have been observed in a number of studies. These differences have been reported in terms of the age at onset, clinical manifestations, and response to therapy. In general, women with Parkinson's disease showed more positive disease outcomes with regard to emotion processing, non-motor symptoms, and cognitive functions, although women report more Parkinson's disease-related clinical manifestations. Female gender predicted poor physical functioning and socioemotional health-related quality of life, while male gender predicted the cognitive domain of health-related quality of life. Some studies reported gender differences in the association between health-related quality of life and non-motor symptoms. Depression and fatigue were the main causes of poorer health-related quality of life in women, even in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The aim of this review was to collect the best available evidence on gender differences in the development of Parkinson's disease symptoms and health-related quality of life.

AB  - Lectins were discovered first in plants and later in other living things, and nowadays it is known that they are present in almost all many life forms. These proteins can bind to specific carbohydrates, which make them perform a number of biological activities and can be used as tools in the study of glycoconjugate structures present on the cell surface, being effective in medical research. Plant lectins, leguminosae lectins particularly, are among the most studied plant proteins. They are very versatile molecules, which show several interesting biological properties. Thus, the present paper reviewed the advances about the leguminosae lectins biological properties studies in the last ten years, taking into account their possible applications in the fields of Clinical Microbiology, Pharmacy and Cancerology through a search in the electronic databases, providing opportunity to exchange information about the theme. Leguminosae lectins can neutralize pathogenic organisms, be they viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes, in addition carcinogenic cells, besides decreasing oxidative stress, conditions which increases the possibility of alternative substances for the design of new drugs to be used in current therapeutic, expanding the possibilities of diseases cure.

AB  - Purpose of review Resilience is an adaptation process presented by an individual despite facing adversities. Epigenetic changes, such as histone acetylation/methylation and DNA methylation, have been demonstrated to mediate stress response. In this review, we summarize recent findings on epigenetic mechanisms contributing to stress resilience. Recent findings : Epigenetic modifications of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, endocrine, immune, and vascular systems are linked to resilience. For instance, increased DNA methylation of the nonneuronal growth factor Gdnf in specific brain regions promotes stress resilience. Additionally, high DNA methylation at the glucocorticoid receptor gene was associated with resilience in both rodents and humans. At the immune level, chronic stress induces increased DNA methylation at IL6 gene, a mediator of stress vulnerability. Moreover, epigenetic adaptations of the blood--brain barrier have been recently associated with stress resilience, which could lead to innovative therapeutic approaches to treat depression. Identification of both central and peripheral epigenetic changes promoting stress resilience represent promising novel targets in the development of preventive and personalized medicine. Nevertheless, more research is needed to establish sex specific differences and to identify novel epigenetic mechanisms, such as serotonylation and dopaminylation, that hold great promises for the field of psychiatry.

AB  - Background. During epidemics, health care workers (HCWs) are particularly exposed to the risk of secondary trauma. If not effectively addressed, the consequences of such psychological distress can progress to more severe conditions.
   Methods. A systematic search of several databases on the effect of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 epidemics on the mental health of HCWs was performed according to both the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the WHO Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research.
   Results. The 77 reviewed studies highlighted that work organization and individual characteristics can add to mental health risk. Providing adequate training to prevent infection and prepare HCWs to handle the epidemic, strengthening team work to improve organization, and ensuring appropriate protective equipment is available can help prevent risk of psychiatric illness.
   Conclusions. Monitoring and addressing through tailored interventions the mental health consequences of pandemics in HCWs is necessary.

KW  - Israel
AB  - Background: The provision of home-based care for frail older adults in Italy and Israel is predominately provided by live-in migrant care workers (MCWs). However, despite the important role that they play in filling the demand for home care, MCWs often experience labor rights violations. This not only impacts the well-being of MCWs but also leads to lower-quality care being provided to people in need of support. Method: This scoping review used Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework to map literature. This article aims to analyze the scope, main topics, themes and gaps in the existing academic literature on how micro and macro level indicators impact the working and living conditions of live-in MCWs in Italy and Israel. Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched for peer-reviewed articles. Search terms were adapted from the Multilevel Framework of Transnational Care Migration (MFTCM). Themes were developed using Braun and Clarke's method for conducting reflexive thematic analysis. Articles were included if they focused on Italy and/or Israel, included analysis on the working and living conditions of live-in MCWs at the macro and/or micro levels, were written in English, and were published between 2015 and 2020. Results: Out of the 1088 articles retrieved, 33 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 18 articles focused on Italy and 14 on Israel, and one focused on both Italy and Israel. The majority of articles in Italy (84 per cent) and Israel (53 per cent) included analysis on care regimes. Only 37 per cent of articles in Italy and 20 per cent in Israel included analysis on gender regimes. At the micro level, 80 per cent of articles in Israel discussed Power/Class Asymmetry, compared to 37 per cent in Italy. In total, six themes were developed. At the macro level, these themes included funding care work, MCWs as a pragmatic approach, care in the home, and valuing care work. At the micro level, the themes included being part of the family, and perceptions on class asymmetries. The findings presented in this review show that MCWs in both Italy and Israel face many of the same challenges in accessing decent work opportunities, despite contrasting employment and migration policies in each country. This can be partially attributed to the undervaluing of care work because of racialized and gendered notions of care. At the macro level, this has contributed to a lack of political will to develop long-term sustainable solutions to create or monitor decent work standards for MCWs. At the micro level, this has led to power imbalances between MCWs and people in need of care and their family members, resulting in MCWs being expected to work hours beyond those contractually allowed, having little to no time off, and experiencing emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Conclusion: This study provides a review of the most recent contributions to the fields of labor migration and health concerning the MCW markets in Italy and Israel. While there have been many studies in each country that detail the labor rights violations experienced by MCWs, this is the first review that develops themes around the underlying causes of these violations. By thematically analyzing the findings of recent studies and current gaps in existing knowledge, this scoping review assists in building the groundwork for the development and implementation of policy, strategies, practice and research to improve the rights and migration experiences of MCWs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress is common among police personnel leading to several negative consequences.
   OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic literature review to identify risk factors for stress among police officers.
   METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus electronic databases through to July 2018 and we conducted this review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for studies quality assessment.
   RESULTS: After selection, 29 cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria and included in the review. The average quality of studies was low since no study was rated as having low risk of bias, three studies (10.3%) as moderate risk and 26 studies (89.7%) were rated as having high risk of bias. Stress risk factors were summarized in the following categories: demographic characteristics; job characteristics; lifestyle factors; negative coping strategies and negative personality traits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Identification of stress risk factors is the first step to create and adopt the appropriate interventions to decrease stress among police personnel. The early identification of police officers at higher risk and the appropriate screening for mental health disorders is crucial to prevent disease and promote quality of life.

AB  - Improvements in understanding the neurobiological basis of mental illness have unfortunately not translated into major advances in treatment. At this point, it is clear that psychiatric disorders are exceedingly complex and that, in order to account for and leverage this complexity, we need to collect longitudinal data sets from much larger and more diverse samples than is practical using traditional methods. We discuss how smartphone-based research methods have the potential to dramatically advance our understanding of the neuroscience of mental health. This, we expect, will take the form of complementing lab-based hard neuroscience research with dense sampling of cognitive tests, clinical questionnaires, passive data from smartphone sensors, and experience-sampling data as people go about their daily lives. Theory and data-driven approaches can help make sense of these rich data sets, and the combination of computational tools and the big data that smartphones make possible has great potential value for researchers wishing to understand how aspects of brain function give rise to, or emerge from, states of mental health and illness.

AB  - Objective: Although available diagnostic criteria are intelligible, combination of OAB and anxiety in the same patient presents a perfect example of medical causality dilemma, commonly stated as the question: "which came first: the chicken or the egg?". The aim of this review article is to address available insights in bidirectional association between OAB and anxiety. Methods: In this review article, we included different types of studies whose results are presented as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) with a 95% accuracy. A literature search was conducted with the use of the PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases focusing on identifying articles published in English between 1990 and 2020. Results: The electronic searches, after duplicate records removal, provided a total of 126 citations. Of these, 107 were excluded after title/abstract screening (not relevant to the review). We examined the full text of 19 publications remaining to summarize possible mechanisms between OAB and anxiety. According to examined literature, our result synthesis provides insight in epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic and therapeutic approach of both conditions. Conclusion: Temporal relationship between OAB and anxiety is not very well documented because available longitudinal cohort studies are limited. The limitation of the published literature is that most were population-based symptom studies demonstrating high risk of bias. Although data from analysed studies suggest that anxiety and OAB and anxiety might be casually related, studies provided on clinical population are warranted. In addition to the traditional urologic factors, we recommend that psychosocial factors such as anxiety should be assessed routinely in patients with OAB.

AB  - One of the major puzzles in medical research and public health systems worldwide is Alzheimer's disease (AD), reaching nowadays a prevalence near 50 million people. This is a multifactorial brain disorder characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, apathy, and mood and neuropsychiatric disorders. The main risk of AD is aging; a normal biological process associated with a continuum dynamic involving a gradual loss of people's physical capacities, but with a sound experienced view of life. Studies suggest that AD is a break from normal aging with changes in the powerful functional capacities of neurons as well as in the mechanisms of neuronal protection. In this context, an important path has been opened toward AD prevention considering that there are elements of nutrition, daily exercise, avoidance of toxic substances and drugs, an active social life, meditation, and control of stress, to achieve healthy aging. Here, we analyze the involvement of such factors and how to control environmental risk factors for a better quality of life. Prevention as well as innovative screening programs for early detection of the disease using reliable biomarkers are becoming critical to control the disease. In addition, the failure of traditional pharmacological treatments and search for new drugs has stimulated the emergence of nutraceutical compounds in the context of a "multitarget" therapy, as well as mindfulness approaches shown to be effective in the aging, and applied to the control of AD. An integrated approach involving all these preventive factors combined with novel pharmacological approaches should pave the way for the future control of the disease.

AB  - Background: Using non-pharmacological interventions is a current approach in dementia care to manage responsive behaviors, to maintain functional capacity, and to reduce emotional stress. Novel technologies such as social robot interventions might be useful to engage people with dementia in activities and interactions as well as to improve their cognitive, emotional, and physical status.
   Objective: Assessing the effects and the quality of reporting of social robot interventions for people with dementia.
   Methods: In our systematic review, we included quasi-experimental and experimental studies published in English, French, or German, irrespective of publication year. Searching CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection was supplemented by citation tracking and free web searching. To assess the methodological quality of included studies, we used tools provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute. To assess the reporting of the interventions, we applied CReDECI 2 and TIDieR.
   Results: We identified sixteen studies published between 2012 and 2018, including two to 415 participants with mostly non-defined type of dementia. Eight studies had an experimental design. The predominant robot types were pet robots (i.e., PARO). Most studies addressed behavioral, emotion-related, and functional outcomes with beneficial, non-beneficial, and mixed results. Predominantly, cognitive outcomes were not improved. Overall, studies were of moderate methodological quality.
   Conclusion: Heterogeneous populations, intervention characteristics, and measured outcomes make it difficult to generalize the results with regard to clinical practice. The impact of social robot interventions on behavioral, emotion-related, and functional outcomes should therefore be assessed considering the severity of dementia and intervention characteristics.

AB  - Objectives Chronic low-grade inflammation has been identified as a key pathway linking stress experience to human health. However, systematic evaluations on the relationship of work stress and immune function are scarce and predominantly based on cross-sectional studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies on associations of working conditions and inflammatory biomarkers.
   Methods In line with our previously established study protocol and the PRISMA-guidelines, we systematically searched electronic databases for prospective studies on working conditions as well as workplace interventions and inflammatory markers in employees. We classified studies (by design, type of exposure/intervention, outcome) and performed rigorous risk-of-bias assessments. Studies were summarized qualitatively, and a meta-analysis was conducted.
   Results We identified 23 eligible studies (N=16 432) with a broad scope of working conditions and inflammatory markers. For interventional designs, we differentiated between individual-directed/behavioral (including physical and mental) and organization-directed/structural interventions. Workplace physical exercise interventions were associated with a decrease in C-reactive protein (k=5; d=-0.61; P<0.001). For other workplace interventions, ie, mental and organizational/structural, results were inconclusive. Concerning observational studies, dimensions of the job demand-control(-support) model were most frequently investigated, and results showed weak - if any - associations with inflammatory markers.
   Conclusions The research base was heterogeneous and high-level evidence was limited. More prospective studies are needed with broader consideration of work stressors and inflammatory markers. For practical occupational health management, exercise interventions are effective measures to reduce chronic low-grade inflammation.

AB  - Background: Stigma is a barrier for help-seeking, mental health service access, and contributes to the mental health treatment gap. Because the mental health treatment gap is greatest in low- and middle-income countries, it is vital to identify effective strategies to reduce stigma in these settings. To date, there has been a lack of synthesis of findings from interventions to reduce stigma related to mental disorders within India.
   Method: A systematic review was conducted to provide an overview of the characteristics and effectiveness of stigma reduction interventions studies in India. PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases were searched for literature published up to 30th June 2020.
   Results: From a total of 1,984 articles identified, only 9 were eligible for final inclusion, published between 1990-2020. No study was found from North, North-East, Central or East India. Most stigma-reduction interventions were multi-level, that is, using a combination of intra-personal, inter-personal and community level strategies to target changes in outcomes of individuals, environments and community groups. Three studies focused on health and stigma-related changes at the organisational/institutional level. No interventions focused on the governmental/structural level. There were only two randomised controlled trials, and two studies focused on all three stigma components of knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. Most interventions were delivered to community members. None focused on mental health professionals as intervention delivery target.
   Conclusion: There is a need for the development of comprehensive, culturally acceptable evidence-based interventions that act at multiple levels, and involve a mixture of various stigma reducing strategies with multiple target groups.

AB  - Oncology nurses are at risk of chronic stress. In this narrative review we provide an overview of stress management intervention studies for oncology nurses, and suggest that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy/Training (ACT) provides a better intervention framework due to the relevance of underpinning therapeutic processes (e.g. acceptance, mindfulness, values clarification) to the role and stress-related experiences of this workforce population. Current evidence for the effectiveness of stress management intervention varies, with few studies describing how theory informs intervention content, or justifying why they should benefit this population specifically. ACT lends itself to data-driven intervention development, thus potentially addressing some methodological limitations in this field. Only one trial has tested ACT in this population, reporting only partial effects. Further empirical research is required given (a) the applicability of ACT for this population and context, and (b) the associated advantages of brief and/or group delivery to address known barriers to participating in stress management interventions.

AB  - The literature review is devoted to the analysis of the relationship of suicidal behavior with both gene loci and established gene polymorphisms. The relationship with suicides of both individual genes and their groups is considered. Information about single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes regulating the concentration of cortisol (genes FKBP5, SLC6A3, CRHR1, CRHR2, SKA2) is especially valuable, since it is this group of genes that regulates the stress response and is involved in the formation of the depressive state along with serotoninergic (genes 5-HTTLPR, HTR2A) and adrenergic (genes ADRA2A, ADRA2B) systems, the pathology of which is usually associated with various forms of depression and suicide. It is particularly interesting that different polymorphisms of genes (CRHR1, CRHR2, SKA2) that regulate the concentration of cortisol are characteristic of age and sex groups and therefore determine the differences in frequency, age and reasons for committing suicide. In addition, the role of polymorphisms in the implementation of suicide of the gene for proteins of the YWHAE family, the gene for the neurotrophic factor NTRK2, and the reward system is considered. The questions of the formation of possible ways to search for means of preventing the development of the suicidal phenotype are discussed. The authors proposed to distinguish the suicidal phenotype into an independent group of conditions, considered as a multifactorial disease, the final result of which is committing suicide or its attempt, requiring codification and requiring the development of a classification of variants of etiology and pathogenesis.

AB  - Alteration in cortisol response to acute social stressors has been hypothesized to mediate childhood adversities (CA) and increased morbidity in adulthood. However, the evidence supporting an association between CA and cortisol response to social stressors is inconclusive. The present review addressed this issue by reviewing the literature on CA and cortisol response to acute social stressors, with a focus on studies with adolescents or adults, using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to assess CA, and examining salivary cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Systematic searches of relevant articles in PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect in February and March 2020 identified 12 articles including 1196 participants with mean ages ranging from 15.3 to 52.3 yrs. across studies. CTQ scores were significantly associated with cortisol response in 2 studies. In addition, the physical abuse and emotional neglect subscales were associated with cortisol response respectively in 2 separate studies. The lack of association between CA and cortisol response calls for more longitudinal studies, and the use of formal records of maltreatment or informant reports in future research to complement information collected by retrospective measures. In addition, increased attention to biological mechanisms other than that associated with the regulation of cortisol in explaining the connection between CA and psychiatry morbidity is warranted.

AB  - Despite the growing interest in the treatment and management of COVID-19, communities still end up experiencing multiple stresses with mental health crisis, due to the pandemic. When this is not addressed, it causes stress in the long run, with further mental health damage in individuals and the communities. Furthermore, relevant policy related to the community mental health was identified as awareness in promoting mental issues, yet there are still failures recorded in the aspect of adequately addressing the well-being concerns. This study aims to support community mental health during the crisis, through useful information from relevant articles. It also explains some perspectives from literature reviews, case reports, with society responses from Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Proquest databases concerning recent community mental health issues, and government policy on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion criteria required articles that were peer-reviewed, by using i) English language March-September 2020; ii) Presented empirical studies related to COVID-19 (quantitative and qualitative); iii) Searched terms related to the general and community mental health, their policy, and COVID-19 pandemic. This study showed 19 articles related to community mental health issues or psychological wellbeing topics. The interventions provided to strengthen community mental health during the pandemic included emergency psychological crisis treatment, hotline assistance, online counseling service with mental care course, and outpatient consultation. Therefore, community mental health issues should be addressed with physical wellness. In addition, the community plays a key role in influencing stakeholders and governments, to increase the priority in supporting mental health.

AB  - Objectives Epidemiological studies have explored the relationship between work-related stress and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but it remains unclear on whether work-related stress could increase the risk of T2DM. We aimed to evaluate the association between job strain and the risk of T2DM.
   Methods We searched PubMed and Web of Science up to April 2019. Summary risk estimates were calculated by random-effect models. And the analysis was also conducted stratifying by gender, study location, smoking, drinking, body mass index, physical activity, family history of T2DM, education and T2DM ascertainment. Studies with binary job strain and quadrants based on the job strain model were analyzed separately.
   Results A total of nine studies with 210 939 participants free of T2DM were included in this analysis. High job strain (high job demands and low control) was associated with the overall risk of T2DM compared with no job strain (all other combinations) [relative risk (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.31], and the association was more evident in women (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.02-2.14). A statistically significant association was also observed when using high strain as a category (job strain quadrants) rather than binary variable (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.04-2.55) in women but not men.
   Conclusions Our study suggests that job strain is an important risk factor for T2DM, especially among women. Appropriate preventive interventions in populations with high job strain would contribute to a reduction in T2DM risk.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. The association between environmental factors (e.g., pesticide) and AD has attracted considerable attention. However, no systematic analysis has been performed and make it difficult to provide deeper insights of AD correlated with pesticide exposure. Hence, this study utilized a bibliometric and visual approach that included map collaborations, co-citations, and keywords, to identifying the knowledge structure, hot topics and the research trends based on 372 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection and PubMed databases. The results showed that 116 institutions from 52 countries published articles in this field. The United States and Israel played a leading role with numerous publications in related journals, as well as prolific institutions and authors, respectively. Three hot topics in pesticide-induced AD were recognized based on co-occurrence keywords detection, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, oxidative stress, and AChE. Moreover, analysis of keywords burst suggests that some potential molecular mechanisms and therapy targets of pesticide-induced AD, especially for mitochondrial dysfunction and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) that catalyzes the oxidative deamination and causes oxidative stress, are emerging trends. In addition, the study of various pesticides and the assessment method of pesticide exposure will step forward as well. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to specifically visualize the relationship between AD and pesticide exposure and to predict potential future research directions.

AB  - Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major cause of chronic neurological disability in young adults. An increasing number of controlled studies have assessed the potential rehabilitative effects of new drug-free treatments, complementary to the standard care, including music-based therapy (MBT). Objective: To analyze the evidence for the effectiveness of MBT within the therapeutic approaches to individuals diagnosed with MS. Methods: A systematic review of clinical trials was performed with searches in the following databases: BIOSIS, CINAHL, Cochrane, EBSCO, ERIC, Google Scholar, IBECS, LILACS, LISA (ProQuest), Medline, PEDro, PsycINFO (APA), Psychological & Behavioral, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science. Clinical trials comparing MBT versus conventional therapy/no intervention were included. Results: From the 282 studies identified, 10 trials were selected. Among these, the total sample consisted of 429 individuals: 253 were allocated to the experimental group (MBT) and 176 to the control group (conventional therapies or no intervention). All the studies presented high methodological quality. Modalities of MBT were clustered into four groups: (1) Rhythmic auditory; (2) Playing musical instruments; (3) Dance strategy; and (4) Neurological music therapy. Overall, the studies consistently showed that MBT was better than conventional therapy or no intervention, with regard to gait parameters (double support time and walking speed), fatigue level, fatigability, coordination, dexterity, balance, walking endurance, lower extremity functional strength, emotional status and pain. Regarding mental fatigability and memory, the data were conflicting and the evidence was unclear. Conclusion: MBT is a safe and effective approach for clinical rehabilitation of MS patients that leads to positive results regarding both motor and non-motor functions.

AB  - Evidence shows that altered retinoic acid signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Retinoic acid is the bioactive derivative of the lipophilic vitamin A. Vitamin A is involved in several important homeostatic processes, such as cell differentiation, antioxidant activity, inflammation and neuronal plasticity. The role of vitamin A and its derivatives in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and their potential as therapeutics, has drawn attention for more than 10 years. However, the literature sits in disparate fields. Vitamin A could act at the crossroad of multiple environmental and genetic factors of PD. The purpose of this review is to outline what is known about the role of vitamin A metabolism in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PD. We examine key biological systems and mechanisms that are under the control of vitamin A and its derivatives, which are (or could be) exploited for therapeutic potential in PD: the survival of dopaminergic neurons, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, circadian rhythms, homeostasis of the enteric nervous system, and hormonal systems. We focus on the pivotal role of ALDH1A1, an enzyme expressed by dopaminergic neurons for the detoxification of these neurons, which is under the control of retinoic acid. By providing an integrated summary, this review will guide future studies on the potential role of vitamin A in the management of symptoms, health and wellbeing for PD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Taxi/for-hire vehicle (FHV) drivers are a predominantly immigrant, male, and growing population in large, metropolitan cities in the U.S. at risk for cardiovascular conditions.
   OBJECTIVE: This review sought to systematically investigate the literature given mounting evidence of poor taxi/FHV driver health.
   METHODS: A systematic search of peer-reviewed journal articles that included a range of cardiovascular risks and conditions among taxi/FHV drivers in the U.S. was conducted.
   RESULTS: 8800 journal articles were initially found. 14 eligible articles were included: 3 mixed methods articles, 1 qualitative article, and 10 quantitative articles. Articles spanned 13 cardiovascular risks and conditions, including tobacco, nutrition, physical activity, stress, depression, body mass index/waist circumference, cholesterol, blood glucose/diabetes, air pollution, sleep, blood pressure/hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. The majority of studies were cross-sectional and utilized convenience samples.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous and high quality research is needed to further investigate rates of cardiovascular health in this population. The complexity of data collection in this group presents challenges to this endeavor. The high prevalence of poor nutrition, limited physical activity, diabetes, and blood pressure across studies indicates an urgent need to address low rates of health care access at a policy level and to design targeted workplace interventions.

AB  - Low back pain is the leading cause for years lived in disability. Most people with acute low back pain improve rapidly, but 4% to 25% of patients become chronic. Since the previous systematic reviews on the subject, a large number of new studies have been conducted. The objective of this article was to review the evidence of the prognostic factors behind nonspecific chronic low back pain. A systematic literature search was performed without date limitation from the MEDLINE, Cochrane library, and Medic databases. Specific inclusion criteria were used, and risk factors before the onset of chronic symptoms were searched. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. One hundred eleven full articles were read for potential inclusion, and 25 articles met all the inclusion criteria. One study was rated as good quality, 19 studies were rated as fair quality, and 5 articles were rated as poor quality. Higher pain intensity, higher body weight, carrying heavy loads at work, difficult working positions, and depression were the most frequently observed risk factors for chronic low back pain. Maladaptive behavior strategies, general anxiety, functional limitation during the episode, smoking, and particularly physical work were also explicitly predictive of chronicity. According to this systematic review, several prognostic factors from the biomechanical, psychological and psychosocial point of view are significant for chronicity in low back pain.

AB  - To combat the coronaviruses and their novel variants, therapeutic drugs and the development of vaccines that are to be effective throughout human life are urgently needed. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) acts as a modulator in the activation of the microcirculation, immune system, and autonomic nervous system, along with controlling pharmacological functions such as emotional responses, homeostasis, motor functions, cognition, and motivation. The ECS contains endogenous cannabinoids, cannabinoid receptor (CBRs), and enzymes that regulate their biosynthesis, transport, and degradation. Moreover, phytocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids that mimic the action of endocannabinoids also play an essential role in the modulation of the ECS. Cannabinoids, the main constituents of cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), are therapeutic compounds that have received international attention in the health field due to their therapeutic properties. Recently, they have been tested for the treatment of COVID-19 due to their antiviral properties. Indeed, cannabinoid-type compounds, and in particular cannabidiol (CBD), isolated from glandular trichomes found in the calyx of cannabis flowers with reported antiviral properties is hypothesized to be a therapeutic option in the ministration of SARS-CoV-2 consorted with COVID-19 disease. The relevant articles were determined from the database search published mainly in Web of Science, Google scholar, PubMed, Crossref, and ClinicalTrials.gov database during the pandemic period. The articles were evaluated for the therapeutic potentials, mechanisms of action of cannabinoids, the roles of the ECS in the immune system, impact of cannabinoids in SARS-CoV-2 septic, especially if they address the application of cannabinoids as drugs for the curability and management of SARSCoV-2 and its novel variants. Although the evidence needed to be considered using cannabinoids in the control and treatment of viral diseases is currently in its infancy, they already offer an opportunity for clinicians due to their effects in relieving pain, improving appetite, and improving childhood epilepsy, especially in cancer and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS) patients. In addition to these, the most recent scientific evidence emphasizes their use in the treatment of the coronavirus infected patients. In brief, all preclinic and clinic studies that have been reported show that, through the cannabinoid system, cannabinoids, particularly CBD, have many mechanisms that are effective in the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, more extensive studies are necessary in this area to fully identify the effects of cannabinoids on SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Death anxiety is a common phenomenon that humans experience. It is multidimensional. There has been an upsurged interest around the discussion on death anxiety across the globe, however, much of the literature focuses on the concept of death anxiety, religiosity, and its role in mental health conditions. Further, studies on death anxiety are scattered and at times disconnected. It is important to review existing literature to get an overview of the current direction in research and understand its relevance to facilitate therapeutic processes. In this scoping review, literature was searched in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and PsychINFO using key words such as "death anxiety", "fear of death", religion", "culture", and "psychopathology" combined with Boolean operators to narrow down the search results. The initial search yielded 614 records, of which 546 records were removed based on title review (363), abstract review (94), and full-text review (89). Finally, 68 articles were appraised, narratively synthesized, and thematically presented. Major themes revealed in the literature were theoretical frameworks of death anxiety, religiosity, universality, psychological effects of death anxiety, psychopathology, and religious coping strategies. There is a need to assess client's death anxiety and address them using religious rituals and coping mechanisms.

AB  - Background Syndemics are characterized by the clustering of two or more health conditions, their adverse interaction, and contextual factors that create the conditions for clustering and/or interaction that worsens health outcomes. Studying syndemics entails drawing on diverse disciplines, including epidemiology and anthropology. This often means collaboration between researchers with different scholarly backgrounds, who share and - ideally - integrate their findings. Objective This article examines how context within syndemics has been defined and studied. Methods A literature review of empirical studies focusing on syndemics involving non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions was conducted and the full text of 13 articles was analyzed. The review was followed-up with semi-structured interviews with 11 expert researchers working in the field. Results The review and interviews highlighted a relatively consistent definition of syndemics. The reviewed studies of NCD-related syndemics tended to focus on micro-level context, suggesting a need to analyze further underlying structural factors. In their syndemics research, respondents described working with other disciplines and, although there were some challenges, welcomed greater disciplinary diversity. Methodological gaps, including a lack of mixed methods and longitudinal studies, were identified, for which further interdisciplinary collaborations would be beneficial. Conclusions NCD-related syndemics research would benefit from further analysis of structural factors and the interconnections between syndemic components across multiple levels, together with more ambitious research designs integrating quantitative and qualitative methods. Research on the COVID-19 pandemic can benefit from a syndemics approach, particularly to understand vulnerability and the unequal impacts of this public health crisis.

AB  - Background Mental health disorders are viewed as a global concern requiring globally led approaches to address them. Since the publication of the 2007 Lancet series on global mental health (GMH), the term has become widespread. Over the last two decades, GMH has become increasingly affiliated with policy reform, academic courses, funding bodies and research. However, it is not always obvious how those working in the field of GMH are using the term, resulting in a lack of clarity. Therefore, work is needed to synthesise the current understanding(s) of GMH to help characterise its meaning. Aim To synthesise the literature and identify the different ways GMH is understood. Method A conceptual review, using a systematic search and a content analysis, was conducted to develop a conceptual framework of the different conceptual understandings of GMH. Results We developed a conceptual framework of four understandings of GMH. These understandings of GMH are as follows: an area of research generating findings to establish a GMH evidence-base; implementation of research into practice; improving the mental health environment; learning from and supporting low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Conclusion Our review proposes a simple framework, clarifying the key characteristics of the GMH landscape. The findings highlight the diversity of usage of the term in the literature, as well as present the wide scope that comprises the field of GMH. Referring to this framework may help those engaged with GMH to be more specific with which aspect of the field they are concerned with.

AB  - Introduction: Existing reviews exploring cannabis effectiveness have numerous limitations including narrow search strategies. We systematically explored cannabis effects on PTSD symptoms, quality of life (QOL), and return to work (RTW). We also investigated harm outcomes such as adverse effects and dropouts due to adverse effects, inefficacy, and all-cause dropout rates. Methods: Our search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and PubMed databases, yielded 1 eligible RCT and 10 observational studies (n = 4672). Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and ROBINS-I. Results: Evidence from the included studies was mainly based on non-randomized studies with no comparators. Results from unpooled, high RoB studies showed that cannabis was associated with a reduction in overall PTSD symptoms and improved QOL. Dry mouth, headaches, and psychoactive effects such as agitation and euphoria were the commonly reported adverse effects. In most studies, cannabis was well tolerated, but small proportions of patients experienced a worsening of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: Evidence in the current study primarily stems from low quality and high RoB observational studies. Further RCTs investigating cannabis effects on PTSD treatment should be conducted with larger sample sizes and explore a broader range of patient-important outcomes.

AB  - Early intervention approaches are built on the premise of preventing disability, burden, and cognitive sequelae caused by bipolar disorder. The objective of this systematic review was to characterise the effectiveness of all the available psychological and pharmacological treatments for early intervention in people at high risk of developing bipolar disorder. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019133420). We did a systematic search to identify studies published in ten databases up to March 27, 2020. Randomised controlled trials and cohort studies that assessed the effect of pharmacological or psychological interventions in people at high risk of developing bipolar disorder were included. Studies of first episodes of mania were excluded. Eligible papers were assessed for quality and data were extracted. The primary outcomes were change in manic and depressive symptoms from baseline to endpoint. Of the 2856 citations retrieved by our search, 16 studies were included; five evaluated pharmacotherapeutic strategies (three randomised controlled trials and two open-label studies), ten assessed psychotherapeutic strategies (four randomised controlled trials and six open-label studies), and one randomised controlled trial assessed combination therapy; these 16 trials included a total of 755 participants at high risk of developing bipolar disorder. Quality assessment indicated fair to good quality for open-label studies, and a high risk of bias in four randomised controlled trials. Among the pharmacotherapeutic interventions, there is preliminary support for the efficacy of aripiprazole in reducing mood symptoms in people at high risk of developing bipolar disorder. Psychological interventions were effective for various outcomes. There was substantial methodological heterogeneity across studies. This systematic review underscores the need for multicentre, prospective, methodologically homogeneous studies evaluating conversion to bipolar disorder as an outcome measure.

AB  - Numerous clinical studies have shown that the serotonergic system also degenerates in patients with Parkinson's disease. The causal role of this impairment in Parkinson's symptomatology and the response to treatment remains to be refined, in particular thanks to approaches allowing the two components DA and 5-HT to be isolated if possible. We have developed a macaque monkey model of Parkinson's disease exhibiting a double lesion (dopaminergic and serotonergic) thanks to the sequential use of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine) (or MDMA prior MPTP). We characterized this monkey model by multimodal imaging (PET, positron emission tomography with several radiotracers; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging), behavioral assessments (parkinsonism, dyskinesia, neuropsychiatric-like behavior) and post-mortem analysis (with DA and 5-HT markers). When administrated after MPTP, MDMA damaged the 5-HT presynaptic system without affecting the remaining DA neurons. The lesion of 5-HT fibers induced by MDMA altered rigidity and prevented dyskinesia and neuropsychiatric-like symptoms induced by levodopa therapy in MPTP-treated animals. Interestingly also, prior MDMA administration aggravates the parkinsonian deficits and associated DA injury. Dystonic postures, action tremor and global spontaneous activities were significantly affected. All together, these data clearly indicate that late or early lesions of the 5-HT system have a differential impact on parkinsonian symptoms in the macaque model of Parkinson's disease. Whether MDMA has an impact on neuropsychiatric-like symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, depression remains to be addressed. Despite its limitations, this toxin-based double-lesioned monkey model takes on its full meaning and provides material for the experimental study of the heterogeneity of patients.

AB  - Purpose: Presentation of the role of the dopaminergic system and microRNAs in the development of depression alter glucocorti-coids (GCs) therapy.
   Views: GCs are steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal glands, and their synthesis is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The secretion of GCs (cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents) is dependent directly on corticotropin, secreted from the pituitary gland and indirectly on the corticotropin-releasing factor, a hormone released from the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Prolonged treatment with GCs disrupts the functions of the HPA axis, impairs the dopaminergic sys-tem, suppresses hippocampal neurogenesis and sensitizes the amygdala, leading to an increased susceptibility to depression. This is an important problem because GCs are commonly prescribed for a broad range of medical conditions, including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The action of GCs may be at least partially regulated by epigenetic mechanisms (microRNAs), in addition to which microRNAs modulate GCs production and cellular response to GCs.
   Conclusions: The administration of GCs may lead to changes in dopaminergic system activity (e.g. D2 receptors activity), which significantly contribute to the predisposition to depression. Additionally, GCs therapy may cause changes in the activity of micro-RNAs (e.g. miR-124), which exacerbates symptoms of depression. Searching for specific changes in microRNA expression will provide clinically practical and easily applicable biomarkers of depression risk and new forms of pharmacotherapy in GC-induced depression.

AB  - With accelerating climate change, US coastal communities are experiencing increased flood risk intensity, resulting from accelerated sea level rise and stronger storms. These conditions place pressure on municipalities and local residents to consider a range of new disaster risk reduction programs, climate resilience initiatives, and in some cases transformative adaptation strategies (e.g., managed retreat and relocation from highly vulnerable, low-elevation locations). Researchers have increasingly understood that these climate risks and adaptation actions have significant impacts on the quality of life, well-being, and mental health of urban coastal residents. We explore these relationships and define conditions under which adaptation practices will affect communities and residents. Specifically, we assess climate and environmental stressors, community change, and well-being by utilizing the growing climate change literature and the parallel social science literature on risk and hazards, environmental psychology, and urban geography work, heretofore not widely integrated into work on climate adaptation.

AB  - Introduction Primary data collection in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is associated with a range of ethical complexities. Considerations on how to adequately ensure the well-being of research staff are largely neglected in contemporary ethics discourse. This systematic review aims to identify the ethical challenges that research staff across different hierarchical levels and scientific disciplines face when conducting research in LMICs. Methods We searched 13 electronic databases and handsearched publications in six selected journals as well as the reference lists of all included studies. No restrictions were applied with respect to the publication date, research design, and target population.
   Results 23 151 studies were retrieved, 183 of which met our inclusion criteria. We identified nine different types of ethical challenges that research staff may be exposed to during field research, including (1) role conflicts that can emerge from participants' help requests and the high level of deprivation found in certain study settings, (2) feelings of guilt and (3) detrimental mental health impacts. Further challenges were (4) sexual harassment (5) safety risks and (6) political repression, particularly in postconflict, disaster-ridden or autocratic study contexts. Additionally, studies reported (7) inadequate working conditions and (8) power imbalances within research teams, while (9) ethics boards were found to be ill equipped to anticipate and address emerging risks, thus increasing the ethical liability of researchers.
   Conclusion This review revealed several complex ethical challenges that research staff may face during data collection. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 8.8 on 'safe and secure working environments' and to protect research staff from harm, amendments must urgently be made to current ethical standards.

AB  - Background: Impulsiveness and compulsiveness, though traditionally assumed to represent the opposite poles of a spectrum, have increasingly been understood to have common, rather than disparate, features.
   Objective: We investigated the influence of the ECS on the intricate interplay between impulsiveness and compulsiveness.
   Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed, Psyhlnfo, and Scopus by using the keywords compulsiveness, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), impulsiveness, Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs), addiction, ECS, serotonin, and dopamine.
   Results: The ECS is famous for its role in motivational processes and reward signaling, contributing to the hedonic effect elicited by pleasurable activities. Impulsiveness involves an inability to delay pleasure; compulsiveness, in contrast, is associated with a postponement of present pleasure due to an increased sense of menace. Impulsiveness and compulsiveness work together to result in addiction. The manipulation of the ECS through pharmacological or genetic methods is effective on the manifestations of OCD, ICDs, and impulsiveness. The ECS is distributed throughout the basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus and interacts with serotonergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neural circuits which are all involved in impulsive and compulsive symptomatology. The ECS or cannabinoids exhibit divergent effects depending on environmental conditions, dose, and duration of exposure. The endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers inhibiting the presynaptic neurons (causing a braking effect) and released "on demand", generating a fine-tuning adjustment of the neural activity.
   Conclusion: How impulsiveness and compulsiveness, two apparently opposite traits, interoperate might be accounted for by the specific functions of the ECS.

KW  - disability prevention
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can result from occupational exposures and poses a considerable burden to workers, their families, workplaces and to society in general.
   OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a rapid review of the literature to answer the question: "Which occupations have exposures that may lead to a PTSD diagnosis?"
   METHODS: A rapid review was conducted in six steps: review question development, literature search, study selection (inclusion/exclusion), study characterization, data extraction, and data synthesis.
   RESULTS: The search identified 3428 unique references which were reviewed to find 16 relevant studies in 23 articles. The articles revealed associations between PTSD and rescue workers (police, firefighters, etc.), health care professionals, transit drivers, and bank employees which seem well supported by the literature. Some studies also suggest potential associations with PTSD and construction and extraction, electricians, manufacturing, installation, maintenance and repair, transportation and material moving, and clerical workers.
   CONCLUSIONS: A rapid review of the peer-reviewed scientific literature of PTSD prevalence or treatment suggests many occupations have exposures that could be associated with PTSD. Occupational traumatic events were most often associated with PTSD diagnosis. More research is needed to better understand the association between occupation and PTSD.

AB  - Given the prevalence of fathers who experience psychological distress during the perinatal period, and the tendency of health care to consider and treat fathers as secondary figures, new attitudes and systems are needed to effectively target this population. The current review sought to investigate and report the voices of fathers of "new" children, specifically their experiences of available support throughout the perinatal period and their support needs. A systematic search was undertaken, and a narrative synthesis was conducted to integrate the experiences of 1,326 fathers across 39 articles. Findings suggest that fathers access support from a variety of sources (formal and informal); experience barriers to engaging with support (unaware and/or inaccessible, excluded and/or belittled, and stigma and/or privacy); and lastly, have various support needs (tailored, flexible, credible, and practical). This research has implications for the attitudes and behavior of health care, the refinement of existing and new interventions, and the direction of future research.

AB  - Suicide is a major public health concern, representing the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, claiming the lives of over 48,000 individuals each year. Globally, estimates of annual suicide deaths reached 817,000 in 2016, with the number of global suicide attempts reaching an estimated 25 million each year. While such staggered rates has prompted countless efforts by researchers and clinicians to identify precursors and establish diagnostic tools, our ability to identify individuals at high risk for suicide and predict the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) has not meaningfully improved, nor has our ability to predict when suicidal behaviors will occur. Accordingly, there remains a need to improve our assessment and prevention of STBs in the short term, as well as develop and validate clinical instruments to aid in this effort. One avenue in which prevention efforts have focused is that of health care, specifically mental health professionals. Indeed, clinician judgement remains one of the most relied upon tools for establishing suicide risk among patients as identifying signs, symptoms, or precipitating events are difficult to accurately distinguish. In this paper, we explore clinician countertransference as a potential indicator of patient STBs, beginning with the history of countertransference through the lens of the psychological field, diving into the different types that can be experienced by clinicians (positive, negative, mixed), and arguing that the presence of a mixed response could hold the keys to future patient suicidal action. While research in the realm is still in nascent stages, these findings present an optimistic avenue through while future energy can be focused to further develop the use of such responses for suicide prevention in the future.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in pathophysiological mechanisms in neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia (SZ), as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). An imbalance or insufficient pro-brain-derived neumtrophic factor (proBDNF) transformation into mature BDNF (mBDNF) is potentially critical to the disease pathogenesis by impairing neuronal plasticity as suggested by results from many studies. Thus, promoting proBDNF transformation into mBDNF is therefore hypothesized as beneficial for the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. ProBDNF is proteolytically cleaved into the mBDNF by intracellular furin/ proprotein convertases and extracellular proteases (plasmin/matrix metallopeptidases). This article reviews the mechanisms of the conversion of proBDNF to mBDNF and the research status of intracellular/extracellular proteolytic proteases for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Objective: To synthesize the literature and develop guidance on supports needed for primary care and perinatal providers in screening, initial management, triage, and bridging treatment for perinatal bipolar disorder.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review by searching six electronic databases using keywords related to perinatal bipolar disorder. We summarized descriptive statistics on settings and extracted information on care approaches. We synthesized the literature on indirect care models and extracted data on screening, follow-up, referrals, and management.
   Results: 1169 articles were retrieved. 51 articles were included after review. Most papers were reviews. Fewer addressed care in obstetric (n = 20, 39%), primary care (n = 10, 20%), and pediatric settings (n = 2, 4%). Most papers (n = 30, 59%) discussed using screening instruments for bipolar disorder. Articles were mixed on recommendations for bipolar disorder screening.
   Conclusions: Varied strategies for structured assessment exist and are influenced by practice setting. There remains uncertainty about optimal strategies for screening and management of perinatal bipolar disorder. We recommend screening for bipolar disorder in the perinatal period in select circumstances (with depression screening, known bipolar disorder risk factors, and prior to starting antidepressants). If specialty mental health care is unavailable, we recommend enhancing usual care through integrated care strategies such as indirect consultation.

AB  - Background: Occupational noise exposure has been identified as a significant risk factor for fish harvesters. Chronic noise exposure causes hearing and other health problems and undermines the quality of life and well-being. This review paper aims to highlight noise-related auditory and non-auditory health effects among fish harvesters.
   Materials and methods:A systematic literature search approach was adopted using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and by exploring grey literature. The literature search was conducted in 2020 (between October 15 and November 30). Relevant articles were explored by reviewing title, keywords, and abstract based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The full-text critical review of selected papers was made and finalized the most relevant studies.
   Results: Initial 1,281 records were identified, exploring various databases and additional sources using relevant keywords. Duplicate articles were removed and retrieved 746 articles. After that, a screening of 746 research papers was done based on the selection criteria and finalised 28 articles for full-text review. Finally, articles were filtered based on the study's aim and extracted 17 papers for the final review.
   Conclusions: Noise-induced hearing loss was considered a significant health risk to fish harvesters across the studies, affecting physical and emotional well-being. The prevalence of hearing loss was observed from 6% to 80%. Other health problems, such as headache, dizziness, annoyance, stress, fatigue, elevated blood pressure, sleep disturbances, and impaired cognitive performance, were also reported. Further research is needed to validate the non-auditory health effects among fish harvesters.

AB  - Objective: The current study used meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis to estimate the effects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on the psychological and physical distress of cancer patients, and to identify potential moderators in this body of research.
   Methods: A search of multiple databases in February 2020 identified 25 independent trials (17 randomized controlled trials, 8 non-randomized controlled trials; 2256 participants) on the effects of ACT among cancer patients. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to determine whether the available evidence is sufficient to draw strong conclusions.
   Results: ACT significantly reduced cancer patients' psychological distress (g=0.88), and improved psychological flexibility (g=0.58), quality of life (g=1.19), and sense of hope (g=2.17). TSA showed that there was sufficient evidence to obtain stable estimates of the effect of ACT on psychological distress and quality of life. Effect sizes for psychological distress were larger in studies conducted in eastern countries, in younger samples, and when therapy was of longer duration.
   Conclusion: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy can effectively improve the mental health of cancer patients, and can be applied to clinical practice as an effective psychological intervention. Researchers are encouraged to take into account stage and trajectory of cancer in future studies.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 4.3% of the global population exhibits symptoms of depression. In Poland, 1.5 million people suffer from this illness. Treatment of depression generates significant costs calculated in billions of zlotys. According to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Problems, depression is characterized by: reduced mood, reduced psychomotor drive, loss of interest (axial symptoms), as well as low self-esteem, pessimistic attitude, weakness of concentration, sleep disorders, and loss of appetite (additional symptoms). The aim of this research was to review and evaluate studies on the impact of sport climbing as a complementary form of treatment on reducing depressive symptoms. This is the first literature review undertaking a collective assessment of studies on this subject. The appropriate studies were selected in a three-stage process. PubMed, ResearchGate and Google Scholar databases were searched. Finally, 4 studies were qualified for the review and then assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool developed by Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences. Analysis of the research gives grounds to consider introducing an additional form of treatment for depression in the form of boulder climbing. The evaluation according to the QUADAS - 2 questionnaire indicates a low possibility of making mistakes in all assessed works.

Of the 401 studies identified, meta-analyses were conducted on 46 effect sizes (Pearson's correlation coefficients) from 19 studies, supplemented by a narrative review. Pooled estimates suggest that better emotion control is associated with increased cortisol concentrations [r = 0.083, 95% CI (0.033, 0.132)]. Emotion recognition or empathy were not significantly associated with cortisol concentrations [r = 0.072, 95% CI (-0.020, 0.165) and r = 0.004, 95% CI (-0.061, 0.068) respectively]. Subgroup analyses showed that the association between emotion control and cortisol concentrations is significant in males, for morning cortisol, when the cortisol data are transformed to correct for skewed distributions, or when participants are instructed to avoid food and drink intake for at least one hour before sample collection. There was no evidence for an association between social cognition with diurnal cortisol slope or cortisol awakening response. More validation work with greater standardization of methodological procedures is required.

AB  - Background: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders in childhood. Recently, several studies showed the high suicide risk of patients with ADHD; however, most of these studies had a cross-sectional design.
   Aims: The aim of the current research is to complete a systematic review of published studies which investigate the suicide risk of ADHD patients with longitudinal design.
   Methods: The systematic search was made on OVID Medline, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search terms were (ADHD OR attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) AND (suicide OR suicidal OR suicidality) AND (follow-up OR longitudinal study OR prospective study). The inclusion criteria were as follows: written in English; the participants were under 18 years at baseline; longitudinal, prospective studies; ADHD population at baseline and at follow-up; and suicide behavior as a primary outcome. The exclusion criteria were as follows: the study did not contain empirical data and reviews/meta-analyses and studies which aimed to investigate the drug treatment efficacy of ADHD.
   Results: After the screening process, 18 papers were included in the systematic review. Ten articles were altogether published in the last 5 years. The range of follow-up periods varied between 2 and 17 years. Several different assessment tools were used to investigate the symptoms and/or the diagnosis of ADHD and the suicidal risk. Nine studies enrolled children aged under 12 at baseline, and three studies used birth cohort data, where there was no strict age-based inclusion criteria. A total of 17 studies found a positive association between ADHD diagnosis at baseline and the presence of suicidal behavior and/or attempts at the follow-up visits.
   Limitations: The main limitation of this review is the methodological heterogeneity of the selected studies. A further limitation is the relatively low number of studies that examined a population with balanced gender ratios. Additionally, only one study published data about the treatment of ADHD. Finally, though we carefully chose the keywords, we still may be missing some relevant papers on this topic.
   Conclusions: In spite of the methodological diversity of the included studies, the results of the current systematic review highlight the importance of screening suicidality in the long term in patients with ADHD. Therefore, further studies that compare the suicidal risk of treated and untreated groups of ADHD patients in the long term are needed.

AB  - Background: Firefighters, paramedics, specialized nurses working in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), Operating Rooms (OR), and Emergency Rooms (ER), police officers and military personnel are more frequently exposed to potentially traumatic events than the general population; they are considered high-risk professionals. To reduce the risk of traumatization it is of great importance to be embedded in a social environment with supportive relationships.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review (based on the PRISMA-Guidelines) looking for social connections within the environment in which high-risk professionals are embedded (work, home, community), to obtain evidence on the impact of these connections on the risk of traumatization. Additionally, we aim to identify relevant supportive relationships in the professionals' environments. We identified the relevant scientific literature by searching, without time, and language restriction, five electronic bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, CINAHL, and Web of Science. These databases were last searched in January 2019.
   Results: A qualitative analysis of the 89 eligible (out of 9,047 screened) studies shows that for firefighters, paramedics, and emergency nurses social connections in their work environment are predominantly supportive relationships and may protect them against traumatization. In other occupations (OR-nurses, ICU-nurses, police officers), however, social connections at work are not only a source of support but are also a source of stress. For military personnel study results are inconclusive as to whether their social connections at work or at home support them against traumatization. In so far as connections are supportive, their sources vary greatly from one occupational group to another; they differ between work vs. home as well as within work between peers vs. supervisor.
   Conclusions: Being embedded in a social environment, i.e., having social connections, is important but not always sufficient to protect high-risk professionals against traumatization. For, while these connections may be the antecedents of supportive relationships, they can also be the antecedents of damaging relationships. Additionally, the sources of supportive relationships differ among groups. This suggests that knowledge of how the social structures of the occupational groups differ may increase our understanding of the impact of social connections and relationships, including socialization, on the risk of traumatization of high-risk professionals.

AB  - Introduction: Parental cognitions may directly and indirectly contribute to infant sleep outcomes. This review provides a systematic up-to-date overview of the associations between parental cognitions and infant sleep problems with special emphasis on temporal relationships and the content of parental cognitions.
   Methods: A systematic literature research in PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection sensu Liberati and PRISMA guidelines was carried out in March 2020 using the search terms (parent* AND infant* AND sleep* problem*), including studies with correlational or control group designs investigating associations between parental cognitions and sleep problems in children aged 1-6 years.
   Results: Twenty-three studies (published from 1985 to 2016) met inclusion criteria, of which 14 reported group differences or associations between parental sleep-related cognitions and child sleep outcomes. Nine papers additionally reported on the role of general parental child-related cognitions not directly pertaining to sleep. Findings from longitudinal studies suggest that parental cognitions often preceded child sleep problems. Cognitions pertaining to difficulties with limit-setting were especially prevalent in parents of poor sleepers and were positively associated with both subjective and objective measures of child sleep outcomes.
   Conclusions: Parental cognitions appear to play a pivotal role for the development and maintenance of sleep problems in young children, arguing that parents' attitudes and beliefs regarding child sleep inadvertently prompts parental behavior toward adverse sleep in offspring. Associations are however based on maternal reports and small to moderate effect sizes. Thus, additional parental factors such as mental health or self-efficacy, as well as additional offspring factors including temperamental dispositions and regulatory abilities, require consideration in further studies.

AB  - Background Individual subjective well-being (SWB) is essential for creating and maintaining healthy, productive societies. The literature on SWB is vast and dispersed across multiple disciplines. However, few reviews have summarized the theoretical and empirical tenets of SWB literature across disciplinary boundaries. Methods We cataloged and consolidated SWB-related theories and empirical evidence from the fields of psychology and public health using a combination of online catalogs of scholarly articles and online search engines to retrieve relevant articles. For both theories and determinants/correlates of SWB, PubMed, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar were used to obtain relevant articles. Articles for the review were screened for relevance, varied perspectives, journal impact, geographic location of study, and topicality. A core theme of SWB empirical literature was the identification of SWB determinants/correlates, and over 100 research articles were reviewed and summarized for this review. Results We found that SWB theories can be classified into four groups: fulfillment and engagement theories, personal orientation theories, evaluative theories, and emotional theories. A critical analysis of the conflicts and overlaps between these theories reveals the lack of a coherent theoretical and methodological framework that would make empirical research systematically comparable. We found that determinants/correlates of SWB can be grouped into seven broad categories: basic demographics, socioeconomic status, health and functioning, personality, social support, religion and culture, and geography and infrastructure. However, these are rarely studied consistently or used to test theories. Conclusions The lack of a clear, unifying theoretical basis for categorizing and comparing empirical studies can potentially be overcome using an operationalizable criterion that focuses on the dimension of SWB studied, measure of SWB used, design of the study, study population, and types of determinants and correlates. From our review of the empirical literature on SWB, we found that the seven categories of determinants/correlates identified may potentially be used to improve the link between theory and empirical research, and that the overlap in the determinant/correlates as they relate to multiple theory categories may enable us to test theories in unison. However, doing so in the future would require a conscious effort by researchers in several areas, which are discussed.

AB  - Background Postnatal depression is among the common mental health problems that occur during the postnatal period. However, it is left undiagnosed in low- and middle-income countries including Ethiopia. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to systematically summarize the available evidence on the epidemiology of postnatal depression in Ethiopia and suggest recommendations for future clinical practice. Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases for the relevant articles that assessed the prevalence of postnatal depression in Ethiopia. We used a random-effect model to conduct a meta-analysis. We conducted a subgroup and sensitivity analysis to explore the source of heterogeneity. Cochrane Q- and the I-2-test were used to check the heterogeneity of the included studies. The presence of publication bias was also checked by visual inspection of symmetry and Egger's test. Results The pooled estimated prevalence of postnatal depression in Ethiopia was 20.1% (95% CI 12.7-30.2). The pooled prevalence of postnatal depression in the studies that were conducted in community settings and used the Patient Health Questionnaire to assess postnatal depression [16.6% (95% CI 8.90-28.99)] was lower than the prevalence in studies based in institutions and that used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [23.2% (95% CI 14.50-28.5)]. Further, in a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis the prevalence of postnatal depression ranges between 15.4% and 25.4%. Unplanned pregnancy [AOR = 3.46, 95% CI (2.37-5.04)], age between 15-24 years [AOR = 1.72, 95% CI (1.11-2.68)], marital problems [AOR = 3.07, 95% CI (2.36-3.99)], experiencing the death of infant [AOR = 3.41, 95% CI (1.91-6.09)] and history of substance use [AOR = 3.47, 95% CI (2.17-5.56)] were associated with the increased odds of postnatal depression in Ethiopia. Conclusion The prevalence of postnatal depression in Ethiopia was high. Therefore, the concerned body should give due attention to improve reproductive health services through early detection of risk factors of postnatal depression.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to explore whether engaging with arts and culture affect depression in adults. This is because depression is the most common mental health disorder. Diversification of mental health services, initiatives in arts in health and social prescribing are providing emerging evidence of benefits relating to depression outcomes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A systematic review design adhering to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting guidelines. MEDLINE (R), Embase and American psychology association PsycINFO were searched and six studies were deemed eligible. Data extraction and quality appraisal enabled a narrative descriptive summary comparing study design, characteristics, populations and key results relating arts and cultural engagement to depression outcomes.
   Findings
   The total number of participants across the studies were 49,197. Three studies reported mean age, 58.78 years (15-99 years). Gender reported by five studies was 52.4% (n = 24,689) female and 47.6% (n = 22,439) male. Five studies found that engaging with arts decreased your odds of having depression.
   Originality/value
   This systematic review found emerging evidence that arts and cultural engagement benefits a wider population by reducing depression incidence. Establishing and understanding the association between arts engagement and decreasing depression incidence in a population is relevant to health-care providers, the general population and policymakers alike.

AB  - Introduction Perinatal depression is a widely discussed mental illness that occurs not only in women, but also in men. A previous international meta-analysis of the prevalence of paternal perinatal depression suggested that cross-cultural variables or socioeconomic environment may influence paternal depression. However, it is not clear that these data are general enough to apply to Japanese men, and there are few review articles about perinatal depression among this demographic. The purpose of our study is to provide a reliable estimate of the prevalence of perinatal depression among Japanese men. Method We searched two databases, PubMed and ICHUSHI, to identify studies with data on the prevalence of prenatal or postpartum depression among Japanese men. Data were extracted from reports published from January 1994 to June 2018. The period prevalence of paternal perinatal depression among Japanese men was investigated. A subgroup analysis of gender differences in perinatal depression was also performed. Results We reviewed 1,379 abstracts, retrieved 33 articles and ultimately included 15 studies. The period prevalence of paternal prenatal depression in men was 8.5% (95% CI 3.3-20.3%). Moreover, the period prevalence of postpartum depression in men was 9.7% (95% CI 7.4-12.8%) within the first month, 8.6% (95% CI 5.5-13.3%) in postpartum months 1-3, 13.2% (95% CI 11.6-15.0%) in postpartum months 3-6 and 8.2% (95% CI 1.3-38.0%) in postpartum months 6-12. We also found that the prevalence of prenatal depression was significantly lower in men than in women. However, the prevalence of postpartum depression was not significantly different between men and women. Conclusions The prevalence of perinatal depression among Japanese men peaked at 3-6 months after birth, and its overall prevalence was approximately 10%. These results were similar to those of an international meta-analysis on perinatal depression. Notably, we found that the prevalence of postpartum depression was as high in men as it was in women. Therefore, it is suggested that healthcare workers should be more watchful for paternal perinatal depression in the postpartum period than in the prenatal period.

AB  - How important is the influence of spatial acoustics on our mental processes related to sound perception and cognition? There is a large body of research in fields encompassing architecture, musicology, and psychology that analyzes human response, both subjective and objective, to different soundscapes. But what if we want to understand how acoustic environments influenced the human experience of sound in sacred ritual practices in premodern societies? Archaeoacoustics is the research field that investigates sound in the past. One of its branches delves into how sound was used in specific landscapes and at sites with rock art, and why past societies endowed a special significance to places with specific acoustical properties. Taking advantage of the advances made in sound recording and reproduction technologies, researchers are now exploring how ancient social and sacred ceremonies and practices related to the acoustic properties of their sound environment. Here, we advocate for the emergence of a new and innovative discipline, experimental psychoarchaeoacoustics. We also review underlying methodological approaches and discuss the limitations, challenges, and future directions for this new field.

AB  - Background
   There is growing interest in new factors contributing to the genesis of eating disorders (EDs). Research recently focused on the study of microbiota. Dysbiosis, associated with a specific genetic susceptibility, may contribute to the development of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder, and several putative mechanisms have already been identified. Diet seems to have an impact not only on modification of the gut microbiota, facilitating dysbiosis, but also on its recovery in patients with EDs.
   Methods
   This systematic review based on the PICO strategy searching into PubMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and Cochrane Library examined the literature on the role of altered microbiota in the pathogenesis and treatment of EDs.
   Results
   Sixteen studies were included, mostly regarding AN. Alpha diversity and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels were lower in patients with AN, and affective symptoms and ED psychopathology seem related to changes in gut microbiota. Microbiota-derived proteins stimulated the autoimmune system, altering neuroendocrine control of mood and satiety in EDs. Microbial richness increased in AN after weight regain on fecal microbiota transplantation.
   Conclusions
   Microbiota homeostasis seems essential for a healthy communication network between gut and brain. Dysbiosis may promote intestinal inflammation, alter gut permeability, and trigger immune reactions in the hunger/satiety regulation center contributing to the pathophysiological development of EDs. A restored microbial balance may be a possible treatment target for EDs. A better and more in-depth characterization of gut microbiota and gut-brain crosstalk is required. Future studies may deepen the therapeutic and preventive role of microbiota in EDs.

AB  - Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) results from an external force to the head or body causing neurophysiological changes within the brain. The number and severity of symptoms can vary, with some individuals experiencing rapid recovery, and others having persistent symptoms for months to years, impacting their quality of life. Current rehabilitation is limited in its ability to treat persistent symptoms and novel approaches are being sought to improve outcomes following mTBI. Neuromodulation is one technique used to encourage adaptive neuroplasticity within the brain.
   Objective: To systematically review the literature on the efficacy of neuromodulation in the mTBI population.
   Method: A systematic review was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and EBM Review. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis reporting guidelines were used and a narrative review of the selected studies was completed. Fourteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria which were published in English, investigating an adult sample and using a pre- and post-intervention design. Studies were excluded if they included non-mild TBI severities, pediatric or older adult populations.
   Results: Thirteen of fourteen studies reported positive reductions in mTBI symptomatology following neuromodulation. Specifically, improvements were reported in post-concussion symptom ratings, headaches, dizziness, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, general disability, cognition, return to work and quality of life. Normalization of working memory activation patterns, vestibular field potentials, hemodynamics of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and excessive delta wave activity were also seen. The studies reviewed had several methodological limitations including small, heterogenous samples and varied intervention protocols, limiting generalisability. Further research is required to understand the context in which neuromodulation may be beneficial.
   Conclusions: While these positive effects are observed, limitations included unequal representation of neuromodulation modalities in the literature, and lack of literature describing the efficacy of neuromodulation on the development or duration of persistent mTBI symptoms. Better clarity regarding neuromodulation efficacy could have a significant impact on mTBI patients, researchers, clinicians, and policy makers, facilitating a more productive post-mTBI population. Despite the limitations, the literature indicates that neuromodulation warrants further investigation. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020161279.

AB  - This article discusses how the Generic Model of Psychotherapy (Orlinsky and Howard, 1987) can help to organize the psychotherapy research and the knowledge in the field of psychotherapy for sexual and gender minority patients. The structure that this traditional model provides is a good foundation for research in this field, inasmuch as it stresses macrosocial aspects that determine the provision of psychotherapy and contextualize its outcomes. Each one of the main components offered by the Generic Model of Psychotherapy - Determinants, Processes, and Consequences - are specified for psychotherapy with LGBT patients and are illustrated with a selection of already existing research in the field of sexual minorities; they are also stress areas marked by knowledge gaps that require future developments. In addition, a set of questions are proposed to contribute to new studies, including the clinical implications that can be derived from this model.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to focus on management-led intervention strategies aimed at achieving stable mental well-being among academic staff in higher education institutions (HEIs) by reviewing and synthesising existing literature on varying intervention strategies to managing workplace stress and improving mental health.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Twenty-two peer-reviewed articles were identified through databases (PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Business source complete, Academic search complete) and the application of the PRISMA guideline. A quality check was carried out on the selected articles, and a data extraction table was developed to aid the discussion.
   Findings
   Although the awareness of mental health is a global issue, there was minimal research evidence in managing stress and mental health among academic staff in HEIs through increased university management involvement. Most HEIs were more focused on corporatisation and student satisfaction while unconsciously neglecting its impact on the well-being of academic staff even though universities' management portray staff welfare as priority.
   Research limitations/implications
   There is limited information measuring the outcome of various management-led mental well-being strategies in HEIs. Further research applying more robust study design rather beyond self-reported questionnaires and similar study designs is needed in this area.
   Practical implications
   Establishing routine mental health assessment, effective communication, continuous promotion of existing and available support is imminent to improve the mental well-being of academic staff by HEIs management.
   Originality/value
   This is the first systematic review that describes and synthesises the various mental health triggers, including workplace stressors, that affect academic staff in higher education institutions (HEIs) and summarises various possible management intervention strategies.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious mental disorder that represents a substantial public health problem. Several trials have been undertaken to investigate the role of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) in the treatment of MDD, but the conclusions were controversial. To examine the efficacy and safety of BTX-A vs. placebo on patients with a clinical diagnosis of MDD, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted for all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed and Web of Science from inception to June 17, 2020. All published studies that investigated the efficacy and safety of BTX-A injections on patients with a clinical diagnosis of MDD were included. The overall effect size was summarized using a random-effects meta-analysis model. The primary outcomes of the present meta-analysis were the changes in depressive rating scale at week 6 after BTX-A injection compared with placebo. The safety of BTX-A injections also was assessed.
   Results: Five RCTs with a total of 417 participants (189 patients in the BTX-A group, 228 patients in placebo group) were eligible in this meta-analysis. The results indicated an overall positive effect of BTX-A injections for reducing the depressive symptoms of patients with MDD (Hedges' g, -0.82; 95% CI, -1.38 to -0.27) with large effect size. Differences are likely explained by the dose of BTX-As and the gender of the participants. Our findings also highlighted that BTX-A injections were generally well-tolerated, with only mild and temporary adverse events reported.
   Conclusions: The present meta-analysis provides evidence that BTX-A injections are associated with a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms. BTX-A injections are generally safe and may provide a new, alternative option for the treatment of depression.

AB  - This paper provides a broad critical review of the research that examined the emotional factors such as learners' attitudes, motivation, language anxiety, autonomy, and self-esteem in the context of learning English as a foreign language (EFL) in Saudi Arabia over a period of 20 years (2000-2020). The aim of this critical review is to answer some questions relating to identifying the most common themes of research efforts in this area, the strengths, and weaknesses among it; and to explain how such efforts have contributed to the development of English language learning/teaching within the Saudi context. The study is significant in that the findings identified some issues with thematic orientation in Saudi EFL emotion research-particularly regarding under- and over-explored topics due to an element of randomness in how research topics related to EFL emotions are often selected and explored, with some topic areas receiving excessive attention and others receiving little or no attention. Some issues related to research design and methodology were also acknowledged and assessed. The study suggests that it is useful to develop ways to coordinate and streamline future research on EFL emotions in Saudi Arabia and to work towards developing new research protocols that investigate the practicalities of language learning emotions in real learning situations.

AB  - Context: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most prominent cause of disabilityworldwide. For the treatment of CLBP, Mindfulness-based Interventions (MBIs) such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), mindfulness meditation (MM) are often used; however, their exact effect on pain intensity has not yet been determined for these people.
   Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of MBIs on pain intensity in people with CLBP.
   Data Sources: In this systematic review, all of the randomized controlled trials available on PubMed, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library Google Scholar, Scopus, and ProQuest databases from 2 014 to 2020 were reviewed. This study is also the first review article in the field of chronic low back pain that reviews the databases of Google Scholar, Irandoc, and SID in Persian.
   Study Selection: Studies were included if they were: (1) RCT; (2) had patients with chronic low back pain; (3) made a comparison between MBIs and a passive comparator (usual care) or an active comparator (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or health education); (4) examined pain intensity.
   Results: In the initial search, we found 297 trials in total databases. After removing duplicates and applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 9 RCT (totaling 959 patients) with CLBP were included for this systematic review.
   Conclusions: MBIs are effective solutions for coping with CLBP, and their effects are maintained for a long time. No significant difference was found between the effectiveness of these treatments and CBT treatment on pain intensity of patients with CLBP.

AB  - Objectives: Among all known risk factors of preterm birth, psychosocial factors form an intricate collection, which includes a multidimensional spectrum of interrelated mediating mechanisms. The understanding of these interconnected mechanisms is vital for designing targeted interventions to reduce preterm births. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate potential psychosocial maternal factors and their interactions to cause preterm birth.
   Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Medline, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for U. S.-based English language studies published between 1989 and 2019. Titles, abstracts, and full-texts were screened to determine eligibility for inclusion. Data were extracted from eligible studies using a customized data collection form. The National Institutes of Health assessment tool was utilized for quality assessment.
   Results: Among the 76 full texts that were reviewed, 9 records met the eligibility criteria, and were included in the final review. The included publications addressed psychosocial factors including racial disparity, lifetime racism, neighborhood disadvantage, lack of partner support, childhood maltreatment and life-course variations, including homelessness and marital status. Antenatal stress was identified as a common mechanism through which psychosocial mediators may act to cause preterm birth.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the need for controlling potential risk factors of maternal stress by improving prenatal care, providing proper housing, and establishing conducive social environments for pregnant women. The review also suggests the importance of maternal psychological counselling and extensive maternal health monitoring among minority groups during the pregnancy period.

Consequently, we selected five studies to conduct a systematic review The Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields was used for conducting a quality assessment on the selected literature.
   Results: The results of the quality assessment showed that the score ranged from 11 to 24 points: one strong, one good, two adequate, and one limited. When the meta-mean was compared before and after grief intervention, the effect size of the random-effect model was 0.31 (95% CI: -0.07, 0.69) showed 'intermediate effect', but the confidence interval was not significant.
   Conclusion: The grief intervention for dementia caregivers revealed a moderate effect but it was not significant. In order to prove the effectiveness of grief intervention for dementia caregivers, a meta-analysis targeting RCT studies is needed.

We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Six databases were searched according to search terms set a priori. Empirical studies of any design were included if they provided data on participation in, or benefits of, parkrun and were in English. Two authors conducted the searches independently and screened results by title and abstract, followed by full text reviews. A total of 235 records were screened and 15 studies were eligible; 12 were conducted in the UK and three in Australia. Seven were qualitative interview studies, six were quantitative, and two used mixed methods. parkrun reaches groups traditionally underrepresented in other organised sports or physical activity such as women, the insufficiently active and those aged over 35 years. Participants showed sustained improvements in fitness, physical activity levels, and body mass index with a dose-response effect with participation frequency. Qualitative data shows parkrun's location in pleasant environments with opportunities for informal social interaction engages priority groups such as individuals with mental health issues, women and children. The small evidence base suggests parkrun has good reach, and can positively impact participants' health and wellbeing. The data, however, are currently UK-centric and gaps in research on non-participants, long term health impacts and operationally relevant factors should be addressed.

AB  - Introduction: Allostatic load refers to the cumulative burden of chronic stress and life events. It involves the interaction of different physiological systems at varying degrees of activity. When environmental challenges exceed the individual ability to cope, then allostatic overload ensues. Allostatic load is identified by the use of biomarkers and clinical criteria. Objective: To summarize the current knowledge on allostatic load and overload and its clinical implications based on a systematic review of the literature. Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to December 2019. A manual search of the literature was also performed, and reference lists of the retrieved articles were examined.We considered only studies in which allostatic load or overload were adequately described and assessed in either clinical or non-clinical adult populations. Results: A total of 267 original investigations were included. They encompassed general population studies, as well as clinical studies on consequences of allostatic load/overload on both physical and mental health across a variety of settings. Conclusions: The findings indicate that allostatic load and overload are associated with poorer health outcomes. Assessment of allostatic load provides support to the understanding of psychosocial determinants of health and lifestyle medicine. An integrated approach that includes both biological markers and clinimetric criteria is recommended.

AB  - A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to determine the overall prevalence of depression among farming populations globally, and explore any heterogeneity present. Eligible studies were primary research articles published in English, which involved the collection of data for the purpose of determining the prevalence of depression among a farming population. Four relevant databases were searched in January 2019. Potential for bias was assessed using a modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. From 7662 records, 72 articles were deemed relevant and had data extracted. Of these, 45 utilized the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Revised scale (CES-D/DR) to quantify depression, 42 of which were conducted in the United States (U.S.). As a result, meta-analyses were restricted to this geographic location. Substantial heterogeneity was seen in the initial whole-group analysis (I-2 = 97%), and while sub-group exploration suggested a significantly higher prevalence of depression among migrant farm workers (26%, 95% CI = 21-31%) than in studies examining a non-migrant farming population (12%, 95% CI = 8-17%), substantial heterogeneity remained (I-2 = 96%), indicating that the majority of between study variation was due to factors other than sampling error. Additionally, the majority of studies (81%) in migrant farm worker populations were published since 2010, while only 21% of studies in non-migrant farming populations were published in this timeframe. It is possible with recent efforts to de-stigmatize mental illness, participants in more recent studies may be more likely to self-report depressive symptoms. Hence, while it appears that migrant farmworker populations may have an elevated prevalence of depression, it is also apparent that little research in the U.S. has been done to evaluate depression among non-migrant farming populations in recent years. Perhaps a reporting bias may account for some of the difference between the two populations. A research gap also appears to exist in estimating the prevalence of depression among farming populations outside of the US. Assessment for bias at the study level revealed challenges in reporting of key study design elements, as well as potential for selection bias in the majority of studies.

   Methods: Adult studies were identified through systematic searches of 8 bibliographic databases run in August 2020 including Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO. No language or year limits were applied.
   Results: Of 848 records identified, 516 were selected with seven studies evaluating the CSM mediating pathways for final review (n = 918 adult participants). Consistent with the CSM, illness perceptions were associated with PD and QoL in six and five studies respectively. Illness perceptions acted as mediators, at least partially, on the relationship between IBD disease activity and PD and/or QoL in all seven studies. Coping styles, predominantly maladaptive-based coping styles, were found to act as mediators between illness perceptions and PD and/or QoL in five studies. Perceived stress was identified in one study as an additional psychosocial process that partially explained the positive influence of illness perceptions on PD, and a negative impact on QoL. Five studies were classified as high quality and two as moderate.
   Conclusions: The CSM can be utilised in IBD cohorts to evaluate key psychosocial processes that influence PROs. Future research should explore additional psychosocial processes within the CSM and evaluate the efficacy of targeting CSM processes to promote psychological well-being and QoL in IBD cohorts.

AB  - Background: Disasters have many health consequences such as suicide ideation as one of the relatively common psychological consequences after natural disasters, especially earthquakes. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of post-earthquake suicidal ideation in affected people.
   Methods: Related keywords of this systematic review and meta-analysis in English and their Persian equivalents were searched in the data resources including Google Scholar, SID, Magiran, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science from Jan 2014 to May 2019. The STROBE checklist was used to evaluate the quality of the articles. The I-2 index was used to determine the heterogeneity and the random-effects model was used in meta-analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted in the STATA software version 14.
   Results: Overall, 14347 subjects including 6662 males and 7715 females with the mean age of 23.88 +/- 15.81yr old were assessed. The prevalence of post-earthquake suicidal ideation was 20.34% (95% CI: 13.60-27.08, P<0.001, I-2 =99.1). The prevalence of suicidal ideation showed a decreasing trend based on the year of the study and the duration of post-earthquake follow-up.
   Conclusion: Although the prevalence of post-earthquake suicidal ideation showed a decreasing trend, the probability of incidence of these thoughts in the long-term is still noticeable. Therefore, implementing a surveillance system is recommended to monitor the mental health status of earthquakes survivors for the possibility of suicidal thoughts in the short and long term recovery phase.

AB  - Background: Exposure to transportation noise is hypothesized to contribute to anxiety, but consistent associations have not been established.
   Objective: To provide a comprehensive synthesis of the literature by examining associations between traffic-related noise (i.e., road traffic noise, railway noise, aircraft noise and mixed traffic noise) and anxiety.
   Methods: We systematically searched Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and PsycINFO for English-language observational studies published up to February 2020 reporting on the traffic noise-anxiety association. We appraised the risk of bias using an assessment tool and the quality of evidence following established guidelines. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed for pooled and separated traffic-related noise sources.
   Results: Of the 3575 studies identified, 11 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 9 studies were appropriate for meta-analysis. For the pooled overall effect size between transport noise and anxiety, we found 9% higher odds of anxiety associated with a 10 dB(A) increase in day-evening-night noise level (L-den), with moderate heterogeneity (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: [0.97; 1.23], I-2 = 70%). The association was more likely to be significant with more severe anxiety (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: [1.01; 1.15], I-2 = 48%). Sub-group analysis revealed that the effects of different noise sources on anxiety were inconsistent and insignificant. The quality of evidence was rated as very low to low.
   Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis of an association between traffic noise and more severe anxiety. More high-quality studies are needed to confirm associations between different noise types and anxiety, as well as to better understand underlying mechanisms.

AB  - This study aims to summarize and systematically review the efficacy and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for women with peripartum depression (PPD). Several databases (Wanfang, CNKI, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsyINFO, Web of Science, and Clinical trial) were searched from inception until April 12, 2020. In total, ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. We calculated the combined effect size (standardized mean difference [SMD] and odds ratio [OR]) for the corresponding effects models. The aggregated result of 10 trials indicated a significant benefit of rTMS on PPD, and the aggregated result of remission showed significantly positive effects of Test group VS. Control group. In terms of treatment adverse effects, the aggregated result showed no statistical significance of headache and dry mouth between the two groups. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that rTMS is an effective and safe intervention for PPD. Owing to poor methodological quality among the included studies, high-quality multicenter RCTs are needed to further verify the effects of this treatment.

AB  - Aquatic pollution is one of the greatest environmental problems, and therefore its control represents one of the major challenges in this century. In recent years, proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for searching protein biomarkers in the field of pollution biomonitoring. For biomonitoring marine contamination, there is a consensus that bivalves are preferred organisms to assess organic and inorganic pollutants. Thus, the bivalve proteome was intensively studied, particularly the mussel. It is well documented that heavy metal pollution and organic chemicals altered the structural proteins causing degradation of tissues of molluscs. Also, it is well known that proteins involved in stress oxidative such as glutathione and enzymes as catalase, superoxide dismutase or peroxisomes are overexpressed in response to contaminants. Additionally, using bivalves, other groups of proteins proposed as pollution biomarkers are the metabolic proteins. Even though other marine species are used to monitor the pollution, the presence of proteomic tools in these studies is scarce. Concerning freshwater pollution field, a great variety of animal species (fish and crustaceans) are used as biomonitors in proteomics studies compared to plants that are scarcely analysed. In fish species, proteins involved in stress oxidative such as heat shock family or proteins from lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were proposed as candidate biomarkers. On the contrary, for crustaceans there is a lack of proteomic studies individually assessing the contaminants. Novel scenarios, including emerging contaminants and new threats, will require proteomic technology for a systematic search of protein biomarkers and a greater knowledge at molecular level of those cellular pathways induced by contamination.

AB  - Background: Poor adherence to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is associated with low rates of smoking cessation. Hence, this study aims to identify and map patient-related factors associated with adherence to NRT using the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behaviour (COM-B) model. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching five databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) and grey literature on 30 August 2020. Data were extracted, thematically analysed, and mapped to the COM-B model. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool was utilised to assess the quality of studies. Results: A total of 2929 citations were screened, and 26 articles with a total of 13,429 participants included. Thirty-one factors were identified and mapped to COM-B model: psychological capability (forgetfulness, education), physical capability (level of nicotine dependence, withdrawal symptoms), reflective motivation (perception about NRT and quitting), automatic motivation (alcohol use, stress, depression), physical opportunity (cost), and social opportunity (social support). The most prominent element associated with adherence was reflective motivation followed by physical capability and automatic motivation. Conclusions: Multiple personal, social, and environmental factors affect NRT adherence. Hence, it is recommended to implement a multifaceted behavioural intervention incorporating factors categorised under the COM-B model, which is the hub of the behaviour change wheel (BCW) to improve adherence and quitting.

AB  - Nowadays, different kinds of nanoparticles (NPs) are produced around the world and used in many fields and products. NPs can enter the body and aggregate in the various organs including brain. They can damage neurons, in particular dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatal neurons which their lesion is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). So, NPs can have a role in PD induction along with other agents and factors. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world, and in patients, its symptoms progressively worsen day by day through different pathways including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, alpha-synuclein increasing and aggregation, apoptosis and reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for PD. So, prevention of this disease is very important. On the other hand, without having sufficient information about PD inducers, prevention of this disease would not be possible. Therefore, we need to have sufficient information about things we contact with them in daily life. Since, NPs are widely used in different products especially in consumer products, and they can enter to the brain easily, in this review the toxicity effects of metal and metal oxide NPs have been evaluated in molecular and cellular levels to determine potential of different kinds of NPs in development of PD.

AB  - Purpose of Review Military cultural competence has been recognized as an important factor to delivering effective care to service members, who are a distinct population with unique exposures, and thus with different clinical implications-though only recently has the military service been recognized as a cultural identity that can impact treatment (Meyer et al. Curr Psychiatry Rep. 18:26:1-8, 2016). Competencies within this field do not share a universal definition but have been recognized by the Center for Deployment Psychology (CDP) to include four key components: (1) military ethos, (2) organization and roles, (3) military stressors and resources, and (4) treatment, resources, and tools (Atuel & Castro Clin Soc Work J. 46:74-82, 2018). This article summarizes research literature published in the last 6 years addressing common features and health needs of military families with the goal of improving military cultural competence. This includes recognizing that (a) The military carries its own culture as evidenced by its particular traditions, beliefs, language, and set of guiding principles (Sanghera Optom Educ J Assoc Sch Coll Optom. 42:8-16, 2017) and (b) military families-defined in this paper as active duty service members, their spouses, their children, and civilian warfighters in the form of National Guard and Reservists (NG/R)-face unique stressors as they access health care either in military treatment facilities (MTFs) or in civilian settings. Given the broad and unshared definition of military cultural competence, the CDP's framework for understanding military culture helped shape the focus of our review into literature addressing military stressors and resources, with a particular interest on the impact of deployment, reintegration after deployment, interfamily relationships strained by military service, mental health concerns related to military families, and the vulnerabilities of civilian warfighters. Recent Findings A 2018 demographics profile revealed there were 1.3 million active duty service members, with 605,677 spouses and 981,871 children (Department of Defense, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Community Family Policy (ODASD (MC&FP)). 2018). Concerningly, military families exhibit above-average mental health issues-defined in this review to include increased susceptibility to mental health diagnoses and hospitalizations, worse academic achievement in their children, and higher rates of child maltreatment-and challenges related to military service such as frequent relocations and deployments, geographic isolation from social/support network, financial stressors, worries about infidelity, sexual trauma, and child maltreatment. The military has been described as the most engrossing and demanding institution in American society. Our review shows that military families exhibit above-average mental health issues, thought to be related, at least in part, to the challenges of frequent relocations and deployments. The implications for this are broad, given that 8% of the USA has served in the military, and a third is directly related to a service member (Meyer et al. Curr Psychiatry Rep. 18:26:1-8, 2016) This article describes unique challenges military families face and their impact on the service member, their spouse, and their children.

AB  - Searching for biomarkers has been a chief pursuit of the field of psychiatry. Toward this end, studies have catalogued candidate resting-state biomarkers in nearly all forms of mental disorder. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that these biomarkers lack specificity, limiting their capacity to yield clinical impact. We discuss three avenues of research that are overcoming this limitation: (i) the adoption of transdiagnostic research designs, which involve studying and explicitly comparing multiple disorders from distinct diagnostic axes of psychiatry; (ii) dimensional models of psychopathology that map the full spectrum of symptomatology and that cut across traditional disorder boundaries; and (iii) modeling individuals' unique functional connectomes throughout development. We provide a framework for tying these subfields together that draws on tools from machine learning and network science.

AB  - BackgroundEvidence mapping is a structured approach used to synthesize the state-of-the-art in an emerging field of research when systematic reviews or meta-analyses are deemed inappropriate. We employed this strategy to summarise knowledge regarding longitudinal ecological monitoring of rest-activity rhythms (RAR) and disease modifiers, course of illness, treatment response or outcome in bipolar disorders (BD).StructureWe had two key aims: (1) to determine the number and type of actigraphy studies of in BD that explored data regarding: outcome over time (e.g. relapse/recurrence according to polarity, or recovery/remission), treatment response or illness trajectories and (2) to examine the range of actigraphy metrics that can be used to estimate disruptions of RAR and describe which individual circadian rhythm or sleep-wake cycle parameters are most consistently associated with outcome over time in BD. The mapping process incorporated four steps: clarifying the project focus, describing boundaries and 'coordinates' for mapping, searching the literature and producing a brief synopsis with summary charts of the key outputs. Twenty-seven independent studies (reported in 29 publications) were eligible for inclusion in the map. Most were small-scale, with the median sample size being 15 per study and median duration of actigraphy being about 7 days (range 1-210). Interestingly, 17 studies comprised wholly or partly of inpatients (63%). The available evidence indicated that a discrete number of RAR metrics are more consistently associated with transition between different phases of BD and/or may be predictive of longitudinal course of illness or treatment response. The metrics that show the most frequent associations represent markers of the amount, timing, or variability of RAR rather than the sleep quality metrics that are frequently targeted in contemporary studies of BD.ConclusionsDespite 50 years of research, use of actigraphy to assess RAR in longitudinal studies and examination of these metrics and treatment response, course and outcome of BD is under-investigated. This is in marked contrast to the extensive literature on case-control or cross-sectional studies of actigraphy, especially typical sleep analysis metrics in BD. However, given the encouraging findings on putative RAR markers, we recommend increased study of putative circadian phenotypes of BD.

AB  - The neuroimaging community has witnessed a paradigm shift in biomarker discovery from using traditional univariate brain mapping approaches to multivariate predictive models, allowing the field to move toward a translational neuroscience era. Regression-based multivariate models (hereafter "predictive modeling") provide a powerful and widely used approach to predict human behavior with neuroimaging features. These studies maintain a focus on decoding individual differences in a continuously behavioral phenotype from neuroimaging data, opening up an exciting opportunity to describe the human brain at the single-subject level. In this survey, we provide an overview of recent studies that utilize machine learning approaches to identify neuroimaging predictors over the past decade. We first review regression-based approaches and highlight connectome-based predictive modeling, which has grown in popularity in recent years. Next, we systematically describe recent representative studies using these tools in the context of cognitive function, symptom severity, personality traits, and emotion processing. Finally, we highlight a few challenges related to combining multimodal data, longitudinal prediction, external validations, and the employment of deep learning methods that have emerged from our review of the existing literature, as well as present some promising and challenging future directions.

AB  - Objective:
   The Maternal Mental Health in Canada, 2018/2019, survey reported that 18% of 7,085 mothers who recently gave birth reported "feelings consistent with postpartum depression" based on scores >= 7 on a 5-item version of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS-5). The EPDS-5 was designed as a screening questionnaire, not to classify disorders or estimate prevalence; the extent to which EPDS-5 results reflect depression prevalence is unknown. We investigated EPDS-5 >= 7 performance relative to major depression prevalence based on a validated diagnostic interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID).
   Methods:
   We searched Medline, Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, and the Web of Science Core Collection through June 2016 for studies with data sets with item response data to calculate EPDS-5 scores and that used the SCID to ascertain depression status. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis to estimate pooled percentage of EPDS-5 >= 7, pooled SCID major depression prevalence, and the pooled difference in prevalence.
   Results:
   A total of 3,958 participants from 19 primary studies were included. Pooled prevalence of SCID major depression was 9.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0% to 13.7%), pooled percentage of participants with EPDS-5 >= 7 was 16.2% (95% CI 10.7% to 23.8%), and pooled difference was 8.0% (95% CI 2.9% to 13.2%). In the 19 included studies, mean and median ratios of EPDS-5 to SCID prevalence were 2.1 and 1.4 times.
   Conclusions:
   Prevalence estimated based on EPDS-5 >= 7 appears to be substantially higher than the prevalence of major depression. Validated diagnostic interviews should be used to establish prevalence.

AB  - Aim Health literacy is one's ability to use cognitive and social skills to access, understand and appraise health information. Despite poor health outcomes of people living with mental illness there is limited research assessing their health literacy. This systematic review aims to synthesise research on health literacy rates, conceptualizations, and outcomes of people living with mental illness, including substance use disorders. This will provide insights into how health literacy might be targeted to reduce these health inequities.
   Methods A search of published literature in multiple databases up until February 2019 was conducted. One reviewer screened the titles, abstracts and keywords of identified publications and the eligibility of all full-text publications were assessed for inclusion along with a second reviewer. Both reviewers independently rated the quality of the included studies.
   Results Fourteen studies were included in the review. Rates and measures of health literacy varied. Low health literacy and health literacy weaknesses were identified. There is a lack of research on the relationship between health literacy and other outcomes, particularly health service engagement.
   Conclusion The review highlights the high rates of low health literacy within this population compared with general populations. Most studies used a functional health literacy measure, despite its limitations, with only a few using multidimensional measures. Overall, there is limited research examining the impact that this populations health literacy has on their recovery and how it affects them over time. The review emphasizes the importance of practitioners assessing and targeting health literacy needs when working with this population.

AB  - Objective: This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture in improving cognitive impairment of post-stroke patients.
   Design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of acupuncture compared with no treatment or sham acupuncture on post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) before December 2019 were identified from databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid library, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Chinese Periodical Database, Wanfang Database, and SinoMed). The literature searching and data extracting were independently performed by two investigators. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Meta-analyses were performed for the eligible RCTs with Revman 5.3 software.
   Results: Thirty-seven RCTs (2,869 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. Merged Random-effects estimates of the gain of MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) or MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were calculated for the comparison of acupuncture with no acupuncture or sham acupuncture. Following 2-8 weeks of intervention with acupuncture, pooled results demonstrated significant effects of acupuncture in improving PSCI assessed by MMSE (MD [95% CI] = 2.88 [2.09, 3.66], p < 0.00001) or MoCA (MD [95% CI] = 2.66 [1.95, 3.37], p < 0.00001).
   Conclusion: The results suggest that acupuncture was effective in improving PSCI and supported the needs of more rigorous design with large-scale randomized clinical trials to determine its therapeutic benefits.

AB  - Parental reflective functioning (PRF) is an important predictor of infant attachment, and interventions that target parent-infant/toddler dyads who are experiencing significant problems have the potential to improve PRF. A range of dyadic interventions have been developed over the past two decades, some of which explicitly target PRF as part of their theory of change, and some that do not explicitly target PRF, but that have measured it as an outcome. However, no meta-analytic review of the impact of these interventions has been carried out to date. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of dyadic interventions targeting parents of infant and toddlers, in improving PRF and a number of secondary outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in which key electronic databases were searched up to October 2018. Eligible studies were identified and data extracted. Data were synthesised using meta-analysis and expressed as both effect sizes and risk ratios. Six studies were identified providing a total of 521 participants. The results of six meta-analyses showed a nonsignificant moderate improvement in PRF in the intervention group (standardised mean difference [SMD]: -0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.97, 0.04]) and a significant reduction in disorganised attachment (risk ratio: 0.50; 95% CI [0.27, 0.90]). There was no evidence for intervention effects on attachment security (odds ratio: 0.71; 95% CI [0.19, 2.64]), parent-infant interaction (SMD: -0.10; 95% CI [-0.46, 0.26]), parental depression (SMD: -1.55; 95% CI [-3.74, 0.64]) or parental global distress (SMD: -0.19, 95% CI [-3.04, 22.65]). There were insufficient data to conduct subgroup analysis (i.e. to compare the effectiveness of mentalisation-based treatment with non-mentalization-based treatment interventions). Relational early interventions may have important benefits in improving PRF and reducing the prevalence of attachment disorganisation. The implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - Background Growing literature continues to identify brain regions that are functionally altered in bipolar disorder. However, precise functional network correlates of bipolar disorder have yet to be determined due to inconsistent results. The overview of neurological alterations from a large-scale network perspective may provide more comprehensive results and elucidate the neuropathology of bipolar disorder. Here, we critically review recent neuroimaging research on bipolar disorder using a network-based approach.
   Methods A systematic search was conducted on studies published from 2009 through 2019 in PubMed and Google Scholar. Articles that utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging technique to examine altered functional activity of major regions belonging to a large-scale brain network in bipolar disorder were selected.
   Results A total of 49 studies were reviewed. Within-network hypoconnectivity was reported in bipolar disorder at rest among the default mode, salience, and central executive networks. In contrast, when performing a cognitive task, hyperconnectivity among the central executive network was found. Internetwork functional connectivity in the brain of bipolar disorder was greater between the salience and default mode networks, while reduced between the salience and central executive networks at rest, compared to control.
   Conclusion This systematic review suggests disruption in the functional activity of large-scale brain networks at rest as well as during a task stimuli in bipolar disorder. Disrupted intra- and internetwork functional connectivity that are also associated with clinical symptoms suggest altered functional connectivity of and between large-scale networks plays an important role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.

Over the past two decades, neuroimaging developments have helped to advance the field, particularly the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractographic reconstruction of white-matter pathways. In this article, we review translational considerations and how DTI and tractography have been used to improve targeting during DBS surgery for depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

AB  - Some post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients do not benefit from imaginal exposure therapy. One possible approach to reach such patients are virtual trauma interventions. Herein, a qualitative scoping review was conducted. Different types of virtual trauma exposure interventions were identified. For each type of virtual trauma exposure interventions it was examined in detail: (1) which in sensu trauma exposure approach serves as therapeutic framework, how it was transferred into virtual reality, and if it was manualized; (2) which hardware and software were used; (3) whether the influence of spatial and social presence on the efficacy of virtual trauma interventions have been measured, and (4) whether the efficacy of virtual trauma interventions for PTSD patients having imagination difficulties was evaluated. These research questions were analyzed qualitatively. Accordingly, an extensive literature search was conducted using the databases Web of Science, PsycINFO, LIVIVO, PTSDpubs, and PubMed for scientific articles published between January 2013 and July 2020. Only studies aimed to reduce PTSD symptoms using virtual trauma interventions were included. The literature search was not limited to a specific study design, treatment/intervention method, or a minimum sample size. Eighteen studies were identified, which reported three different virtual trauma intervention approaches, namely, virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), multi-modular motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR), and action-centered exposure therapy (ACET). Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs), two pilot studies, and one case study were focused on VRET; while two RCTs, one pilot study, and three case studies focused on 3MDR, and two case studies on ACET. Regarding the first research question (1), the results show that VRET is based on prolonged exposure, aiming for a virtual re-creation of the patient's traumatic recounting. Several treatment protocols exist for VRET. 3MDR is based on eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, aiming to reduce the patient's avoidance behavior. In 3MDR patients walk toward individualized trauma-related symbolic images in a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE). One treatment protocol exists for 3MDR. ACET is based on the inhibitory learning theory, aiming for active interactions with a virtual trauma-associated environment to alter the anxiety structure through new secondary inhibitory learning. One treatment protocol exists for ACET. For the second research question (2), the results indicate that all VRET studies used head-mounted displays (HMDs) with a virtual version of the Iraq/Afghanistan or the World Trade Center attacks, while 3MDR studies utilized two different versions of a CAVE with personalized trauma-related images, and the ACET studies used HMDs with virtual street scenarios. For the third research question (3), the results demonstrate that the influence of spatial or social presence on the efficacy of virtual trauma interventions was not examined in any of the included studies. Similarly, for the fourth research question (4), the results show that empirical evidence for the efficacy of virtual trauma interventions on PTSD patients having imagination difficulties was lacking. Therefore, such empirical studies are needed to fill these research gaps.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve subjective well-being (SWB), including evaluative, hedonic, and eudemonic well-being, and the mental component of quality of life (QOL) of working population.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted, using PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES. Eligible studies included those that were RCTs of any intervention, conducted among healthy workers, measured SWB as a primary outcome, and original articles in English. Study characteristics, intervention, outcomes, and results on SWB outcomes were extracted by the investigators independently. After a brief narrative summarizing and classifying the contents of the interventions, the included outcomes were categorized into each aspect of SWB (evaluative, hedonic, and eudemonic well-being, and the mental component of QOL). Finally, the characteristics of the effective interventions for increasing each aspect were summarized, and the pooled effect of interventions on SWB was investigated by a meta-analysis. Publication bias was investigated by drawing a funnel plot and conducting Egger's test.
   Results: From the 5,450 articles found, 39 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The interventions included in this review were classified into six categories (physical activity, ergonomics, psychological, environmental, multicomponent intervention, and others). The meta-analysis from 31 studies showed that the pooled effect of included interventions on SWB was significantly positive (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.51; standard error (SE) = 0.10). A funnel plot showed there were extremely large or small SMDs, and Egger's test was significant. Thus, we conducted sensitivity analysis, excluding these extreme SMDs, and confirmed that the estimated pooled effect was also significantly positive. Subgroup analyses for separate types of interventions showed the effects of psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) were also significantly positive.
   Conclusion: The current study revealed the effectiveness of interventions for increasing SWB. Specifically, psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) may be useful for improving SWB.

AB  - Frailty is an age-related dynamic status, characterized by a reduced resistance to stressors due to the cumulative decline of multiple physiological systems. Several researches have highlighted a relationship between physical frailty and cognitive decline; however, the role of specific cognitive domains has not been deeply clarified yet. Current studies have hypothesized that physical frailty and neuropsychological deficits may share systemic inflammation and increased oxidative stress in different neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, the role of the executive dysfunction should be investigated in a more detailed way using a multidimensional approach. With this aim, we conducted a review of the literature on the few experimental articles published to discuss the existence of a relationship between frailty and cognitive impairment in neurocognitive disorders, particularly focusing on the domain of executive dysfunction. The data suggest that physical frailty and cognitive decline, especially executive dysfunction, are two aspects strongly linked in mild and major neurocognitive disorders due to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In light of this, a new framework linking aging, cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative diseases is needed. In order to analyze the effects that aging processes have on neural decline and neurocognitive disease, and to identify relevant groups of users and patients, future longitudinal studies should adopt a multidimensional approach, in the field of primary prevention and in the continuum from mild to major neurocognitive disorder.

AB  - BackgroundPeer support is being introduced into mental health services internationally, often in response to workforce policy. Earlier systematic reviews incorporate different modalities of peer support (i.e. group and one-to-one), offer inconsistent evidence of effectiveness, and also indicate substantial heterogeneity and issues of quality in the evidence base at that time. An updated review, focussed on one-to-one peer support, is timely given current policy interest. This study aims to systematically review evidence for the effectiveness of one-to-one peer support interventions for adults using mental health services, and to explore heterogeneity in peer support interventions.MethodWe searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane databases from inception until 13 June 2019. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias, and meta-analyses conducted where multiple trials provided usable data.ResultsTwenty-three studies reporting nineteen trials were eligible, providing data from 3329 participants. While seven trials were of low to moderate risk of bias, incomplete reporting of data in many studies suggested bias in the evidence base. Peer support interventions included peer workers in paraclinical roles (e.g. case manager), providing structured behavioural interventions, or more flexible support for recovery.Meta-analyses were conducted for eleven outcomes, with evidence that one-to-one peer support may have a modest positive impact on self-reported recovery and empowerment. There was no impact on clinical symptoms or service use. Analyses of heterogeneity suggest that peer support might improve social network support.ConclusionsOne-to-one peer support in mental health services might impact positively on psychosocial outcomes, but is unlikely to improve clinical outcomes. In order to better inform the introduction of peer support into mental health services, improvement of the evidence base requires complete reporting of outcome data, selection of outcomes that relate to intervention mechanisms, exploration of heterogeneity in the implementation of peer support and focused reviews of specific types of one-to-one peer support.Trial registrationProspero identifier: CRD42015025621.

AB  - Flow is a state of full task absorption, accompanied with a strong drive and low levels of self-referential thinking. Flow is likely when there is a match between a person's skills and the task challenge. Despite its relevance for human performance and the vast body of research on flow, there is currently still relatively little insight in its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. In this paper, we discuss a set of large brain networks that may be involved in establishing the core dimensions of flow. We propose that dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems mediate the intrinsic motivation and activate mood states that are typical for flow. The interaction between three large-scale attentional networks, namely the Default Mode Network, Central Executive Network and the Salience Network is proposed to play a role in the strong task engagement, low self-referential thinking, feedback and feelings of control in flow. The proposed relationships between flow and the brain networks may support the generation of new hypotheses and can guide future research in this field.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the published randomized controlled trials (RCT) of non-pharmacological interventions systematically and to synthesize the evidence of these interventions for the management of anxiety and depression in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
   Background: Anxiety and depression are common symptoms in adults with IBD and can have many negative outcomes on their quality of life (QOL). Non-pharmacological interventions for anxiety and depression are important to improve the adaptive strategies of adults with IBD. Previously published reviews of non-pharmacological interventions to mitigate anxiety and depression in those with IBD have resulted in inconclusive evidence. This review is aimed to fill that gap.
   Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Method: Using a PRISMA diagram, English-language RCT published were searched using combined keywords of inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, randomized controlled trial, anxiety, and depression. The Cochrane risk of bias tool is utilized to assess the methodological quality of each study. A meta-analysis of RCTs was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software.
   Results: The final review included 10 studies. The overall risk of bias of the selected studies varied from low risk in three studies, some concerns in four of the studies, and high risk of bias in three of the studies. Interventions included cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, breath-body- mind -workshop, guided imagery with relaxation, solution-focused therapy, yoga, and multicomponent interventions. The pooled evidence from all non-pharmacological interventions showed that these interventions significantly helped to reduce anxiety, depression, and disease specific quality of life (QOL) in adults with IBD compared to control groups. However, the effect sizes are small. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was -0.28 (95% CI [-0.47, -0.09], p = 0.004) for anxiety, -0.22 (95% CI [-0.41, -0.03], p = 0.025) for depression and 0.20 (95% CI [0.004, 0.39], p = 0.046) for disease specific QOL.
   Conclusion: The addressed non-pharmacological interventions were multifaceted and demonstrated positive effects on anxiety and depression, and QOL in those with IBD. Healthcare providers can facilitate a discussion with adults with IBD about the availability of these interventions to mitigate their anxiety and depression and to improve their QOL.

AB  - Traditional physical activities have numerous physiological and psychosocial benefits for Indigenous youth around the world. Little is known about the positive health and wellness impacts of traditional physical activity experiences on Indigenous youths. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the holistic health and wellness impacts of traditional physical activities on Indigenous youth from certain North American and Oceania geographic areas. A systematic search of four electronic databases (PubMed, ERIC, Scopus and Web of Science) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications of qualitative research exploring the diverse health experiences of traditional physical activities for Indigenous youth in Canada, the United States of America, New Zealand and Australia. A qualitative synthesis of studies between 2006 and 2018 were included, and findings were synthesized using an integrated Indigenous-ecological model, which broadly captures health and wellness impacts under intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community and policy level outcomes using medicine wheel teachings. In total, nine studies were identified via this search. Overall, the literature described numerous emotional, mental and spiritual benefits of traditional physical activity, and youth experiences were affected by familial and communal relationships, and systemic factors. Among Indigenous youth, this research shows the importance of including traditional physical activity in future programs and partnerships with community expertise.

AB  - The current body of knowledge on the prevalence rate of psychiatric morbidity among adolescents and youth within the juvenile justice system in sub-Saharan Africa is yet to be systematically synthesized.. Consequently, African literature in the field has remained obscure, out of consideration in global discourses around the subject.; and incoherent to policy-makers. The situation has also hampered the identification of and filling of regional research-gaps in the field. The aim of this study, therefore, was to conduct a systematic scoping review of available data on psychiatric morbidity among adolescents and youth within the juvenile justice system in subSaharan Africa. The search was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct, EMBASE, CINAHL and Psych Info. Additional searches were done in Google Scholar and African Journal Online (AJOL) databases. Twenty-six studies from 21 different research projects were identified. More than two-thirds were conducted in Nigeria and published within the last decade. Similar to what has been established around the world, the prevalence rate of psychiatric disorder was often very high, with a range of 59.7% 63.0% among respondents. Key strengths of identified studies included use of standardized clinician-administered instruments for assessment and exploration of a wide range of psychiatric disorders. The main weaknesses in the studies included male gender-bias, lack of normative comparison groups, emphasis on custodial settings with little data on non-custodial systems, and considerable length of time-lag between the points of incarceration and psychiatric evaluation among the samples studied.. The study concluded that a modest number of studies have been conducted on psychiatric morbidity among justice-involved adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, but there are still significant research gaps which could be bridged in order to aid context-appropriate interventions.

AB  - Neuroplasticity is an area of expanding interest in psychiatry. Plasticity and metaplasticity are processes contributing to the scaling up and down of neuronal connections, and they are involved with changes in learning, memory, mood, and sleep. Effective mood treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are reputed to work via changes in neuronal circuitry. This article explores the interrelatedness of sleep, plasticity, and rTMS treatment. A PubMed-based literature review was conducted to identify all available studies examining the relationship of rTMS, plasticity, and sleep. Key words used in this search included "TMS," "transcranial magnetic stimulation," "plasticity," "metaplasticity," "sleep," and "insomnia." Depressed mood tends to be associated with impaired neural plasticity, while antidepressant treatments can augment neural plasticity. rTMS impacts plasticity, yielding long-lasting effects, with differing impacts on the waking and sleeping brain. Higher quality sleep promotes plasticity and learning. Reports on the sleep impact of high-frequency and low-frequency rTMS are mixed. The efficacy of rTMS may rely on brain plasticity manipulation, enhanced via the stimulation of neural circuits. Total sleep time and sleep continuity are sleep qualities that are likely necessary but insufficient for the homeostatic plasticity driven by slow-wave sleep. Understanding the relationship between sleep and rTMS treatment is likely critical to enhancing outcomes.

AB  - Background: Alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are common in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). Nevertheless, these alterations are not found in every patient. There is evidence to indicate a possible mediating role of early life stress (ELS) in the relation between dysfunction of the HPA axis and MDD. We conducted a systematic review to understand if the alterations of the HPA axis commonly found in patients with MDD are due to early life stress or are caused by the disorder itself. Methods: The review was conducted by following the PRISMA guidelines. Original articles were found in PubMed and via a manual search. Only studies whose design allowed comparison of the HPA functioning in the 4 groups no-MDD/no-ELS, MDD/no-ELS, no-MDD/ELS, and MDD/ELS were included. Results: Hyperactivity or hypoactivity of the HPA axis was found in 8 articles. A greater number of abnormalities and a higher rate of posttraumatic stress disorder comorbidity were found in the MDD/ELS group. Dysfunction of the HPA axis was also found in the no-MDD/ELS groups. Conclusion: HPA dysfunction found in MDD seems to be more related to the presence of ELS rather than to the MDD itself. Future studies are needed to clarify the exact mechanisms involved.

KW  - DEPRESSION
AB  - Introduction
   Although several systematic reviews (SRs)/meta-analyses (MAs) on the association between specific mental disorders and specific somatic conditions are available, an overarching evidence synthesis across mental disorders and somatic conditions is currently lacking. We will conduct an umbrella review of SRs/MAs to test: 1) the strength of the association between individual mental disorders and individual somatic conditions in children/adolescents and adults; 2) to which extent associations are specific to individual mental and somatic conditions .
   Methods and analysis
   We will search a broad set of electronic databases and contact study authors. We will include SRs with MA or SRs reporting the effect size from individual studies on the association between a number of somatic and mental conditions (as per the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision). We will follow an algorithm to select only one SR or MA when more than one are available on the same association. We will rate the quality of included SRs/MAs using the AMSTAR-2 tool. We will assess to which extent mental disorders are selectively associated with specific somatic conditions or if there are transdiagnostic, across-spectra or diagnostic spectrum-specific associations between mental disorders and somatic conditions based on the Transparent, Reporting, Appraising, Numerating, Showing (TRANSD) recommendations.
   Discussion
   The present umbrella review will shed light on the association between mental health disorders and somatic conditions, providing useful data for the care of patients with mental health disorders, in particular for early detection and intervention. This work might also add insight to the pathophysiology of mental health conditions, and contribute to the current debate on the value of a transdiagnostic approach in psychiatry.

AB  - Objectives: This review aimed to evaluate all the published studies from India conducted in the consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatry setting to identify the diagnostic patterns and referral rates in this setting. Understanding the same can help in organizing the services and knowing the training needs.
   Materials and Methods: A thorough literature search was done in August 2020 using different search engines (PubMed, Medknow, and Google Scholar). This was followed by an individual search of various Indian Psychiatry journals and a hand search of references in the available articles. Only those studies that described patients referred to psychiatry services from various specialties were included.
   Results: A total of 33 studies were selected for the review. More than half of them were published in the last 5 years. Studies have primarily reported psychiatric profile medically ill inpatients referred to CL psychiatry services, with the majority of the studies reporting the number of patients seen for the duration of at least 1 year. The referral rates for inpatients across different institutes have varied from 0.01% to 3.6%. The referral rates from emergency set-ups have varied from 1.42% to 5.4%, and in outpatients, from 0.06% to 7.17%. The most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders across different studies include depression; organic disorders, including delirium; substance use; intentional self-harm; and anxiety disorders.
   Conclusions: A limited number of studies have reported the profile of patients seen in CL psychiatry setups. Available data from these studies suggest that referral rates to psychiatry services from other specialists are dismal. There is an urgent need to change the focus of psychiatry training at both undergraduate and the postgraduate levels to enhance the psychiatric knowledge of physicians to improve psychiatry referrals.

KW  - NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS
AB  - Individual negative symptoms have rarely been examined with regard to their relationship with suicide in schizophrenia, which continues to affect up to 13% of people with the disorder. Symptoms such as blunted affect, which can be an enduring hallmark of schizophrenia, may impact suicide through increasing isolation, leading to poor functional recovery and diminished quality of life. A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD4219143373) was conducted; EMBASE, PsychInfo, and MedLine were searched until January 2020. Eight hundred and fifty-six articles were identified from the data-bases and 2 papers were identified from other resources. Twelve papers met inclusion criteria for the review. Nine out of twelve papers report a positive direct or indirect association between blunted affect and suicide in schizophrenia and three papers showed no association. The majority of included studies suggest that blunted affect may be indirectly related to suicide through risk factors such as emotional withdrawal, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, low self-esteem and negative evaluation. Future studies should include assessment of blunted affect as a potential mediator in the generation of suicidal behaviour in patients with such factors.

AB  - Background
   Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been identified as a potential risk factor for developing dementia. There are currently, however, no meta-analyses quantifying this risk.
   Aims
   To systematically review and quantify the risk of future dementia associated with PTSD across populations. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019130392.
   Method
   We searched nine electronic databases up to 25 October 2019 for longitudinal studies assessing PTSD and risk of dementia. We used random- and fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool estimates across studies.
   Results
   PTSD was associated with a significant risk for all-cause dementia: pooled hazard ratio HR = 1.61 (95% CI 1.43-1.81, I-2 = 85.8%, P < 0.001; n = 1 693 678; 8 studies). Pooled HR was 1.61 (95% CI 1.46-1.78; I-2 = 80.9%, P < 0.001; n = 905 896; 5 studies) in veterans, and 2.11 (95% CI 1.03-4.33, I-2 = 91.2%, P < 0.001; n = 787 782; 3 studies) in the general population. The association between PTSD and dementia remained significant after excluding studies with high risk of bias (HR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.39-1.73, I-2 = 83.9%, P < 0.001; n = 1 684 928; 7 studies). Most studies included were retrospective and there was evidence of high heterogeneity.
   Conclusions
   This is the first meta-analysis quantifying the association of PTSD and risk of dementia showing that PTSD is a strong and potentially modifiable risk factor for all-cause dementia. Future studies investigating potential causal mechanisms, and the protective value of treating PTSD are needed.

AB  - Cortisol can be considered as one biomarker for diagnosis of suicide; nevertheless, several studies have shown conflicting results. This study aimed to evaluate the levels of cortisol in individuals with suicide behavior and controls (healthy or with other psychiatric disorders). Published articles were searched on online databases (PubMed, Scopus and EBSCO). Standardized mean differences (SMD), heterogeneity, publication bias and sen-sitivity were assessed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) statistical software. The meta-analysis comprised 30 studies that provided 1775 cases, and 2162 controls (696 healthy individuals and 1465 individuals with other psychiatric diagnoses). The pooled results revealed that cortisol levels were higher in individuals with suicide behavior (SMD = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.26; 1.57, P = 0.006; I-2 = 88%, Q < 0.001) than healthy controls. However, individuals with suicide behavior showed decreased levels of cortisol in the morning. Additionally, individuals with suicide behavior showed lower levels of cortisol than psychiatric controls (SMD = -1.79, 95% CI = -3.01;-0.58, P = 0.004, I-2 = 89%, Q < 0.001). Morning cortisol levels in individuals with suicide behavior were higher than morning cortisol levels in psychiatric controls. Our updated meta-analysis suggests that peripheral levels of cortisol have a role in suicide behavior.

AB  - The sigma-2 receptor (S2R) complex has been implicated in CNS disorders ranging from anxiety and depression to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proteins comprising the S2R complex impact processes including autophagy, cholesterol synthesis, progesterone signaling, lipid membrane-bound protein trafficking, and receptor stabilization at the cell surface. While there has been much progress in understanding the role of S2R in cellular processes and its potential therapeutic value, a great deal remains unknown. The International Symposium on Sigma-2 Receptors is held in conjunction with the annual Society for Neuroscience (SfN) conference to promote collaboration and advance the field of S2R research. This review summarizes updates presented at the Fourth International Symposium on Sigma-2 Receptors: Role in Health and Disease, a Satellite Symposium held at the 2019 SfN conference. Interdisciplinary members of the S2R research community presented both previously published and preliminary results from ongoing studies of the role of S2R in cellular metabolism, the anatomic and cellular expression patterns of S2R, the relationship between S2R and amyloid beta (A beta) in AD, the role of S2R complex protein PGRMC1 in health and disease, and the efforts to design new S2R ligands for the purposes of research and drug development. The proceedings from this symposium are reported here as an update on the field of S2R research, as well as to highlight the value of the symposia that occur yearly in conjunction with the SfN conference.

AB  - Background: Although the precise pathophysiologies underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has not yet been fully clarified, growing evidence supports the involvement of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of this disorder, with microglia being particular relevance in the pathophysiologic processes.
   Objective: The present review aimed to systematically characterize existing literature regarding the role of microglia mediated neuroinflammation in the etiology of ASD.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted for records indexed within Pubmed, EMBASE, or Web of Science to identify potentially eligible publications. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two authors, and the discrepancies in each step were settled through discussions.
   Results: A total of 14 studies comprising 1007 subjects met the eligibility criteria for this review, including 8 immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies, 5 genetic analysis studies, and 1 positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Although small in quantity, the included studies collectively pointed to a role of microglia mediated neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of ASD.
   Conclusion: Findings generated from this review consistently supported the involvement of neuroinflammation in the development of ASD, confirmed by the activation of microglia in different brain regions, involving increased cell number or cell density, morphological alterations, and phenotypic shifts.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The swine industry has an important interest in becoming more efficient and innovative, fitting with the consumer demand in terms of pork quality, meat pig welfare conditions, and the environmental aspects. This paper deals with the productive (breed, diet, stress) and technological (aging, cooking) factors that affect fresh pork and elaborates the quality of products by using proteomic tools for assessing. These technologies are a relevant approach in the meat science field to decipher the underlying mechanisms and post-mortem changes in the muscle and biofluids proteome of pigs because their study will allow better management of the outcomes such as meat quality variation and defects. In general, these new developments in molecular techniques can help researchers to control and assess this quality through biomarkers. Additionally, as food safety and pork product authentication/adulteration to avoid fraud can be evaluated with these high-throughput proteomic tools, hence they were tackled. Finally, another relevant point addressed focused on the search of bioactive peptides with a beneficial effect on human health from added-value products such as dry-cured ham. Overall, this review describes the current and emerging proteomics studies dealing with raw pork and pork products from the farm to fork.
   The quality assurance of pork meat and products includes the study of factors prior to slaughter such as handling practices, diet and castration, and others during the post-mortem period such as aging, storage, and cooking. The development over the last two decades of high-throughput techniques such as proteomics offer great opportunities to examine the molecular mechanisms and study a priori the proteins in the living pigs and main post-mortem changes and post-translational modifications during the conversion of the muscle into the meat. When the most traditional crossbreeding and rearing strategies to improve pork quality were assessed, the main findings indicate that metabolic pathways early post-mortem were affected. Among the factors, it is well documented that pre-slaughter stress provokes substantial changes in the pork proteome that led to defective meat, and consequently, novel protein biomarkers should be identified and validated. Additionally, modifications in pork proteins had a strong effect on the sensory attributes due to the impact of processing, either physical or chemical. Maillard compounds and protein oxidation should be monitored in order to control proteolysis and volatile compounds. Beyond this, the search of bioactive peptides is becoming a paramount goal of the food and nutraceutical industry. In this regard, peptidomics is a major tool to identify and quantify these peptides with beneficial effects for human health.

AB  - Migrants are at a higher risk for common mental health problems than the general population but are less likely to seek care. To improve access, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the integration of mental health services into primary care. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the types and characteristics of mental health services provided to migrants in primary care following resettlement in high-income countries. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Global Health, and other databases from 1 January 2000 to 15 April 2020. The inclusion criteria consisted of all studies published in English, reporting mental health services and practices for refugee, asylum seeker, or undocumented migrant populations, and were conducted in primary care following resettlement in high-income countries. The search identified 1627 citations and we included 19 studies. The majority of the included studies were conducted in North America. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed technology-assisted mental health screening, and one assessed integrating intensive psychotherapy and case management in primary care. There was a paucity of studies considering gender, children, seniors, and in European settings. More equity-focused research is required to improve primary mental health care in the context of global mental health.

AB  - Tinnitus is a complex and heterogeneous psycho-physiological disorder responsible for causing a phantom ringing or buzzing sound albeit the absence of an external sound source. It has a direct influence on affecting the quality of life of its sufferers. Despite being around for a while, there has not been a cure for tinnitus, and the usual course of action for its treatment involves use of tinnitus retaining and sound therapy, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). One positive aspect about these therapies is that they can be administered face-to-face as well as delivered via internet or smartphone. Smartphones are especially helpful as they are highly personalized devices, and offer a well-established ecosystem of apps, accessible via respective marketplaces of differing mobile platforms. Note that current therapeutic treatments such as CBT have shown to be effective in suppressing the tinnitus symptoms when administered face-to-face, their effectiveness when being delivered using smartphones is not known so far. A quick search on the prominent market places of popular mobile platforms (Android and iOS) yielded roughly 250 smartphone apps offering tinnitus-related therapies and tinnitus management. As this number is expected to steadily increase due to high interest in smartphone app development, a contemporary review of such apps is crucial. In this paper, we aim to review scientific studies validating the smartphone apps, particularly to test their effectiveness in tinnitus management and treatment. We use the PRISMA guidelines for identification of studies on major scientific literature sources and delineate the outcomes of identified studies.

AB  - Human biomonitoring (HBM) studies have demonstrated widespread and daily exposure to bisphenol A (BPA). Moreover, BPA structural analogues (e.g. BPS, BPF, BPAF), used as BPA replacements, are being increasingly detected in human biological matrices. BPA and some of its analogues are classified as endocrine disruptors suspected of contributing to adverse health outcomes such as altered reproduction and neurodevelopment, obesity, and metabolic disorders among other developmental and chronic impairments. One of the aims of the H2020 European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) is the implementation of effect biomarkers at large scales in future HBM studies in a systematic and standardized way, in order to complement exposure data with mechanistically-based biomarkers of early adverse effects. This review aimed to identify and prioritize existing biomarkers of effect for BPA, as well as to provide relevant mechanistic and adverse outcome pathway (AOP) information in order to cover knowledge gaps and better interpret effect biomarker data. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed to identify all the epidemiologic studies published in the last 10 years addressing the potential relationship between bisphenols exposure and alterations in biological parameters. A total of 5716 references were screened, out of which, 119 full-text articles were analyzed and tabulated in detail. This work provides first an overview of all epigenetics, gene transcription, oxidative stress, reproductive, glucocorticoid and thyroid hormones, metabolic and allergy/immune biomarkers previously studied. Then, promising effect biomarkers related to altered neurodevelopmental and reproductive outcomes including brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), kisspeptin (KiSS), and gene expression of nuclear receptors are prioritized, providing mechanistic insights based on in vitro, animal studies and AOP information. Finally, the potential of omics technologies for biomarker discovery and its implications for risk assessment are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to comprehensively identify bisphenol-related biomarkers of effect for HBM purposes.

AB  - Objective: Symptoms of depression are highly prevalent and undertreated in dialysis patients. To aid clinicians in offering treatment to patients with depression, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the treatment of current depressive symptoms in dialysis patients.
   Methods: Nine databases were searched on January 8th 2020 for randomized controlled trials on the treatment of depressive symptoms in dialysis patients. In contradiction to previous reviews, we only included studies who selected patients with a score above a defined cut-off for depressive symptoms and used an inactive control group, to investigate the effectiveness of treatments in currently depressed patients. All interventions aimed to treat depressive symptoms were accepted for inclusion. Standardized mean differences were calculated in a random effect meta-analysis.
   Results: Seventeen studies were included in the systematic review (1640 patients). Nine studies could be included in the meta-analysis. A pooled analysis of 7 studies on psychotherapy showed a standardized mean difference of -0.48 [-0.87; -0.08], with a moderate heterogeneity (I-2 = 52%, chi(2) = 12.56, p = .05). All studies on psychotherapy performed a per protocol analysis and scored high on potential bias. A pooled analysis of two studies on SSRI's showed no statistically significant improvement of depressive symptoms (SMD -0.57 [-6.17; 5.02], I-2 = 71%, chi(2) = 0.2474, p = .06).
   Conclusions: Psychotherapy is a promising treatment for currently depressed dialysis patients, although quality of evidence is low. More evidence is needed regarding the efficacy of SSRI's, exercise therapy and dietary supplements in this population.

AB  - Poor mental health contributes significantly to global morbidity. The evidence regarding physical benefits of running are well-established. However, the mental health impacts of running remain unclear. An overview of the relationship between running and mental health has not been published in the last 30 years. The purpose of this study was to review the literature on the relationship between running and mental health. Our scoping review used combinations of running terms (e.g., Run* and Jog*) and mental health terms (general and condition specific). Databases used were Ovid(Medline), Ovid(Embase), ProQuest and SportDiscus. Quantitative study types reporting on the relationships between running and mental health were included. Database searches identified 16,401 studies; 273 full-texts were analysed with 116 studies included. Overall, studies suggest that running bouts of variable lengths and intensities, and running interventions can improve mood and mental health and that the type of running can lead to differential effects. However, lack of controls and diversity in participant demographics are limitations that need to be addressed. Cross-sectional evidence shows not only a range of associations with mental health but also some associations with adverse mental health (such as exercise addiction). This review identified extensive literature on the relationship between running and mental health.

AB  - This narrative review examined strategies for preparedness and response to mental health impacts of three forms of climate change from a services perspective: (1) acute and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, (2) sub-acute or long-term events such as droughts and heatwaves; and (3) the prospect of long-term and permanent changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and an uninhabitable physical environment. Strategies for acute events included development and implementation of programs and practices for monitoring and treating mental health problems and strengthening individual and community resilience, training of community health workers to deliver services, and conducting inventories of available resources and assessments of at-risk populations. Additional strategies for sub-acute changes included advocacy for mitigation policies and programs and adaptation of guidelines and interventions to address the secondary impacts of sub-acute events, such as threats to livelihood, health and well-being, population displacement, environmental degradation, and civil conflict. Strategies for long-lasting changes included the implementation of evidence-based risk communication interventions that address the existing and potential threat of climate change, promoting the mental health benefits of environmental conservation, and promoting psychological growth and resilience.

AB  - Objective: The majority of original studies showed that unintended pregnancy is related to adverse obstetric outcomes, however, up to now, the influence of unintended pregnancy on the risk of developing postpartum depression (PPD) remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the association between unintended pregnancy and the risk of developing PPD by conducting a meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies.
   Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched up to December 31, 2019 to identify relevant studies evaluating the association between unintended pregnancy and PPD. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan software and Stata software. Potential heterogeneity source was explored by subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and potential publication bias was tested using Begg's funnel plots and Begg's linear regression test.
   Results: A total of thirty studies involving 65,454 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Overall, women who get pregnant unintendedly compared with those who are intending to be pregnant were at a significantly higher risk of developing PPD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-1.74; P < 0.00001).
   Conclusions: Unintended pregnancy is significantly associated with the risk of developing PPD. These findings highlight the necessity of screening for pregnancy intention and integrating family planning and personalized mental health services into primary healthcare to promote maternal mental health.

AB  - Problems with interpersonal relationships are often a chief complaint among those seeking psychiatric treatment; yet heterogeneity and homogeneity across disorders suggests both common and unique mechanisms of impaired interpersonal relationships. Basic science research has begun yielding insights into how the brain responds to social feedback. Understanding how these processes differ as a function of psychopathology can begin to inform the mechanisms that give rise to such interpersonal dysfunction, potentially helping to identify differential treatment targets. We reviewed 46 studies that measured the relationship between brain responses to social feedback and internalizing psychopathology. We found that socially relevant anxiety was associated with amygdala hyperactivity to the anticipation of social feedback. Depression was related to hyperreactivity of regions in the cingulo-opercular network to negative social feedback. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) was associated with hyperactivity of regions in the default mode network to negative social feedback. The review also identified key insights into methodological limitations and potential future directions for the field.

AB  - Background: In recent years, studies and reviews have reported the therapeutic benefits of both mindful and non-mindful exercises in reducing anxiety. However, there have not been any systematic reviews to compare their relative effectiveness for therapeutic application, especially among the non-clinical population. Thus, the aim of this review is to compare the effectiveness between mindful and non-mindful exercise on treating anxiety among non-clinical samples. Methods: Potential articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Academic Search Premier, and PsycInfo. Randomized controlled trials, which involved both mindful and non-mindful exercises as intervention, and the use of anxiety outcome measures were included. Results: Twenty-four studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in our systematic review. In addition, 14 studies provided sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis. For studies that reported significant group differences at post-assessment, results showed that mindful exercise was more beneficial in reducing anxiety than non-mindful exercise. The meta-analysis reported that yoga was more effective in reducing anxiety than non-mindful exercise. Conclusions: Compared to non-mindful exercise, yoga is shown to be more effective in alleviating anxiety symptoms. It is recommended that yoga could be used as a primary healthcare intervention to help the public reduce anxiety.

AB  - Background: In involuntary psychiatric admission, used globally, professionals or caretakers decide upon hospitalization regardless of what the person with psychosocial disabilities decides. This raises clinical, ethical, legal, and human rights concerns, and it goes against Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). CRPD mandates that member states respect the autonomy of people with disabilities. Through Article 12, it recognizes full enjoyment of legal capacity for persons with disabilities. Implementation of Article 12 is challenging in every country, and exploring all the stakeholders' experiences at admission decision-making will help us to understand the challenges that the current psychiatry system poses for service users to exercise their autonomy and identify the areas where service users need support to have their rights, will, and preferences respected.
   Aim: To describe the experiences of service users, informal carers, and professionals in involuntary psychiatric admission decision-making and throughout the subsequent involuntary admission. We explored the support that the service users need to have their rights, will, and preferences respected.
   Method: A search of twelve databases in medicine, sociology, and law in Danish, English, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish was conducted in 2017 and 2018, limited to the past 10 years, using terms such as "involuntary," "admission," "mental illness," and "experience". The search identified 682 articles. Four researchers independently reviewed the articles to find those that completed original qualitative or mixed method studies exploring experiences of involuntary psychiatric admission among adults. We added seven publications from the articles' references, contacted experts in the field (no publications were added), and excluded two articles that were in German. Three researchers analyzed the articles' results using Thematic Analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019072874).
   Results: Overall, 37 articles were included from 11 countries; they involved 731 service users, 100 informal carers, and 291 mental health professionals. We identified a lack of communication and a power imbalance among the stakeholders, which was exacerbated by the professionals' attitudes. At admission decision-making, the service users wanted to be heard and wanted to understand the situation. The families felt responsibility for the service users, they were careful not to ruin relationships, and they struggled to obtain support from the mental health system. Professionals believed that threats or harming others should lead to admission regardless of what the service users or their families felt. Professionals sometimes felt that it was not necessary to explain the information to the service users because they would not understand. Professionals were concerned and frustrated with difficulties in coordinating among themselves. During admission, service users struggled with the ward environment and relationship with staff; they most objected to coercion, such as forced medication. Families were frustrated that they were not involved in the treatment planning, especially as the service users moved toward discharge. The professionals often rationalized that coercion was necessary, and they believed that they knew what was best for the service users.
   Conclusions: A lack of communication and a power imbalance among the stakeholders hindered respect for the service users' rights, will, and preferences. This was exacerbated by professionals rationalizing coercion and assuming that service users were incapable of understanding information. Services that encourage communication and overcome power imbalances (e.g. Crisis Plans, Family Group Conferencing) combined with stronger community mental health support will respect service users' rights, will, and preferences and avoid substituted decision-making on issues such as involuntary admission and forced medication.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus, first reported in December 2019 in China, is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic that, at the time of writing (1 November 2020) has infected almost 43 million people and caused the death of more than 1 million people. The spectrum of clinical manifestations observed during COVID-19 infection varies from asymptomatic to critical life-threatening clinical conditions. Emerging evidence shows that COVID-19 affects far more organs than just the respiratory system, including the heart, kidneys, blood vessels, liver, as well as the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). It is also becoming clear that the neurological and psychological disturbances that occur during the acute phase of the infection may persist well beyond the recovery. The aim of this review is to propel further this emerging and relevant field of research related to the pathophysiology of neurological manifestation of COVID-19 infection (Neuro-COVID). We will summarize the PNS and CNS symptoms experienced by people with COVID-19 both during infection and in the recovery phase. Diagnostic and pharmacological findings in this field of study are strongly warranted to address the neurological and psychological symptoms of COVID-19.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent across all stages of Bipolar Disorder. Despite a wealth of research on the neurophysiological features of sleep in this population, progress in this field has been slow. We aimed to review the literature on sleep electroencephalography (EEG) studies in Bipolar Disorder, considering sleep architecture and microstructural oscillatory activity.
   We included a total of 22 studies: six on sleep during manic episodes, seven during depressive episodes, seven in euthymic patients and two in high-risk individuals. The most consistent findings were increased SOL and REM density across all stages of the disorder. Only two studies reported a reduced spindle count during bipolar depression and euthymia, respectively. Although not specific for Bipolar Disorder, SOL and REM density have been repeatedly found to be increased across all stages of illness in this population. Whereas the former reflects a difficulty initiating sleep, the latter can be considered a neurophysiological signature of patients' overall reduced sleep need, independent of illness stage.

KW  - systematic review
KW  - psychiatry
KW  - mobile phone
AB  - Background: Psychiatric disorders often have an onset at an early age, and early identification and intervention help improve prognosis. A fine-grained, unobtrusive, and effective way to monitor symptoms and level of function could help distinguish severe psychiatric health problems from normal behavior and potentially lead to a more efficient use of clinical resources in the current health care system. The use of smartphones to monitor and treat children, adolescents, and young adults with psychiatric disorders has been widely investigated. However, no systematic review concerning smartphone-based monitoring and treatment in this population has been published.
   Objective: This systematic review aims at describing the following 4 features of the eligible studies: (1) monitoring features such as self-assessment and automatically generated data, (2) treatment delivered by the app, (3) adherence to self-monitoring, and (4) results of the individual studies. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search of the PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo databases. We searched for studies that (1) included a smartphone app to collect self-monitoring data, a smartphone app to collect automatically generated smartphone-based data, or a smartphone-based system for treatment; (2) had participants who were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders or received treatment for a psychiatric disorder, which was verified by an external clinician; (3) had participants who were younger than 25 years; and (4) were published in a peer-reviewed journal. This systematic review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The risk of bias in each individual study was systematically assessed.
   Results: A total of 2546 unique studies were identified through literature search; 15 of these fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. These studies covered 8 different diagnostic groups: psychosis, eating disorders, depression, autism, self-harm, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicidal behavior. Smartphone-based self-monitoring was used in all but 1 study, and 11 of them reported on the participants' adherence to self-monitoring. Most studies were feasibility/pilot studies, and all studies on feasibility reported positive attitudes toward the use of smartphones for self-monitoring. In 2 studies, automatically generated data were collected. Three studies were randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of smartphone-based monitoring and treatment, with 2 of these showing a positive treatment effect. In 2 randomized controlled trials, the researchers were blinded for randomization, but the participants were not blinded in any of the studies. All studies were determined to be at high risk of bias in several areas.
   Conclusions: Smartphones hold great potential as a modern, widely available technology platform to help diagnose, monitor, and treat psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. However, a higher level of homogeneity and rigor among studies regarding their methodology and reporting of adherence would facilitate future reviews and meta-analyses.

AB  - Background: The Republic of Liberia recently experienced several events that resulted in wide-ranging societal impacts, including long-term civil war and an outbreak of Ebola. These types of events are linked to higher prevalence of mental disorders and psychosocial distress. As a result, it is likely that there is an increased prevalence of mental health disorders in the population.
   Aim: To assess and review the recent mental health literature in order to provide insight into existing mental health needs and effective or recommended interventions in post-conflict Liberia.
   Setting: Articles included in this study enrolled Liberians living in Liberia.
   Methods: A search of four databases was conducted for studies of any type that assessed mental health in Liberia between 01 January 2003 and 27 March 2019. After reviewing 363 articles, 21 articles were included in the final analysis. Articles were coded to identify common themes and needs.
   Results: The majority of studies used qualitative designs and were conducted in Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia. Common topics included adolescent mental health, intervention and assessment and post-conflict impacts. One article focused on mental health impacts after recovery from Ebola.
   Conclusion: Overall, there is a dearth of mental health literature that focuses on Liberia. This suggests ample opportunity for researchers to investigate mental health needs amongst the Liberian population and effective psychiatric interventions. Existing recommendations often focus on addressing adolescent health needs, including substance use practices. Opportunities for future research particularly related to needs of adult populations and to mental health impacts of Ebola, abound.

AB  - The disease caused by respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) called COVID-19 resulted in a pandemic that has demanded extraordinary physical and mental effort from healthcare workers. This review provides an overview of studies that have explored traumatic stress in healthcare workers and associated factors between January and May 2020. The focus is on the most relevant literature investigating the prevalence of trauma- and stressor-related symptoms. Articles were selected from PubMed and PsycINFO databases using the search terms, "healthcare workers," "COVID-19," and "posttraumatic stress" in different combinations and with various synonyms. Among the seven studies that fulfilled our criteria, five assessed traumatic stress response, one assessed acute stress symptoms, and one focused on vicarious traumatization. Overall, the available findings highlight the presence of trauma-related stress, with a prevalence ranging from 7.4 to 35%, particularly among women, nurses, frontline workers, and in workers who experienced physical symptoms. Future studies should clarify the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers, with particular focus on posttraumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Creatine provides cells with high-energy phosphates for the rapid reconstitution of hydrolyzed adenosine triphosphate. The eponymous creatine transporter (CRT1/SLC6A8) belongs to a family of solute carrier 6 (SLC6) proteins. The key role of CRT1 is to translocate creatine across tissue barriers and into target cells, such as neurons and myocytes. Individuals harboring mutations in the coding sequence of the human CRT1 gene develop creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), one of the pivotal underlying causes of cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome. CTD encompasses an array of clinical manifestations, including severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism, development delay, and motor dysfunction. CTD is characterized by the absence of cerebral creatine, which implies an indispensable role for CRT1 in supplying the brain cells with creatine. CTD-associated variants dramatically reduce or abolish creatine transport activity by CRT1. Many of these are point mutations that are known to trigger folding defects, leading to the retention of encoded CRT1 proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and precluding their delivery to the cell surface. Misfolding of several related SLC6 transporters also gives rise to detrimental pathologic conditions in people; e.g., mutations in the dopamine transporter induce infantile parkinsonism/dystonia, while mutations in the GABA transporter 1 cause treatment-resistant epilepsy. In some cases, folding defects are amenable to rescue by small molecules, known as pharmacological and chemical chaperones, which restore the cell surface expression and transport activity of the previously non-functional proteins. Insights from the recent molecular, animal and human case studies of CTD add toward our understanding of this complex disorder and reveal the wide-ranging effects elicited upon CRT1 dysfunction. This grants novel therapeutic prospects for the treatment of patients afflicted with CTD, e.g., modifying the creatine molecule to facilitate CRT1-independent entry into brain cells, or correcting folding-deficient and loss-of-function CTD variants using pharmacochaperones and/or allosteric modulators. The latter justifies a search for additional compounds with a capacity to correct mutation-specific defects.

AB  - Social stress is ubiquitous in the lives of social animals. While significant research has aimed to understand the specific forms of stress imparted by particular social interactions, less attention has been paid to understanding the behavioral effects and neural underpinnings of stress produced by the presence and magnitude of social interactions. However, in humans and rodents alike, chronically low and chronically high rates of social interaction are associated with a suite of mental health issues, suggesting the need for further research. Here, we review literature examining the behavioral and neurobiological findings associated with changing social density, focusing on research on chronic social isolation and chronic social crowding in rodent models, and synthesize findings in the context of the continuum of social density that can be experienced by social animals. Through this synthesis, we aim to both summarize the state of the field and describe promising avenues for future research that would more clearly define the broad effects of social interaction on the brain and behavior in mammals.

We also discuss the shortcomings of transcranial magnetic stimulation in preclinical studies such as inaccurate positioning, shallow depth of stimulation, and difficulty in elucidating the neural circuit mechanism up- and down-stream of the stimulation target brain region.

AB  - This narrative review describes current and potential future use of polygenic risk scores in psychiatric clinical practice, with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in schizophrenia and depression.
   Importance Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are predictors of the genetic susceptibility to diseases, calculated for individuals as weighted counts of thousands of risk variants in which the risk variants and their weights have been identified in genome-wide association studies. Polygenic risk scores show promise in aiding clinical decision-making in many areas of medical practice. This review evaluates the potential use of PRS in psychiatry. Observations On their own, PRS will never be able to establish or definitively predict a diagnosis of common complex conditions (eg, mental health disorders), because genetic factors only contribute part of the risk and PRS will only ever capture part of the genetic contribution. Combining PRS with other risk factors has potential to improve outcome prediction and aid clinical decision-making (eg, determining follow-up options for individuals seeking help who are at clinical risk of future illness). Prognostication of adverse physical health outcomes or response to treatment in clinical populations are of great interest for psychiatric practice, but data from larger samples are needed to develop and evaluate PRS. Conclusions and Relevance Polygenic risk scores will contribute to risk assessment in clinical psychiatry as it evolves to combine information from molecular, clinical, and lifestyle metrics. The genome-wide genotype data needed to calculate PRS are inexpensive to generate and could become available to psychiatrists as a by-product of practices in other medical specialties. The utility of PRS in clinical psychiatry, as well as ethical issues associated with their use, should be evaluated in the context of realistic expectations of what PRS can and cannot deliver. Clinical psychiatry has lagged behind other fields of health care in its use of new technologies and routine clinical data for research. Now is the time to catch up.

AB  - This narrative review was conducted to synthesize and summarize available up-to-date evidence on current health status, including both non-communicable diseases and infectious diseases, of migrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union countries in the Russian Federation. Epidemiological and sociological studies with one or more determinants of the health, as well as relevant qualitative studies characterizing risk factors, well-being indicators, and lifestyles of migrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union countries in Russia published from 2004 to 2019 in Russian and English languages were included in the review. Despite significant limitations of the available research literature in the field, some patterns in migrants' health in Russia and issues that need to be addressed were identified. In particular, the syndemic epidemics of communicable and non-communicable diseases, additively increasing negative health consequences, including cardiovascular diseases and chronic digestive system diseases, high rates of sexually transmitted infections and HIV, respiratory diseases and a growing percentage of new tuberculosis cases among migrants from the former Soviet Union countries are all of great concern. Possibly, the burden of these co-occurring morbidities is linked to commonly reported issues among this population group, such as poor nutrition and living conditions, high prevalence of unskilled manual labour, non-compliance with sanitary norms, lack of basic vaccinations, lack of basic knowledge about safe sexual practices and risky sexual behaviour, low healthcare seeking behaviour and limited access to health care. Importantly, these findings may urge the government to increase efforts and promote international collaboration in combating the threat of infectious diseases. Additionally, it was found that migrants had higher levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and those who stayed in the receiving country 5 years or more had a higher level of somatic pathology than those whose stay was less than 5 years. In order to ensure an adequate health system response and fulfil the main Universal Health Coverage principle of "leaving no one behind", a robust monitoring system of the health status of refugees and migrants and an integrated legal framework for the standardized and more inclusive routine care for this population in Russia is urgently needed.

AB  - Aim Studies have shown that sleep problems can affect social behavior. This review was conducted to evaluate how reduced sleep duration, sleep quality, and sleep problems can contribute to changes in the social behavior of children and adolescents from scientific evidence on problems regarding the social behavior in children and adolescents derived from sleep problems. Subjects and methods It integrated findings from cross-sectional and cohort studies that assessed the association between sleep duration/quality/problems and social behavior of children and adolescents. PubMed and LILACS databases between January 2011 and March 2016 were searched. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study characteristics and assessed agreement on the selection and quality of the articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies were added from the reference lists. Twenty studies were considered, and ten showed an association between an individual's reduction in number of sleep hours, bedtime, and awakening with worse social behavior (p < 0.001). From seven studies analyzing sleep disorders, four identified a positive association with social behavior. Out of all the studies, one study indicated greater conflict between parents and children and sleep reduction. Conclusion Duration of and problems in sleeping, bedtime, and wakefulness are associated with poorer social behavior, including aggression, anxiety, and depression, among children and adolescents. Although these differences in social behavior are small, a persistent reduction in sleep hours and consequent inadequacy of social behavior in this population may contribute to later illnesses in adulthood.

AB  - Aim Pathways to care are well studied in the First Episode Psychosis field, but less attention has been given to At-Risk Mental States or prodromal psychosis. This is important because accessing appropriate help at the earliest opportunity is likely to improve outcomes, particularly for those who make transition to psychosis. The present systematic review aimed to synthesize the available literature on pathways to care in ARMS or prodromal psychosis, and investigate the barriers and facilitators to receiving care for ARMS. Methods The CINAHL Complete, EMBASE, Medline Complete, PsycINFO and PubMED databases were searched. Studies were included if they were published in English between 1985 and 2019, where reported data came exclusively from an At-Risk Mental State population, and the study described or related to pathways to care. Results Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 8 were quantitative. Screening tools and pathways to care instruments varied. Mental health professionals, and general practitioners played a key role in help seeking. Family involvement was also found to be an important factor. Conclusions Pathways to care research in At-Risk Mental States are more scarce than in the field of First Episode Psychosis. More research is warranted, especially concerning the role of patient-level characteristics on pathways to care. A validated measure of pathways to care may also be of benefit.

AB  - Background First-episode psychosis typically has its onset during adolescence. Prolonged deficits in social functioning are common in FEP and yet often variance in functioning remains unexplained. Developmental psychology frameworks may be useful for understanding these deficits. Eudaimonic well-being (EWB), or positive self-development, is a developmental psychology construct that has been shown to predict mental health outcomes across multiple populations but has not been systematically reviewed in FEP. Aim Our aim was to systematically review the evidence for: the predictors of EWB, the effectiveness of EWB interventions and to examine the quality of this research in FEP. Methods Selected studies measured either composite or components of EWB. A systematic search produced 2876 abstracts and 122 articles were identified for full screening which produced 17 final papers with 2459 participants. Results Studies comprised six RCTs, eight prospective follow-up studies and three case-controlled studies. Self-esteem and self-efficacy were the most commonly measured components. A meta-analysis of RCTs revealed no statistically significant effect of interventions on self-esteem. The extant research indicates that character strengths may be associated with higher EWB. Self-esteem may be lower in FEP compared with age matched controls but not different from ultra-high risk patients. Self-esteem appears to be associated with poorer insight and improved therapeutic alliance. Significant problems with both external and internal validity of reviewed studies were apparent. Conclusions The hypotheses that lowered EWB is a risk factor for both onset of FEP and for poorer functional outcomes warrant further investigation. There is currently no evidence for effective interventions for EWB in FEP.

AB  - Women who have experienced childhood trauma (CT) are at increased risk for depression during pregnancy and postpartum, pregnancy complications, and adverse child outcomes. There are effective psychotherapeutic interventions to treat depression during pregnancy and postpartum, yet there is a paucity of literature on the impact of CT on treatment outcomes. This review aims to determine whether and how maternal CT history affects the outcomes of psychological interventions for depression during pregnancy and postpartum. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library searches were conducted to identify papers on psychological interventions designed to treat depression during pregnancy and postpartum in women with CT. Seven manuscripts, describing six studies, met the inclusion criteria (N = 1234). Three studies utilized core principles of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Two studies investigated interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). One study was based on a psychoeducation component. Results suggest that IPT-based interventions are beneficial for women with CT. The evidence regarding CBT-based interventions is less conclusive. This review is written in light of the paucity of research addressing the question systematically. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was the main measure used to assess CT. Trauma related to accidents, illness, and political violence was not included. The results are only applicable to interventions based on either IPT or CBT and cannot be generalized to other forms of psychotherapy. Psychotherapeutic interventions are beneficial for depressed women with history of CT during pregnancy and postpartum; however, further systematic research is needed.

AB  - Background:Art therapy (AT) is frequently offered to children and adolescents with psychosocial problems. AT is an experiential form of treatment in which the use of art materials, the process of creation in the presence and guidance of an art therapist, and the resulting artwork are assumed to contribute to the reduction of psychosocial problems. Although previous research reports positive effects, there is a lack of knowledge on which (combination of) art therapeutic components contribute to the reduction of psychosocial problems in children and adolescents. Method:A systematic narrative review was conducted to give an overview of AT interventions for children and adolescents with psychosocial problems. Fourteen databases and four electronic journals up to January 2020 were systematically searched. The applied means and forms of expression, therapist behavior, supposed mechanisms of change, and effects were extracted and coded. Results:Thirty-seven studies out of 1,299 studies met the inclusion criteria. This concerned 16 randomized controlled trials, eight controlled trials, and 13 single-group pre-post design studies. AT interventions for children and adolescents are characterized by a variety of materials/techniques, forms of structure such as giving topics or assignments, and the use of language. Three forms of therapist behavior were seen: non-directive, directive, and eclectic. All three forms of therapist behavior, in combination with a variety of means and forms of expression, showed significant effects on psychosocial problems. Conclusions:The results showed that the use of means and forms of expression and therapist behavior is applied flexibly. This suggests the responsiveness of AT, in which means and forms of expression and therapist behavior are applied to respond to the client's needs and circumstances, thereby giving positive results for psychosocial outcomes. For future studies, presenting detailed information on the potential beneficial effects of used therapeutic perspectives, means, art techniques, and therapist behavior is recommended to get a better insight into (un)successful art therapeutic elements.

This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of suicide-related behaviors among physicians and its associated factors. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched from commencement date to August 14, 2018. Eligible studies on the prevalence of suicide-related behaviors among physicians were included. Results Thirty-five eligible studies with 70,368 physicians were included. The lifetime prevalence of SI was 17.4% (95% CI: 13.8%-21.8%), while the 1-year prevalence was 8.6% (95% CI: 7.1%-10.3%), 6-month prevalence was 11.9% (95% CI: 2.7%-39.2%), and 1-month prevalence was 8.6% (95% CI: 5.6%-13.0%). The lifetime prevalence of SA was 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-3.7%), while the 1-year prevalence was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1%-0.8%). Subgroup analyses revealed that geographic region was significantly associated with lifetime and 1-year prevalence of SI, while sample size was significantly associated with 1-month prevalence of SI. Conclusions This meta-analysis found a relatively high prevalence of suicide-related behaviors, particularly lifetime SI, among physicians. Appropriate preventive and treatment measures should be implemented to reduce the risk of suicide-related behaviors in this population.

AB  - Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids highly abundant in the nervous system, and carry most of the sialic acid residues in the brain. Gangliosides are enriched in cell membrane microdomains ("lipid rafts") and play important roles in the modulation of membrane proteins and ion channels, in cell signaling and in the communication among cells. The importance of gangliosides in the brain is highlighted by the fact that loss of function mutations in ganglioside biosynthetic enzymes result in severe neurodegenerative disorders, often characterized by very early or childhood onset. In addition, changes in the ganglioside profile (i.e., in the relative abundance of specific gangliosides) were reported in healthy aging and in common neurological conditions, including Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. At least in HD, PD and in some forms of epilepsy, experimental evidence strongly suggests a potential role of gangliosides in disease pathogenesis and potential treatment. In this review, we will summarize ganglioside functions that are crucial to maintain brain health, we will review changes in ganglioside levels that occur in major neurological conditions and we will discuss their contribution to cellular dysfunctions and disease pathogenesis. Finally, we will review evidence of the beneficial roles exerted by gangliosides, GM1 in particular, in disease models and in clinical trials.

TI  - Postsecondary Mental Health Policy in Canada: A Scoping Review of the Grey Literature: Politique de sante mentale post-secondaire au Canada: un examen de la portee de la litterature grise
KW  - mental health
KW  - postsecondary
KW  - policy frameworks
KW  - guiding frameworks
AB  - Objective:
   Concerns surrounding the mental health and well-being of Canadian postsecondary students have increased in recent years, with data suggesting increases in the prevalence of self-reported stress and psychological distress. Strategies to address postsecondary mental health have emerged at the national, provincial, and institutional levels. While reviews of the academic literature on the subject have been conducted, a detailed review of the grey literature has not. The objective of this study was to map the current state of grey literature related to current or recommended action supporting postsecondary mental health and well-being in Canada, with a focus on policy documents and guiding frameworks.
   Methods:
   We conducted a review following Arksey and O'Malley's 5-step framework for scoping reviews, as well as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Our search was restricted to documents with a primary focus on postsecondary mental health, a national or provincial scope, and publication date between 2000 and 2019.
   Results:
   While a national policy or guiding framework applicable to all postsecondary institutions across Canada does not yet exist, recommendations for policy at both the national and provincial levels were well aligned, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing mental health services through the use of a whole-campus approach that encompasses both upstream and downstream services.
   Conclusion:
   Postsecondary sector stakeholders should consider how existing policy documents and guiding frameworks can be used to inform evidence-based, institutionally specific action on postsecondary mental health. More work is required to align the fragmented action occurring across Canada and incentivize postsecondary institutions to create a sustainable, effective strategy to address the increasingly complex and unique mental health needs of their students, staff, and faculty.

AB  - Purpose An increasing prevalence of work-related stress and employees' mental health impairments in the health care sector calls for preventive actions. A significant factor in the workplace that is thought to influence employees' mental health is leadership behavior. Hence, effective leadership interventions to foster employees' (leaders' and staff members') mental health might be an important measure to address this pressing issue. Methods We conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA statement (Liberati et al. 2009) and systematically searched the following databases: PubMed (PMC), Web of Science, PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), EconLit (EBSCOhost), and Business Source Premier (EBSCOhost). In addition, we performed a hand search of the reference lists of relevant articles. We included studies investigating leadership interventions in the health care sector that aimed to maintain/foster employees' mental health. Results The systematic search produced 11,221 initial search hits in relevant databases. After the screening process and additional literature search, seven studies were deemed eligible according to the inclusion criteria. All studies showed at least a moderate global validity and four of the included studies showed statistically significant improvements of mental health as a result of the leadership interventions. Conclusions Based on the findings, leadership interventions with reflective and interactive parts in group settings at several seminar days seem to be the most promising strategy to address mental health in health care employees. As the available evidence is limited, efforts to design and scientifically evaluate such interventions should be extended.

AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) is recognised as a major factor in whether athletes seek help when they experience mental health difficulties. Therefore, the current study aimed to provide a systematic review of the effectiveness of MHL training programmes in improving mental health knowledge and help-seeking and reducing stigma among athletes. To identify intervention studies of MHL programmes, five electronic databases were systematically searched for articles published before May 2020. The selection procedure was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All kinds of study designs were included. Effect sizes were calculated for mental health knowledge, stigma reduction and help-seeking attitudes, intentions and behaviours. Risk of bias was assessed for each study using the Cochrane tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Five studies (1239 participants in total) were selected for review. Overall, either small or medium effects were found for mental health knowledge, stigma reduction, help-seeking attitudes, and intentions for post- and follow-up interventions, whereas a null effect was found in help-seeking behaviours for both post- and follow-up interventions. Furthermore, three studies had a low risk of bias, and two had a high risk of bias. MHL interventions can enhance help-seeking attitudes and intentions and mental health knowledge and reduce stigma but do not increase help-seeking behaviours for now. Further studies should evaluate interventions to enhance help-seeking behaviours. Furthermore, the methodological quality of studies, including randomized controlled trials and other designs, should be improved in future research.

AB  - In utero exposure to environmental stress in both animals and humans could result in long-term epigenome alterations which further lead to consequences for adaptation and development in the offspring. Epigenetics, especially DNA methylation, is considered one of the most widely studied and well-characterized mechanisms involved in the long-lasting effects of in utero stress exposure. In this review, we outlined evidence from animal and human prenatal research supporting the view that prenatal stress could lead to lasting, broad and functionally organized signatures in DNA methylation which, in turn, could mediate exposure-phenotype associations. We also emphasized the advantage of using stressor from quasi-randomly assigned experiments. Furthermore, we discuss challenges that still need to be addressed in this field in the future.

AB  - As reviewed in Part 1 of this two part review, birth prior to full term is a substantial public health issue. In the US, similar to 400,000 babies per year are born preterm (< 37 weeks), while > 1 million are early term (37-38(6/7) weeks) and remarkable racial disparities in shortened gestation are observed among African Americans as compared to Whites. Biomechanisms linking stressor exposures with birth outcomes are increasingly being explicated. The current paper reviews the mechanistic role of maternal biological functioning in the link between behavioral exposures and birth outcomes. These include the inter-related roles of neuroendocrine function, inflammatory regulation, biological aging, and the microbiome. An integrative approach which addresses both behavioral and biological factors within the same study, carefully considers the role of race/ethnicity, and rigorously defines birth outcomes (e.g., spontaneous versus medically-indicated and inclusive of early term birth) is needed to move research in this field toward better mechanistic understanding and clinical application.

AB  - The worst rates of preventable mortality and morbidity among women and children occur in humanitarian settings. Reliable, easy-to-use, standardized, and efficient tools for data collection are needed to enable different organizations to plan and act in the most effective way. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a review of tools for data collection on the health of women and children in humanitarian emergencies. An update of this review was conducted to investigate whether the recommendations made were taken forward and to identify newly developed tools. Fifty-three studies and 5 new tools were identified. Only 1 study used 1 of the tools identified in our search. Little has been done in terms of the previous recommendations. Authors may not be aware of the availability of such tools and of the importance of documenting their data using the same methods as other researchers. Currently used tools may not be suitable for use in humanitarian settings or may not include the domains of the authors' interests. The development of standardized instruments should be done with all key workers in the area and could be coordinated by the WHO.

AB  - Mental illness and substance use disorders in the workplace have been increasingly recognised as a problem in most countries; however, evidence is scarce on which solutions provide the highest return on investment. We searched academic and grey literature databases and additional sources for studies that included a workplace intervention for mental health or substance abuse, or both, and that did an economic analysis. We analysed the papers we found to identify the highest yielding and most cost-effective interventions by disorder. On the basis of 56 studies, we found moderate strength of evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy is cost-saving (and in some cases cost-effective) to address depression. We observed strong evidence that regular and active involvement of occupational health professionals is cost-saving and cost-effective in reducing sick leave related to mental health and in encouraging return to work. We identified moderate evidence that coverage for pharmacotherapy and brief counselling for smoking cessation are both cost-saving and cost-effective. Addressing mental health and substance misuse in the workplace improves workers' wellbeing and productivity, and benefits employers' bottom line (ie, profit). Future economic analyses would benefit from the consideration of subgroup analyses, examination of longer follow-ups, inclusion of statistical and sensitivity analyses and discussion around uncertainty, and consideration of potential for bias.

AB  - Five percent of the patient population accounts for 50% of U.S. healthcare expenditures. High-need, high-cost patients are medically complex for numerous reasons, often including behavioral health needs. Intensive outpatient care programs (IOCPs) are emerging, innovative clinics which provide patient-centered care leveraging multidisciplinary teams. The overarching goals of IOCPs are to reduce emergency department visits and hospitalizations (and related costs), and improve care continuity and patient outcomes. The purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of IOCPs on multiple outcomes to inform clinical care. A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify articles. Six studies were included that varied in rigor of research design, analysis, and measurement of outcomes. Most studies reported results on healthcare utilization (n = 4) and costs (n = 3), with fewer reporting results on patient-reported and health-related outcomes (n = 2). Overall, there were decreasing trends in emergency department visits and hospitalizations. However, results on healthcare utilization varied based on time of follow-up, with shorter follow-up times yielding more significant results. Two of the three studies that evaluated costs found significant reductions associated with IOCPs, and the third was cost-neutral. Two studies reported improvements in patient-reported outcomes (e.g., satisfaction, depression, and anxiety). Overall, these programs reported positive impacts on healthcare utilization and costs; however, few studies evaluated patient characteristics and behaviors (e.g., engagement in care) which may serve as key mechanisms of program effectiveness. Future research should examine patient characteristics, behaviors, and clinic engagement metrics to inform clinical practice.

AB  - Background: Employees' well-being at work after the return to work (RTW) is considered a key aspect of rehabilitation and maintenance of workability. This systematic review aimed at identifying the common psychosocial factors that predict the subjective and psychological well-being in RTW processes after having a long-standing health problem or disability. Objective: To evaluate the subjective and psychological well-being at work of employees with chronic or long-standing health problems or those returning to work after any cause of disability. Data source: Systematic review of articles published in English or Spanish using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, Psychology, and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and Pubpsych. An additional study was identified by contacting expert academics in the field. The search equations used included terms such as Return to Work, Long-Standing Health Problems or Disability, Work Health Balance, and job satisfaction or subjective well-being. Eligibility criteria for the studies: Studies that included a measure of employees' well-being at work following return to work were selected for the review. Evaluation of the studies and synthesis methods: The studies were selected using predefined fields which included quality criteria. Results: Of the 264 articles returned by the initial search, a total of 20 were finally selected. Results were organized around the three different theoretical approaches for understanding RTW and its antecedents and consequences: (a) RTW and autonomy at work have a positive effect on psychological well-being; (b) job demand is linked to less job satisfaction, whereas a higher level on the work-health balance is associated with job satisfaction and work engagement; (c) internal and external support is linked to job satisfaction in the case of a disease. Limitations: The evidence provided by the results is restricted by the limited availability of studies focusing on well-being at work following return to work. Moreover, the studies identified are of different kinds, thereby preventing comparisons. Conclusions and implications of the main findings: Employees' subjective well-being after return to work has received very little attention to date. Given its importance in the current configuration of the labor market, it should be the object of more research.

AB  - Background: The use of telepsychiatry (TP) for inpatient service delivery is still an emerging field and there is limited literature on its practice and evidence. This review was conducted with the objectives of (a) exploring the models of TP for inpatient service delivery, (b) qualitative synthesis of the efficacy of TP in inpatient settings, and (c) proposing a best-fit model of TP-based inpatient care for Indian settings.
   Methods: An electronic database search was conducted on July 22, 2020, in PubMed, Directory of Open Access Journals, and Google Scholar for relevant articles. Seventeen articles were included in the review.
   Results: The review revealed three models for TP-based inpatient care; direct care model, teleconsultation model, and the collaborative care model. Preliminary evidence suggests that TP is cost-effective and reliable, and that patients and service providers are highly satisfied with this approach. Evidence gaps were seen for some diagnostic categories such as psychosis and for extremes of age groups. Based on the existing models, we propose an Indian model for implementing TP in inpatient settings.
   Conclusion: Promising initial results and the evidence gaps highlight the need for further research in this area.

AB  - Maintaining or improving quality of life (QoL) and well-being is a universal goal across the lifespan. Being physically active has been suggested as one way to enhance QoL and well-being. In this systematic review, conducted in part for the 2018 U.S. Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Scientific Advisory Committee Report, we examined the relationship between physical activity (PA) and QoL and well-being experienced by the general population across the lifespan and by persons with psychiatric and neurologic conditions. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and pooled analyses from 2006 to 2018 were used for the evidence base. Strong evidence (predominantly from randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) demonstrated that, for adults aged 18-65 years and older adults (primarily 65 years and older), PA improves QoL and well-being when compared with minimal or no-treatment controls. Moderate evidence indicated that PA improves QoL and well-being in individuals with schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, and limited evidence indicated that PA improves QoL and well-being for youth and for adults with major clinical depression or bipolar disorder. Insufficient evidence existed for individuals with dementia because of a small number of studies with mixed results. Future high-quality research designs should include RCTs involving longer interventions testing different modes and intensities of PA in diverse populations of healthy people and individuals with cognitive (e.g., dementia) and mental health conditions (e.g., schizophrenia) to precisely characterize the effects of different forms of PA on aspects of QoL and well-being.

AB  - The terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 placed nearly a half million people at increased risk of adverse health. Health effects research began shortly after and continues today, now mostly as a coordinated effort under the federally mandated World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program (WTCHP). Established in 2011, the WTCHP provides medical monitoring and treatment of covered health conditions for responders and survivors and maintains a research program aimed to improve the care and well-being of the affected population. By 2020, funds in excess of USD 127 M had been awarded for health effects research. This review describes research findings and provides an overview of the WTCHP and its future directions. The literature was systematically searched for relevant articles published from 11 September 2001 through 30 June 2020. Synthesis was limited to broad categories of mental health, cancer, respiratory disease, vulnerable populations, and emerging conditions. In total, 944 WTC articles were published, including peer-reviewed articles funded by the WTCHP (n = 291) and other sources. Research has focused on characterizing the burden and etiology of WTC-related health conditions. As the program moves forward, translational research that directly enhances the care of individuals with chronic mental and physical health conditions is needed.

AB  - Background: Work-related psychosocial stress can cause mental and physical illnesses resulting in high costs for the individual, the economy and society. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) employ the majority of the world's workforce and often have fewer financial and human resources compared to larger businesses. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge on work-related stress in SMEs according to well-established guidelines categorizing psychosocial factors at work. Methods: A systematic database search was carried out in PubMed, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and Business Source Premiere from March to June 2019, updated in January 2020. Data of included studies were analyzed and mapped into five themes: "work content and task", "organization of work", "social relations", "working environment" and "new forms of work". Results: After full-text screening, 45 out of 116 studies were included for data extraction. Studies were very heterogeneous and of varying quality, mostly applying a cross-sectional study design. Psychosocial factors in SMEs have been researched with a focus on the work patterns "work organization" and "work content and task". Conclusions: This review underlines the need for more and better quality research of psychosocial factors in SMEs, particularly in relation to ongoing and new challenges in the workplace, including stressors related to the process of digitalization or the development of safe working conditions during the emerge of new infectious diseases.

AB  - It would be useful for researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers to anticipate the hazards that workers will face in the future. The focus of this study is a systematic review of published information to identify and characterize scenarios and hazards in the future of work. Eleven bibliographic databases were systematically searched for papers and reports published from 1999 to 2019 that described future of work scenarios or identified future work-related hazards. To compile a comprehensive collection of views of the future, supplemental and ad hoc searches were also performed. After screening all search records against a set of predetermined criteria, the review yielded 36 references (17 peer-reviewed, 4 gray, and 15 supplemental) containing scenarios. In these, the future of work was described along multiple conceptual axes (e.g. labor market changes, societal values, and manual versus cognitive work). Technology was identified as the primary driver of the future of work in most scenarios, and there were divergent views in the literature as to whether technology will create more or fewer jobs than it displaces. Workforce demographics, globalization, climate change, economic conditions, and urbanization were also mentioned as influential factors. Other important themes included human enhancement, social isolation, loneliness, worker monitoring, advanced manufacturing, hazardous exposures, sustainability, biotechnology, and synthetic biology. Pandemics have not been widely considered in the future of work literature, but the recent COVID-19 pandemic illustrates that was short-sighted. Pandemics may accelerate future of work trends and merit critical consideration in scenario development. Many scenarios described 'new' or 'exacerbated' psychosocial hazards of work, whereas comparatively fewer discussed physical, chemical, or biological hazards. Various preventive recommendations were identified. In particular, reducing stress associated with precarious work and its requirements of continual skill preparation and training was acknowledged as critical for protecting and promoting the health and well-being of the future workforce. In conclusion, the future of work will be comprised of diverse complex scenarios and a mosaic of old and new hazards. These findings may serve as the basis for considering how to shape the future of work.

AB  - Attention deficits have been proven in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, a detailed characterization of attention deficits in MDD was unclear. The aim of current study was to explore the specific deficits of attention in different sub-domains of attention so as to produce an overall picture of contemporary research on this field. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published researches. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and review of references were searched up to October 2019. Studies using at least one objective measurement to assess attention performances of MDD patients were included. Effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models for attention outcomes. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test. Twenty-three eligible studies including 1371 MDD patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Significant deficit of global attention was observed. For the specific outcomes, MDD patients showed significant deficits psychomotor speed/attention, auditory attention, visuo-spatial attention, sustained visual attention, ranging from small to moderate, but not in selective attention. Larger sample sizes and more detailed subgroup analyses based on features of patients should be conducted to produce a more accurate conclusion.

AB  - Purpose: Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common psychiatric condition after childbirth which not only effects the mother's health, but also might have impact on child's development and parenting behaviors. Because the etiology of PPD has not been fully cleared, the efforts towards identification of risk factors are crucial for both the children and mother's health.
   Method: PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases were searched since inception until July 2019 to collect data about the risk factors of PPD and only systematic review and meta-analysis can be included.
   Result: To identify the real risk factors, protective factors and controversial factors, nineteen parts of the interpretation were adopted. The risk factors are mainly concentrated in the following aspects: violence and abuse, immigration status, gestational diabetes, cesarean section, depressive history, vitamin D deficiency, obese and overweight, postpartum sleep disruption and poor postpartum sleep, lack of social support, traditional dietary pattern (Japanese, Indian, United Kingdom, and Brazilian dietary pattern), multiple births, preterm and low birth-weight infants, postpartum anemia, negative birth experience. The controversial factors are serum level of cortisol, thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies status, acculturation, traditional confinement practices. Skin-to skin care, higher concentrations of DHA in mothers' milk, greater seafood consumption, healthy dietary patterns, multivitamin supplementation, fish and PUFA intake, calcium, Vitamin D, zinc and possibly selenium are protective factors.
   Conclusion: Thirteen risk factors were identified, but five factors still controversial due to the insufficient of the evidence. What's more, skin-to-skin care and some nutrition related factors are protective factors against PPD.

AB  - The current state of computer vision methods applied to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research has not been well established. Increasing evidence suggests that computer vision techniques have a strong impact on autism research. The primary objective of this systematic review is to examine how computer vision analysis has been useful in ASD diagnosis, therapy and autism research in general. A systematic review of publications indexed on PubMed, IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library was conducted from 2009 to 2019. Search terms included ['autis*' AND ('computer vision' OR 'behavio* imaging' OR 'behavio* analysis' OR 'affective computing')]. Results are reported according to PRISMA statement. A total of 94 studies are included in the analysis. Eligible papers are categorised based on the potential biological/behavioural markers quantified in each study. Then, different computer vision approaches that were employed in the included papers are described. Different publicly available datasets are also reviewed in order to rapidly familiarise researchers with datasets applicable to their field and to accelerate both new behavioural and technological work on autism research. Finally, future research directions are outlined. The findings in this review suggest that computer vision analysis is useful for the quantification of behavioural/biological markers which can further lead to a more objective analysis in autism research.

AB  - BackgroundResearch on parental mental illness is often carried out in disorder specific research silos. Drawing on the different research areas, it is possible to leverage and combine existing knowledge, and identify insights that can be transferred across research areas. In this study, we identify the overarching structure of research on parents with psychiatric disorders, and the structure of the different research areas, as defined by psychiatric disorder groups in ICD-10, and identify both topics that are commonly examined, and topics that received attention in only a few of the research areas.MethodsWe use bibliometric science mapping to examine keywords in 16,734 articles, showing the overarching structure of research on parents with mental illness, both overall and within ICD-10 psychiatric disorder categories. The search was conducted using the Scopus database for journal articles published between 1999 and 2018, with no restrictions on language.ResultsCo-occurrence analysis of the keywords in the 16,734 articles on parental mental illnesses in different psychiatric disorder categories, indicate there are six general themes in the literature: 'expectant mothers and early motherhood', 'substance use and abuse', 'Socio-economic status' (SES) and support practices', 'biomedical research', 'diagnoses, symptoms and treatment', and 'child-parent interaction and context'. Although the same themes are covered in different areas, the contexts, in terms of content and relation to other topics, vary between the research areas. Some topics are heavily researched in some areas, but seem to be neglected in others.ConclusionsThis study provides data both in interactive maps and an extensive table, allowing readers to dive deep into their topic of interest, and examine how this connects to other topics, which may in turn guide identification of important gaps in the literature, and ultimately inspire and generate novel research avenues.

AB  - Background In all epidemics, healthcare staff are at the centre of risks and damages caused by pathogens. Today, nurses and physicians are faced with unprecedented work pressures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in several psychological disorders such as stress, anxiety and sleep disturbances. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbances in hospital nurses and physicians facing the COVID-19 patients. Method A systematic review and metanalysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA criteria. The PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, Web of science, CINHAL, Medline, and Google Scholar databases were searched with no lower time-limt and until 24 June 2020. The heterogeneity of the studies was measured using I(2)test and the publication bias was assessed by the Egger's test at the significance level of 0.05. Results The I(2)test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the selected studies, based on the results of I(2)test, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians is I-2: 97.4% and I-2: 97.3% respectively. After following the systematic review processes, 7 cross-sectional studies were selected for meta-analysis. Six studies with the sample size of 3745 nurses were examined in and the prevalence of sleep disturbances was approximated to be 34.8% (95% CI: 24.8-46.4%). The prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians was also measured in 5 studies with the sample size of 2123 physicians. According to the results, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians caring for the COVID-19 patients was reported to be 41.6% (95% CI: 27.7-57%). Conclusion Healthcare workers, as the front line of the fight against COVID-19, are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of this disease than other groups in society. Increasing workplace stress increases sleep disturbances in the medical staff, especially nurses and physicians. In other words, increased stress due to the exposure to COVID-19 increases the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians. Therefore, it is important for health policymakers to provide solutions and interventions to reduce the workplace stress and pressures on medical staff.

AB  - Numerous studies have reported that the prevalence estimates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) might be substantially high among people with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) when compared to the general population. However, there are no previous systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies that reported the pooled prevalence of PTSD among PLWHA. To fill this gap in research, this study aims to analyze data from observational studies concerning the prevalence of PTSD among PLWHA and formulate a recommendation for future research and clinical practice. Three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS) were searched to identify relevant studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD among PLWHA. A comprehensive meta-analysis software was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis was conducted the I(2)test was utilized to evaluate heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by using Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots. Nineteen-studies with 9094 participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence estimate of PTSD among PLWHA was found to be 32.67% (95% CI; 25.29-41.01). The prevalence of PTSD was 25.17% (95% CI; 19.72-31.55) for studies that used diagnostic instrument to assess PTSD and it was 34.68% (95% CI; 25.42-45.26) for studies that used screening instruments. Furthermore, the prevalence of PTSD among PLWHA was comparable between high-income (31.19%) and low, and middle-income countries (34.87%). We also found that the pooled prevalence of PTSD was remarkably higher for moderate and low-quality studies (42.64%) than for high-quality studies (24.84%). The prevalence of PTSD among PLWHA in the current study showed a significant variation by the location of the studies, the instruments used to measure PTSD as well as the quality of the included studies. The present review demonstrated that the prevalence estimates of PTSD among PLWHA (32.67%) was notably high and requires clinical attention. The estimated prevalence of PTSD was found to be comparable between high income and low, and middle-income countries. In addition, we found that the prevalence of PTSD was notably lower when measured by the diagnostic instrument than the screening instrument, although the variation was not statistically significant. Early screening and treatment of PTSD among PLWHA is needed to alleviate suffering.

AB  - Co-occurrence of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts (SA) might occur because they share common risk factors, or alternatively because one leads to the other. Using search terms salient to NSSI and SA, we screened 555 studies to identify 17 that presented temporal data about NSSI and SA. Much of the evidence indicates that NSSI predates SA, especially among females and individuals with depressive symptoms, or diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or mood disorders. However, in some studies, associated risk factors likely accounted for the effect. Greater NSSI frequency to a threshold increases risk for later SA. Findings suggest that the behaviors have common predisposing factors, but that there is also a potent gateway effect whereby NSSI precedes SA.

AB  - Background: Since 2013, the number of violent crimes and offences by sharp instruments have increased continually, following a previous decrease, with majority of cases occurring among young people and in London. There is limited understanding surrounding the drivers influencing this change in trends, with mostly American-based research identifying risk factors.
   Methods: The aim of this review is to identify and synthesise evidence from a range of literature to identify risk factors associated with weapon-related crime, for young people (aged 10-24 years) within the UK.
   A search strategy was generated to conduct a systematic search of published and grey literature within four databases (EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and OpenGrey), identifying papers within a UK-context. s and full texts were screened by two independent reviewers to assess eligibility for inclusion, namely study focus in line with the objectives of the review. Weight of Evidence approach was utilised to assess paper quality, resulting in inclusion of 16 papers. Thematic analysis was conducted for studies to identity and categorise risk factors according to the WHO ecological model.
   Results: No association was found between gender or ethnicity and youth violence, contrasting current understanding shown within media. Multiple research papers identified adverse childhood experiences and poor mental health as positively associated with youth and gang violence. It was suggested that community and societal risk factors, such as discrimination and economic inequality, were frequently linked to youth violence.
   A small number of studies were included within the review as this is a growing field of research, which may have led to a constrained number of risk factors identified. Due to heterogeneity of studies, a meta-analysis could not be conducted. As many studies displayed positive results, publication bias may be present.
   Conclusions: Several risk factors were identified, with evidence currently heterogeneous with minimal high-quality studies. However, findings highlight key areas for future research, including the link between poor mental health and knife-crime, and the trajectory into gangs. Risk factors should help identify high-risk individuals, targeting them within mitigation strategies to prevent involvement within crime. This should contribute to efforts aimed at reducing the rising crime rates within UK.

AB  - Research on anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has burgeoned in the past 15 years. Most of the research has focused on school-age children, ages 6 to 18 years. Yet, recent studies suggest that anxiety can emerge in young children, under 6 years, with ASD. This scoping review synthesized the literature on anxiety in young children with ASD. Three domains of anxiety research were reviewed: (a) prevalence/severity, phenomenology, and course; (b) correlates; and (c) treatment. Four online databases were searched from the start of the database until March 2020. Keywords pertaining to anxiety, autism, and young children were entered. The search identified 44 articles for inclusion. These studies varied with respect to sample source, informants, and measures to assess anxiety. The overall prevalence of anxiety ranged from 1.6 to 62%. Sixteen of 17 studies found that young children with ASD had higher levels of anxiety compared to various control groups. A variety of DSM anxiety symptoms and disorders were present in young children with the most common symptoms being specific, social, and generalized fears. Correlates of anxiety included sensory over-responsivity, sleep disturbance, aggression/defiance, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Three cognitive behavioral treatment studies for anxiety and one developmental intervention targeting ASD symptoms showed promise in reducing anxiety. Findings indicate an early emergence of anxiety in some children with ASD. Further research on the measurement, pathophysiology, and treatment of anxiety in early childhood is critical to improving outcomes in children with ASD. Lay summary This scoping review synthesizes the literature on anxiety in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results indicate that children with ASD have higher levels of anxiety than children without ASD. Potential factors that could be contributing to anxiety include sensory, sleep, and behavioral problems. Preliminary studies show that anxiety can improve with cognitive behavioral treatment. These findings suggest that research on anxiety in young children with ASD should be prioritized to improve mental health outcomes.

Second, to identify opportunities for research. Methods: Literature searches were conducted of the MEDLINE database, UpToDate and the Australian National University Library SuperSearch from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2019. The search terms used were 'transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'major depressive disorder' and 'depression'. Results: There were 24 meta-analyses identified, demonstrating a clear clinical effect. Left high-frequency rTMS had the most evidence. Ideal clinical parameters and study design were explored. Conclusion: Use of rTMS for some patients with depression is justified. Open research questions include the comparative efficacy of right low-frequency and bilateral stimulation, the role of rTMS in medication-naive patients, and maintenance of effect.

AB  - Studies have suggested that suicidal ideation and attempt are highly prevalent among young people with HIV/AIDS and have been linked with increased risk of complete suicide. However, thus far, there are no worldwide systematic reviews and meta-analysis of the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt among young people with HIV/AIDS. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Prevalence rates from individual studies were pooled by using a random-effect meta-analysis. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute's quality assessment checklist. We used the Cochran's Q and the I(2)tests to measure heterogeneity across the studies. In total, 14 studies involving 4842 young people with HIV/AIDS were included in this meta-analysis. Our random effect meta-analysis indicated that roughly a quarter of young people with HIV/AIDS had lifetime suicidal ideations [24.38% (95% CI; 18.49-31.44)], and more than one in ten had current [10.33% (95% CI; 6.13-16.88)], and 6 month [13.03% (95% CI; 4.71-31.24)] suicidal ideations. Likewise, a significant proportion of young people with HIV/AIDS had current [3.75% (95% CI; 2.30-6.06)], 6 month [15.33% (95% CI; 10.00-22.78)], and lifetime [13.05% (95% CI; 7.55-21.61)] suicidal attempts. The pooled prevalence estimate of both suicidal ideation and attempts varied according to the sample size of the participants. This study found that a considerable proportion of young people with HIV/AIDS had suicidal ideation and attempt, suggesting the urgent needs of intervention strategies to relieve the suffering and possibly prevent death due to suicide.

AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-proteinogenic amino acid and is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. GABA's stress-reducing, and sleep enhancing effects have been established. However, although several human clinical trials have been conducted, results regarding the role of natural and/or biosynthetic oral GABA intake on stress and sleep are mixed. We performed a systematic review to examine whether natural and/or biosynthetic oral GABA intake has an effect on stress and sleep. We systematically searched on PubMed database for studies published up to February 2020 following PRISMA guidelines. Only placebo-controlled human trials that assessed stress, sleep, and related psychophysiological outcomes as a response to natural GABA (i.e., GABA that is present naturally in foods) or biosynthetic GABA (i.e., GABA that is produced via fermentation) intake were included. Fourteen studies met the criteria and were included in the systematic review. Although more studies are needed before any inferences can be made about the efficacy of oral GABA consumption on stress and sleep, results show that there is limited evidence for stress and very limited evidence for sleep benefits of oral GABA intake.

AB  - Renewed interest in the use of psychedelics in the treatment of psychiatric disorders warrants a better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of these substances. After a hiatus of about 50 years, state-of-the art studies have recently begun to close important knowledge gaps by elucidating the mechanisms of action of psychedelics with regard to their effects on receptor subsystems, systems-level brain activity and connectivity, and cognitive and emotional processing. In addition, functional studies have shown that changes in self-experience, emotional processing and social cognition may contribute to the potential therapeutic effects of psychedelics. These discoveries provide a scientific road map for the investigation and application of psychedelic substances in psychiatry.
   A resurgence in interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs has boosted research into their neurobiological and cognitive effects. Vollenweider and Preller review recent advances in the field and consider the implications of recent discoveries for the therapeutic use of psychedelics.

AB  - Background Several reviews have found that psychological trauma affects access to health care services, including mental health care, in the general population. People from refugee and asylum seeker backgrounds are more likely to have a mental illness than the general population, and experience a broad range of barriers and facilitators to service access. However, to date there has been no comprehensive consideration of the potential effect of psychological trauma on access to primary health care within this population. Methods This paper provides a mixed-methods systematic review of literature which included any consideration of the relationship between psychological trauma and access to primary health care. A systematic search of Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library was conducted. Study eligibility criteria were empirical, peer-reviewed studies that considered the relationship between psychological trauma and access to, or use of, primary healthcare in resettlement countries for refugees (including asylum seekers). Papers were required to be written in English and published between 1998 and August 2019. Quality was assessed using the Multi-Methods Appraisal Tool. The search identified a total of 14 eligible studies (11 quantitative and 3 qualitative) which had explored this relationship in refugee and asylum seeker populations. Results Overall, synthesis of findings indicated variable results with respect to the impact of psychological trauma on service access. Specifically, the review found that while rates of psychological trauma were high. Key themes were that while general health care access was comparable or greater than the general population, rates of mental healthcare specifically were low. In addition, included papers identified a range of barriers to service access-particularly somatisation, stigma and healthcare provide knowledge about psychological trauma. Conclusions While there is a critical need for more research in this area, the study points to several key recommendations including training of general practitioners in relation to psychological trauma, ensuring culturally responsive services, and the use of interpreters. Finally, due to the levels of somatisation found in some studies, ensuring general practitioners understand the somatic element of psychological trauma-particularly within some groups of people from refugee backgrounds-is important.

AB  - Literature investigating whether an individuals' sex affects their executive control abilities and performance on cognitive tasks in a normative population has been contradictory and inconclusive. Using meta-analytic procedures (abiding by PRISMA guidelines), this study attempts to identify the magnitude of behavioural sex differences in three prominent executive control domains of cognitive set-shifting, performance monitoring, and response inhibition. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched. Across 46 included studies, a total of 1988 females and 1884 males were included in the analysis. Overall, males and females did not differ on performance in any of the three domains of performance monitoring, response inhibition, or cognitive set-shifting. Task-specific sex differences were observed in the domains of performance monitoring, in the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task-males scored statistically higher than females (Hedges'g = -0.60), and response inhibition, in the Delay Discounting task-females scored statistically higher than males (Hedges'g = 0.64). While the meta-analysis did not detect overall behavioural sex differences in executive control, significant heterogeneity and task-specific sex differences were found. To further understand sex differences within these specific tasks and domains, future research must better control for age and sex hormone levels.

AB  - Purpose It is plausible that offspring born to mothers using tobacco during pregnancy may have increased risk of mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorders); however, mixed results have been reported. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the magnitude and consistency of associations reported between prenatal tobacco use and mood disorders in offspring. Methods We systematically searched EMBASE, SCOPUS, PubMed and Psych-INFO for studies on mood disorders and prenatal tobacco use. Methodological quality of studies was assessed with the revised Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We estimated pooled relative risk (RR) with inverse variance weighted random-effects meta-analysis. We performed leave-one-out analyses, and stratified analyses by a subgroup (depression and bipolar disorder). Potential publication bias was assessed by inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's test for regression asymmetry. This study protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017060037). Results Eight cohort and two case-control studies were included in the final meta-analysis. We found an increased pooled relative risk of mood disorders in offspring exposed to maternal prenatal tobacco use RRs 1.43 (95% CI 1.27-1.60) compared to no prenatal tobacco use. Similarly, the pooled relative risks of bipolar and depressive disorders in offspring were 1.44, (95% CI 1.15-1.80) and 1.44, (95% CI 1.21-1.71), respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimated risk of mood disorders was not significantly attenuated in the studies that reported sibling comparison results [RR = 1.21 (95% CI 1.04-1.41)]. Conclusion Taken together, there was strong evidence for a small (RR < 2) association between prenatal tobacco use and mood disorders in offspring.

AB  - Little is known about the experiences of correctional health care providers and how their experiences impact the correctional health care system. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines, multiple databases were searched. Each abstract was read by two reviewers with a third for consensus as needed. Full-text articles were selected through a second round of review. Of 4,467 citations, 61 were selected for full-text evaluation and 23 were ultimately included. Major themes identified were the distinctive working environment, burnout, and the presence of ethical dilemmas, including the tension between security and clinical considerations. This scoping review identified a limited number of articles centered on the health care provider experience in the correctional setting.

AB  - Background: In recent years, there has been an increasing burden of child and adolescent mental illness recognized in the United States, and the need for pediatric mental health care is growing. Pediatric consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrists are increasingly playing a role in the management of medical and psychiatric disease for pediatric patients. The field is a fast-moving one, with understanding of new neuropsychiatric disease entities; reformulation of prior disease entities; and new interdisciplinary treatments and models of care. Methods: In this study, we aim to review recent advances in the field of pediatric C-L psychiatry, including new diagnostic entities, updated management of frequently encountered clinical presentations, and developments in systems of care. Conclusion: The advances in pediatric C-L psychiatry are broad and serve to promote more streamlined, evidence-based care for the vulnerable population of psychiatrically ill pediatric medical patients. More work remains to determine the most effective interventions for the wide array of presentations seen by pediatric C-L psychiatrists.

AB  - Background Digital phenotyping is the use of data from smartphones and wearables collected in situ for capturing a digital expression of human behaviors. Digital phenotyping techniques can be used to analyze both passively (e.g., sensor) and actively (e.g., survey) collected data. Machine learning offers a possible predictive bridge between digital phenotyping and future clinical state. This review examines passive digital phenotyping across the schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders, with a focus on machine-learning studies. Methods A systematic review of passive digital phenotyping literature was conducted using keywords related to severe mental illnesses, data-collection devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables, actigraphy devices), and streams of data collected. Searches of five databases initially yielded 3312 unique publications. Fifty-one studies were selected for inclusion, with 16 using machine-learning techniques. Results All studies differed in features used, data pre-processing, analytical techniques, algorithms tested, and performance metrics reported. Across all studies, the data streams and other study factors reported also varied widely. Machine-learning studies focused on random forest, support vector, and neural net approaches, and almost exclusively on bipolar disorder. Discussion Many machine-learning techniques have been applied to passively collected digital phenotyping data in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Larger studies, and with improved data quality, are needed, as is further research on the application of machine learning to passive digital phenotyping data in early diagnosis and treatment of psychosis. In order to achieve greater comparability of studies, common data elements are identified for inclusion in future studies.

AB  - Algal biomass, extracts, or derivatives have long been considered a valuable material to bring benefits to humans and cultivated plants. In the last decades, it became evident that algal formulations can induce multiple effects on crops (including an increase in biomass, yield, and quality), and that algal extracts contain a series of bioactive compounds and signaling molecules, in addition to mineral and organic nutrients. The need to reduce the non-renewable chemical input in agriculture has recently prompted an increase in the use of algal extracts as a plant biostimulant, also because of their ability to promote plant growth in suboptimal conditions such as saline environments is beneficial. In this article, we discuss some research areas that are critical for the implementation in agriculture of macro- and microalgae extracts as plant biostimulants. Specifically, we provide an overview of current knowledge and achievements about extraction methods, compositions, and action mechanisms of algal extracts, focusing on salt-stress tolerance. We also outline current limitations and possible research avenues. We conclude that the comparison and the integration of knowledge on the molecular and physiological response of plants to salt and to algal extracts should also guide the extraction procedures and application methods. The effects of algal biostimulants have been mainly investigated from an applied perspective, and the exploitation of different scientific disciplines is still much needed for the development of new sustainable strategies to increase crop tolerance to salt stress.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to systematically review the effects of supervised resistance training (RT) programs in people diagnosed with depression or depressive symptoms. The following databases were used to search and retrieve the articles: Cochrane Library, EBSCO, PEDro, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. The search was conducted in late June 2020. Search protocol required the title to contain the words depression or depressive or dysthymia. Furthermore, the title, abstract or keywords had to contain the words or expressions: "randomized controlled trial"; and "strength training" or "resistance training" or "resisted training" or "weight training". The screening provided 136 results. After the removal of duplicates, 70 records remained. Further screening of titles and abstracts resulted in the elimination of 57 papers. Therefore, 13 records were eligible for further scrutiny. Of the 13 records, nine were excluded, and the final sample consisted of four articles. Results were highly heterogeneous, with half of the studies showing positive effects of resistance training and half showing no effects. In two of the four combinations, the meta-analysis revealed significant benefits of RT in improving depressive symptoms (p <= 0.05). However, considering significant differences with moderate (Effect Size = 0.62) and small (ES = 0.53) effects, the heterogeneity was above 50%, thus suggesting a substantial level. To draw meaningful conclusions, future well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed that focus on understudied RT as a treatment for depression.

AB  - Objective: Although the mechanism of post-concussion syndrome remains unclear, psychological factors are thought to be associated with its development. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the gold standard for psycho-logical disorders; however, its effects on post-concussion syndrome remain unclear. Through this meta-analysis, we assessed the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on post-concussion syndrome following traumatic brain injury.
   Methods: Six electronic databases were searched from inception to September 15, 2019, for randomized con-trolled trials evaluating the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with post-concussion syndrome. Primary outcomes included the severity of symptoms of post-concussion syndrome, depression, anxiety, and social integration. Secondary outcomes were fatigue, cognitive function, and quality of life. Effects were esti-mated through the calculation of Hedge's g and 95% confidence interval using a random effects model. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding studies in which an intention-to-treat analysis was not em-ployed.
   Results: In total, 24 studies were included. Most studies had risk of bias. Significant effects were found for most outcomes, except for severity of symptoms of post-concussion syndrome, fatigue, executive function, and pro-blem solving. After sensitivity analyses, the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy remained significant for immediate and mid-term effects on depression, anxiety, and social integration.
   Conclusions: This study does not support the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for severity of symptoms of post-concussion syndrome; however, it might be an effective treatment option for improving de-pression, anxiety, and social integration in individuals with traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Personally traits have been found to predict participation in high-risk sports. Nevertheless, recent research identified problems with treating participants in high-risk sports as a homogenous group. This narrative review provides a critical overview of personally research in the increasingly popular high-risk sport of mountaineering. Twenty four studies were identified following a search of ten databases, which allowed data for mountaineers to be analysed separately rather than being subsumed within homogenous high-risk sports groups. Mountaineers were generally found to possess higher levels of extraversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability than the general population or low-risk sports participants. High levels of sensation-seeking were found in mountaineers across numerous studies. There was some evidence of mountaineers being assertive/aggressive, having difficulties interacting with others in social settings, and reporting problems with maintaining close relationships. Few studies examined how personally traits might be related to important outcomes such as accident rates, group cohesion, or team performance. Numerous limitations within the extant literature are identified. Recommendations are made to facilitate higher quality research and to encourage greater focus upon the application of knowledge via personally-informed interventions.

AB  - Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world. It is often associated with various long-term physical and neuropsychological consequences. The aim of this article is to present the results of research on the occurrence of dementia and post-stroke depression. Using the keywords: post-stroke dementia, post-stroke depression, post-stroke cognitive impairment, stroke, Polish and foreign bibliographic databases were searched: PubMed, Science Direct, Wiley, Google Scholar. Documents that met the eligibility criteria were selected for inclusion in this review. After the conducted analyses, 7 Polish articles and 13 English-language articles were qualified for the review. In the group of people after stroke, there is an increased risk of depression and dementia. According to the data, up to every third person can deal with one of these neuropsychiatric disorders. The presented research analyses indicate that the results obtained by the respondents, at any time after the stroke, indicate the presence of mild cognitive impairment or slight degree dementia among the majority of respondents. It was also shown that people with a stroke in the dominant hemisphere are more likely to experience post-stroke depression. Depression and post-stroke dementia are a common and significant complication of stroke that negatively affects the functional outcome. The huge focus on neuropsychiatric disorders occurring after stroke in modern research is very important because of their negative impact on recovery, quality of life and survival after stroke.

AB  - Almost all forms of psychopathology, including personality disorders, are arrived at through complex interactions among neurobiological vulnerabilities and environmental risk factors across development. Yet despite increasing recognition of etiological complexity, psychopathology research is still dominated by searches for large main effects causes. This derives in part from reliance on traditional inferential methods, including ordinary factor analysis, regression, ANCOVA, and other techniques that use statistical partialing to isolate unique effects. In principle, some of these methods can accommodate etiological complexity, yet as typically applied they are insensitive to interactivefunctional dependencies(modulating effects) among etiological influences. Here, we use our developmental model of antisocial and borderline traits to illustrate challenges faced when modeling complex etiological mechanisms of psychopathology. We then consider how computational models, which are rarely used in the personality disorders literature, remedy some of these challenges when combined with hierarchical Bayesian analysis.

AB  - Physical literacy, especially in the fields of physical education and public health, has been gaining global interest in recent years. Applying an appropriate method to measure physical competence under the concept of physical literacy for older adults aligns with the goal of healthy aging. In this scoping review, we reflected on previous empirical studies regarding the measurements of physical competence among older adults holistically and systematically to identify and analyze gaps in the topic of "physical literacy" among older adults as a precursor to a systematic review. We searched five databases using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for Protocols guidelines: (1) SPORTDiscus; (2) PubMed; (3) Scopus; (4) ScienceDirect; and (5) Web of Science. There were 29 studies included in our thematic analysis. Through our review, we found that 73% of the mean age of the participants comprised older baby boomers who were from 65-74 years old as aging continues. Therefore, more effort should be made in developing physical literacy for older adults with the goal of health promotion. Our results showed that most studies adopted both self-reported and objective measures, in which objective measures were widely embraced by scholars in the measurement, while self-reported measures were encouraged to be included in the assessment as well. Using assessment tools to measure a combination of actual physical competence and perceived physical competence is recommended in the measurement of physical competence, especially in older adults. In addition, other elements of physical literacy should be taken into account when measuring physical competency in older adults. For future implementation, when framing the model to chart physical literacy for older adults, it is important to review the definition again and adopt a holistic measurement system including every aspect of physical literacy.

AB  - Patient-centred care by a coordinated primary care team may be more effective than standard care in chronic disease management. We synthesised evidence to determine whether patient-centred medical home (PCMH)-based care models are more effective than standard general practitioner (GP) care in improving biomedical, hospital, and economic outcomes. MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched to identify randomised (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled trials that evaluated two or more principles of PCMH among primary care patients with chronic diseases. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal tools, and grading of evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach were conducted independently. A quantitative synthesis, where possible, was pooled using random effects models and the effect size estimates of standardised mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were reported. Of the 13,820 citations, we identified 78 eligible RCTs and 7 quasi trials which included 60,617 patients. The findings suggested that PCMH-based care was associated with significant improvements in depression episodes (SMD -0.24; 95% CI -0.35, -0.14; I-2= 76%) and increased odds of remission (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.46, 2.21; I-2= 0%). There were significant improvements in the health-related quality of life (SMD 0.10; 95% CI 0.04, 0.15; I-2= 51%), self-management outcomes (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.03, 0.44; I-2= 83%), and hospital admissions (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.70, 0.98; I-2= 0%). In terms of biomedical outcomes, with exception to total cholesterol, PCMH-based care led to significant improvements in blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol outcomes. The incremental cost of PCMH care was identified to be small and significantly higher than standard care (SMD 0.17; 95% CI 0.08, 0.26; I-2= 82%). The quality of individual studies ranged from "fair" to "good" by meeting at least 60% of items on the quality appraisal checklist. Additionally, moderate to high heterogeneity across studies in outcomes resulted in downgrading the included studies as moderate or low grade of evidence. PCMH-based care has been found to be superior to standard GP care in chronic disease management. Results of the review have important implications that may inform patient, practice, and policy-level changes.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought a great deal of pressure for medical students, who typically show elevated anxiety rates. Our aim is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety in medical students during this pandemic. This systematic review and mini meta-analysis has been conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Two researchers independently searched PubMed on 26 August 2020 for cross-sectional studies on medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, with no language restrictions applied. We then performed a manual search to detect other potentially eligible investigations. To the 1361 records retrieved in the initial search, 4 more were added by manual search on medRxiv. Finally, eight studies were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analysis, which yielded an estimated prevalence of anxiety of 28% (95% CI: 22-34%), with significant heterogeneity between studies. The prevalence of anxiety in medical students is similar to that prior to the pandemic but correlates with several specific COVID-related stressors. While some preventive and risk factors have been previously identified in a non-pandemic context, knowledge and cognitions on COVID-19 transmission, treatment, prognosis and prevention negatively correlate with anxiety, emerging as a key preventive factor that may provide a rationale for why the levels of anxiety have remained stable in medical students during the pandemic while increasing in their non-medical peers and the general population. Other reasons for the invariability of anxiety rates in this population are discussed. A major limitation of our review is that Chinese students comprised 89% the total sample, which could compromise the external validity of our work

AB  - Importance Wisdom is a neurobiological personality trait made up of specific components, including prosocial behaviors, emotional regulation, and spirituality. It is associated with greater well-being and happiness. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance individual components of wisdom. Data Sources MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles published through December 31, 2018. Study Eligibility Criteria Randomized clinical trials that sought to enhance a component of wisdom, used published measures to assess that component, were published in English, had a minimum sample size of 40 participants, and presented data that enabled computation of effect sizes were included in this meta-analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis Random-effect models were used to calculate pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) for each wisdom component and random-effects meta-regression to assess heterogeneity of studies. Main Outcomes and Measures Improvement in wisdom component using published measures. Results Fifty-seven studies (N = 7096 participants) met review criteria: 29 for prosocial behaviors, 13 for emotional regulation, and 15 for spirituality. Study samples included people with psychiatric or physical illnesses and from the community. Of the studies, 27 (47%) reported significant improvement with medium to large effect sizes. Meta-analysis revealed significant pooled SMDs for prosocial behaviors (23 studies; pooled SMD, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.22-0.3]; P = .02), emotional regulation (12 studies; pooled SMD, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.21-1.12]; P = .004), and spirituality (12 studies; pooled SMD, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.41-1.60]; P = .001). Heterogeneity of studies was considerable for all wisdom components. Publication bias was present for prosocial behavior and emotional regulation studies; after adjusting for it, the pooled SMD for prosocial behavior remained significant (SMD, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.16-0.78]; P = .003). Meta-regression analysis found that effect sizes did not vary by wisdom component, although for trials on prosocial behaviors, large effect sizes were associated with older mean participant age (beta, 0.08 [SE, 0.04]), and the reverse was true for spirituality trials (beta, -0.13 [SE, 0.04]). For spirituality interventions, higher-quality trials had larger effect sizes (beta, 4.17 [SE, 1.07]), although the reverse was true for prosocial behavior trials (beta, -0.91 [SE 0.44]). Conclusions and Relevance Interventions to enhance spirituality, emotional regulation, and prosocial behaviors are effective in a proportion of people with mental or physical illnesses and from the community. The modern behavioral epidemics of loneliness, suicide, and opioid abuse point to a growing need for wisdom-enhancing interventions to promote individual and societal well-being.
   This systematic review and meta-analysis examines studies that investigated social, emotional, and spiritual aspects of wisdom.
   Question How effective are interventions to enhance individual components of wisdom? Findings Despite heterogeneity of studies and publication bias, this meta-analysis and meta-regression found that interventions to enhance prosocial behaviors, emotional regulation, and spirituality were generally effective, especially among older participants. Meaning Per this analysis, interventions to enhance prosocial behaviors, emotional regulation, and spirituality are effective in a proportion of individuals with mental or physical illnesses and people from the community.

AB  - Background: Depression is the most common psychiatric sequela after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and poses a variety of treatment challenges. There is a lack of clinical trials focused on biological interventions used to manage TBI depression. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the current evidence of psychotropic and neuromodulatory interventions used to treat TBI depression and to provide directions for future research. Methods: Key words were used to describe the following search terms: "traumatic brain injury", "depression", "pharmacological/drug therapy", and "neuromodulation". Studies focused on pharmacotherapy or neuromodulation in TBI depression were identified in 5 databases: Medline (PubMed), EMBASE (Embase. com), the Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Methodology Register), PsycINFO (EbscoHost), and Web of Science. Article inclusion/exclusion using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)based systematic protocol of extraction and evaluation was applied. Level of evidence for each study was determined using the American Academy of Neurology criteria. Results: The initial search provided 1473 citations. Twenty-two studies met inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies explored pharmacological interventions with emphasis on serotonergic agents. Results between studies were conflicting, and interventions did not always outperform placebos, although sertraline provided the highest level of evidence for treatment of TBI depression. Six studies examining neuromodulatory interventions show preliminary evidence of efficacy with a range of interventions and modes of delivery used. Conclusions: Additional research including large-sample randomized-controlled trials using pharmacological, neuromodulation, or combination treatment is needed. These studies should incorporate premorbid psychosocial functioning, preinjury psychiatric disease, cognitive deficits, and functional recovery when examining outcomes.

AB  - Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, with more than 264 million people affected. On average, depression first appears during the late teens to mid-20s as result of a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis is to assess the association between red and processed meat intake and depression (both incident and prevalent). This systematic review was conducted according to the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Relevant papers published through March 2020 were identified by searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus. All analyses were conducted using ProMeta3 software. A critical appraisal was conducted. Finally, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall effect size (ES) of depression for red and processed meat intake was 1.08 [(95% CI = 1.04; 1.12),p-value < 0.001], based on 241,738 participants. The results from our meta-analysis showed a significant association between red and processed meat intake and risk of depression. The presented synthesis will be useful for health professionals and policy makers to better consider the effect of diet on mental health status.

AB  - Background: Transgender individuals experience unique vulnerabilities to intimate partner violence (IPV) and may experience a disproportionate IPV burden compared with cisgender (nontransgender) individuals.
   Objectives: To systematically review the quantitative literature on prevalence and correlates of IPV in transgender populations.
   Search Methods: Authors searched research databases (PubMed, CINAHL), gray literature (Google), journal tables of contents, and conference abstracts, and consulted experts in the field. Authors were contacted with data requests in cases in which transgender participants were enrolled in a study, but no disaggregated statistics were provided for this population.
   Selection Criteria: We included all quantitative literature published before July 2019 on prevalence and correlates of IPV victimization, perpetration, or service utilization in transgender populations. There were no restrictions by sample size, year, or location.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Two independent reviewers conducted screening. One reviewer conducted extraction by using a structured database, and a second reviewer checked for mistakes or omissions. We used random-effects meta-analyses to calculate relative risks (RRs) comparing the prevalence of IPV in transgender individuals and cisgender individuals in studies in which both transgender and cisgender individuals were enrolled. We also used meta-analysis to compare IPV prevalence in assigned-female-sex-at-birth and assigned-male-sex-at-birth transgender individuals and to compare physical IPV prevalence between nonbinary and binary transgender individuals in studies that enrolled both groups.
   Main Results: We identified 85 articles from 74 unique data sets (n(total) = 49 966 transgender participants). Across studies reporting it, the median lifetime prevalence of physical IPV was 37.5%, lifetime sexual IPV was 25.0%, past-year physical IPV was 16.7%, and past-year sexual IPV was 10.8% among transgender individuals. Compared with cisgender individuals, transgender individuals were 1.7 times more likely to experience any IPV (RR = 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36, 2.03), 2.2 times more likely to experience physical IPV (RR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.66, 2.88), and 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual IPV (RR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.64, 3.69). Disparities persisted when comparing to cisgender women specifically. There was no significant difference in any IPV, physical IPV, or sexual IPV prevalence between assigned-female-sex-at-birth and assigned-male-sex-at-birth individuals, nor in physical IPV prevalence between binary- and nonbinary-identified transgender individuals. IPV victimization was associated with sexual risk, substance use, and mental health burden in transgender populations.
   Authors' Conclusions: Transgender individuals experience a dramatically higher prevalence of IPV victimization compared with cisgender individuals, regardless of sex assigned at birth. IPV prevalence estimates are comparably high for assigned-male-sex-at-birth and assigned-female-sex-at-birth transgender individuals, and for binary and nonbinary transgender individuals, though more research is needed.
   Public Health Implications: Evidence-based interventions are urgently needed to prevent and address IPV in this high-risk population with unique needs. Lack of legal protections against discrimination in employment, housing, and social services likely foster vulnerability to IPV. Transgender individuals should be explicitly included in US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations promoting IPV screening in primary care settings. Interventions at the policy level as well as the interpersonal and individual level are urgently needed to address epidemic levels of IPV in this marginalized, high-risk population.

AB  - Context: Poor physical and mental health and substance use disorder can be causes and consequences of homelessness. Approximately 2.1 million persons per year in the United States experience homelessness. People experiencing homelessness have high rates of emergency department use, hospitalization, substance use treatment, social services use, arrest, and incarceration. Objectives: A standard approach to treating homeless persons with a disability is called Treatment First, requiring clients be "housing ready"-that is, in psychiatric treatment and substance-free-before and while receiving permanent housing. A more recent approach, Housing First, provides permanent housing and health, mental health, and other supportive services without requiring clients to be housing ready. To determine the relative effectiveness of these approaches, this systematic review compared the effects of both approaches on housing stability, health outcomes, and health care utilization among persons with disabilities experiencing homelessness. Design: A systematic search (database inception to February 2018) was conducted using 8 databases with terms such as "housing first," "treatment first," and "supportive housing." Reference lists of included studies were also searched. Study design and threats to validity were assessed using Community Guide methods. Medians were calculated when appropriate. Eligibility Criteria: Studies were included if they assessed Housing First programs in high-income nations, had concurrent comparison populations, assessed outcomes of interest, and were written in English and published in peer-reviewed journals or government reports. Main Outcome Measures: Housing stability, physical and mental health outcomes, and health care utilization. Results: Twenty-six studies in the United States and Canada met inclusion criteria. Compared with Treatment First, Housing First programs decreased homelessness by 88% and improved housing stability by 41%. For clients living with HIV infection, Housing First programs reduced homelessness by 37%, viral load by 22%, depression by 13%, emergency departments use by 41%, hospitalization by 36%, and mortality by 37%. Conclusions: Housing First programs improved housing stability and reduced homelessness more effectively than Treatment First programs. In addition, Housing First programs showed health benefits and reduced health services use. Health care systems that serve homeless patients may promote their health and well-being by linking them with effective housing services.

AB  - Purpose of review Borderline personality disorder (BPD) attracts significant attention from clinicians and researchers alike. Despite increased recognition and willingness to diagnose BPD, most effective treatment approaches remain inaccessible to most. We consider recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of BPD. Recent findings A literature search of EMBASE and PsychINFO, using the search terms 'borderline personality disorder,' 'diagnosis' and 'treatment' for publications since October 2018, yielded over 300 articles and reviews. The literature highlights the increasing awareness of the diagnostic complexity of BPD as well as the emerging significance of 'common factors' and stepped care approaches for managing and treating the disorder. Clinical practice is evolving to embrace more holistic diagnostic approaches, generalist treatment frameworks and stepped-care models that can be tailored to fit individual needs and service resources. The new frontiers in this field include expansion of timely treatment options, improved knowledge regarding the expression and management of BPD in men, adolescents and the elderly, and bridging cultural divides to create a worldwide population approach.

AB  - Paying attention to faces is of special interest for humans as well as for scientific research. The experimental manipulation of facial information offers an ecologically valid approach to investigate emotion, attention and social functioning. Humans are highly specialized in face perception and event-related brain potentials (ERP) provide insights into the temporal dynamics of involved neuronal mechanisms. Here, we summarize ERP research from the last decade, examining the processing of emotional compared to neutral facial expressions along the visual processing stream. A particular focus lies on exploring the impact of attention tasks on early (P1, N170), mid-latency (P2, EPN) and late (P3, LPP) stages of processing. This review systematizes facial emotion effects as a function of different attention tasks: 1) When faces serve as mere distractors, 2) during passive viewing designs, 3) directing attention at faces in general, and 4) paying attention to facial expressions. We find fearful and angry expressions to reliably modulate the N170, EPN, and LPP component, the latter benefiting from attention directed at the emotional facial expression. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose of review Social media's role in a user's life has increased dramatically over the past decade. It is used increasingly as a leisure activity amongst young adults. The types of social media have also diversified with time and the ease of access is worrying. Aim of the current review is to find the effect of social media use on mental health. Recent findings Systematic search of articles was carried out from different database from 1991 to February 2020 across five databases. The PICO guidelines, PRISMA flow diagram and Rayyan software were used in identifying relevant studies which were assessed using the risk of bias. Cross-referencing was done with the co-authors. A total of 16 studies was finally included in the review. Social media role is far reaching both in terms of an individual's self-perception and mood but also on their social relationships. It is interesting to find its effect also in politics, organizations and even psychiatric illnesses. The 16 studies were divided into the positive, negative and neutral effects of social media. Debate over social media's role on mental health will continue till a greater number of RCTs are conducted. Various variables amongst different age groups should be measured. It would also be beneficial if longitudinal research can be done.

AB  - Issue addressed In Australia, natural areas used for outdoor recreation activities or camping often have limited or no sanitation infrastructure. Recreationist and campers may use open defaecation practices where toilets are not provided. Contaminated soils and watercourses are associated with gastrointestinal illnesses. This review aims to determine if open defaecation is a public health issue in outdoor recreation and camping areas in Australia. Method A literature review was conducted using the following search engines: CINAHL, Informit Database, Scopus, ProQuest Science & Technology, Medline (Ovid) and EBSCOhost. Inclusion criteria for this review were both experimental and observational research designs for studies describing the public health issues associated with open defaecation practice. Results Out of 12 147 papers identified, only three studies met the inclusion criteria, showing a lack of research into this area. Included were two studies that addressed human waste management practices in outdoor environments and the breakdown of human waste in alpine regions of Tasmania. The third study measured water contamination at a freshwater beach on K'gari-Fraser Island, Queensland. Visitors to natural areas are potentially at high risk of illness due to exposure to faecal contamination from other visitors using unsafe open defaecation practices in high-use camping areas. Conclusion The limited number of studies addressing open defaecation in the outdoor recreation and camp areas in Australia indicates this review is a starting point to identify critical areas that may be of concern when managing visitors in an outdoor recreation setting. This review recommends investigating barriers and enablers motivating human disposal waste in these settings to help formulate health promotion content; environmental management policies related to sanitation and hygiene should be also underpinned by public health policy; and providing appropriate sanitation options depending on the ecological and visitor numbers to natural areas. So what-relevance of findings Outdoor recreation activities offer physical and mental health benefits for communities. The popularity of outdoor recreation activities is on the increase in Australia. With the rise in visitation to natural areas, management of human waste needs to be addressed to reduce the public health risk of illness.

AB  - Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is frequently associated with emotion dysregulation (ED) that is characterized by excessive and inappropriate emotional reactions. Children with ADHD and ED present significant social, academic and family functioning impairments. These findings indicate that ED should be regularly monitored in children with ADHD and should be managed with targeted therapeutic interventions. However, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions to manage ED in children with ADHD. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for children with ADHD and ED, particularly their benefits and limitations. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) model. A systematic literature search of different databases in February 2018 allowed the identification of five randomized controlled trials, one quasi experimental study, and four open-label uncontrolled studies. Analysis of the results reported in these studies suggested that psychosocial interventions can improve severe irritability and aggressive behavior in children with ADHD and ED. However, the short trial duration, the lack of follow-up and of control group in several studies, and the heterogeneity of the outcome measures affected the result interpretation. Future studies should use standardized measures of ED and larger samples.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify and evaluate the impact of interventions to improve or reduce insomnia in the workforce through randomized clinical trials. Following the recommendations of the PRISMA and MARS statement, a systematic literature search was carried out on the PubMed, Web of Science, CINHAL, and PsycINFO databases, with no restrictions on the language or publication date. For the meta-analysis, a random-effects model and theInsomnia Severity Indexwere used as outcome measures. To assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence, the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the GRADE method were used, respectively. Twenty-two studies were included in the systematic review and 12 studies in the meta-analysis, making a total of 14 intervention groups with a sample of 827 workers. Cognitive behavioral therapy was the most widely used intervention. According to the estimated difference between the means, a moderate effect for the reduction of insomnia symptoms after the intervention (MD -2.08, CI 95%: [-2.68, -1.47]) and a non-significant degree of heterogeneity were obtained (p= 0.64; I-2= 0%). The quality of the evidence and the risk of bias were moderate. The results suggest that interventions on insomnia in the workplace are effective for improving workers' health, and that improvements in the quality of sleep and a decrease in the symptoms of insomnia are produced, thanks to an increase in weekly sleeping hours and a reduction in latency at sleep onset. As regards work, they also led to improvements in productivity, presenteeism, and job burnout.

Inclusion criteria were: (i) the study was a (cluster) randomized controlled trial, (ii) the subjects were aged >= 59 years without mental illnesses, (iii) an intervention arm performing MBI compared to a non-exercise control group (e.g., wait-list or usual care), (iv) psychological health outcomes related to QoL, depressive symptoms, FoF or sleep quality were assessed and (v) a PEDro score of >= 5. The interventions of the included studies were sub-grouped into Tai Chi/Qigong (TCQ) and Yoga/Pilates (YP). Statistical analyses were conducted using a random-effects inverse-variance model.Results: Thirty-seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (comprising 3224 participants) were included. Small to moderate-but-significant overall effect sizes favoring experimental groups (Hedges'g: 0.25 to 0.71) compared to non-exercise control groups were observed in all outcomes (allpvalues <= 0.007), apart from one subdomain of quality of life (i.e., social functioning,p= 0.15). Interestingly, a significant larger effect on QoL and depressive symptoms with increasing training frequency was found for TCQ (p= 0.03;p= 0.004).Conclusions: MBI involving meditative movements may serve as a promising opportunity to improve psychological health domains such as QoL, depressive symptoms, FoF and sleep quality in older adults. Hence, these forms of exercise may represent potential preventive measures regarding the increase of late-life mental disorders, which need to be further confirmed by future research.

AB  - Extensive research documents the health inequalities LGBTI people experience, however far less is known for people with intersex variation. This paper presents a review of intersex health and healthcare inequalities by evaluating research published from 2012 to 2019. In total 9181 citations were identified with 74 records screened of which 16 were included. A synthesis of results spans nine quantitative, five qualitative and two narrative reviews. Literature was searched in Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane, PsycInfo and CINAHL. People with intersex variance experience a higher incidence of anxiety, depression and psychological distress compared to the general population linked to stigma and discrimination. Progressive healthcare treatment, including support to question normative binaries of sex and gender, aids understand of somatic intersex variance and non-binary gender identity, especially when invasive treatment options are avoided or delayed until individuals are able to self-identify or provide consent to treatment. Findings support rethinking sex and gender to reflect greater diversity within a more nuanced sex-gender spectrum, although gaps in research remain around the general health profile and the healthcare experiences of people with intersex variance. More large-scale research is needed, co-produced with peers who have lived experience of intersex variation to ensure policy, education and healthcare advances with greater inclusivity and ethical accountability.

AB  - Background: As mental health services in outpatient medical clinics expand, psychiatrists must be trained to practice in these settings. Objectives: The Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry residency education subcommittee convened a writing group with the goal of summarizing the current evidence about outpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) training and providing a framework for CLP educators who are interested in developing outpatient CLP rotations within their programs. Method: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, and PsycINFO (via OVID) were reviewed each from inception to December 2019, for psychiatric CLP services in ambulatory settings that involved residents or fellows. The CLP education guidelines were reviewed for recommendations relevant to outpatient CLP. We also searched MedEd portal for published curriculums relevant to CLP. The group held 2 conferences to reach consensus about recommendations in setting up outpatient CLP rotations. Results: Seventeen articles, 3 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry- supported guidelines, and 8 online didactic resources were identified as directly reporting on the organization and/or impact of an outpatient CLP rotation. These manuscripts indicated that residents found outpatient CLP rotations effective and relevant to their future careers. However, the literature provided few recommendations for establishing formal outpatient CLP training experiences. Conclusions: Outpatient CLP rotations offer multiple benefits for trainees, including exposure to specific clinical scenarios and therapeutic interventions applicable only in the outpatient setting, increased continuity of care, and the unique experience of providing liaison and education to non-mental health providers. The article outlines recommendations and examples for developing outpatient CLP rotations which CLP educators can incorporate in their programs.

AB  - Objective To investigate the prevalence of occupational burnout among ophthalmologists in order to better understand the mental and physical well-being of eye physicians and surgeons in the professional workplace. Study Design A systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Online computer databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched systematically and thoroughly. Conferences held through Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and Canadian Society of Ophthalmology were searched. Studies were screened using Covidence software. Data on reported burnout prevalence was extracted. STATA 15.0 was used to conduct meta-analysis. Synthesis:Our search strategy identified 318 records from online databases and 11 records from grey literature search, which were screened at 2-levels. Title and abstracts of each record were screened resulting in 24 records moving to full-text screening. Total of 9 records were utilized for quantitative analysis in the data extraction stage. Our results indicated significant professional burnout among ophthalmologists (ES = 0.41; CI: [0.26, 0.56]) with significant emotional exhaustion (ES = 0.43; CI: [0.33, 0.53]), depersonalization (ES = 0.29; CI: [0.13, 0.46]), and a low sense of personal accomplishment (ES = 0.36; CI: [0.08, 0.63]). Conclusions Significant occupational burnout among ophthalmologists is concerning because burnout can have a negative effect on the physical and mental health of eye physicians and surgeons. It could impact productivity, cutbacks in work hours, or lead to early retirement from the profession. Contributing factors in ophthalmologist burnout including work overload need to be addressed in a timely manner.

AB  - Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may stem from the formation of aberrant and enduring aversive memories. Some PTSD patients have recreationally usedCannabis, probably aiming at relieving their symptomatology. However, it is still largely unknown whether and howCannabisor its psychotomimetic compound Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) attenuates the aversive/traumatic memory outcomes. Here, we seek to review and discuss the effects of THC on aversive memory extinction and anxiety in healthy humans and PTSD patients. Methods Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Central Register for Controlled Trials databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed published studies and randomized controlled trials in humans published in English between 1974 and July 2020, including those using only THC and THC combined with cannabidiol (CBD). The effect size of the experimental intervention under investigation was calculated. Results At low doses, THC can enhance the extinction rate and reduce anxiety responses. Both effects involve the activation of cannabinoid type-1 receptors in discrete components of the corticolimbic circuitry, which could couterbalance the low "endocannabinoid tonus" reported in PTSD patients. The advantage of associating CBD with THC to attenuate anxiety while minimizing the potential psychotic or anxiogenic effect produced by high doses of THC has been reported. The effects of THC either alone or combined with CBD on aversive memory reconsolidation, however, are still unknown. Conclusions Current evidence from healthy humans and PTSD patients supports the THC value to suppress anxiety and aversive memory expression without producing significant adverse effects if used in low doses or when associated with CBD. Future studies are guaranteed to address open questions related to their dose ratios, administration routes, pharmacokinetic interactions, sex-dependent differences, and prolonged efficacy.

AB  - Much has been written about the placebo effects in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD), especially in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), driven by the early hypothesis that in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IBS, the placebo effect might be specifically high and thus, corrupts the efficacy of novel drugs developed for this condition. This narrative review is based on a specific search method, a database (www.jips.online) developed since 2004 containing more than 4,500 papers (data papers, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, reviews) pertinent to the topic placebo effects/placebo response. Three central questions-deducted from the body of current literature-are addressed to explore the evidence behind this hypothesis: What is the size placebo effect in FGD, especially in IBS, and is it different from the placebo effect seen in other gastrointestinal disorders? Is the placebo effect in FGD different from other functional, non-intestinal disorders,e.g.in other pain syndromes? Is the placebo effect in FGD related to placebo effects seen in psychiatry,e.g.in depression, anxiety disorders, and alike? Following this discussion, a fourth question is raised as the result of the three: What are the consequences of this for future drug trials in FGD? In summary it is concluded that, contrary to common belief and discussion, the placebo effect seen in RCT in FGD is not specifically high and extraordinary as compared to other comparable (i.e.functional) disorders. It shares less than expected commonalities with the placebo effect in psychiatry, and very few predictors have yet been identified that determine its effect size, especially some that are driven by design features of the studies. Current practice of RCT in IBS seems to limit and control the placebo effect quite well, and future trial practice,e.g.head-to-head trial, still offers options to maintain this control, even in the absence of placebos used.

AB  - Parenting is a broad construct that comprises stable and durable attitudes and behaviors regarding child-rearing. Since mothers and fathers play different roles in the family, parenting styles and practices in childhood and adolescence may differ depending on the parents' and adolescents' gender. While gender differences in parenting are theoretically warranted, the research literature in this field is considerably limited and lacking conclusive information dealing with this question. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to aggregate and synthesize the available research studies containing significant findings on the differences between mothers and fathers in parenting styles and practices. For that purpose, we conducted a systematic search of the PsycInfo, Scopus, Eric, and Web of Science databases, covering literature published from 1990 to 2020. The search was restricted to peer-reviewed studies in English alone. Our findings reveal that mothers as compared to fathers are perceived as more accepting, responsive, and supportive, as well as more behaviorally controlling, demanding, and autonomy granting than fathers. Accordingly, in the studies comparing parents on the constructs of overall parenting styles, mothers were predominantly more authoritative than fathers, and fathers were mostly more authoritarian than mothers (based on both parent and descendant reports). These parental differences established by research from over 15 countries around the globe seem to apply similarly for male and female descendants, while principally not varying by their age.

AB  - Salt spray mainly originates from the bursting of bubbles in breaking waves and is often considered as one of the dominant factors contributing to vegetation zonation in coastal dunes. In this paper, the literature on salt spray distribution and impact on dune plants are reviewed. Salt spray distribution is greatly affected by wave energy, wind conditions, distance from the coast, topography, vegetation, precipitation, and sand/soil properties. The amount of salt accumulation and trapping efficiency of the vegetative canopy are largely dependent on the plant characteristics such as architecture and leaf morphology. Salt concentrations in sand mainly vary with soil texture. Salt spray has negative impacts on plant growth and can cause water stress, promote tissue necrosis and leaf loss, reduce stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, photosynthesis, affect assimilates, or hormone supply to the growing organs. Damage to plants is increased by sand and wind abrasion and insect damage on leaves. High humidity, dew formation, light drizzle, and fog increase the rates of salt uptake by plant leaves. Plant seedlings and reproductive organs are more significantly affected by salt spray compared with mature plants and plant leaves respectively. Salt spray can also provide nutrition to plants particularly in coastal dunes with lower soil nutrition and salt accumulation rates. Species near the sea often show phenological, morphological, and physiological adaptations to salt spray including dormant times/seasons, low heights, compacted and asymmetrical canopies, unique leaf morphologies and/or orientations, dense hairs, rigid cuticles, and closed stomata. Surfactants produced from human activities can aggravate the damage on plants at average salt spray levels. Methods to trap salt vary considerably in the literature, and results from different studies may not be comparable due to trap type, placement, and landscape position. Greenhouse versus field experiments and sampling may not always be compatible. The relations between salt spray distribution and vegetation zonation will be further complicated under climate change and human activities.

AB  - Objectives To systematically review and meta-analyze the psychological effects and mortality rate in inmates having been exposed to solitary confinement in correctional settings. Methods PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched using keywords describing solitary confinement in combination with keywords for psychological or mortality outcomes. Eligible case-control studies for the systematic review met an operational definition for solitary confinement and evaluated outcomes after exposure to such confinement. Studies presenting statistical data which allowed to compute standardized mean differences for symptom scales or odds ratio for mortality were further meta-analyzed using random-effects models. Results Systematic review identified 13 studies for inclusion, with a total sample of 382,440 inmates (23% having been exposed to solitary confinement). Higher quality evidence showed solitary confinement was associated with an increase in adverse psychological effects, self-harm, and mortality, especially by suicide. Meta-analysis of five studies (n = 4,517) showed a standardized mean difference of 0.45 for general psychological symptomatology, which increased to 0.51 upon outlier exclusion. Small to moderate significant effects were observed for mood, psychotic, and hostility symptoms specifically. In addition, meta-analysis of two mortality studies (n = 243,050) showed a trend for a moderate effect for mortality by any or unnatural causes (i.e., suicide, homicide, overdose, and accidents). Conclusions Analyses showed that solitary confinement is associated with the psychological deterioration of inmates. This effect appears to be beyond that of general incarceration or presence of prior mental illness. Thus, solitary confinement may pose significant harm for inmates. Still, further studies are required to show that exposure to SC can increase risk of post-release death. Finally, add-on treatments and alternatives to solitary confinement that could alleviate the associated psychological harm are discussed.

AB  - Background Exercise may be a promising target for depression interventions. However, evidence for a beneficial effect of exercise interventions on the prevention of depression differs substantially across different studies. Methods A systematic search was performed up to July 2018 using PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane. Articles were included if a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed that examined the effect of exercise interventions on the onset of depression or depressive symptoms in the general population. Meta-analyses focusing on treatment of diagnosed depression were excluded. Two authors independently screened the articles and graded the quality of included meta-analyses using AMSTAR 2. Results Eight meta-analyses were included that showed little overlap in 134 included studies. All meta-analyses reported on depressive symptoms rather than onset of depression. Five of these were rated as moderate quality and three of low quality. Six meta-analyses found significant effects, and two found non-significant effects of exercise interventions in reducing depressive symptoms in children, adolescents, adults and the elderly (effect sizes ranging from - 0.10 to - 0.81). Scarce evidence did not allow to draw conclusions about the role of sex and characteristics of exercise on depression. However, some findings suggest that low intensity exercise was as effective as high intensity exercise. Heterogeneity among primary studies was high, likely caused by differences in study quality and exercise characteristics. Conclusions The evidence from this study suggests that exercise interventions have a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms in the general population across a wide age-range.

AB  - The categorical approach to defining schizophrenia spectrum disorders requires meeting established criteria. To advance early identification and intervention in young people, the field has progressed to studying help-seeking individuals who are at clinical high risk based on subthreshold psychosis spectrum symptoms, and criteria have been articulated for qualifying individuals as at risk. A broader dimensional examination of psychosis has been applied to population-based studies on non-help seekers. This review highlights the ascertainment and assessment approaches to such population-based studies. Most studies are cross-sectional and rely on questionnaires with limited overlap of tools. However, several consistent findings emerge on symptoms, neurocognitive deficits, and neuroimaging parameters and other biomarkers associated with emergence and persistence of psychotic features. The findings are consistent with the literature on abnormalities associated with schizophrenia, including the presence of neurocognitive deficits; abnormalities in brain structure, function, and connectivity that are related to distress; impairment; and functional outcome. These findings support the validity of studying psychosis experiences during development in a way that can chart the emergence of psychosis in the context of general psychopathology. Such studies are necessary for establishing developmental trajectories that characterize this emergence and for identifying risk and resilience biomarkers moderating or modulating the full range of schizophrenia-related manifestations. More community-based studies are needed, with better standardization and harmonization of measures and incorporating longitudinal follow-up, to establish mechanistic links between cellular-molecular aberrations and specific manifes-tations of psychosis as envisioned by the precision medicine agenda.

AB  - According to the stress-diathesis model of suicidal behavior, completed suicide depends on the interaction between psychosocial stressors and a trait-like susceptibility. While there are likely multiple biological processes at play in suicidal behavior, recent findings point to over-activation of microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, as implicated in stress-induced suicidal behavior. However, it remains unclear how microglial dysregulation can be integrated into a clinical model of suicidal behavior. Therefore, this narrative review aims to (1) examine the findings from human post-mortem and neuroimaging studies that report a relationship between microglial activation and suicidal behavior, and (2) update the clinical model of suicidal behavior to integrate the role of microglia. A systematic search of SCOPUS, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases revealed evidence of morphological alterations in microglia and increased translocator protein density in the brains of individuals with suicidality, pointing to a positive relationship between microglial dysregulation and suicidal behavior. The studies also suggested several pathological mechanisms leading to suicidal behavior that may involve microglial dysregulation, namely (1) enhanced metabolism of tryptophan to quinolinic acid through the kynurenine pathway and associated serotonin depletion; (2) increased quinolinic acid leading to excessive N-methyl-D-aspartate-signaling, resulting in potential disruption of the blood brain barrier; (3) increased quinolinic acid resulting in higher neurotoxicity, and; (4) elevated interleukin 6 contributing to loss of inhibition of glutamatergic neurons, causing heightened glutamate release and excitotoxicity. Based on these pathways, we reconceptualized the stress-diathesis theory of suicidal behavior to incorporate the role of microglial activity.

AB  - Yoga is a holistic practice that - when incorporated effectively into neurorehabilitation - has potential to meet the complex needs of persons with acquired brain injury (ABI). This systematic review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, investigated cognitive, physical, and psychological outcomes following controlled trials of yoga for ABI. The search returned six eligible studies, four of which focused specifically on stroke rehabilitation. For persons with ABI broadly, within-group improvements were found after yoga for psychological and physical adjustment, quality of life, and respiratory functioning. For stroke specifically, physical and memory recovery was greater in the yoga group vs. exercise control, and within-group improvements were noted for motor functioning, self-efficacy, and quality of life outcomes. Lack of (1) between-group analyses despite the inclusion of control groups, and (2) a common yoga rehabilitation protocol including frequency, length, and duration of yoga must be addressed in future research to establish efficacy of these interventions. Considerations for psychophysiological outcome measures and cultural factors are presented in the context of future research and clinical directions.

AB  - Numerous studies showed that factors influencing fetal development and neonatal period could lead to lasting alterations in the brain of the offspring, in turn increasing the risk for eating disorders (EDs). This work aims to systematically and critically review the literature on the association of prenatal and perinatal factors with the onset of EDs in the offspring, updating previous findings and focusing on anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). A systematic literature search was performed on Pubmed, PsycINFO, and Scopus. The drafting of this systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA statement criteria and the methodological quality of each study was assessed by the MMAT 2018. A total of 37 studies were included in this review. The factors that showed a more robust association with AN were higher maternal age, preeclampsia and eclampsia, multiparity, hypoxic complications, prematurity, or being born preterm (< 32 weeks) and small for gestational age or lower birth size. BN was only associated with maternal stress during pregnancy. Many methodological flaws emerged in the considered studies, so further research is needed to clarify these inconsistencies. Altogether, data are suggestive of an association between prenatal and perinatal factors and the onset of EDs in the offspring. Nevertheless, given the methodological quality of the available literature, firm conclusions cannot be drawn and whether this vulnerability is specific to EDs or mental disorders remains to be defined. Also, a strong need for longitudinal and well-designed studies on this topic emerged.

AB  - Background In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the mismatch between the number of individuals needing and those receiving treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUD) is substantial. In order to provide suggestions for the scaling up of effective service provision we systematically reviewed the current evidence on the effectiveness of AUD-focused psychosocial interventions in LMIC. Methods We used a systematic review methodology following the PRISMA guidelines. Twelve electronic databases listing published and grey literature were searched and only randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Where possible, effect sizes were calculated using Hedges'gindices. Results Twenty-one RCTs conducted in 15 different LMIC between 1992 and 2018 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Most studies employed brief one-on-one interventions facilitated by trained primary care staff. Eighty-six percent of RCTs based their interventions on the principles of motivational interviewing (MI) with the majority supplementing MI-based interventions with alcohol-tailored elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The remaining RCTs employed CBT-components exclusively. Just over 40% of studies included in quantitative analyses (n=17) yielded an at least medium-sized effect (g >=.50) of the respective intervention compared to alcohol-related and unrelated control conditions or waiting list. Only half of the trials implementing the widely applied MI-based approaches (or MI-based approaches blended with CBT-elements) were superior to their respective control conditions. Conclusion To date, a relatively small number of RCTs investigating AUD-focused treatments has been conducted in LMIC. The majority of between condition effect size estimates were small and no type of intervention can clearly be recommended over another. No RCTs were conducted in conflict-affected areas in LMIC although they would merit particular attention since AUD is often linked to trauma-related mental health disorders. More RCTs in LMIC are required and alternatives to MI-based approaches should be investigated. This systematic review summarizes properties of effective interventions and provides implications for future research.

AB  - If illness behaviour is to be fully understood, the social and behavioural sciences must work together to understand the wider forms in which illness is experienced and communicated with individuals and society. The current paper synthesised literature across social and behavioural sciences exploring illness experience and communication through physical and mental images. It argues that images may have the capacity to embody and influence beliefs, emotions, and health outcomes. While four commonalities exist, facilitating understandings of illness behaviour across the fields (i.e., understanding the importance of the patient perspective; perception of the cause, sense of identity with the illness, consequences, and level of control; health beliefs influencing illness experience, behaviours, and outcomes; and understanding illness beliefs and experiences through an almost exclusive focus on the written or spoken word), we will focus on exploring the fourth commonality. The choice to focus on the role of images on illness behaviour is due to the proliferation of interventions using image-based approaches. While these novel approaches show merit, there is a scarcity of theoretical underpinnings and explorations into the ways in which these are developed and into how people perceive and understand their own illnesses using image representations. The current paper identified that the use of images can elucidate patient and practitioner understandings of illness, facilitate communication, and potentially influence illness behaviours. It further identified commonalities across the social and behavioural sciences to facilitate theory informed understandings of illness behaviour which could be applied to visual intervention development to improve health outcomes.

AB  - This is the first review to rigorously examine the mediating role of cognitive factors in the relationship between childhood trauma and subsequent adult psychopathology, and highlight areas for future research. A database search (Child Development & Adolescent Studies, ERIC, Global Health, PsycARTICLES, and PsycINFO) was conducted to identify empirical studies on cognitive factors, explaining the relationship between different types of adverse childhood experiences and adult psychopathology across clinical and nonclinical populations. A narrative synthesis and appraisal of the methodological quality of the studies was conducted. Ninety-eight mediation studies were identified, comprising 4,137 clinical and 28,228 nonclinical participants. Despite great variation in methodological quality of the studies, our narrative synthesis suggests that cognitive factors mediate the relationship between early trauma and later psychopathology. This finding is consistent across different measures of traumatic experiences, psychopathology, and cognitive mediators. Cognitive mediators represent potentially valuable intervention targets for (non)clinical patients who have experienced childhood adversity. Future studies are needed to (a) establish longitudinal causal connections, and (b) assess the effect of interventions that specifically target cognitive change in patients with different levels and types of pathology.

Methods The authors collected articles through a search into Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and the Cochrane Review. Search terms used included "Lipoedema," "Lipedema," "psychological status," "Quality of life," "Health related quality of life," and "HRQOL." Results A total of four observational studies were evaluated. The included studies were moderate-quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Three of the included studies demonstrated deterioration of HRQOL and psychological status in patients with lipedema. These studies also identify that pain and tenderness are a more common and dominant characteristic. Conclusion Future studies should establish a specific approach to treat and manage lipedema symptoms. Based on this narrative review of the literature findings, we recommended for the health care provider to pay more attention to HRQOL and psychological status. Moreover, validated and adapted measures of HRQOL and psychological status for patients with lipedema are required.

AB  - Objectives: Sick leave imposes large costs on society, and job strain is one of the factors leading to sick leave. A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies was conducted to address job strain and its association with sick leave.
   Study design: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: PubMed and Scopus databases were reviewed, in addition to searches in Google Scholar and ResearchGate to ensure the inclusion of any grey literature articles. After screening the studies, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses principles, articles with longitudinal design were found desirable for meta-analysis. The risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated, and publication bias was examined.
   Results: Eighteen longitudinal cohort studies were selected. Job strain and sick leave were found to be associated, and the RR of this association was equal to 1.44. Risk of sick leave based on job strain in men and women was equal to 1.66 (95% CI: 1.15-2.40) and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.08-1.24), respectively. The results showed no publication bias as per Begg's test.
   Conclusions: Job strain was associated with an increased risk of sick leave. Occupational conditions have significant effects on the risk of sick leave one of which is job strain. Therefore, improving organisational conditions can have a significant impact on reducing sick leave. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Major depressive disorder is a common psychiatric disorder associated with marked suffering, morbidity, mortality, and cost. The World Health Organization projects that by 2030, major depression will be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide. While numerous treatments for major depression exist, many patients do not respond adequately to traditional antidepressants. Thus, more effective treatments for major depression are needed, and targeting certain hormonal systems is a conceptually based approach that has shown promise in the treatment of this disorder. A number of hormones and hormone-manipulating compounds have been evaluated as monotherapies or adjunctive treatments for major depression, with therapeutic actions attributable not only to the modulation of endocrine systems in the periphery but also to the CNS effects of hormones on non-endocrine brain circuitry. The authors describe the physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA), hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid (HPT), and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes and review the evidence for selected hormone-based interventions for the treatment of depression in order to provide an update on the state of this field for clinicians and researchers. The review focuses on the HPA axis-based interventions of corticotropin-releasing factor antagonists and the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone, the HPT axis-based treatments of thyroid hormones (T(3 )and T-4), and the HPG axis-based treatments of estrogen replacement therapy, the progesterone derivative allopregnanolone, and testosterone. While some treatments have largely failed to translate from preclinical studies, others have shown promising initial results and represent active fields of study in the search for novel effective treatments for major depression.

AB  - Detecting signs for an increased level of risk during driving are critical for the effective prevention of road traffic accidents. The current study searched for literature through major databases such as PubMed, EBSCO, IEEE, and ScienceDirect. A total of 14 articles that measured P300 components in relation to driving tasks were included for a systematic review and meta-analysis. The risk factors investigated in the reviewed articles were summarized in five categories, including reduced attention, distraction, alcohol, challenging situations on the road, and negative emotion. A meta-analysis was conducted at both behavioral and neural levels. Behavioral performance was measured by the reaction time and driving performance, while the neural response was measured by P300 amplitude and latency. A significant increase in reaction time was identified when drivers were exposed to the risk factors. In addition, the significant effects of a reduced P300 amplitude and prolonged P300 latency indicated a reduced capacity for cognitive information processing. There was a tendency of driving performance decrement in relation to the risk factors, however, the effect was non-significant due to considerable variations and heterogeneity across the included studies. The results led to the conclusion that the P300 amplitude and latency are reliable indicators and predictors of the increased risk in driving. Future applications of the P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system may make considerable contributions toward preventing road traffic accidents.

AB  - Background Self-harm is a leading cause of morbidity in prisoners. Although a wide range of risk factors for self-harm in prisoners has been identified, the strength and consistency of effect sizes is uncertain. We aimed to synthesise evidence and assess the risk factors associated with self-harm inside prison.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) for observational studies on risk factors for self-harm in prisoners published from database inception to Oct 31, 2019, supplemented through correspondence with authors of studies. We included primary studies involving adults sampled from general prison populations who self-harmed in prison and a comparison group without self-harm in prison. We excluded studies with qualitative or ecological designs, those that reported on lifetime measures of self-harm or on selected samples of prisoners, and those with a comparison group that was not appropriate or not based on general prison populations. Data were extracted from the articles and requested from study authors. Our primary outcome was the risk of self-harm for risk factors in prisoners. We pooled effect sizes as odds ratios (OR) using random effects models for each risk factor examined in at least three distinct samples. We assessed study quality on the basis of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and examined between-study heterogeneity. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018087915.
   Findings We identified 35 independent studies from 20 countries comprising a total of 663 735 prisoners, of whom 24 978 (3.8%) had self-harmed in prison. Across the 40 risk factors examined, the strongest associations with self-harm in prison were found for suicide-related antecedents, including current or recent suicidal ideation (OR 13.8, 95% CI 8.6-22.1; I-2=49%), lifetime history of suicidal ideation (8.9, 6.1-13.0; I-2=56%), and previous self-harm (6.6, 5.3-8.3; I-2=55%). Any current psychiatric diagnosis was also strongly associated with self-harm (8.1, 7.0-9.4; I-2=0%), particularly major depression (9.3, 2.9-29.5; I-2=91%) and borderline personality disorder (9.2, 3.7-22.5; I-2=81%). Prison-specific environmental risk factors for self-harm included solitary confinement (5.6, 2.7-11.6; I-2=98%), disciplinary infractions (3.5, 1.2-9.7; I-2=99%), and experiencing sexual or physical victimisation while in prison (3.2, 2.1-4.8; I-2=44%). Sociodemographic (OR range 1.5-2.5) and criminological (1.8-2.3) factors were only modestly associated with selfharm in prison. We did not find clear evidence of publication bias.
   Interpretation The wide range of risk factors across clinical and custody-related domains underscores the need for a comprehensive, prison-wide approach towards preventing self-harm in prison. This approach should incorporate both population and targeted strategies, with multiagency collaboration between the services for mental health, social care, and criminal justice having a key role.

AB  - A better understanding of context in decision-making-that is, the internal and external conditions that modulate decisions-is required to help bridge the gap between natural behaviors that evolved by natural selection and more arbitrary laboratory models of anxiety and fear. Because anxiety and fear are mechanisms evolved to manage threats from predators and other exigencies, the large behavioral, ecological and evolutionary literature on predation risk is useful for re-framing experimental research on human anxiety-related disorders. We review the trade-offs that are commonly made during antipredator decision-making in wild animals along with the context under which the behavior is performed and measured, and highlight their relevance for focused laboratory models of fear and anxiety. We then develop an integrative mechanistic model of decision-making under risk which, when applied to laboratory and field settings, should improve studies of the biological basis of normal and pathological anxiety and may therefore improve translational outcomes.

AB  - Politics permeates everyday life, often evoking negative emotions among the public and affecting their well-being. Politics has, in essence, become a chronic stressor for many. Fortunately, people can protect themselves from politics: people commonly employ emotion regulation strategies to help reduce their negative emotional responses to politics and thereby protect emotional well-being. However, this protection may also come at a cost when people lose their affectively-driven motivation to take action aimed at changing the political system that evoked the negative emotions in the first place. Here, we review the recent literature examining emotion regulation and political action, considering both the benefits and costs of emotion regulation. Finally, we outline several important unresolved questions to guide future research.

AB  - Introduction: While some families may experience poor mental health, substance use, and poor school performance due to service life, the usefulness and applicability of these research findings may be affected by how representative study participants are of the broader population. This article aims to examine how research on mental health and substance use defines a "military family" to understand if the current body of evidence reflects the increasing diversity of this population. Methods: A systematic search of academic articles was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, Ebsco CINAHL and ProQuest PILOTS using database-specific subject headings and keyword searches for 'military', 'family', 'mental health' and 'substance use'. Sociodemographic and military characteristics of study participants were extracted to identify who was and was not included. Results: The most commonly represented family structure was the traditional, heteronormative family comprised of a male service member married to a female civilian with whom they have children. Military couples without children, dual-serving couples, families of LGBTQ personnel, unmarried and new relationships, single parents, male spouses/partners, Veterans not seeking Veterans Affairs (VA) services, and families with additional challenges were regularly not reflected in the research due to implicit or explicit exclusion from studies. Discussion: Research on mental health and substance use among the family members of service personnel continues to reflect the traditional, heteronormative family. Future studies should consider more inclusive definitions of family and creative approaches to recruitment to ensure research in this area reflects the experiences, needs, and strengths of an increasingly diverse military community.

AB  - Although approximately 90% of the U.S. population will experience a traumatic event within their lifetime, only a fraction of those traumatized individuals will develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In fact, approximately 7 out of 100 people in the U.S. will be afflicted by this debilitating condition, which suggests there is substantial inter-individual variability in susceptibility to PTSD. This uncertainty regarding who is susceptible to PTSD necessitates a thorough understanding of the neurobiological processes that underlie PTSD development in order to build effective predictive models for the disorder. In turn, these predictive models may lead to the development of improved diagnostic markers, early intervention techniques, and targeted treatment approaches for PTSD. Prior research has characterized a fear learning and memory network, centered on the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, that plays a key role in the pathology of PTSD. Importantly, changes in the function, structure, and biochemistry of this network appear to underlie the cognitive-affective dysfunction observed in PTSD. The current review discusses prior research that has demonstrated alterations in brain function, structure, and biochemistry associated with PTSD. Further, the potential for future research to address current gaps in our understanding of the neural processes that underlie the development of PTSD is discussed. Specifically, this review emphasizes the need for multimodal neuroimaging research and investigations into the acute effects of posttraumatic stress. The present review provides a framework to move the field towards a comprehensive neurobiological model of PTSD.

AB  - The growing field of equine-assisted psychotherapy (EAP), a subfield of animal-assisted psychotherapy (AAP), needs theoretically-based clinical studies. This systematic review examines the existing clinical studies in adult populations on psychodynamic psychotherapy combined with equine-assisted psychotherapy. An electronic database search was divided in two studies to identify publications on 1) EAP combined with psychodynamic psychotherapy and 2) EAP combined to personality problems and traumatization in order to compile studies by population, intervention, outcome and therapeutic assets. Study 1 revealed no relevant clinical studies on EAP with a psychodynamic background with an adult population. Study 2 revealed 12 publications to review predominantly addressing veterans with PTSD. The methodological limitations of most of the studies restrain the overall findings on outcome. However, overall positive effects for EAP, specifically on its experiential features and on finding interpersonal trust for patients, can be discerned. There is an apparent need for clinical studies meeting methodological standards on psychodynamic underpinned EAP methodologies in adults with intertwined personality problems and traumatization.

AB  - Background: Assessing the quality of life in HIV/AIDS patients is of great importance not only for evaluating the effect of the disease, but also to measure the impact of the interventions in order to improve their quality of life in clinical researches. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients in Iran.
   Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the literature search using the related chain of keywords was conducted from 1 Jan 1987 to 30 Apr 2019 in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Iranian Scientific Information Database (SID), and Magiran. Moreover, hand search of the key journals and the gray literature was performed. The meta-analysis was performed by CMA2 software.
   Results: Out of the 1576 retrieved records, eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the patients was 37.15 +/- 9.46 years. The average score of quality of life before and after sensitivity analysis was (39.13 [28.36-49.901 95% CI P>0.000] vs. 49.05 [46.31-51.79 95% CI P>0.000]). Moreover, the average score of quality of life was respectively 38.86 +/- 3.83 vs. 40 +/- 6.37 among married compared with single patients, 56.33 +/- 4.67 vs. 43.64 +/- 1.94 for employment vs. unemployment status. While quality of life was measured in terms of education level, the score was 29.59 +/- 9.34 vs. 41.65 +/- 4.45 in the individuals with primary school versus academic education.
   Conclusion: The QOL score of the HIV/AIDS patients in Iran was significantly low. Therefore, the study highlights the importance of strengthening efforts to undertake necessary investigations in order to provide adequate health insurance, extensive and affordable welfare services, and more appropriate social and mental supports in order to improve the quality of life of the individuals with HIV/AIDS in Iran.

AB  - (1) Background: Women with personality disorder are at risk of social and emotional problems which impact deleteriously on everyday functioning. Moreover, a personality disorder diagnosis has been established to have an adverse impact upon pregnancy outcomes and child health. Understanding this impact is critical to improving both maternal and child outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the contemporary evidence regarding these relationships. (2) Methods: Prospero and Cochrane were searched for any systematic reviews already completed on this topic. Academic Search Premier, CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO via the EBSCO host, and the Web of Science Core Collection were searched to include research articles published between 1980 and 2019. A total of 158 records were identified; 105 records were screened by reviewing the abstract; 99 records were excluded; 6 full text articles were assessed for eligibility; 5 records were included in the review. (3) Results: All the included studies reported on preterm birth. The meta-analysis indicates significant risk of preterm birth in women with personality disorder (overall odds ratio (OR) 2.62; CI 2.24-3.06;p< 0.01). Three studies reported on low birth weight, with the meta-analysis indicating a raised risk of low birth weight of the babies born to women with personality disorder (overall OR 2.00 CI 1.12-3.57 (p= 0.02)). Three studies reported on appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) score, with the meta-analysis of OR's indicating a risk of low APGAR score in women with personality disorder (overall OR 2.31; CI 1.17-4.55;p= 0.02). (4) Conclusions: The infants of women with personality disorder are at elevated risk of preterm birth, low birth weight and low APGAR score.

AB  - Infidelity and romantic jealousy (RJ) are commonly cited relational level drivers of intimate partner violence (IPV) but remain undertheorized and underutilized in IPV research and prevention. This global systematic review aims to characterize the existing research on real or suspected infidelity and RJ in relation to IPV and inform future research and programming. We systematically searched 11 databases for peer-reviewed research, published between April 2009 and 2019, that provided data on the prevalence or a measure of association (quantitative), or pathway (qualitative), between real or suspected infidelity or RJ, and IPV. Fifty-one papers from 28 countries were included and the evidence showed a consistent association between real or suspected infidelity, RJ and IPV. Our findings identify three overarching mechanisms and six pathways between infidelity, RJ and IPV. These provide support for prominent theories in the field related to patriarchal culture, threatened masculinities and femininities and a lack of emotional regulation and conflict resolution skills, but not evolutionary theories. Our findings suggest that researchers should use standardized measurement tools that make the distinction between RJ and suspected, confirmed and accusations of infidelity. Policy and programming should aim to transform traditional gender roles, accounting for infidelity and RJ and improving couple's communication and trust.

AB  - Bone plays an important role in dental implant treatment success. The goal of this literature review is to analyze the influence of bone definition and finite element parameters on stress in dental implants and bone in numerical studies. A search was conducted of Pubmed, Science Direct and LILACS, and two independent reviewers performed the data extraction. The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook tool for clinical trials. Seventeen studies were included. Titanium was the most commonly-used material in dental implants. The magnitude of the applied loads varied from 15 to 300 N with a mean of 182 N. Complete osseointegration was the most common boundary condition. Evidence from this review suggests that bone is commonly defined as an isotropic material, despite being an anisotropic tissue, and that it is analyzed as a ductile material, instead of as a fragile material. In addition, and in view of the data analyzed in this review, it can be concluded that there is no standardization for conducting finite element studies in the field of dentistry. Convergence criteria are only detailed in two of the studies included in this review, although they are a key factor in obtaining accurate results in numerical studies. It is therefore necessary to implement a methodology that indicates which parameters a numerical simulation must include, as well as how the results should be analyzed.

AB  - Motivational theory-based interventions are known to be effective for increasing physical activity (PA) in the general population but their effects in people with severe mental illness are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis on the effect of these interventions on PA and cardiometabolic risk factors. A systematic search of randomized controlled trials through 6 databases was carried out from inception to March 2019. Analyses were conducted using random-effect models. Weighted mean difference (WMD) were used as effect size when outcomes had the same units, otherwise Hedge's g was used. Fourteen articles including 2128 participants were identified. Motivational theory-based interventions were effective in increasing PA (g = 0.27, 95%CI [0.03; 0.51], p = .003), reducing weight (WMD = -1.87 kg, 95%CI[-2.98; -0.76], p = .001), body mass index (WMD = -0.82 kg/m(2), 95% CI[-1.23; -0.41], p = .009), waist circumference (WMD = -1.91 cm, 95%CI [-3.63; -0.18], p = .03) and fasting glucose (g = -0.17, 95%CI[-0.34; -0.001], p = .04). Larger effect sizes were found in interventions based on only one theoretical model of motivation. In conclusion, interventions using motivational theories are effective to improve PA levels and the cardiometabolic health profile of people with severe mental illness.

KW  - NEUROINFLAMMATION

KW  - COMMON
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by both motor and non-motor symptomology. The reported prevalence of depression in patients with PD is difficult to ascertain due to overlapping somatic symptoms and failure to self-report symptoms. Although antidepressants remain a first-line treatment, they can have adverse effects. Recently, literature has demonstrated that due to its anti-inflammatory properties, yoga may be an effective nonpharmacologic therapy for depression.
   METHODS: A search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from January 2000 to January 2019 that assessed the effects of yoga on depression and motor functioning in PD.
   RESULTS: Three studies met the criteria for inclusion. In one RCT, biweekly yoga resulted in a decrease in depression score (P = .056). In another RCT, weekly yoga resulted in a significant decrease in depression and demonstrated that its therapeutic effects are long-lasting. Finally, in a third RCT, no significant difference was found between control and experimental groups in depression after biweekly yoga. However, yoga was found to be protective against worsening of depression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that the practice of yoga may be a useful nonpharmacologic adjunctive treatment for depression in patients with PD. However, more controlled RCTs are needed to validate our conclusions.

Different studies have been stressed the importance and need for parental involvement in the intervention process to increase positive impacts. Methods: The process of caregiving and the associated challenges should be understood from different aspects to be able to facilitate parent involvement in intervention implementation. In a narrative literature review, ten selected reviews were considered and each review considered a special aspect of caregiving for an individual with ASD. Results: Five main different factors in the available literature and reviews were considered as different themes that needed to be reconsidered in the studies on the impacts of caregiving for an individual with ASD. Conclusions: It is concluded that to facilitate parental involvement in the intervention process, and to support caregivers of this group of individuals this review highlights the need for improved research in some proposed areas in this field and to bridge the gap between research and practice in this field.

AB  - Sleep in seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has been primarily characterized by delayed sleep timing and self-reports of hypersomnolence. It is unclear whether delayed sleep timing is due to circadian or behavioral misalignment and if effective treatments operate independently of the circadian system. Discrepancies between self-report and actigraphic/ polysomnographic sleep duration in SAD hinder clarification of hypersomnolence as a cardinal symptom. Previous studies have largely neglected the summer remission period in SAD, which could yield valuable insight to the role sleep disturbances play in the onset and recurrence of winter depressive episodes. Future studies should incorporate multi-method, multi-season assessment of sleep and circadian rhythms to best characterize relevant sleep-circadian phenotypes. Empirically determining sleep phenotypes present in SAD will pave the way for targeted sleep interventions.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this paper was to provide a systematic review and update on the pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder (SAD), including the efficacy and tolerability of these agents, the ranking of interventions, and the grading of results by quality of evidence. Methods: The Common Mental Disorder Controlled Trial Register and two trial registries were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any pharmacological intervention or placebo in the treatment of SAD. We performed a standard pairwise meta-analysis using a random effects model and carried out a network meta-analysis (NMA) using the statistical package, R. Quality of evidence was also assessed. Results: We included 67 RCTs in the review and 21 to 45 interventions in the NMA. Paroxetine was most effective in the reduction of symptom severity as compared to placebo. Superior response to treatment was also observed for paroxetine, brofaromine, bromazepam, clonazepam, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, phenelzine, and sertraline. Higher dropout rates were found for fluvoxamine. Brofaromine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, pregabalin, sertraline, and venlafaxine performed worse in comparison to placebo for the outcome of dropouts due to adverse events. Olanzapine yielded a relatively high rank for treatment efficacy and buspirone the worse rank for dropouts due to any cause. Conclusion: The differences between drugs and placebo were small, apart from a significant reduction in symptom severity and response for paroxetine. We suggest paroxetine as a first-line treatment of SAD, with the consideration of future research on the drug olanzapine as well as brofaromine, bromazepam, clonazepam, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, phenelzine, and sertraline because we observed a response to treatment.

AB  - Objective:
   The aim of this study is to describe the risk factors of injured children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in China and provide the scientific data for PTSD prevention and control in children.
   Methods:
   Electronic databases, including Medline, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), were searched for articles published on or before October 30, 2018, searching for the words, "PTSD," "child"/"children," "injury"/"injuries," and "China"/"Chinese." Forty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria and were meta-analyzed using random-effect models.
   Results:
   The total sample size in our meta-analysis was 65 298, and there were 13 402 children diagnosed with PTSD. The prevalence of PTSD after suffering from injury was 20.52% (95% CI = 17%-23%). PTSD occurrence was higher in girls than boys (24.61% vs 19.36%, P < 0.001). The PTSD rate for students was 51.82%, 37.12%, and 14.02% in senior, junior high school children, and primary school student, respectively. PTSD prevalence was 58.93% in rural children and higher than the urban children (57.36%). The prevalence of PTSD in ethnic minority children was significantly higher than that of Han Chinese children (35.38% vs 13.50%).
   Conclusion:
   PTSD in injured children is significantly higher in girls, senior high school children, in rural areas, and in ethnic minority children. PTSD prevention and control should be focused on these 4 subgroups.

AB  - Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition that is associated with symptoms such as hyperarousal and overreactions. Treatments for PTSD are limited to medications and in-session therapies. Assessing the way the heart responds to PTSD has shown promise in detecting and understanding the onset of symptoms.
   Objective: This study aimed to extract statistical and mathematical approaches that researchers can use to analyze heart rate (HR) data to understand PTSD.
   Methods: A scoping literature review was conducted to extract HR models. A total of 5 databases including Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline) OVID, Medline EBSCO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) EBSCO, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase) Ovid, and Google Scholar were searched. Non-English language studies, as well as studies that did not analyze human data, were excluded. A total of 54 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in this review.
   Results: We identified 4 categories of models: descriptive time-independent output, descriptive and time-dependent output, predictive and time-independent output, and predictive and time-dependent output. Descriptive and time-independent output models include analysis of variance and first-order exponential; the descriptive time-dependent output model includes a classical time series analysis and mixed regression. Predictive time-independent output models include machine learning methods and analysis of the HR-based fluctuation-dissipation method. Finally, predictive time-dependent output models include the time-variant method and nonlinear dynamic modeling.
   Conclusions: All of the identified modeling categories have relevance in PTSD, although the modeling selection is dependent on the specific goals of the study. Descriptive models are well-founded for the inference of PTSD. However, there is a need for additional studies in this area that explore a broader set of predictive models and other factors (eg, activity level) that have not been analyzed with descriptive models.

AB  - Aims Functional impairment is a hallmark feature of severe mental health problems (SMI). Attachment theory is a key psychological theory of interpersonal functioning and difficulties in attachment are common in SMI and may help explain functioning problems in SMI. This systematic review aimed to synthesise and critically appraise existing literature exploring associations between adult attachment style and functioning in SMI samples. Method Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines we systematically searched five databases using strings of terms relating to both attachment and social functioning. Inclusion criteria were samples diagnosed with SMI and validated measure tools. Results Ten studies met inclusion criteria. Considerable heterogeneity was found across studies in relation to construct measurement, sample size, and gender distribution. However, as predicted there was some evidence to suggest that secure attachment is associated with better functioning, and insecure attachment (specifically anxious style) is associated with impairments in functioning. Conclusion Findings highlight the importance of considering attachment in relation to functional outcome when working with people with SMI, particularly when assessing, formulating, and delivering psychological interventions.

AB  - Addiction management is complex, and it requires a bio-psycho-social perspective, that ought to consider the multiple etiological and developmental factors. Because of this, a large amount of resources has been allocated to assess the vulnerability to dependence, i.e., to identify the processes underlying the transition from substance use to dependence, as well as its course, in order to determine the key points in its prevention, treatment, and recovery. Consequently, knowledge \from neuroscience must be taken into account, which is why different initiatives have emerged with this objective, such as the "Research Domain Criteria" (RDoC), and the "Addiction Neuroclinical Assessment" (ANA). Particularly, neuropsychophysiological measures could be used as markers of cognitive and behavioral attributes or traits in alcohol dependence, and even trace clinical change. In this way, the aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview following ANA clinical framework, to the most robust findings in neuropsychophysiological changes in alcohol dependence, that underlie the main cognitive domains implicated in addiction: incentive salience, negative emotionality, and executive functioning. The most consistent results have been found in event-related potential (ERP) analysis, especially in the P3 component, that could show a wide clinical utility, mainly for the executive functions. The review also shows the usefulness of other components, implicated in affective and substance-related processing (P1, N1, or the late positive potential LPP), as well as event-related oscillations, such as theta power, with a possible use as vulnerability or clinical marker in alcohol dependence. Finally, new tools emerging from psychophysiology research, based on functional connectivity or brain graph analysis could help toward a better understanding of altered circuits in alcohol dependence, as well as communication efficiency and effort during mental operations. This review concludes with an examination of these tools as possible markers in the clinical field and discusses methodological differences, the need for more replicability studies and incipient lines of work. It also uses consistent findings in psychophysiology to draw possible treatment targets and cognitive profiles in alcohol dependence.

AB  - Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental problem and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed types of antidepressants which are called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and used as a primary therapeutic intervention in MDD. This umbrella review aimed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of selected SSRIs. Methods A systematic review on systematic reviews based on meta-analysis was conducted for head-to-head comparisons on 6 antidepressants (fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine) as monotherapy in the acute-phase treatment for adults with MDD. The primary outcomes included response rate and remission rate. The secondary outcome was the withdrawal rate due to any cause. All articles published on 6 electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and ProQuest, until 28 August 2018, were searched and analysed. Results Fifteen meta-analysis based systematic reviews finally met all the inclusion criteria and pre-defined outcomes were extracted. Regarding the remission rate and withdrawal rate, statistically, significant comparisons showed that escitalopram was the better choice. Conclusion The descriptive analysis of the included articles showed that generally, escitalopram was more effective than other defined SSRIs in terms of response rate, remission rate, and withdrawal rate.Keypoints This work compiles evidence from multiple meta-analyses based on systematic reviews and provides a clearer picture for assessing the efficacy of SSRIs, clarify current gaps and direction of future research in this category of antidepressants. A minority of included articles attained the high-quality rank according to AMSTAR-2. The descriptive analysis of the included articles showed that generally, escitalopram was more effective than other defined SSRIs in terms of response rate, remission rate, and withdrawal rate.

AB  - Purpose To identify, review and synthesize evidence on whether social disadvantage moderates antidepressant treatment outcomes, even when access to treatment is not a consideration. Methods The systematic review was done in accordance with PRIMSA guidelines. An a priori systematic search strategy was used to search databases (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE, Global Health and Cochrane Trials Library) from their earliest entries through December 31, 2018. A two-step screening procedure was followed, and all experimental studies of antidepressant treatment in ICD/DSM diagnosed cases of depression were included. Studies with subjects < 18 years or investigating other modalities of treatment were excluded. Results Thirteen papers reporting analyses from nine studies met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity in sample sizes, target populations, treatment settings, clinical outcomes and definition of SES indices. The primary outcome was the relative effect of socioeconomic status (SES) (as measured by income, employment status and level of education)-on antidepressant treatment outcomes. Conclusions The evidence from this review suggests that lower SES may lead to social inequalities in antidepressant treatment outcomes even in the context of clinical trials in which all participants have equal access to the same high-quality, standardized care. The review calls for more careful consideration of the choice and operationalization of SES indicators, and the need to "employ sampling methods that ensure ample representation of individuals from a wide range of social worlds". The review concludes with tentative suggestions about how to reduce social inequalities in antidepressant treatment outcomes at the level of individuals and populations.

AB  - Kelp forests are highly productive foundation species along much of the world's coastline. As a result, kelp are crucial to the ecological, social, and economic well- being of coastal communities. Yet, due to a combination of acute and chronic stressors, kelp forests are under threat and have declined in many locations worldwide. Active restoration of kelp ecosystems is an emerging field that aims to reverse these declines by mitigating negative stressors and then, if needed, introducing biotic material into the environment. To date, few restoration efforts have incorporated positive species interactions. This gap presents a potential shortcoming for the field as evidence from other marine ecosystems illustrates that the inclusion of positive species interactions can enhance restoration success. Additionally, as the climate continues to warm, this approach will be particularly pertinent as positive interactions can also expand the range of physical conditions under which species can persist. Here, we highlight how practitioners can use positive density dependence within and amongst kelp species to increase the chances of restoration success. At higher trophic levels, we emphasize how co -restoring predators can prime ecosystems for restoration. We also investigate how emerging technologies in genetic and microbial selection and manipulation can increase the tolerance of target species to warming and other stressors. Finally, we provide examples of how we can use existing anthropogenic activities to facilitate restoration while performing alternative purposes. As kelp forests continue to decline and the field of kelp restoration continues to develop, it is also important that we monitor these potential advancements and ensure they do not have unintended ecosystem effects, particularly with untested techniques such as genetic and microbial manipulations. Nevertheless, incorporating positive species interactions into future restoration practice stands to promote a more holistic form of restoration that also increases the likelihood of success in a shifting seascape.

AB  - Objective. Cognitive compensatory interventions aim to alleviate psychosocial disability by targeting functioning directly using aids and strategies, thereby minimizing the impact of cognitive impairment. The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive compensatory interventions for psychosis by examining the effects on functioning and symptoms, and exploring whether intervention factors, study design, and age influenced effect sizes. Methods. Electronic databases (Ovid Medline, PsychINFO) were searched up to October 2018. Records obtained through electronic and manual searches were screened independently by two reviewers according to selection criteria. Data were extracted to calculate estimated effects (Hedge's g) of treatment on functioning and symptoms at post-intervention and follow-up. Study quality was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool.Results. Twenty-six studies, from 25 independent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis (1654 participants, mean age = 38.9 years, 64% male). Meta-analysis revealed a medium effect of compensatory interventions on functioning compared to control conditions (Hedge's g = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.33, 0.60, P <.001), with evidence of relative durability at follow-up (Hedge's g = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.54, P <.001). Analysis also revealed small significant effects of cognitive compensatory treatment on negative, positive, and general psychiatric symptoms, but not depressive symptoms. Estimated effects did not significantly vary according to treatment factors (ie, compensatory approach, dosage), delivery method (ie, individual/group), age, or risk of bias. Longer treatment length was associated with larger effect sizes for functioning outcomes. No evidence of publication bias was identified.Conclusion. Cognitive compensatory interventions are associated with robust, durable improvements in functioning in people with psychotic illnesses.

AB  - Background: Several countries have regulated euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Research has looked at the experiences of patients, family, and professionals. However, little is known of the effects on bereaved individuals. Aims: We aimed to assess (a) what is known about the grief and mental health of people bereaved by euthanasia or PAS and (b) the quality of the research. Method: Systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines with searches in Cinahl, Embase, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Scopus. Results: The searches identified 10 articles (eight studies), and the study quality was fair. People bereaved by euthanasia/PAS generally had similar or lower scores on measures of disordered grief, mental health, and posttraumatic stress compared with those who died naturally. Lack of social support and secrecy may compound their grief. Being involved in the decision-making process and having the feeling of honoring the deceased's will may facilitate their grief. Limitations: Studies used self-reports from non-random self-selected participants, were retrospective, and were conducted in only three countries. Conclusion: There is little evidence of increased risk of adverse grief or mental health outcomes in people bereaved by euthanasia/PAS. As more countries legalize assisted dying, high-quality studies of the factors that may hinder or facilitate the grief process are needed.

AB  - Anthropogenic eutrophication contributes to harmful blooms of cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems worldwide. In Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, massive blooms of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and smaller blooms of other cyanobacteria are associated with cyanotoxins, hypoxia, high pH, high concentrations of ammonia, and potentially hypercapnia. Recovery of the endangered Lost River sucker Deltistes luxatus and shortnose sucker Chasmistes brevirostris in Upper Klamath Lake is obstructed by low survival in the juvenile life stage. Water quality associated with the harmful algal blooms and their decomposition (crashes) is often singled out as the primary cause of juvenile sucker mortality. We investigated this general hypothesis with a review of relevant literature and data from decades of monitoring in Upper Klamath Lake. Microcystins, hepatotoxins produced by some cyanobacteria, are unlikely to be directly lethal to suckers; potential effects of other cyanotoxins that are present in the lake warrant investigation. Dissolved-oxygen saturation declined following bloom crashes, but was infrequently low enough for long enough in Upper Klamath Lake to cause direct sucker mortality. Hypercapnia could potentially reach lethal concentrations in the fall and winter, but did not appear to be associated with the summer algal blooms. pH was highest during peaks in cyanobacteria growth, but infrequently reached directly lethal levels (> 10.3). However, pH frequently reached an observed sub-lethal effect level for juvenile suckers (10.0). Un-ionized ammonia rarely exceeded even the lowest effect level measured for suckers. Rather than act as a direct cause of large-scale mortality, the available evidence suggests that water quality associated with massive blooms of cyanobacteria in Upper Klamath Lake contributes to chronic stress for juvenile suckers and may increase mortality due to other factors.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the effect sizes of randomized trials of psychotherapies for depression across different age groups.
   Importance It is not clear whether psychotherapies for depression have comparable effects across the life span. Finding out is important from a clinical and scientific perspective. Objective To compare the effects of psychotherapies for depression between different age groups. Data Sources Four major bibliographic databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched for trials comparing psychotherapy with control conditions up to January 2019. Study Selection Randomized trials comparing psychotherapies for depression with control conditions in all age groups were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Effect sizes (Hedges g) were calculated for all comparisons and pooled with random-effects models. Differences in effects between age groups were examined with mixed-effects subgroup analyses and in meta-regression analyses. Main Outcomes and Measures Depressive symptoms were the primary outcome. Results After removing duplicates, 16756 records were screened and 2608 full-text articles were screened. Of these, 366 trials (36702 patients) with 453 comparisons between a therapy and a control condition were included in the qualitative analysis, including 13 (3.6%) in children (13 years and younger), 24 (6.6%) in adolescents (>= 13 to 18 years), 19 (5.2%) in young adults (>= 18 to 24 years), 242 (66.1%) in middle-aged adults (>= 24 to 55 years), 58 (15.8%) in older adults (>= 55 to 75 years), and 10 (2.7%) in older old adults (75 years and older). The overall effect size of all comparisons across all age groups was g = 0.75 (95% CI, 0.67-0.82), with very high heterogeneity (I-2= 80%; 95% CI: 78-82). Mean effect sizes for depressive symptoms in children (g = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.55) and adolescents (g = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34-0.75) were significantly lower than those in middle-aged adults (g = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.87). The effect sizes in young adults (g = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79-1.16) were significantly larger than those in middle-aged adults. No significant difference was found between older adults (g = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51-0.82) and those in older old adults (g = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.42-1.52). The outcomes should be considered with caution because of the suboptimal quality of most of the studies and the high levels of heterogeneity. However, most primary findings proved robust across sensitivity analyses, addressing risk of bias, target populations included, type of therapy, diagnosis of mood disorder, and method of data analysis. Conclusions and Relevance Trials included in this meta-analysis reported effect sizes of psychotherapies that were smaller in children than in adults, probably also smaller in adolescents, that the effects may be somewhat larger in young adults, and without meaningful differences between middle-aged adults, older adults, and older old adults.
   Question Do psychotherapies for depression have comparable outcomes in age groups across the life span? Findings In a meta-analysis of 366 randomized clinical trials including 36072 patients comparing psychotherapy with control conditions, psychotherapies had lower effect sizes in children and adolescents compared with adults, and no significant differences were found between middle-aged and older adults. However, conclusions are not definitive, given the low quality of many studies, the risk of publication bias, and the high heterogeneity among the studies. Meaning There is a need to improve psychotherapies in children and adolescents.

AB  - Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease affecting more than 170 million women worldwide and up to 10% of women of reproductive age. As a consequence of inflammatory reaction and infiltration of anatomic structures, endometriosis can cause "pain symptoms" including dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, dysuria, and chronic pelvic pain. In this review, we summarized the impact of endometriosis on quality of life in all its aspects including sexual life, work, and social relationships. The data research was conducted using web-based search engines and/or various electronic research databases querying for all articles related to endometriosis and quality of life from the inception of the database up to February 2020. Endometriosis has not only physical but also psychological effects, causing depression, anxiety, and compromising social relationships. Furthermore, endometriosis negatively impacts sexual life and social relationships. At last, the economic burden of endometriosis should not be underestimated, both individually and for the community, as this pathology leads to a loss of productivity at work and large use of health resources. Thus, endometriosis-related symptoms control women's lives compromising the quality of life in all aspects. In this review, we summarized the impact of endometriosis on various aspects of women's lives.

AB  - The association between FI, social determinants, and nutritional outcomes for pregnant women are analyzed. A systematic review was conducted through a search of articles in five electronic databases. Social determinants (race, education, participation in social programs) and nutritional status (pre-gestational BMI, gestational weight gain, anemia) were analyzed in relation to the FI situation. For each article, the frequency of food insecurity was collected in order to calculate the summary measure, prevalence ratio (PR). 26 articles were selected. An elevated occurrence of FI was associated with black pregnant women (PR: 1.83, 95% CI 1.08-3.10), participation in social protection programs (PR = 1.43, 1.02-2.01), and with low education levels on the part of pregnant women (PR = 2.73, 1.68-4.43). FI increased the chances of being overweight (PR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.29-1.91) and obese (PR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.15-1.87) in pregnant women, as well as excessive weight gain (PR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.10-1.82) and inadequate weight gain (PR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.09-1.97) during pregnancy. Anemia was not associated with FI. Social inequities are associated with food and nutritional insecurity in pregnant women.

AB  - This review article highlights the current state of perinatal depression (PND) research including established standards of care and innovative research in progress. PND can have a significant adverse impact on mother, child, and family; however, to date, wide-scale identification, prevention, and treatment have been limited. PND is heterogenous in presentation with likely multifactorial etiologies for each woman. Challenges in PND research are discussed including a need for universal tools, standardized measures, benchmarks, and best practices. Current examples are reviewed that highlight approaches to novel treatment paradigms and interventions. This includes reviewing epidemiologic studies in PND research, examining the biological underpinnings of PND, and discussing examples from this field and other fields currently developing translational research that spans from bench to bedside. Current and future challenges and opportunities in developing best practices for the treatment of PND are outlined. We also discuss the use of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria approach for PND research and provide recommendations for future directions in PND research collaboration. In conclusion, greater precision in perinatal psychiatry can be possible in the future with the development of guidelines and best practices that build on current work and apply innovative and collaborative approaches of scientists, providers, patients, community members, and government officials.

AB  - Background Several observational studies have been conducted to investigate the link between anaemia and adult depression but have shown inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate this association.
   Methods A comprehensive search of four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library) was conducted to identify relevant papers published up to November 2019 for the systematic review and meta-analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of selected studies. A random-effects model was used to draw metaestimates of the relationship between anaemia and adult depression.
   Results A total of 9706 papers were retrieved, and 14 observational epidemiological studies (9 case-control studies and 5 prospective cohort studies) comprising 10 764 cases of depression were finally included in this meta-analysis. The mean age of the participants ranged from 38.4 to 75.0 years. A significant association was identified between low haemoglobin levels and adult depression (OR or relative risk 1.43; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.65). Subgroup analyses according to study design, mean age, diagnostic criteria of anaemia, geographical region, number of participants, methodological quality and adjustment for various confounding factors such as education, smoking, comorbid disorders, physical activity, alcohol intake and medication use showed similar results.
   Conclusions The current study showed that anaemia was related to an increased risk of adult depression. One of the important limitations of our study was a moderate degree of heterogeneity due to the variety of assessment tools used to identify depression and the existence of publication bias. Another limitation of this meta-analysis was the lack of prospective cohort studies.

AB  - Background: Comorbidity between obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and psychotic disorders has long been a subject of interest and speculation, with much overlap being reported. The current review seeks to: (1) Investigate the prevalence of co-occurring OCD and psychosis, reporting pooled prevalence rates; and (2) Explore variability in reported rates on the basis of categorical and/or dimensional classifications of OCD and psychosis and (3) explore potential moderators of variability.
   Method: A systematic search was performed of key databases (Embase, PSYCHInfo, MEDLINE, Scopus) from January 1988 to October 2017. Included in the meta-analyses were studies that reported adult (18+) prevalence of comorbid OCD, obsessional compulsive symptoms (OCS) and psychosis-related disorders.
   Results: 94 articles with 103 effect sizes were extracted. Overall, when using categorical diagnoses, the prevalence rate of comorbid OCD and psychotic disorder was 12% (n = 155649; k = 81; 95% CI = 9-15%). Using diagnostic plus symptom criteria, the prevalence was 24% (n = 9563; k = 46, 95% CI = 20-28%).
   Conclusion: Given the substantial co-occurrence, it is important that individuals presenting in routine clinical practice are assessed for both disorders. To advance understanding, future research must go beyond comorbidity to explore latent dimensions that may account for their development and/or maintenance (e.g., trauma).

AB  - Background and objectives: Cognitive deficits and psychiatric comorbidities are frequent complications of epilepsy. These deleterious effects are thought to be present to a greater extent in drug-resistant epilepsy. A significant association between cognition, psychopathology and drug-resistant epilepsy is expected to exist. The objective of this review is to examine the relationship between cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in drug-resistant epilepsy.
   Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase was performed as well as a manual search of references from evaluated studies. Search strategy combined MeSH Terms and keywords. All studies except for case and report series were included. Study quality was evaluated by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies and the Jadad Scale for randomized controlled trials.
   Results: A final selection of 11 articles were selected after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria, evaluating 772 subjects in total, 562 with a diagnosis of resistant or hard-to-control epilepsy. Three studies demonstrated a positive association, two studies showed no association and one study showed controversial results while five studies investigated the impact of antiepileptic drugs or certain interventions.
   Conclusion: Patients with treatment-resistant seizures appear to present broader impairment related to both cognitive deficits and psychopathological alterations. Worse seizure control seems to be associated with worse cognitive performance and higher expression of psychiatric symptoms, characterizing a subgroup with a more severe disorder. Specific attention should be devoted to determine a protocolized assessment. Further investigation of potential correlates between cognition and psychopathology is required.

AB  - Background: Health care workers (HCWs) constitute a vulnerable group in terms of physical, mental, and emotional health setbacks during an epidemic. An in-depth understanding of the effects of epidemics on HCWs is of utmost importance, in order to put in place measures for their well-being. The purpose of the review was to compile, compare, and contrast the available information so as to produce a lucid picture of how HCWs are impacted during an epidemic, and the factors that affect their mental health.
   Methods: A literature search of MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases was conducted to uncover research pertaining to four major epidemic outbreaks over the last two decades. The search was carried out at three levels using pertinent key words. The records thus identified were narrowed down at three further levels, that is, by screening of the title, abstract, and full text, to obtain articles most relevant to the subject matter. Data extraction was done using a spreadsheet to compile the relevant data. Data synthesis was done by studying those factors found to affect psychological well-being of HCWs and separating them into suitable sub-groups. Recommendations to mitigate the psychological impact were proposed.
   Results: Thirteen factors were identified, which were grouped under the broad categories of socio-demographic variables, individual characteristics, social characteristics, and psychological constructs.
   Conclusion: Epidemics have a profound impact on psychological well-being of HCWs. There is a pressing need to address the issue of the psychological health of this vulnerable group.

AB  - It is debated as to whether major depressive disorder (MDD) and the burnout syndrome represent different aspects of the same syndrome or whether they reflect separate entities. A dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-axis has been related to both conditions separately. Dissecting the pathophysiology of the conditions and describing differences and similarities with regard to stress physiological systems might further clarify whether underlying etiological models of these syndromes differ. A systematic literature search including MDD and the burnout syndrome and peripheral cortisol measures was performed and resulted in 190 studies for inclusion in the qualitative synthesis. For MDD, findings suggest a general state of hypercortisolism and glucocorticoid resistance reflected by increased basal cortisol levels, reduced reactivity to psychosocial stress and a reduced cortisol suppression in pharmacological challenge tests. For the burnout syndrome, two central factors limit further conclusions: i) there is not a sufficient amount of studies examining the burnout syndrome and different cortisol secretion patterns to provide an evidence base, ii) the burnout syndrome is assessed heterogeneously reflecting imprecision of the measured constructs. Large prospective cohort studies examining both conditions in parallel rigorously controlling for confounders are required to further elucidate the differences and similarities of the HPA axis in MDD and the burnout syndrome.

AB  - In recent years, the rapid advances in machine learning (ML) and information fusion has made it possible to endow machines/computers with the ability of emotion understanding, recognition, and analysis. Emotion recognition has attracted increasingly intense interest from researchers from diverse fields. Human emotions can be recognized from facial expressions, speech, behavior (gesture/posture) or physiological signals. However, the first three methods can be ineffective since humans may involuntarily or deliberately conceal their real emotions (so-called social masking). The use of physiological signals can lead to more objective and reliable emotion recognition. Compared with peripheral neurophysiological signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals respond to fluctuations of affective states more sensitively and in real time and thus can provide useful features of emotional states. Therefore, various EEG-based emotion recognition techniques have been developed recently. In this paper, the emotion recognition methods based on multi-channel EEG signals as well as multi-modal physiological signals are reviewed. According to the standard pipeline for emotion recognition, we review different feature extraction (e.g., wavelet transform and nonlinear dynamics), feature reduction, and ML classifier design methods (e.g., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)). Furthermore, the EEG rhythms that are highly correlated with emotions are analyzed and the correlation between different brain areas and emotions is discussed. Finally, we compare different ML and deep learning algorithms for emotion recognition and suggest several open problems and future research directions in this exciting and fast-growing area of AI.

AB  - Objective:Medication non-adherence in mental health problems has social and economic costs. The objective of the study was to review the cost-effectiveness of interventions to enhance medication adherence in patients with mental health problems. Methods:The update of a previous systematic review was performed. Databases were searched in June 2019: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, CRD, WOS. Cost-effectiveness studies comparing an intervention to improve the medication adherence with other interventions/usual care in adults with mental health problems were included. Data were extracted, methodological quality of the studies was assessed and a narrative synthesis was performed. Results:Nine studies were included in the review. The interventions that showed medication adherence increase were: a financial incentive when depot injection was taken by patients with psychotic disorders, a value-based benefit design policy including copayment and counselling in a company setting, and a medication treatment decision supported by a pharmacogenetic test. The other studies (coaching by pharmacists; a psychological and educational intervention at health care centres) did not find differences between groups. No study found cost differences between alternatives. Conclusions:Interventions to improve medication adherence in adults with mental health problems could be cost-effective, especially those based on financial incentives, although more research is needed.KEYPOINTS There are several types of interventions designed to enhance medication adherence in patients with mental health problems. Few of them have demonstrated cost-effectiveness. Two studies found that a financial incentive per depot injection in patients with psychotic disorders improved the medication adherence. Two other studies found improvement in adherence due to two specific interventions: a value-based benefit design policy in a company setting and a pharmacogenetic test supporting the medication treatment decision. No study found differences in costs between the intervention and the comparator. More research is needed to implement cost-effective interventions.

AB  - Background Indigenous people experience significant poor oral health outcomes and poorer access to oral health care in comparison to the general population. The integration of oral health care with primary health care has been highlighted to be effective in addressing these oral health disparities. Scoping studies are an increasingly popular approach to reviewing health research evidence.Two-eyed seeing is an approach for both Western and Indigenous knowledge to come together to aid understanding and solve problems. Thus, the two-eyed seeing theoretical framework advocates viewing the world with one eye focused on Indigenous knowledge and the other eye on Western knowledge. This scoping review was conducted to systematically map the available integrated primary oral health care programs and their outcomes in these communities using the two-eyed seeing concept. Methods This scoping review followed Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework and its methodological advancement by Levac et al. A literature search with defined eligibility criteria was performed via several electronic databases, non-indexed Indigenous journals, Indigenous health organizational websites, and grey literature. The charted data was classified, analyzed, and reported using numeral summary and qualitative content analysis. The two-eyed seeing concept guided the interpretation and synthesis of the evidence on approaches and outcomes. Results A total of 29 publications describing 30 programs conducted in Australia and North America from 1972 to 2019 were included in the final analysis. The following four program categories emerged from the analysis: oral health promotion and prevention programs (n = 13), comprehensive dental services (n = 13), fly in, fly out dental services (n = 3), and teledentistry (n = 1). Biomedical approaches for integrated primary oral health care were leadership and governance, administration and funding, capacity building, infrastructure and technology, team work, and evidence-based practice. Indigenous approaches included the vision for holistic health, culturally appropriate services, community engagement, shared responsibility, and cultural safety. The program outcomes were identified for biological, mental, and emotional dimensions of oral health; however, measurement of the spiritual dimension was missing. Conclusion Our results suggest that a multiple integrated primary oral health care approach with a particular focus on Indigenous culture seems to be efficient and relevant in improving Indigenous oral health.

Literature Search:A systematic search identified primary research focusing on EOT, describing child, adolescent, and parental perceptions, experiences, and needs during this transition period. Of 170 articles identified, 22 met inclusion criteria. Data Evaluation/Synthesis:Studies were appraised for level and quality of evidence. Narrative synthesis was performed to extract themes and integrate the literature. Family members' perceived needs, factors influencing the EOT experience, and consequences of this transition emerged as themes. Conclusions:Uncertainty and heightened anxiety at EOT highlight the need for increased education and support for family members. Family functioning and distress influence the EOT experience, with variable effects on each family member. There is a call for individualized interventions to promote coping and positive outcomes.

AB  - Background Perinatal depression is one of the important mental illnesses among women. However, not enough reviews have been done, and a certain consensus has not been obtained about the prevalence of perinatal depression among Japanese women. The purpose of our study is to reveal the reliable estimates about the prevalence of perinatal depression among Japanese women. Method We searched two databases, PubMed and ICHUSHI, to identify studies published from January 1994 to December 2017 with data on the prevalence of antenatal or postnatal depression. Data were extracted from published reports. Results We reviewed 1317 abstracts, retrieved 301 articles and included 123 studies. The point prevalence of postpartum depression at 1 month was 14.3% incorporating 108,431 Japanese women. The period prevalence of depression at pregnancy was 14.0% in the second trimester and 16.3% in the third trimester. The period prevalence of postpartum depression was 15.1% within the first month, 11.6% in 1-3 months, 11.5% in 3-6 months and 11.5% in 6-12 months after birth. We also identified that compared with multiparas, primiparas was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of postpartum depression; the adjusted relative risk was 1.76. Conclusions The prevalence of postpartum depression at 1 month after childbirth was found to be 14.3% among Japanese women. During pregnancy, the prevalence of depression increases as childbirth approaches, and the prevalence of depression was found to decrease in the postpartum period over time. In addition, we found that the prevalence of postpartum depression in primiparas was higher than that in multiparas. Hence, we suggest that healthcare professionals need to pay more attention to primiparas than multiparas regarding postpartum depression.

AB  - Background: Consumer-facing digital health interventions provide a promising avenue to bridge gaps in mental health care delivery. To evaluate these interventions, understanding how the target population uses a solution is critical to the overall validity and reliability of the evaluation. As a result, usage data (analytics) can provide a proxy for evaluating the engagement of a solution. However, there is paucity of guidance on how usage data or analytics should be used to assess and evaluate digital mental health interventions.
   Objective: This review aimed to examine how usage data are collected and analyzed in evaluations of mental health mobile apps for transition-aged youth (15-29 years).
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A systematic search was conducted on 5 journal databases using keywords related to usage and engagement, mental health apps, and evaluation. A total of 1784 papers from 2008 to 2019 were identified and screened to ensure that they included analytics and evaluated a mental health app for transition-aged youth. After full-text screening, 49 papers were included in the analysis.
   Results: Of the 49 papers included in the analysis, 40 unique digital mental health innovations were evaluated, and about 80% (39/49) of the papers were published over the past 6 years. About 80% involved a randomized controlled trial and evaluated apps with information delivery features. There were heterogeneous findings in the concept that analytics was ascribed to, with the top 3 being engagement, adherence, and acceptability. There was also a significant spread in the number of metrics collected by each study, with 35% (17/49) of the papers collecting only 1 metric and 29% (14/49) collecting 4 or more analytic metrics. The number of modules completed, the session duration, and the number of log ins were the most common usage metrics collected.
   Conclusions: This review of current literature identified significant variability and heterogeneity in using analytics to evaluate digital mental health interventions for transition-aged youth. The large proportion of publications from the last 6 years suggests that user analytics is increasingly being integrated into the evaluation of these apps. Numerous gaps related to selecting appropriate and relevant metrics and defining successful or high levels of engagement have been identified for future exploration. Although long-term use or adoption is an important precursor to realizing the expected benefits of an app, few studies have examined this issue. Researchers would benefit from clarification and guidance on how to measure and analyze app usage in terms of evaluating digital mental health interventions for transition-aged youth. Given the established role of adoption in the success of health information technologies, understanding how to abstract and analyze user adoption for consumer digital mental health apps is also an emerging priority.

AB  - The marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool is an important player in the functioning of marine ecosystems. DOC is at the interface between the chemical and the biological worlds, it fuels marine food webs, and is a major component of the Earth's carbon system. Here, we review the research showing impacts of global change stressors on the DOC cycling, specifically: ocean warming and stratification, acidification, deoxygenation, glacial and sea ice melting, changed inflow from rivers, changing ocean circulation and upwelling, and wet/dry deposition. A unified outcome of the future impacts of these stressors on the global ocean DOC production and degradation is not possible, due to regional differences and differences in stressors impacts, but general patterns for each stressor are presented.

AB  - Background Smartphone applications could improve symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in a scalable and resource-efficient manner in the context limited access to specialized care. Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of applications designed as treatment interventions for adults with symptoms such as anger, suicidality, or self-harm that commonly occur in BPD. Data sources Search terms for BPD symptoms, smartphone applications, and treatment interventions were combined on PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO from database inception to December 2019. Study selection Controlled and uncontrolled studies of smartphone interventions for adult participants with symptoms such as anger, suicidality, or self-harm that commonly occur in BPD were included. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v3was used to compute between-groups effect sizes in controlled designs. The primary outcome was BPD-related symptoms such as anger, suicidality, and impulsivity; and the secondary outcome was general psychopathology. An average dropout rate across interventions was computed. Study quality, target audiences, therapeutic approach and targets, effectiveness, intended use, usability metrics, availability on market, and downloads were assessed qualitatively from the papers and through internet search. Results Twelve studies of 10 applications were included, reporting data from 408 participants. Between-groups meta-analyses of RCTs revealed no significant effect of smartphone applications above and beyond in-person treatments or a waitlist on BPD symptoms (Hedges'g = - 0.066, 95% CI [-.257, .125]), nor on general psychopathology (Hedges'g = 0.305, 95% CI [- 0.14, 0.75]). Across the 12 trials, dropout rates ranged from 0 to 56.7% (M = 22.5, 95% CI [0.15, 0.46]). A majority of interventions studied targeted emotion dysregulation and behavioral dyscontrol symptoms. Half of the applications are commercially available. Conclusions The effects of smartphone interventions on symptoms of BPD are unclear and there is currently a lack of evidence for their effectiveness. More research is needed to build on these preliminary findings in BPD to investigate both positive and adverse effects of smartphone applications and identify the role these technologies may provide in expanding mental healthcare resources.

AB  - Background Increasing rates of mental health problems among adolescents are of concern. Teens who are most in need of mental health attention are reluctant to seek help. A better understanding of the help-seeking in this population is needed to overcome this gap. Methods Five databases were searched to identify the principal barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking for common mental health problems in adolescents aged 10-19 years. The search was performed in June 2018 and updated in April 2019. Two independent screening processes were made using the eligibility criteria. Quality assessment of each study was performed, and findings summarised using a narrative synthesis. Results Ninety studies meet the inclusion criteria for this review for barrier and facilitators (n = 54) and interventions (n = 36). Stigma and negative beliefs towards mental health services and professionals were the most cited barriers. Facilitators included previous positive experience with health services and mental health literacy. Most interventions were based on psychoeducation, which focused on general mental health knowledge, suicide and self-harm, stigma and depression. Other types of interventions included the use of multimedia and online tools, peer training and outreach initiatives. Overall, the quality of studies was low to medium and there was no general agreement regarding help-seeking definition and measurements. Conclusion Most of the interventions took place in an educational setting however, it is important to consider adolescents outside the educational system. Encouraging help-seeking should come with the increased availability of mental health support for all adolescents in need, but this is still a major challenge for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. There is also a need to develop shared definitions, theoretical frameworks and higher methodological standards in research regarding help-seeking behaviours in adolescents. This will allow more consistency and generalisability of findings, improving the development of help-seeking interventions and ensuring timely access to mental health treatments.

AB  - Cumulative evidence shows a linkage between gut microbiota pattern and depression through the brain-gut microbiome axis. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the alterations of the gut microbiota patterns in people with depression compared to healthy controls. A comprehensive literature search of human studies, published between January 2000 and June 2019, was reviewed. The key words included gastrointestinal microbiome, gut microbiome, microbiota, depression, depressive symptoms, and depressive disorder. The systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Disparities in alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of the microbiota existed in people with depression compared to healthy controls. At the phylum level, there were inconsistencies in the abundance ofFirmicutes,Bacteroidetes,and Proteobacteria. However, high abundance inActinobacteriaandFusobacteriaphyla were observed in people with depression. On the family level, high abundance ofActinomycineae,Coriobacterineae,Bifidobacteriaceae,Clostridiales incertae sedis XI,Porphyromonadaceae,Clostridiaceae,Lactobacillaceae,Streptococcaceae,Eubacteriaceae,Thermoanaerobacteriaceae,Fusobacteriaceae,Nocardiaceae,Streptomycetaceae,andlow abundance ofVeillonellaceae,Prevotellaceae,Bacteroidaceae,Sutterellaceae,Oscillospiraceae,Marniabilaceae, andChitinophagaceaewere observed in people with depression. On the genus level, high abundance ofOscillibacter,Blautia,Holdemania,Clostridium XIX,Anaerostipes,Anaerofilum,Streptococcus,Gelria,Turicibacter,Parabacteroides,Eggerthella,Klebsiella,Paraprevotella,Veillonella,Clostridium IV,Erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis,Eubacterium,Parvimonas,Desulfovibrio,Parasutterella,Actinomyces,Asaccharobacter,Atopobium,Olsenellaand low abundance ofCoprococcus,Lactobacillus,Escherichia/Shigella,Clostridium XlVa,Dialister,Howardella,Pyramidobacter, andSutterellawere found in people with depression. Alteration of gut microbiome patterns was evident in people with depression. Further evidence is warranted to allow for the translation of microbiome findings toward innovative clinical strategies that may improve treatment outcomes in people with depression.

AB  - This article reports a meta-analysis of the relationships between the Big Five personality traits and problematic mobile phone use (PMPU). After searching and screening the literature, a total of 36 studies involving 15,660 participants were included in the analysis. Using the random-effects model, the results indicated that neuroticism and extraversion were positively associated with PMPU. Conversely, agreeableness and conscientiousness were negatively associated with PMPU, while openness showed no association with PMPU. The result also showed that culture could moderate the relationship between openness and PMPU. Specifically, the negative relationship between openness and PMPU was not significant in collectivist culture but was significant in individualistic culture. In conclusion, high neuroticism, high extraversion, low agreeableness, and low conscientiousness are associated with PMPU. Moreover, the relationship between neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness and PMPU is relatively stable. Besides, cultural background moderates the relationship between openness and PMPU.

AB  - Background: There is a strong stigma attached to mental disorders preventing those affected from getting psychological help. The consequences of stigma are worse for racial and/or ethnic minorities compared to racial and/or ethnic majorities since the former often experience other social adversities such as poverty and discrimination within policies and institutions. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the evidence on the impact of differences in mental illness stigma between racial minorities and majorities.
   Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis included cross-sectional studies comparing mental illness stigma between racial minorities and majorities. Systematic searches were conducted in the bibliographic databases of PubMed, PsycINFO and EMBASE until 20th December 2018. Outcomes were extracted from published reports, and meta-analyses, and meta-regression analyses were conducted in CMA software.
   Results: After screening 2787 abstracts, 29 studies with 193,418 participants (N = 35,836 in racial minorities) were eligible for analyses. Racial minorities showed more stigma than racial majorities (g = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.12 similar to 0.27) for common mental disorders. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of these results. Multivariate meta-regression analyses pointed to the possible moderating role of the number of studies with high risk of bias on the effect size. Racial minorities have more stigma for common mental disorders when compared with majorities. Limitations included moderate to high risk of bias, high heterogeneity, few studies in most comparisons, and the use of non-standardized outcome measures.
   Conclusions: Mental illness stigma is higher among ethnic minorities than majorities. An important clinical implication of these findings would be to tailor anti-stigma strategies related with mental illnesses according to specific racial and/or ethnic backgrounds with the intention to improve mental health outreach.

AB  - BackgroundThe burden of depression in prisoners is increasing and factors such as co-existence of medical illness, lack of social support and longer duration of sentences are contributing to it. However, no pooled evidence on the magnitude and factors of depression in prisoners existed in Ethiopia. The current meta-analysis was therefore aimed to have aggregate evidence on the magnitude and factors of depression in prisoners of Ethiopia.MethodsA search of databases on PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE was carried out systematically. Besides, grey literature sources were extensively investigated. Moreover, the reference lists of the articles selected were searched. Random effects and quality-effects models were used to describe the pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms with 95% CI. We also detect heterogeneity between studies using Cochran's Q- statistic and the Higgs I-2 test. A sensitivity analysis was also implemented. Publication bias was checked with Egger's test and funnel plots visually.ResultsAmong 232 papers identified through the specified database searches only 17 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and only nine (9) studies fulfilled the prespecified criteria and incorporated in the final meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of Depressive symptoms among prisoners was 53.40%(95% CI: 41.33, 65.46). The pooled prevalence of Depressive symptoms in prisoners was 41.9% in Southwest Ethiopia, 44.43% in North West of Ethiopia, 59.05% in Addis Ababa, and 72.7% Southern Ethiopia. Besides, the pooled Depression symptoms prevalence among prisoners was 51.24% as measured with PHQ-9 and 56.15% with BDI-II. Besides, studies that utilized a relatively large sample size (>= 350) yields a smaller pooled prevalence of Depression symptoms, 51.93% than those which utilized smaller sample sizes (<350); 54.13%.ConclusionThe pooled magnitude of depression in prisoner's population is very high, 53.40%. This pooled effect size for the Depression symptoms was significantly higher in the southern region of the country than in the southwest region. Besides, the pooled prevalence was significantly higher as measured by the BDI-II tool than by PHQ-9. Also, studies that utilized a larger sample size provided a significantly lower pooled magnitude of symptoms of depression than studies that utilized a smaller sample size.

AB  - Background Anxiety disorders first emerge during the critical developmental periods of childhood and adolescence. This review synthesizes recent findings on the prevalence, risk factors, and course of the anxiety disorders; and their neurobiology and treatment.
   Methods For this review, searches were conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and . Findings related to the epidemiology, neurobiology, risk factors, and treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders were then summarized.
   Findings Anxiety disorders are high prevalence, and early-onset conditions associated with multiple risk factors including early inhibited temperament, environment stress, and structural and functional abnormalities in the prefrontal-amygdala circuitry as well as the default mode and salience networks. The anxiety disorders are effectively treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
   Conclusions Anxiety disorders are high prevalence, early-onset conditions associated with a distinct neurobiological fingerprint, and are consistently responsive to treatment. Questions remain regarding who is at risk of developing anxiety disorders as well as the way in which neurobiology predicts treatment response.

AB  - The somatic marker hypothesis (SMH) has been utilized to demonstrate the role of emotion and somatic state in decision-making under uncertainty over the past two decades. Despite some debate, the SMH has provided not only a neurobiological framework for understanding emotion and decision-making but also a good empirical support for ecological rationality and embodied emotion. Unlike the traditional maximizing rationality and bounded satisficing rationality, the ecological rationality stresses that emotions should be brought to the decision-making process. The embodied emotion furthermore emphasizes that emotions are embodied in the body and the brain. On the other hand, behavioral decision-making has spawned many new interdisciplines, including neuroeconomics. In this case, the SMH could act as a bridge to translate the ecological rationality and the embodied emotion into emerging neuroeconomics. Thus, this mini-review article aims to propose an integrated framework for introducing ecological rationality and embodied emotion into the field of neuroeconomics by virtue of insights from the SMH.

AB  - Background Up to 33% of women report a negative or traumatic childbirth experience. Given this high prevalence and its consistent association with adverse postpartum and child outcomes, it is essential to identify predictive factors and to improve the management of the childbirth experience. Objective This systematic review explores and identifies risk and protective factors for women's subjective childbirth experience and birth satisfaction by reviewing original research. Methods A systematic search was performed for childbirth experience literature on three online databases. Reviewed papers focused on women's subjective childbirth experience and its predictive factors. The articles were assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Results Risk and protective factors are notably different depending on the study design, the country, or the method employed. The main risk factors are obstetric, such as emergency caesarean and highly perceived labour pain, and women's dissatisfaction with social support. The main protective factors are: obstetric, including highly perceived control during labour or satisfaction regarding partner's support. However, overall results are inconclusive for methodological or conceptual reasons. Conclusions Several risk factors can be identified through pregnancy or childbirth. This underlines the importance of the quality of maternal interpersonal and professional relationships, especially with first-line perinatal health-care professionals, such as midwives.

AB  - Labour migration is a challenge for the globalised world due to its long-term effects such as the formation of transnational families. These families, where family members of migrant workers are "left-behind", are becoming a common phenomenon in many low- and middle-income countries. Our systematic literature review investigated the effects of international parental labour migration on the mental health and well-being of left-behind children. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed searches in PubMed, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar, resulting in 30 finally included studies. We found that mental health and well-being outcomes of left-behind children differed across and sometimes even within regions. However, only studies conducted in the Americas and South Asia observed purely negative effects. Overall, left-behind children show abnormal Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores and report higher levels of depression and loneliness than children who do not live in transnational families. Evidence from the studies suggests that gender of the migrant parent, culture and other transnational family characteristics contribute to the well-being and mental health of left-behind children. Further research utilising longitudinal data is needed to better understand the complex and lasting effects on left-behind children.

AB  - Elder abuse is a complex public health problem. It is of fundamental importance to ascertain which factors are associated with each specific type of abuse, as a way of enabling the creation of evidence-based public policies. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the literature regarding analytical epidemiological studies of factors associated with elder abuse. Four databases were used for the bibliographic search: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and Lilacs, with no limitations regarding year of publication. Articles were selected by pairs of researchers in two stages: reading of abstracts (3.121) and reading of complete articles (64). The total number of articles selected was 27. The risk of bias was evaluated. The factors associated with general violence were age, sex, marital status, educational level, income, family arrangement, social support, solitude, mental disorder, depression, suicide attempt, dependence on others in daily activities, cognitive function, chronic diseases, alcohol or drug abuse, among others. Elder abuse was found to be a multifactorial and complex phenomenon that should not therefore be viewed in a partial one-dimensional manner, but in such a way as to take into account all dimensions and the interdependence of these.

AB  - Objective: One of the most challenging issues in the pediatric obsessive-compulsive (OC) disorder field is to differentiate pathological OC symptoms from the phenotypically similar normative rituals/routines that characterize normal childhood development. Given their similarities, it can be questioned whether both constructs reflect two qualitatively distinct behavioral expressions of different etiological factors or rather reflect two diverse manifestations of one single continuum (cfr. the continuity hypothesis).
   Method: This paper aims to improve our understanding of the relation between normative childhood rituals/routines and OC symptoms in two ways. First, the continuity hypothesis was investigated by systematically reviewing current evidence on this association, using various databases (Web of Science Core Collection, MEDLINE/PubMed, and SciELO Citation Index) from 1950 until February 1, 2019 (registration number: CRD42019121293). Second, based on this systematic review, an integrative conceptual model was developed describing this relation from different perspectives on sources of influence.
   Results: The literature search initially revealed 2122 hits, with 114 full-texts being assessed for eligibility. After applying several selection criteria, 18 studies were included in the review. The results generally support the continuity hypothesis and reveal important etiological factors at different levels of behavioral analysis, including the phenotypic (anxiety), neurobiological and genetic level. Also age and the presence of other disorders appeared to be important factors in evaluating the level of normality.
   Conclusion: We provide a conceptual framework to inform future research aimed at improving the understanding of the relationship between normative rituals/routines and pathological OC symptoms. Conceptual implications are discussed and clinical recommendations are given to improve early identification and differentiation.

AB  - Pain measures traditionally used in rodents record mere reflexes evoked by sensory stimuli; the results thus may not fully reflect the human pain phenotype. Alterations in physical and emotional functioning, pain-depressed behaviors and facial pain expressions were recently proposed as additional pain outcomes to provide a more accurate measure of clinical pain in rodents, and hence to potentially enhance analgesic drug development. We aimed to review how preclinical pain assessment has evolved since the development of the tail flick test in 1941, with a particular focus on a critical analysis of some nonstandard pain outcomes, and a consideration of how sex differences may affect the performance of these pain surrogates. We tracked original research articles in Medline for the following periods: 1973-1977, 1983-1987, 1993-1997, 2003-2007, and 2014-2018. We identified 606 research articles about alternative surrogate pain measures, 473 of which were published between 2014 and 2018. This indicates that preclinical pain assessment is moving toward the use of these measures, which may soon become standard procedures in preclinical pain laboratories.

AB  - The occupational health literature has established that sex and gender are associated with all dimensions of the workplace. Sex and/or gender (sex/gender) factors play an important role in shaping the experiences, exposures, and health outcomes of male and female healthcare providers working in war and conflict settings. This study aims to (1) assess how sex/gender is considered in the occupational health literature on healthcare workers in conflict settings, and (2) identify the gaps in incorporating sex/gender concepts in this literature. A scoping review was carried out and nine electronic databases were searched using a comprehensive search strategy. Two reviewers screened the titles/abstracts and full-texts of the studies using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Key information was extracted from the studies and four themes were identified. Of 7679 identified records, 47 were included for final review. The findings underlined the harsh working conditions of healthcare workers practicing in conflict zones and showed sex/gender similarities and differences in experiences, exposures and health outcomes. This review revealed a dearth of articles with adequate consideration of sex/gender in the study design. Sex/gender-sensitive research in occupational health is necessary to develop effective occupational health and safety policies to protect men and women healthcare workers in conflict settings.

AB  - Burnout syndrome is a major problem in occupational health, which also affects nursing managers. The main aim was to analyze the level, prevalence and risk factors of burnout among nursing managers. A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted. The databases used were Medline (Pubmed), PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Scielo and Scopus. The search equation was "burnout AND nurs* AND (health manager OR case managers)". Nursing managers present high levels of emotional exhaustion and a high degree of depersonalization. Some studies show that variables like age, gender, marital status, having children or mobbing and other occupational factors are related with burnout. The prevalence estimation of emotional exhaustion with the meta-analysis was high; 29% (95% CI = 9-56) with a sample of n = 780 nursing managers. The meta-analytical estimation of the correlation between burnout and age was r = -0.07 (95% CI = -0.23-0.08). Work overload, the need to mediate personnel conflicts, lack of time and support from superior staff, contribute to the development of burnout among nursing managers.

AB  - The study of animal emotion, as with its human equivalent, can be confusing due to the complicated and inconsistent use of terminology, and the number of interlinked fields and topics it encompasses. With this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date and, to the best of our knowledge, complete overview of the field of animal emotion, especially intended for new-comers to the field who wish to get a grasp of this field. We start by tackling the terminology and proposing definitions of commonly used terms, and present the different frameworks used for the study of animal emotion. Here, we heavily draw from human literature, as the definitions of animal emotion are derived originally from human research. We follow-up with an overview of current methodologies for the study of animal emotion, in particular the valence dimension of emotion, and include some of the associated limitations linked to these methodologies. We end by pointing out key areas for future research.

AB  - Some evidence pointed out that Electro-Convulsive Treatment (ECT) could increase the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in depressive patients. However, there are some disagreements. The purpose of the study is through a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate BDNF levels after ECT in patients with Major depressive disorder. Two independent researchers searched of published articles in the databases of Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and WanFang Data, from January 1990 to March 2019. The following key words were used: "depression" or "depressive disorder", "major depressive disorder", "unipolar depression", "brain-derived neurotrophic factor" or "BDNF", and "electroconvulsive" or "ECT". A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis and included into our analysis. BDNF levels were increased among patients with MDD after ECT (P=0.000) in plasma samples. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was 0.695 (95 % CI: 0.402-0.988). We also found BDNF levels increased on one week and one month after finishing ECT (SMD=0.491, 95 %CI: 0.150,0.833, P=0.005; and SMD=0.812, 95 %CI: 0.326,1.298, P=0.001, respectively). Our findings suggest that BDNF levels may increase after ECT and may possibly be used as an indicator of treatment response after one or more weeks of ECT in patients with depression. However, additional investigation of BDNF levels with different ECT durations are needed in responders and non-responders.

AB  - The prevalence of microplastic debris in aquatic ecosystems as a result of anthropogenic activity has received worldwide attention. Although extensive research has reported ubiquitous and directly adverse effects on organisms, only a few published studies have proposed the long-term ecological consequences. The research in this field still lacks a systematic overview of the toxic effects of microplastics and a coherent understanding of the potential ecological consequences. Here, we draw upon cross-disciplinary scientific research from recent decades to 1) seek to understand the correlation between the responses of organisms to microplastics and the potential ecological disturbances, 2) summarize the potential ecological consequences triggered by microplastics in aquatic environments, and 3) discuss the barriers to the understanding of microplastic toxicology. In this paper, the physiochemical characteristics and dynamic distribution of microplastics were related to the toxicological concerns about microplastic bioavailability and environmental perturbation. The extent of the ecological disturbances depends on how the ecotoxicity of microplastics is transferred and proliferated throughout an aquatic environment. Microplastics are prevalent; they interfere with nutrient productivity and cycling, cause physiological stress in organisms (e.g., behavioral alterations, immune responses, abnormal metabolism, and changes to energy budgets), and threaten the ecosystem composition and stability. By integrating the linkages among the toxicities that range from the erosion of individual species to the defective development of biological communities to the collapse of the ecosystem functioning, this review provides a bottom-up framework for future research to address the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of microplastics in aquatic environments and the substantial ecological consequences.

AB  - Objective Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain often co-occur. Studies have shown an interaction between pain and PTSD. In this narrative review, we aim to support conducting comprehensive studies by describing PTSD, pain and determining whether opioidergic system, its agonist and antagonist manipulation could positively or negatively affect PTSD symptoms and concurrent pain.
   Methods Term searches was done in Google Scholar, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and PubMed databases as well as hand searching in key resource journals from 1979-2019.
   Results There are a lot of contradictions and disputes when endogenous opioidergic system and opioidergic antagonist system are studied in PTSD patients. Exogenous morphine administration in PTSD patients can decrease the symptoms of PTSD but it doesn't have a pain reduction effect to an acceptable level. Beta-endorphin as an endogenous opioid is effective in pain reduction in the moment of events but after minutes to hours, the endorphins withdrawal syndrome leads to exaggerated intrusive thoughts and flashbacks of PTSD, which exacerbate the pain. It has also been shown that naloxone, as an opioidergic antagonist, can reduce or increase the PTSD symptoms and its associated pain.
   Conclusion Data suggest different roles of opioidergic system and their antagonist in pain control and mood in PTSD. However, further investigations need to be done in order to reveal the role of endogenous opioidergic system and opioidergic antagonist system as a mediator in PTSD patients suffering from acute or chronic pain.

AB  - Objective: Gene-environment (GxE) interactions may comprise an important part of the aetiology of depression, and childhood maltreatment (CM), a significant stressor, has consistently been linked to depression. Hence, in this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the interaction between hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) genes and CM in depression. Methods: We conducted a literature search using the Pubmed, Embase, and PsychINFO databases in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included studies investigating GxE interactions between HPA-axis genes [Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), Arginine Vasopressin (AVP), Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone (CRH), Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone Receptor 1 (CRHR1), Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone Receptor 2 (CRHR2), FK506 binding protein (FKBP5), Nuclear Receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1), Nuclear Receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2 (NR3C2)] and CM in depression. Results: The literature search identified 159 potentially relevant studies. Following screening, 138 of these were excluded. Thus, 21 studies, investigating a total of 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms, were included in the final study. The most prevalent genes in the current study were CRHR1 and FKBP5. Significant GxE interactions were reported in seven of eight studies for CRHR1:rs110402 and CM, and in five of eight studies for FKBP5:rs1360780 and CM. In summary, our results suggest possible GxE interactions between CRHR1, FKBP5, NR3C1, and NR3C2 and CM, respectively. For the remaining genes, no relevant literature emerged. Conclusions: We find that genetic variation in four HPA-axis genes may influence the effects of CM in depression.

AB  - Context: Coping strategies can predict breast cancer patients' emotional well-being.
   Objectives: The aim of this systematic scoping review was to investigate the effect of coping strategies-oriented interventions on coping skills in breast cancer women.
   Data Sources: A systematic scoping review was conducted using a broad search across PubMed, Scopus, Springer, Elsevier, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Web of Science, Magiran, Scientific Information Database, and Google scholar from 2009-2018.
   Study Selection: Clinical or quasi-experimental trials using interventions and control groups on the coping strategies-oriented interventions in breast cancer women in English or Persian were included.
   Data Extraction: Two independent researchers selected the final papers. In the case of a disagreement, the third researcher made the final decision. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Jadad scale.
   Results: The coping strategies-oriented interventions were classified into four main categories: psychological interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, coping therapy, self-management, and psychoeducation; spiritual-religious interventions; social interventions, such as family therapy; and complementary interventions, such as acupuncture. Most interventions improved the coping skills of the studied women. Based on the Jadad scale, only two studies had good quality.
   Conclusions: Considering that most interventions improved the coping skills of breast cancer women, it is suggested that healthcare providers be proficient in examination techniques that maximize the patient's coping skills. However, there remains a need for further culture-based research to adopt the best interventions and make changes in policy.

AB  - Introduction
   Natural hazards are elements of the physical environment caused by forces extraneous to human intervention and may be harmful to human beings. Natural hazards, such as weather events, can lead to natural disasters, which are serious societal disruptions that can disrupt dialysis provision, a life -threatening event for dialysis - dependent people. The adverse outcomes associated with missed dialysis sessions are likely exacerbated in island settings, where health care resources and emergency procedures are limited. The effect of natural disasters on dialysis patients living in geographic- ally vulnerable areas such as the Cayman Islands is largely under-studied. To inform predisaster interventions, we systematically re- viewed studies examining the effects of disasters on dialysis pa- tients and discussed the implications for emergency preparedness in the Cayman Islands.
   Methods
   Two reviewers independently screened 434 titles and abstracts from PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. We in- cluded studies if they were original research articles published in English from 2009 to 2019 and conducted in the Americas.
   Results
   Our search yielded 15 relevant articles, which we included in the final analysis. Results showed that disasters have both direct and indirect effects on dialysis patients. Lack of electricity, clean wa- ter, and transportation, and closure of dialysis centers can disrupt dialysis care, lead to missed dialysis sessions, and increase the number of hospitalizations and use of the emergency department. Additionally, disasters can exacerbate depression and lead to posttraumatic stress disorder among dialysis patients.
   Conclusion
   To our knowledge, this systematic review is the first study that presents a synthesis of the scientific literature on the effects of dis- asters on dialysis populations. The indirect and direct effects of disasters on dialysis patients highlight the need for predisaster in- terventions at the patient and health care system levels. Particu- larly, educating patients about an emergency renal diet and offer- ing early dialysis can help to mitigate the negative effects of dis- asters.

AB  - Background:
   Children and adolescents with intellectual disability are at risk of developing psychiatric symptoms and disorders; yet, the estimates reported in the literature have been inconsistent, presenting a potential barrier for service planning and delivery. Sources of variability could arise from differences in measurement instruments as well as subgroup membership by severity of intellectual disability, gender and age. This systematic review aimed to address these gaps.
   Method:
   MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to 2018 and selected studies were reviewed. Studies were included if they reported point prevalence estimates of mental health symptomology or diagnoses in a general population of 6- to 21-year-old individuals with intellectual disability. The Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Checklist was applied to eligible papers to appraise their scientific strength. Pooled prevalence for mental health symptomology was determined using a random-effects meta-analysis.
   Results:
   A total of 19 studies were included, including 6151 children and adolescents. The pooled prevalence estimate captured by the Developmental Behaviour Checklist was 38% (95% confidence interval = [31, 46]), contrasting with 49% (95% confidence interval = [46, 51]) captured by the Child Behaviour Checklist; both rates were higher than a non-intellectual disability population. Severity of intellectual disability did not significantly influence the Developmental Behaviour Checklist risks. Insufficient data were available to conduct statistical analyses on the effects of age, gender and socioeconomic status. Of diagnosed psychiatric disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (30%), conduct disorder (3-21%) and anxiety disorders (7-34%) were the most prevalent conditions.
   Conclusion:
   This review consists of the largest sample hitherto evaluated. In the intellectual disability population, mental health comorbidities could be better detected by a symptom phenotype than a psychiatric diagnostic phenotype. Crucially, future research needs to address the effect of measurement validity in the intellectual disability population. Estimated prevalence rates were high compared to the general population, indicating the importance of systematic screening, case detection and appropriate management.

AB  - Due to severe shortages of specialist mental health personnel in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), psychological therapies are increasingly being delivered by non-specialist health workers (NSHWs). Previous reviews have investigated the effectiveness of NSHW-delivered psychological therapies, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), in LMIC settings. This systematic review aims to synthesise findings on the implementation outcomes of NSHW-delivered CBT interventions addressing common mental disorders and substance-use disorders in LMICs. Four databases were searched, yielding 3211 records, 18 of which met all inclusion criteria. We extracted and synthesised qualitative and quantitative data across eight implementation outcomes: acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, penetration and sustainability. Findings suggest that delivery of CBT-based interventions by NSHWs can be acceptable, appropriate and feasible in LMIC settings. However, more research is needed to better evaluate these and other under-reported implementation outcomes.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate which available online therapeutic methods, could be utilized as an alternative to conventional face-to-face therapy for individuals suffering from various mental health disorders. Database searches were conducted using topic-related search terms and predetermined inclusion criteria. The final collection of articles used for this systematic review was comprised of 8 articles. Randomized control trials were used for 7 of the studies, while the only exception was a randomized parallel group trial. This systematic review evaluated the influence of the interventions on the respective study participants. Each study reported notable results, which indicated that dispensing online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was a viable means of reducing the symptoms of certain mental health disorders. The involvement of a therapist also demonstrated better results than self-help programs, even if only slightly, and usually the positive effects of treatment lasted longer when a therapist-client relationship was present. This was evidenced in post-treatment follow-ups. Online therapy displayed promise in the treatment of certain mental health disorders. A therapeutic alliance was shown to be an important aspect in determining treatment outcomes and more research is required into the application of online therapeutic methods in developing contexts.

AB  - Introduction: Parenting self-efficacy (PSE) refers to parents' belief in their ability to perform the parenting role successfully, and derives from Bandura's concept of personal self-efficacy formulated within the social cognitive theory. PSE has been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of parenting functioning. At the same time, relatively less is known about its possible role in the situation of migration, when a family experiences acculturation stress in the process of adaptation to the new culture. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to summarize available data on the conceptualization, measurement, and the role of parenting self-efficacy in the context of acculturation processes, and in various groups of immigrant parents.
   Methods: An extensive search of eight electronic databases was conducted in August 2018 and updated in February 2020 to identify peer-reviewed articles on parenting self -efficacy among immigrants. Eleven studies met pre-specified criteria for inclusion. Nine of the studies employed a quantitative design, whereas the remaining two studies used qualitative methods. In three of the quantitative studies, interventions/programs for immigrants were assessed.
   Results: Three different approaches to conceptualizing and measuring PSE were identified in the analyzed papers: domain-general, domain-specific, and narrow domain. Incongruent results were found with regards to the links between the strength of PSE and immigrants' cultural orientation. Additionally, PSE was identified as a mediator between a stronger orientation toward the mainstream culture and more supportive parenting. The qualitative studies indicated that a reduction in PSE was typical for the initial period of immigration and might be a consequence of a forced orientation toward the standards of the receiving country, which was a consequence of the parents wanting to maintain close relations with their teenage children.
   Discussion: Overall, the theoretical and methodological quality of the reported studies varied and hence their findings have to be interpreted with caution. Our analysis clearly points to the usefulness of a multifaceted approach to PSE. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which parental self-efficacy may exert a positive effect on the functioning of immigrant families.

AB  - The world population increases every day as a consequence of the increase in life expectancy and longevity of humans. There are several factors analyzed in the different studies that have been developed on this topic. The research carried out in this field distinguishes biological, cultural, and cognitive factors; some of them describing similar results, while many others showed antagonistic results. Our study was oriented to the accomplishment of a bibliographical revision with the objective to verify the scientific production on "memory, cognitive development, and aging linked with longevity"-international/ national studies were analyzed and identified. The method carried out was through a research in the databases: SciELO, UAM, PePSIC, LILACS, PubMed, PsycINFO, Dialnet, and Teseo; in a period of 10 years, considering the studies published between January 2008 and December 2017. From the results found at first, 16 articles were analyzed after the application of the exclusion criteria. Likewise, we analyzed the relationship of longevity with the level of studies in Spain from a group of people over 60 years of age counted in January 2017. The literature review determined that there are psycho-cultural aspects that have a decisive influence on the increase in longevity, such as the performance of activities with positive mental states, positive emotions and experiences, and the level of studies.

AB  - Objective:
   South Asians (SAs), a rapidly growing minority group in the United States are underrepresented in mental health research. They represent a unique sub-group of Asian immigrants in that their journey to the United States in the last 50 years was driven by the pursuit of academic and career opportunities. Our goal is to provide a topical overview of factors contributing to the mental health challenges of South Asian American (SAA) youth and to describe culturally sensitive approaches that would provide effective treatment for SAA youth and their families.
   Methods:
   We conducted a review of published literature in PubMed and PsycInfo search engines using the key words South Asian immigrants, South Asian Americans, psychological, psychiatric, mental health treatment, therapy and interventions.
   Results:
   The challenges faced by these highly educated families are distinctive in that there is a struggle to maintain ethnic identity based on collectivism while embracing American ideals of individualism. These opposing values along with model minority expectations put SAs at high risk for mental health concerns and acculturative family distancing. Furthermore, mental health stigma impedes help-seeking. Mental health practitioners must navigate the different value systems of the parent-child dyad without ostracizing either generation and deliver effective care. Hence, culturally adapted family therapy and community-based approaches may be particularly relevant in SA youth.
   Conclusion:
   Our article outlines common family attitudes and issues pertinent to mental health in youth and discusses useful clinical approaches to dealing with SAA youth and their families.

More specifically this review attempts to estimate the rate at which Veterans experience the return of symptoms after completing treatment. The review was conducted by the authors in accordance with theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The literature search identified eight eligible studies, which met the predefined inclusion criteria. Of the included studies a majority were deemed to be at a high risk of attrition bias. In addition, few studies comprehensively reported relevant relapse or recurrence related outcome statistics. The implications of the available evidence base on long-term treatment outcomes are discussed. Recommendations for future studies on relapse and recurrence of PTSD symptoms among Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are also presented.

AB  - Objectives
   Colorectal cancer is among the top three most common cancers globally. In order to reduce the health burden, it is important to improve the uptake of colorectal cancer screening by understanding the barriers and facilitators encountered. There are numerous reports in the literature on the views of the general public on cancer screening. However, the experiences of colonoscopy patients are not as well studied. This paper maps their perceptions.
   Methods
   Keyword searches for terms such as 'colorectal', 'colonoscopy' and 'qualitative' were conducted on 3 December 2019 in five databases: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science Core Collection. Qualitative articles that quoted colonoscopy-experienced patients with no prior history of colorectal cancer were included for the thematic analysis. The systematic review was then synthesized according to PRISMA guidelines.
   Results
   The major themes were distilled into three categories: pre-procedure, during and post-procedure. The factors identified in the pre-procedure phase include the troublesome bowel preparation, poor quality of information provided and the dynamics within a support network. Perceptions of pain, emotional discomfort and the role of providers mark the experience during the procedure. The receipt of results, opportunities given for discussion and finances relating to colonoscopy are important post-procedure events.
   Conclusion
   Understanding colorectal cancer screening behaviour is fundamental for healthcare providers and authorities to develop system and personal level changes for the improvement of colorectal cancer screening services. The key areas include patient comfort, the use of clearer instructional aids and graphics, establishing good patient rapport, and the availability of individualized options for sedation and the procedure.

AB  - Objectives:
   Physician-assisted death (PAD), also known as medical assistance in dying, of patients with a psychiatric disorder (PPD) is a global issue of debate. In most jurisdictions that allow PAD, irremediable suffering is a legal requirement, how to apply the concept of irremediability to PPD remains challenging. The aim of this article is to identify the main arguments concerning irremediability in the debate about PAD of PPD and give directions for further moral deliberation and empirical research.
   Methods:
   Systematic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO were combined with 4 additional search strategies. All conceptual-ethical articles, quantitative and qualitative empirical studies, guidelines, case reports, and commentaries that met the inclusion criteria were included, and a qualitative data synthesis was used to identify recurring themes within the literature. The study protocol was preregistered at the Open Science Framework under registration code: thjg8.
   Results:
   A total of 50 articles met the inclusion criteria. Three main arguments concerning irremediability were found in the debate about PAD of PPD: uncertainty, hope, and treatment refusal.
   Conclusions:
   Uncertainty about irremediability is inevitable, so which level of certainty is morally required should be the subject of moral deliberation. Whether PAD induces or resolves hopelessness is an empirical claim that deserves clarification. Treatment refusal in search of PAD raises questions about treatment efficacy in this patient group and about decision-making in the context of the physician-patient relationship. Going forward, more attention should be given to epidemiological research and to specific challenges posed by different psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common among homeless people and is associated with an increased risk of mortality from suicide, medical causes, and drug-related problems. However, there are no previous systematic review and meta-analysis studies that reported the consolidated magnitude of PTSD among homeless people. A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus to discover pertinent studies that determined the prevalence of PTSD among the homeless. Articles were evaluated by titles, abstracts, and full-text. Comprehensive meta-analysis software was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were performed and Cochran's Q- and the I-2 test were used to assess heterogeneity. The evidence of publication bias was evaluated by using Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots. From the total, 19 studies with 20,364 participants across seven countries were included in the final analysis. Our meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of PTSD among homeless people was 27.38% (95% CI; 21.95-33.57). In our subgroup analysis, we found that the prevalence of PTSD was considerably high as measured by the screening instrument (35.93%) than the diagnostic instrument (23.57% %). The prevalence of PTSD among homeless showed a significant variation by the location of the studies, the instruments used to measure PTSD as well as the quality of the included studies. This review showed that the pooled prevalence estimate of PTSD among homeless peoples was remarkably high (27.38%). Early screening and treatment of PTSD among homeless peoples are warranted to alleviate suffering.

AB  - Medical staff caring for COVID-19 patients face mental stress, physical exhaustion, separation from families, stigma, and the pain of losing patients and colleagues. Many of them have acquired SARS-CoV-2 and some have died. In Africa, where the pandemic is escalating, there are major gaps in response capacity, especially in human resources and protective equipment. We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is 'physical distancing' in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk 'allowances' or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic's trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale. Clearly there are multiple ways that international support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, essential for limiting the pandemic's potentially devastating heath, socio-economic and security impacts on the continent.

AB  - Purpose: Complex and widespread stigma exposes sexual minority people to disproportionate risks for adverse mental health. Intersectionality theory calls for consideration of the unique experiences of living with multiple forms of inequality. Yet, concerns remain regarding the extent to which intersectionality theory has been integrated into mental health interventions for sexual minority populations. This systematic review aims to assess the degree to which available mental health interventions account for intersecting forms of marginalization and to identify methods that facilitate the application of intersectionality.
   Methods: A search for peer-reviewed English language journal articles was conducted using PsycINFO and PubMed to locate reports of mental health interventions for sexual minority groups. A coding framework was designed to evaluate how interventions incorporated intersectionality theory.
   Results: Of 1877 potentially eligible articles, forty-three were included in the analysis. They were each classified as low, medium, or high with regard to intersectionality. Thirteen (30.2%) were rated as low on intersectionality for only recruiting a homogeneous group of participants in the interventions; 23 (53.4%) were classified as medium for including additional identities in recruitment without responding to possible intersectional disadvantages; 7 (16.3%) were rated as high with adequate consideration of the complex effects of intersecting positions. In addition, the review identified community-based participatory research as a common and instrumental method to ensure intersectionality.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the limitations of interventions for sexual minority people in addressing intersectionality. Guidelines are needed for clinical practice and evaluation to adequately incorporate intersectionality theory.

AB  - During the last years, an extraordinary effort has been made to identify biomarkers as potential tools for improving prevention, diagnosis, drug response and drug development in psychiatric disorders. Contrary to other diseases, mental illnesses are classified by diagnostic categories with a broad variety list of symptoms. Consequently, patients diagnosed from the same psychiatric illness present a great heterogeneity in their clinical presentation. This fact together with the incomplete knowledge of the neurochemical alterations underlying mental disorders, contribute to the limited efficacy of current pharmacological options. In this respect, the identification of biomarkers in psychiatry is becoming essential to facilitate diagnosis through the developing of markers that allow to stratify groups within the syndrome, which in turn may lead to more focused treatment options. In order to shed light on this issue, this review summarizes the concept and types of biomarkers including an operational definition for therapeutic development. Besides, the advances in this field were summarized and sorted into five categories, which include genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics. While promising results were achieved, there is a lack of biomarker investigations especially related to treatment response to psychiatric conditions. This review includes a final conclusion remarking the future challenges required to reach the goal of developing valid, reliable and broadly-usable biomarkers for psychiatric disorders and their treatment. The identification of factors predicting treatment response will reduce trial-and-error switches of medications facilitating the discovery of new effective treatments, being a crucial step towards the establishment of greater personalized medicine.

AB  - BackgroundIndividuals who conduct disaster relief work overseas are exposed to a variety of traumatic events that can cause distress and trigger psychological illnesses. Identification of which disaster relief workers may be at risk of experiencing psychological distress or mental health disorders is frequently carried out through pre-employment or pre-deployment psychological screening. The primary objective of our review was to assess the evidence for pre-employment and pre-deployment psychological screening of relief workers who work in disaster situations. We aimed to identify specific pre-employment and pre-deployment characteristics that predict impaired wellbeing of an individual following engaging in disaster-related work.MethodsA combined list of search terms was composed relating to disaster-related occupations, screening methods, psychological disorders, and study design. The databases used were PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GlobalHealth. We included studies that used cross-sectional or longitudinal study designs; were published in the English language in peer-reviewed academic journals; reported on the association between pre-employment and pre-deployment features and post-deployment psychological disorders or distress; considered any occupational groups responding to a specified, discrete crisis; and used at least one validated measure of distress or disorder. We extracted data on the author; year of publication; disaster description; country of study; study design; population sample; disorder(s) outcome and the measures used; and results.ResultsSixty-two, high-quality studies were included in the review. Forty-one potential predictors were identified. Of these, only volunteer status and previous history of mental illness and life stressors emerged as reliable predictors of distress or disorder.ConclusionThe results suggest that whilst it is attractive to screen for pre-employment and pre-deployment indicators of resilience, the evidence base for doing so is weak. At best, this sort of screening can only weakly suggest vulnerability and at worst may result in discrimination. Until better evidence about its usefulness becomes available, employers should exercise caution over its use.

AB  - Technology is changing the way organizations and their employees need to accomplish their work. Empirical evidence on this topic is scarce. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the effects of technological developments on work characteristics and to derive the implications for work demands and continuous vocational education and training (CVET). The following research questions are answered: What are the effects of new technologies on work characteristics? What are the implications thereof for continuous vocational education and training? Technologies, defined as digital, electrical or mechanical tools that affect the accomplishment of work tasks, are considered in various disciplines, such as sociology or psychology. A theoretical framework based on theories from these disciplines (e.g., upskilling, task-based approach) was developed and statements on the relationships between technology and work characteristics, such as complexity, autonomy, or meaningfulness, were derived. A systematic literature review was conducted by searching databases from the fields of psychology, sociology, economics and educational science. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Empirical evidence was extracted and its implications for work demands and CVET were derived by using a model that illustrates the components of learning environments. Evidence indicates an increase in complexity and mental work, especially while working with automated systems and robots. Manual work is reported to decrease on many occasions. Workload and workflow interruptions increase simultaneously with autonomy, especially with regard to digital communication devices. Role expectations and opportunities for development depend on how the profession and the technology relate to each other, especially when working with automated systems. The implications for the work demands necessary to deal with changes in work characteristics include knowledge about technology, openness toward change and technology, skills for self- and time management and for further professional and career development. Implications for the design of formal learning environments (i.e., the content, method, assessment, and guidance) include that the work demands mentioned must be part of the content of the trainings, the teachers/trainers must be equipped to promote those work demands, and that instruction models used for the learning environments must be flexible in their application.

AB  - Background Evidence has shown that the prevalence of depression is much higher among patients with tuberculosis (TB) and this, in turn, may adversely impact compliance with anti-TB medications. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively summarize epidemiologic evidence on the prevalence of depression among patients with TB and formulate a recommendation for future clinical practice as well as research. Methods We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct this review. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Psych INFO to identify relevant studies that investigated the prevalence of depression among TB patients. We also supplemented our electronic search with manual searching to include all pertinent studies in the analysis. We used a Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 3.0 (CMA 3.0) to conduct a meta-analysis. We conducted a subgroup and sensitivity analysis and Cochran's Q- and the I-2-statistics were used to assess heterogeneity. The evidence for the presence of publication bias was checked by using Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots. Results We identified a total of 25 studies that included 4903 participants across seven countries. In our analysis, the pooled estimated prevalence of depression among TB patients was found to be 45.19% (95% CI 38.04-52.55). The prevalence was higher in MDR-TB 52.34% (95% CI 38.09-66.22) than non-MDR-TB 43.47% (95% CI 35.88-51.37) patients. We also found that the pooled prevalence of depression was higher among females 51.54% (95% CI 40.34-62.60) when compared to males 45.25% (95% CI 35.19-55.71). The pooled prevalence of depression was 45.45% as measured by HRDS, and it was 55.62%, 45.52%, and 38.36% as measured by BDI, HADS and PHQ-9, respectively. Conclusion Our finding suggested that the pooled estimated prevalence of depression among tuberculosis patients was relatively high. Screening and management of depression among TB patients were warranted to alleviate suffering. Moreover, the integration of tuberculosis program with regular psychiatry services may substantially reduce the burden.

AB  - BackgroundPeer support refers to a process whereby individuals with lived experience of a particular phenomenon provide support to others by explicitly drawing on their personal experience. It has been adopted in a variety of service contexts including homelessness, substance use, mental and physical health. Those who experience homelessness have some of the most complex intersecting health and social challenges. This 'state of the art' review provides a systematic search and synthesis of literature examining use of peer support models within services for people impacted by homelessness and problem substance use.MethodsA systematic search using six databases (CINAHL, SocINDEX, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Knowledge) was conducted in August 2019 and identified 2248 papers published in English after the year 2000. After de-duplication and scanning titles/abstracts, 61 papers were deemed relevant. Three more papers (including one grey literature report) were identified via references, but two papers were later excluded due to relevance. The final 62 papers included studies conducted in five countries. A thematic analysis approach was used to compare and contrast the study findings and provide a synthesis of the main learning points.ResultsIn recent years there has been a substantial increase in research examining the utility of peer support yet there is significant variation across this field. Alongside profiling the range of settings, aims, populations, and main outcomes of these studies, this paper also provides an overview of overarching themes: the overall effectiveness and impact of peer-staffed or peer-led interventions; and challenges commonly faced in these roles. Five themes relating to the challenges faced by peers were identified: vulnerability, authenticity, boundaries, stigma, and lack of recognition.ConclusionsWhile our findings provide support for current efforts to involve individuals with lived experience in providing peer support to those experiencing concurrent problem substance use and homelessness, they also urge caution because of common pitfalls that can leave those providing the support vulnerable. We conclude that peers should be respected, valued, supported, and compensated for their work which is often profoundly challenging. Suggested guidelines for the implementation of peer involvement in research studies and service delivery are presented.

AB  - Dexmedetomidin is a new-generation, highly selective alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a large number of advantages, including its sedative and analgesic properties, its ability to inhibit sympathetic nerves, its reduced anesthetic dosage, its hemodynamic stability, its mild respiratory depression abilities, and its ability to improve postoperative recognition. Its safety and effectiveness, as well as its ability to provide a certain degree of comfort to patients, make it a useful anesthetic adjuvant for a wide range of clinical applications. For example, dexmedetomidine is commonly used in patients undergoing general anesthesia, and it also exerts sedative effects during tracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit patients. In recent years, with the deepening of clinical research on dexmedetomidine, the drug is still applied in the treatment of spastic pain, myofascial pain, neuropathic pain, complex pain syndrome, and chronic headache, as well as for multimodal analgesia. However, we must note that the appropriateness of patient and dose selection should be given attention when using this drug; furthermore, patients should be observed for adverse reactions such as hypotension and bradycardia. Therefore, the safety and effectiveness of this drug for long-term use remain to be studied. In addition, basic experimental studies have also found that dexmedetomidine can protect important organs, such as the brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung, through various mechanisms, such as antisympathetic effects, the inhibition of apoptosis and oxidative stress, and a reduction in the inflammatory response. Moreover, the neuroprotective properties of dexmedetomidine have received the most attention from scholars. Hence, in this review, we mainly focus on the characteristics and clinical applications of dexmedetomidine, especially the role of dexmedetomidine in the nervous system and the use of dexmedetomidine in the relief of neuropathic pain.

AB  - Objectives Compelling evidence from observational studies shows that dietary patterns play a role in the development of depression and depressive symptoms in the general population. However, few studies have specifically sought to explore the association between maternal diet in the postpartum period and PPD. The purpose of this literature review was to synthesise data from existing published studies, examining the association between maternal postpartum diet and PPD symptoms. Methods Relevant studies were identified by systematic search from the Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed and PsycInfo databases for articles published between 1835 and April 2020. Results Of the 931 articles identified, six met eligibility criteria and were included. Four were cross-sectional and two were a cohort design. All but one study showed at least one inverse association, such that greater adherence to a healthy diet in the postpartum period was associated with fewer PPD symptoms. Specifically, if confirmed in further longitudinal and intervention studies, a balanced maternal diet with an emphasis on fruits, vegetables, fish, grains, legumes, and herbs could be a potential option for helping reduce the incidence of PPD. Conclusions This review provides evidence that the postnatal diet could have an effect on PPD symptoms, although further longitudinal and intervention research is warranted.

AB  - Background: Lifestyle medicine interventions have the potential to improve symptom management, daily function, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with advanced or terminal disease receiving palliative or hospice care. The goal of this review is to summarize the current state of the literature on this subject. Methods: The authors used a broad search strategy to identify relevant studies, reviews, and expert opinions, followed by narrative summary of available information. Results: Four main categories of lifestyle interventions feature prominently in the palliative care literature: exercise, nutrition, stress management, and substance use. High-quality studies in this vulnerable population are relatively sparse. Some interventions show promise. However, most show mixed results or inadequate evidence. For some interventions, risks in this generally frail population outweigh the benefits. Clinical decision making involves balancing research findings, including the risks and benefits of interventions, with a clear understanding of patients' prognosis, goals of care, and current physical, emotional, and spiritual state. Achieving optimum QOL, safety, and ethical care are emphasized. Conclusions: The use of lifestyle interventions in patients receiving palliative or hospice care is a complex undertaking, requiring tailoring recommendations to individual patients. There is potential for considerable benefits; however, more research is needed.

AB  - Developmental trauma is associated with an increased risk of psychosis and predicts poor prognosis. Despite this association, little is known about which treatments work best for survivors of developmental trauma with psychosis. We sought to do the first review, to our knowledge, to investigate treatments for people with psychotic and dissociative symptoms who have a history of developmental trauma. We searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar for studies reporting psychological and pharmacological treatments of psychotic or dissociative symptoms in adult survivors of developmental trauma. We identified 24 studies, most of which investigated various modalities of psychotherapy with two case reports of pharmacological treatments. There is preliminary evidence in favour of third wave cognitive therapies. However, because of low methodological quality and reporting in most of the studies found, it remains unknown which treatments are most effective in this clinical group. Nonetheless, our findings of potential treatment targets, including emotion regulation, acceptance, interpersonal skills, trauma re-processing, and the integration of dissociated ego states, could guide future work in this area. Methodologically rigorous studies are needed to enable clinicians and patients to collaboratively form evidence-based treatment plans.

AB  - DNA methylation (DNAm) - an epigenetic process that regulates gene expression - may represent a mechanism for the biological embedding of early traumatic experiences, including childhood maltreatment. Here, we conducted the first systematic review of human studies linking childhood maltreatment to DNAm. In total, 72 studies were included in the review (2008-2018). The majority of extant studies (i) were based on retrospective data in adults, (ii) employed a candidate gene approach (iii) focused on global maltreatment, (iv) were based on easily accessible peripheral tissues, typically blood; and (v) were cross-sectional. Two-thirds of studies (n = 48) also examined maltreatment-related outcomes, such as stress reactivity and psychiatric symptoms. While findings generally support an association between childhood maltreatment and altered patterns of DNAm, factors such as the lack of longitudinal data, low comparability across studies as well as potential genetic and 'pre-exposure' environmental confounding currently limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Key challenges are discussed and concrete recommendations for future research are provided to move the field forward.

We included clinical studies assessing HRV (including baseline HRV and HRV reactivity) in FSSs/SSDs and healthy participants. We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases from the earliest available date to June 2019. Eighty-five studies comprising 3242 FSSs/SSDs patients and 2321 controls were included in the main meta-analysis; the baseline HRV value was significantly lower compared to healthy individuals (Hedges'g, -0.43; 95 % CI, -0.54 to -0.30; p < .001), with the largest effect size in fibromyalgia patients. A significant lower HRV was also found for total variability (Hedges'g, -0.56; 95 % CI, -0.77 to -0.36) and specific parasympathetic indices (Hedges'g, -0.41, 95 % CI; -0.54 to -0.30). HRV reactivity was significantly lower in FSSs/SSDs patients (Hedges'g, -0.42; 95 % CI, -0.64 to -0.20). Our results support the notion that FSSs/SSDs patients have significantly lower HRV than healthy individuals.

AB  - Introduction: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and disordered eating are both common in military populations, yet research on their connection is limited. This systematic review aimed to analyze themes and gaps in the literature and offer recommendations for future research. Methods: Four databases were searched using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and Cooper's approach to research synthesis, resulting in nine articles. Results: Research on ACEs and disordered eating in military populations tended to focus on participants who were Veterans, women, and white. All studies measured sexual abuse, and few explored relational or health outcomes. Discussion: Future research should include diverse samples, a comprehensive assessment of disordered eating, and a wider range of ACEs and other health and relational variables. The inclusion of these variables will contribute to a greater understanding of the far-reaching impact of ACEs on this population.

   Results: We found 923 articles matching our search, and 52 were retained based on their results regarding the psychological factors underlying police officers' decisions to use force and the decision-making process itself. We found that the most frequently studied factors were belonging to an ethnic minority, carrying a conducted energy device (CED), the police department's policies and managerial organization, and the environment in which the encounter occurred. However, it seems that the most predictive factor in the decision to use force is the resistance and behavior of the suspect.

AB  - This article provides a systematic review of the research examining the individual associations of public, personal, and self-stigma for anxiety disorders and a range of demographic and cultural factors impacting on help-seeking processes in the context of stigma. An extensive search of the literature was conducted with 18 studies (N = 17,066), examining mainly social and generalized anxiety disorder identified as satisfying the inclusion criteria. Key findings revealed endorsement of weak-not-sick attitudes were strongest for public stigma. increased awareness of anxiety disorders and mental health literacy were associated with reduced negative personal stigma attitudes, and high levels of self-stigma were associated with poorer treatment outcomes. For public stigma, younger age and geographical rurality were revealed as relevant correlates, whereas gender and cultural differences were each identified as factors influencing personal stigma. This is the first systematic review examining anxiety disorders and stigma, with future research needed to continue investigating this understudied relationship and the related variables that ultimately impact on help-seeking processes.

AB  - Background Prenatal and perinatal insults are implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of psychotic disorders but the consistency and magnitude of their associations with psychosis have not been updated for nearly two decades. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of the evidence on the association between prenatal or perinatal risk and protective factors and psychotic disorders.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the Web of Science database for articles published up to July 20, 2019. We identified cohort and case-control studies examining the association (odds ratio [OR]) between prenatal and perinatal factors and any International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) non-organic psychotic disorder with a healthy comparison group. Other inclusion criteria were enough data available to do the analyses, and non-overlapping datasets. We excluded reviews, metaanalyses, abstracts or conference proceedings, and articles with overlapping datasets. Data were extracted according to EQUATOR and PRISMA guidelines. Extracted variables included first author, publication year, study type, sample size, type of psychotic diagnosis (non-affective psychoses or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, affective psychoses) and diagnostic instrument (DSM or ICD and version), the risk or protective factor, and measure of association (primary outcome). We did random-effects pairwise meta-analyses, Q statistics, I-2 index, sensitivity analyses, meta-regressions, and assessed study quality and publication bias. The study protocol was registered at PROSPERO, CRD42017079261.
   Findings 152 studies relating to 98 risk or protective factors were eligible for analysis. Significant risk factors were: maternal age younger than 20 years (OR 1.17) and 30-34 years (OR 1.05); paternal age younger than 20 years (OR 1.31) and older than 35 years (OR 1.28); any maternal (OR 4.60) or paternal (OR 2.73) psychopathology; maternal psychosis (OR 7.61) and affective disorder (OR 2.26); three or more pregnancies (OR 1.30); herpes simplex 2 (OR 1.35); maternal infections not otherwise specified (NOS; OR 1.27); suboptimal number of antenatal visits (OR 1.83); winter (OR 1.05) and winter to spring (OR 1.05) season of birth in the northern hemisphere; maternal stress NOS (OR 2.40); famine (OR 1.61); any famine or nutritional deficits in pregnancy (OR 1.40); maternal hypertension (OR 1.40); hypoxia (OR 1.63); ruptured (OR 1.86) and premature rupture (OR 2.29) of membranes; polyhydramnios (OR 3.05); definite obstetric complications NOS (OR 1.83); birthweights of less than 2000 g (OR 1.84), less than 2500 g (OR 1.53), or 2500-2999 g (OR 1.23); birth length less than 49 cm (OR 1.17); small for gestational age (OR 1.40); premature birth (OR 1.35), and congenital malformations (OR 2.35). Significant protective factors were maternal ages 20-24 years (OR 0.93) and 25-29 years (OR 0.92), nulliparity (OR 0.91), and birthweights 3500-3999 g (OR 0.90) or more than 4000 g (OR 0.86). The results were corrected for publication biases; sensitivity and meta-regression analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings for most factors.
   Interpretation Several prenatal and perinatal factors are associated with the later onset of psychosis. The updated knowledge emerging from this study could refine understanding of psychosis pathogenesis, enhance multivariable risk prediction, and inform preventive strategies.

AB  - Objective: Social and occupational functioning are important for psychological health. However, quantitative research has suggested that these areas can be adversely affected by multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). This systematic review therefore sought to explore what qualitative research has suggested about how people with MCS perceive it to affect their social and occupational functioning.
   Method: Journal articles were included if they were 1) peer reviewed 2) qualitative or mixed methods 3) published in English 4) reported qualitative findings relevant to the review. Studies were excluded if they were 1) descriptive only 2) primarily concerned with environmental intolerances other than chemicals or 3) focussed on specific populations such as veterans. Quality was assessed using the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2018) qualitative quality criteria. However, quality was not used to determine eligibility for inclusion. Six databases (CINAHL, Medline, PsychArticles, PsychInfo, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched between the 24th of February 2019 and 2nd of March 2019.
   Results: Having removed duplicates, database searches identified 388 potential articles. Thirteen of these articles were eligible for inclusion. Following review, no more articles were included from the reference lists of these studies. Meta-aggregation of the findings identified seven categories. These were synthesised into three themes; 'limited access', 'loss & anxiety' and 'seeking engagement'.
   Conclusions: The findings suggested that MCS limits some people's social and occupational functioning. The results warrant further research, and, the development of prevention and intervention strategies. Studies predominantly recruited United States and Canadian females and had several limitations.

AB  - Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are widely used for controlling pests worldwide. The inhibitory effects of these pesticides on acetylcholinesterase lead to neurotoxic damages. The oxidative stress is responsible for several neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease, seizure, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. Strong evidence suggests that dysfunction of mitochondria and oxidative stress are involved in neurological diseases. OPs can disturb the function of mitochondria by inducing oxidative stress. In the present study, we tried to highlight the role of dysfunction of mitochondria and the induction of oxidative stress in the neurotoxicity induced by OPs. Additionally, the amelioration of OP-induced oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunctional through the chemical and natural antioxidants have been discussed.

AB  - Depression is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease, with high prevalence and relapse rate. Several factors have been considered in order to reduce the depression burden. Among them, physical activity (PA) showed a potential protective role. However, evidence is contrasting probably because of the differences in PA measurement. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis is to assess the association between objectively measured PA and incident and prevalent depression. The systematic review was conducted according to methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Relevant papers published through 31 August 2019 were identified searching through the electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and the Cochrane Library. All analyses were conducted using ProMeta3. Finally, 42 studies met inclusion criteria. The overall Effect size (ES) of depression for the highest vs. the lowest level of PA was -1.16 [(95% CI = -1.41; -0.91), p-value < 0.001] based on 37,408 participants. The results of the meta-analysis showed a potential protective effect of PA on prevalent and incident depression.

AB  - Psychotherapy has proven to be effective for a wide range of mental health problems. However, not all patients respond to the treatment as expected (not-on-track patients). Routine outcome monitoring (ROM) and measurement-based care (MBC), which consist of monitoring patients between appointments and using this data to guide the intervention, have been shown to be particularly useful for these not-on-track patients. Traditionally, though, ROM and MBC have been challenging, due to the difficulties associated with repeated monitoring of patients and providing real-time feedback to therapists. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) might help reduce these challenges. Therefore, we systematically reviewed evidence regarding the use of ICTs for ROM and MBC in face-to-face psychological interventions for mental health problems. The search included published and unpublished studies indexed in the electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS. Main search terms were variations of the terms "psychological treatment", "progress monitoring or measurement-based care", and "technology". Eighteen studies met eligibility criteria. In these, ICTs were frequently handheld technologies, such as smartphone apps, tablets, or laptops, which were involved in the whole process (assessment and feedback). Overall, the use of technology for ROM and MBC during psychological interventions was feasible and acceptable. In addition, the use of ICTs was found to be effective, particularly for not-on-track patients, which is consistent with similar non-ICT research. Given the heterogeneity of reviewed studies, more research and replication is needed to obtain robust findings with different technological solutions and to facilitate the generalization of findings to different mental health populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Benzodiazepines are currently the most commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of anxiety in older adults, although there is a dearth of good-quality data on this subject. The aim of this review was to systematically review studies examining the efficacy and tolerability of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety disorders among older adults.
   METHODS: The authors conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. All searches were limited to English-language articles. The quality of each study was appraised using criteria developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine for randomized controlled trials.
   RESULTS: A total of 8,785 citations were retrieved and pooled in EndNote and de-duplicated to 3,753. This set was uploaded to Covidence for screening. Two separate screeners (AG and SAF) evaluated the titles, abstracts, and full text of the eligible articles. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Across all studies, benzodiazepines were associated with decreased anxiety at the end of the study period. The limited tolerability data show mild adverse effects from the benzodiazepines studied. Limitations of the trials included limited data on the long-term use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and a preponderance of trials examining generalized anxiety disorder, with relatively less data on other anxiety disorders.
   CONCLUSIONS: Benzodiazepines are effective for treating anxiety disorders in late life, at least in the short term, but more data is needed to establish tolerability and their long-term benefits.

AB  - From squid at the bottom of the ocean to humans at the top of mountains, animals have adapted to diverse oxygen-limited environments. Surviving these challenging conditions requires global metabolic reorganization that is orchestrated, in part, by microRNAs that can rapidly and reversibly target all biological functions. Herein, we review the involvement of microRNAs in natural models of anoxia and hypoxia tolerance, with a focus on the involvement of oxygen-responsive microRNAs (OxymiRs) in coordinating the metabolic rate depression that allows animals to tolerate reduced oxygen levels. We begin by discussing animals that experience acute or chronic periods of oxygen deprivation at the ocean's oxygen minimum zone and go on to consider more elevated environments, up to mountain plateaus over 3500 m above sea level. We highlight the commonalities and differences between OxymiR responses of over 20 diverse animal species, including invertebrates and vertebrates. This is followed by a discussion of the OxymiR adaptations, and maladaptations, present in hypoxic high-altitude environments where animals, including humans, do not enter hypometabolic states in response to hypoxia. Comparing the OxymiR responses of evolutionarily disparate animals from diverse environments allows us to identify species-specific and convergent microRNA responses, such as miR-210 regulation. However, it also sheds light on the lack of a single unified response to oxygen limitation. Characterizing OxymiRs will help us to understand their protective roles and raises the question of whether they can be exploited to alleviate the pathogenesis of ischemic insults and boost recovery. This Review takes a comparative approach to addressing such possibilities.

AB  - We reviewed English-language articles concerning obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in older adults. PubMed was searched using key words that included obsessive-compulsive disorder, geriatric, elderly, aging, and older. Of the 644 articles identified, we included 78 that were relevant to the topic. Articles that were excluded as irrelevant included studies that were not focused on OCD in older adults, animal studies, and older case reports if we identified similar more recent case reports. The literature contains very little information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, psychopathology, and treatment of OCD in older adults. Even though the diagnostic criteria for OCD are the same for older and younger adults, different manifestations and progression in older patients have been reported. While the domains and severity of symptoms of OCD do not change with age, pathologic doubt may worsen. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale is used for diagnosing and evaluating illness severity, and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised is another valuable tool for use in older adults. Psychotherapy, specifically exposure and response prevention, is the first-line treatment for OCD because of minimal adverse effects and reported benefit. Although the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved any medications specifically for OCD in older adults, pharmacotherapy is a consideration if psychotherapy is not successful. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have the fewest side effects, while the cardiovascular and anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants are especially worrisome in older adults. OCD in older adults has received little attention, and further studies are needed.

AB  - Maladaptive avoidance/intolerance of negative emotional states has been widely shown to contribute to negative outcomes. Growing interest in this construct has led to the use of multiple terms (e.g., emotion dysregulation, distress intolerance, experiential avoidance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency) to describe such individual differences, each with their own measurement tools. However, to date, the degree to which these terms reflect truly unique attributes is understudied. The aim of the current manuscript is to review five of the most common terms (and associated measurement tools) used to describe these patterns of avoidance/intolerance of negative emotional states to better understand areas of overlap and key differences. We used qualitative content analysis and examined correlations between measures across 114 datasets from published manuscripts (i.e., Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Distress Tolerance Scale, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale-Negative Urgency Subscale; N = 28,648 administrations). Our review suggests that measurement tools for existing terms demonstrate considerable qualitative overlap and moderate-to-large positive correlations (r = 0.24-0.67). Failures to emphasize the unique features associated with each term in existing measures may have minimized the field's ability to evaluate distinct facets of avoidance/intolerance of negative emotional states and to determine whether these facets differentially predict outcomes.

AB  - Background: Improving brain tumor survival rates have drawn increasing focus on neuropsychiatric and psychological outcomes. Objective: This review characterizes the literature on neuropsychiatric sequelae after neurosurgical resection of adult brain tumors. Methods: Using a scoping method, we reviewed articles describing patients with adult brain tumor who underwent partial or total brain resection and examined major neuropsychiatric domains after intervention. Results: The initial search yielded 9903 articles. After duplicate removal, abstract screening, review, and hand searching, 81 articles were found: 63 empirical and 18 nonempirical. Most articles centered on survivorship within the first year. Cognition was most widely studied with a transient worsening during the first month and usually recovery or improvement thereafter. Depression increased in frequency during survivorship and was associated with frontotemporal location, time to survival, quality of life, cognitive and physical parameters, and functional status. Anxiety, independent of depression, related to tumor histology and grading and had a weaker association with cognition and quality of life. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, psychosis, mania, and delirium received little attention. Most studies did not include preoperative neuropsychiatric assessment, and treatment was poorly addressed. Conclusion: This review highlights key gaps, including preoperative and postoperative neuropsychiatric assessment and a short follow-up. A better understanding of postresection neuropsychiatric outcomes can inform our ability to prognosticate and tailor management for patients at risk for these life-impairing conditions.

AB  - Video game live streaming is a kind of real-time video social media that integrates traditional broadcasting and online gaming. With the rapid popularity of video game live streaming in the past decade, researchers have started to investigate the relationship between the use of video game live streaming and various psychological variables. In order to fully understand the factors that affected user participation (streamers and audiences) in video game live streaming and provide a reference to the mental health issues of Internet addiction, this paper summarizes the relevant literature on user behavior in video game live streaming. First, we comprehensively searched literature in six social science databases and thus obtained 24 papers that meet our inclusion criteria. Second, the above literature was presented in table form for classification and we found that the effect factors of user behavior in video game live streaming mainly include user demands and platform impact. Based on Use and Satisfaction theory, this paper reviewed the following four aspects: streamer demand, audience demand, interaction behavior and platform impact, then a relevant theoretical framework was constructed. Finally, this paper looks forward to possible future research topics based on the research platform, research data and research content and so on, hoping to provide a foundation and new ideas for future research.

AB  - Background: Reports have suggested that sexual dysfunction is an underestimated complication of panic disorder, but little research has focused on sexual dysfunction associated specifically with panic disorder. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate whether patients with panic disorder who are not currently receiving treatment had a higher risk of sexual dysfunction than healthy people, as well as to clarify the appropriate treatment for this patient group. Methods: Articles that reported panic disorder complicated with sexual dysfunction were identified by a systematic literature search of electronic databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane databases, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Results: Six articles were included in the review. Patients with panic disorder showed a high prevalence of sexual aversion (35.7% to 64%) and sexual infrequency (36% to 44%). One cohort study indicated that untreated patients with panic disorders had a higher risk of erectile dysfunction than controls. Another article that focused specifically on female patients reported that the patients with panic disorder exhibited decreased frequency of sexual behavior and decreased sexual desire compared with the controls. However, 2 studies found conflicting results after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusions: Although the results were mixed, it appears that patients with panic disorder tended to be more susceptible to sexual dysfunction than the general population. Further trials with larger sample sizes and rigorous research designs are needed to establish the relationship between sexual dysfunction and panic disorder.

AB  - Pain, anxiety, or depression are very prevalent in children and adolescents with cancer, which is a great challenge for health professionals. Several studies pointing out the positive effect of technology on the management of symptoms have been published in recent years. Considering these studies is important in order to reduce the negative impact on the quality of life of this population. This study aimed to analyze the available evidence and to describe the benefits of the new technologies in the treatment of pain, anxiety, and depression in children and adolescents with cancer. A systematic search using six electronic databases was conducted to identify studies using technological interventions with a focus on pain, anxiety, and depression that were published from 2008 to 2018 including oncology patients from 0-18 years old. Out of the 1261 studies that were identified, five studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Robots were used in two studies, providing amusement and social interventions that showed significant improvements. Virtual reality, a mobile application, and a videogame were used in three studies and obtained beneficial results in pain and anxiety. The studies included in this review suggest that new technologies can be used as an innovative form of non-pharmacological intervention with therapeutic benefits.

AB  - The fear avoidance model (FAM) represents a cognitive-behavioral explanatory approach for pain chronification. The core assumption is that fear of pain (FOP) following an acute pain experience facilitates the development of pain chronification, disability, and receding functionality. Thus, the model predicts a positive association between FOP and pain intensity in pain patients, which was frequently investigated; however, results were inconsistent. To highlight inconsistencies, we performed integrative statistical analysis aimed at evaluating the strength of the cross-sectional relation between FOP and pain intensity in clinical research and reviewing its moderation through demographic, pain-specific and psychosocial characteristics. To this end, we searched the databases PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science and included 253 independent effect size estimates (N = 42 463). The overall mean effect size was computed based on a random-effects model. By utilizing the artifact distribution method, we supplemented it with an analysis correcting for artifacts. The magnitude of the positive association equated to the threshold between a small to medium effect size, which was expected as the FAM predicts an indirect relation only. The association turned out to be stable across different FOP measures, but was significantly moderated by age, pain localization, first-time pain episode, pain onset, treatment status, and anxiety sensitivity. A potentially necessary differentiation of patient subgroups and suggestions for an adjusted methodological approach of future research are discussed.

AB  - Early recognition and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in youth are critical. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the up-to-date evidence for pharmacological options for children with PTSD. Eight electronic databases were searched and a manual search of the full text of included articles was performed. Two independent reviewers performed screening of the articles using the predetermined eligibility criteria. The data were extracted by two independent reviewers. The search generated 32 articles with a total patient population of 833. The pharmacological options were antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, alpha-adrenergic agents, beta-blockers, serotonin and histamine antagonists, and opioid agonists. The mood stabilizers and second-generation antipsychotics should be reserved for patients with significant safety concerns or aggressive behaviors because of their side-effect profile. Alpha-adrenergic agonists can be used in patients who are re-experiencing symptoms of PTSD and without safety concerns.

AB  - Monozygotic (MZ) twin studies constitute a key resource for the dissection of environmental and biological risk factors for human complex disorders. Given that epigenetic differences accumulate throughout the lifespan, the assessment of MZ twin pairs discordant for depression offers a genetically informative design to explore DNA methylation while accounting for the typical confounders of the field, shared by co-twins of a pair. In this review, we systematically evaluate all twin studies published to date assessing DNA methylation in association with depressive phenotypes. However, difficulty to recruit large numbers of MZ twin pairs fails to provide enough sample size to develop genome-wide approaches. Alternatively, region and pathway analysis revealed an enrichment for nervous system related functions; likewise, evidence supports an accumulation of methylation variability in affected subjects when compared to their co-twins. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies incorporating known risk factors for depression such as childhood trauma are required for understanding the role that DNA methylation plays in the etiology of depression.

AB  - Duloxetine has been increasingly administered, but the associated cardiovascular adverse event risk is not clearly understood. Therefore, we identified the association between duloxetine and cardiovascular adverse events through an analysis of heart rate and blood pressure change. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov , and psycINFO in June 2019. The title, abstract, and full text were checked in order to obtain articles. A meta-analysis was conducted with random effect model and quality of articles was evaluated using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0. The manuscript has been written according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) harm checklist. A total of 4009 studies were screened by the title and abstract. After reviewing 186 full texts, 17 studies were finally selected for the meta-analysis. Nine of the 17 studied duloxetine given for mood disorders and 8 for pain control. The duration of 14 studies was under 13 weeks. Cardiovascular adverse events (hypertension, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, tachycardia atrial fibrillation, and cerebrovascular accident) were reported. The meta-analysis demonstrated that duloxetine increased heart rate by 2.22 beats/min (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 1.53, 2.91) and diastolic blood pressure by 0.82 mmHg (95% CI: 0.17, 1.47). Our findings may be the signal for the safety of cardiovascular disease for short-term use of duloxetine. Well-designed pharmaco-epidemiological studies evaluating the causal relationship between long-term use of duloxetine and cardiovascular disease is still necessary.

KW  - HEALTH
AB  - Purpose of review One of the defining trends of population movement in the last half century has been global urbanization. Depression is the most common mental disorder in the world, but it is unclear how urbanization and urban living affect depression outcomes. Grounded in a previously articulated conceptual framework, we systematically reviewed recently published studies on urbanization, urbanicity, and depression. Recent findings Eleven articles were included in this review. Four studies found that living in urban areas was associated with elevated odds or more symptoms of depression. Three studies - all done in China - estimated protective effects of urbanization or urbanicity on depression. Two studies concluded no overall clear association. The remaining two articles stratified by urbanicity and found that greenspace was inversely associated with depression in more densely populated areas relative to rural areas. Other themes discussed included global and national trends such as aging, immigration, and planned urbanization in China, as well as urban living conditions such as traffic noise, air pollution, proximity to roadways, neighborhood social capital, and social cohesion. Urbanization may affect depression differentially across geographic regions and income levels. More research is needed, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, and on intersections between urbanization and other emerging global trends.

AB  - Background: There is preliminary evidence for lavender as an anxiolytic agent through various routes of administration. Our goal is to elucidate the best route of administration for lavender as a treatment for anxiety.
   Methods: Thirteen electronic search engines were systematically scanned for relevant publications. The relevant articles were included after the title and abstract screening followed by the full-text screening. This study included randomized control trials reporting lavender for the treatment of anxiety. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017076711). Frequentist network meta-analysis and Bayesian meta-regression were conducted to report the best treatment modality and the effect of covariates on the effectiveness as an anxiolytic. Treatment arms were ordered according P-scores, where higher P-score indicates better treatment choice.
   Results: Forty studies were eligible for qualitative analysis, and 32 were included in quantitative analysis. Lavender aromatherapy was the best approach for the treatment of anxiety among other lavender modalities at the first week recording [Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)=-0.57, 95% CI (-1.14-0.01), Pscore =0.72], in addition to achieve at the first time points [SMD=-0, 95% CI (-0.97.-0.16), Pscore =0.69], compared to placebo; however, lavender massage along with foot bath were found to be the most efficacious for anxiety treatment at the study endpoint [SMD=-1.10, 95% CI=(-7.41. 5.21), Pscore =0.65]. Furthermore, network meta-regression revealed that the duration of therapy influenced treatment, suggesting Silexan (oral lavender) 80 mg (first rank probability=.116) as the favorable option for anxiety in long-term treatment.
   Conclusions: Lavender aromatherapy is, clinically, superior in short-duration, while Silexan (oral lavender) 80 mg is preferable for long-term treatment of anxiety.

AB  - Animal models in neuropsychiatric research need validation. One way to address external validity is systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The present study presents a meta-analysis of the effects of antidepressants in the mouse tail suspension test (TST).
   A PubMed search identified studies that examined imipramine and fluoxetine effects in the TST. Inclusion criteria were testing in the light phase; trial duration was six minutes; immobility time scored 6 or (last) 4 min; adult mice; acute intraperitoneal (IP) administration. Effect sizes (ES) were estimated using Cohen's d, heterogeneity of ES with Cochran's Q test, correlations between dose and ES with Pearson's correlation and differences between strains with Analysis of variance.
   Results show that antidepressants decrease immobility time in the TST and a correlation between drug dose and ES but no effects of strain.
   We suggest that the TST is a valid tool to quantitatively, consistently and reproducibly capture the immobility-reducing aspects of fluoxetine and imipramine and that the lack of strain effects is due to small number of experiments in many of the strains.

AB  - Background: Cyberchondria (CYB) has been described relatively recently as a behaviour characterized by excessive online searching for medical information that is associated with increasing levels of health anxiety. Although CYB has received some attention from researchers, there is no consensus about many of its aspects.
   Aims: We describe one of the first reported cases of a treatment-seeking patient with CYB. We review the published literature on the definition of CYB, its assessment, epidemiology, cost and burden, psychological models and mechanisms associated with CYB, relationships between CYB and mental disorders and prevention and treatment strategies.
   Methods: Systematic review of all peer-reviewed papers published within the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases.
   Results: 61 articles were selected. Nearly all the studies were descriptive and cross-sectional recruiting sample mainly from the general/university student population and collecting self-report data via online surveys. Data on epidemiology, clinical features, course, comorbidity and therapeutic interventions were scarce. CYB showed a self-reported association with health anxiety, hypochondriasis and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as well as other forms of problematic usage of the internet (PUI) The psychological mechanisms associated with CYB include low self-esteem, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, pain catastrophizing and certain meta-cognitive beliefs.
   Conclusion: A working definition of CYB includes excessive online health searches that are compulsive and may serve the purpose of seeking reassurance, whilst leading to a worsening of anxiety or distress and further negative consequences. CYB represents a clinically relevant transdiagnostic compulsive behavioural syndrome, closely related to PUI and usually presenting in association with health anxiety, hypochondriasis and/or OCD. CYB is clearly in need of further study and we identify key areas for future research. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background To examine the effectiveness and safety of yoga of women with sleep problems by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Medline/PubMed, ClinicalKey, ScienceDirect, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched throughout the month of June, 2019. Randomized controlled trials comparing yoga groups with control groups in women with sleep problems were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated risk of bias by using the risk of bias tool suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration for programming and conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The main outcome measure was sleep quality or the severity of insomnia, which was measured using subjective instruments, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), or objective instruments such as polysomnography, actigraphy, and safety of the intervention. For each outcome, a standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 95% were determined. Results Nineteen studies in this systematic review included 1832 participants. The meta-analysis of the combined data conducted according to Comprehensive Meta-Analysis showed a significant improvement in sleep (SMD = - 0.327, 95% CI = - 0.506 to - 0.148, P < 0.001). Meta-analyses revealed positive effects of yoga using PSQI scores in 16 randomized control trials (RCTs), compared with the control group in improving sleep quality among women using PSQI (SMD = - 0.54; 95% CI = - 0.89 to - 0.19; P = 0.003). However, three RCTs revealed no effects of yoga compared to the control group in reducing insomnia among women using ISI (SMD = - 0.13; 95% CI = - 0.74 to 0.48; P = 0.69). Seven RCTs revealed no evidence for effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving sleep quality for women with breast cancer using PSQI (SMD = - 0.15; 95% CI = - 0.31 to 0.01; P = 0.5). Four RCTs revealed no evidence for the effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving the sleep quality for peri/postmenopausal women using PSQI (SMD = - 0.31; 95% CI = - 0.95 to 0.33; P = 0.34). Yoga was not associated with any serious adverse events. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that yoga intervention in women can be beneficial when compared to non-active control conditions in term of managing sleep problems. The moderator analyses suggest that participants in the non-breast cancer subgroup and participants in the non-peri/postmenopausal subgroup were associated with greater benefits, with a direct correlation of total class time with quality of sleep among other related benefits.

AB  - Background: Universities represent an important setting for health promotion. The unique collective of university students is of particular relevance since they are the leaders, decision-makers, and parents of tomorrow. In this context, modifiable health influencing factors as well as interventions to prevent these, play a crucial role. Therefore, the present umbrella review aims to (i) provide an overview of review articles addressing epidemiological issues (prevalence and determinants) of modifiable health influencing factors in university students and (ii) to provide an overview of review articles addressing the evidence of interventions to promote/enhance modifiable health influencing factors in university students.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in the databases PubMed, Cochrane Reviews Library und Web of Science according to the PRISMA guidelines. Only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. The AMSTAR-2-Tool was used for the quality assessment.
   Result: The initial search resulted in 10,726 records of which 81 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with a further distinction in articles with an epidemiological focus (n = 39) and in articles with interventional approaches (n = 42). Topics of the different review articles ranged from physical activity over mental health, substance use, sleep, diet and nutrition, and media consumption. Many review articles had a specific focus on medical and nursing students and originated from the U.S.A., U.K., or China.
   Discussion: This umbrella review provides an overview of review articles on the epidemiology of modifiable health influencing factors and on the evidence of interventions targeting these factors among university students. Thereby, experts as well as stakeholders in the field could gain insights into crucial target points for health promotion. It identifies research gaps in terms of study region and groups of students.

AB  - Aims There has been a surge in child mental health literacy training programmes for non-mental health professionals. No previous review has examined the effectiveness of child mental literacy training on all professionals in contact with children.
   Methods Studies were identified through a systematic literature search of the Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO databases in February 2019. The review included studies that delivered training to professionals who have regular contact with young people aged 0 to 19 in the context of their role and at least one component of mental health literacy; (a) knowledge, (b) attitudes, (c) confidence in helping, (d) intention to help and (e) actual helping behaviour. The quality of papers was reviewed using the Cochrane revised Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs for non RCTs.
   Results Twenty-one studies met eligibility criteria (n = 3243). There was some evidence that global and specific child mental health literacy training improved professionals' knowledge and stigma-related attitudes towards mental health. Few studies investigated the impact of training on actual helping behaviour.
   Conclusion There may be value in providing child mental health literacy training to professionals in contact with children, however there is a need for studies to evaluate the long-term impact of such training, particularly on subsequent access to appropriate support. Findings raise concerns about the quality of the studies reported in the systematic review and recommendations are made for future studies.

AB  - Background
   There are different ways to define stabilization and currently, the main standpoint regards it as no-depression/no-mania. Furthermore, each person is physiologically different from childhood to adulthood, and in old age, thus the meaning of stabilization should take into account both growth and maturity. We aimed to review systematically studies focusing on mood stabilization in all phases of bipolar disorder (BD) and across all life phases, including pregnancy and the perinatal period, which is still a different phase in women's life cycles.
   Methods
   We carried out a PubMed search focusing on studies of bipolar disorder treated with drugs and aimed at stabilization with the following search strategy stabiliz*[ti] OR stabilis*[ti] OR stable[ti] OR stability[ti]) AND mood[ti] AND bipolar. In conducting our review, we followed the PRISMA statement. Agreement on inclusion was reached by consensus of all authors through a Delphi rounds procedure.
   Results
   The above search strategy produced 509 records on January 25, 2020. Of them, 58 fitted our inclusion criteria and were discussed. The eligible studies spanned from September 1983 to July 6, 2019.
   Conclusions
   No clear-cut indications could be drawn due to a number of limitations involving sample inconsistency and different methods of assessing mood stabilization. The evidence collected so far does not allow recommended treatments for Adolescents, pregnant or perinatal women, and aged patients. However, adults, not within these groups, better focused upon. For their manic/mixed phases, second generation antipsychotic drugs may be useful in the short-to-medium run, alone or combined with mood stabilizers (MSs). However, MSs, and especially lithium, continue to be pivotal in chronic treatment. Bipolar depression should rely on MSs, but an antidepressant may be added on and can prove to be helpful. However, there are concerns with the tendency of antidepressants to induce the opposite polarity or mood instability, rendering the need for concurrent MS prescription mandatory.

AB  - Background Household chaos, represented by the level of disorganisation or environmental confusion in the home, has been associated with a range of adverse child and family outcomes. This review aims to (1) identify how household chaos is measured, (2) chart study details of household chaos literature, and (3) map the existing literature with respect to the relationship between household chaos and child, parent, and family outcomes. We expect that this review will highlight the need to consider the importance of household chaos in child well-being research, particularly in those families where children may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of household chaos. Methods We searched five electronic databases (last updated September 1st 2018) in addition to Google Scholar, and identified publications via a 3-stage screening process, which was conducted by two researchers. Published studies were included if they investigated the association between household chaos and child, parent, or family outcomes. Research that investigated household chaos as a mediator or moderator, or that investigated how the relationship between household chaos and the outcome of interest was mediated or moderated, were also included. Results One hundred twelve studies in 111 publications were included. The majority were conducted in the United States (n = 71), and used either cross-sectional (n = 60) or longitudinal (n = 49) study designs. Outcomes of interest were categorised into seven categories: (1) cognitive and academic (n = 16), (2) socio-emotional and behavioural (n = 60), (3) communication (n = 6), (4) parenting, family, and household functioning (n = 21), (5) parent outcomes (n = 6), (6) hormone (n = 8), and (7) physical health and health behaviours (n = 19). There was consistent evidence for significant correlations between household chaos and adverse outcomes across all seven categories in diverse populations with respect to age, disease status, and socio-economic status (SES). Conclusion There is consistent evidence for associations between household chaos and a number of adverse child, parent, and family-level outcomes. Household chaos may also help describe variations in outcomes between low SES and child development.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a kind of regulated cell death (RCD) caused by the redox state disorder of intracellular microenvironment controlled by glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is inhibited by iron chelators and lipophilic antioxidants. In addition to classical regulatory mechanisms, new regulatory factors for ferroptosis have been discovered in recent years, such as the P53 pathway, the activating transcription factor (ATF)3/4 pathway, Beclin 1 (BECN1) pathway, and some non-coding RNA. Ferroptosis is closely related to cancer treatment, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia-reperfusion of organ, neurotoxicity, and others, in particular, in the field of neurodegenerative diseases treatment has aroused people's interest. The nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2/NFE2L2) has been proved to play a key role in neurodegenerative disease treatment and ferroptosis regulation. Ferroptosis promotes the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, while the expression of Nrf2 and its target genes (Ho-1, Nqo-1, and Trx) has been declined with aging; therefore, there is still insufficient evidence for ferroptosis and Nrf2 regulatory networks in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of ferroptosis regulatory mechanisms, as well as an emphasis on the mechanism of Nrf2 regulating ferroptosis. We also highlight the role of ferroptosis and Nrf2 during the process of neurodegenerative diseases and investigate a theoretical basis for further research on the relationship between Nrf2 and ferroptosis in the process of neurodegenerative diseases treatment.

AB  - Objective:
   Addiction comorbidity is an important clinical challenge in mood disorders, but the best way of pharmacologically treating people with mood disorders and addictions remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for mood and addiction symptoms in people with mood disorders and addiction comorbidity.
   Methods:
   A systematic search of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of pharmacological treatments in people with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD), and comorbid addictions was performed. Treatment-related effects on mood and addiction measures were assessed in a meta-analysis, which also estimated risks of participant dropout and adverse effects.
   Results:
   A total of 32 studies met systematic review inclusion criteria. Pharmacological therapy was more effective than placebo for improving manic symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -0.29 to -0.02; P = 0.03) but not BD depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.03; P = 0.15). Quetiapine significantly improved manic symptoms (SMD = -0.23; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.06; P = 0.008) but not BD depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.23 to 0.10; P = 0.42). Pharmacological therapy was more effective than placebo for improving depressive symptoms in MDD (SMD = -0.16; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.03; P = 0.02). Imipramine improved MDD depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI, -1.03 to -0.13; P = 0.01) but Selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI)-based treatments had no effect (SMD = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.17; P = 0.60). Pharmacological treatment improved the odds of alcohol abstinence in MDD but had no effects on opiate abstinence.
   Conclusions:
   Pharmacological treatments were significantly better than placebo in improving manic symptoms, MDD depressive symptoms, and alcohol abstinence but were not better for bipolar depression symptoms. Importantly, quetiapine was not more effective than placebo in improving bipolar depression symptoms nor were SSRI's for the treatment of MDD depression. Our findings highlight the need for further high-quality clinical trials of treatments for mood disorders and comorbid addictions.

Alexithymia represents a personality trait reflecting an intrinsic difficulty in recognizing the emotional components of subjective experiences. Thus, its modulating role on treatment outcome has gathered substantial attention during the past years. In the present paper, we aimed at exploring the available evidence for Alexithymia role in influencing the treatment outcome on a wide range of psychiatric conditions by means of a systematic review.
   Data Source
   We performed a systematic review in Medline and Scopus, augmented by tracking the reference list of the pertinent articles.
   Inclusion Criteria
   To be included in this review, research studies had to assess alexithymia impact on a treatment intervention delivered to manage a primary psychiatric disorder.
   Study Evaluation and Data Synthesis
   After removing duplicates, titles were screened first, then abstracts, and last full texts were read, eventually leading to the inclusion or exclusion of the papers according to the criteria established before the online search. Then results of the search were downloaded in.xml format and uploaded in Rayyan, a free web software, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. After uploading, screening of the literature was performed in blind by two investigators. Disagreement between reviewers was resolved by joint discussion with a third senior investigator. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Thereafter, the data considered relevant was extracted and synthetized in this paper.
   Results
   Our search yielded a total of 30 articles dealing with a wide range of psychiatric conditions and exploring both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Several lines of evidence suggest a complex role for alexithymia in influencing the psychiatric treatment outcome, further underscoring the need for additional research in this area to better address the existing knowledge gaps.

AB  - Assessing psychophysiological responses of emotion regulation is a cost-efficient way to quantify emotion regulation and to complement subjective report that may be biased. Previous studies have revealed inconsistent results complicating a sound interpretation of these findings. In the present study, we summarized the existing literature through a systematic search of articles. Meta-analyses were used to evaluate effect sizes of instructed downregulation strategies on common autonomic (electrodermal, respiratory, cardiovascular, and pupillometric) and electromyographic (corrugator activity, emotion-modulated startle) measures. Moderator analyses were conducted, with moderators including study design, emotion induction, control instruction and trial duration. We identified k = 78 studies each contributing multiple sub-samples and performed 23 meta-analyses for combinations of emotion regulation strategy and psychophysiological measure. Overall, results showed that effects of reappraisal and suppression on autonomic measures were highly inconsistent across studies with rather small mean effect sizes. Electromyography (startle and corrugator activity) showed medium effect sizes that were consistent across studies. Our findings highlight the diversity as well as the low level of standardization and comparability of research in this area. Significant moderation of effects by study design, trial duration, and control condition emphasizes the need for better standardization of methods. In addition, the small mean effect sizes resulting from our analyses on autonomic measures should be interpreted with caution. Findings corroborate the importance of multi-channel approaches.

AB  - While early efforts in psychiatry were focused on uncovering the neurobiological basis of psychiatric symptoms, they made little progress due to limited ability to observe the living brain. Today, we know a great deal about the workings of the brain; yet, none of this neurobiological awareness has translated into the practice of psychiatry. The categorical system which dominates psychiatric diagnosis and thinking fails to match up to the real world of genetics, sophisticated psychological testing, and neuroimaging. Nevertheless, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) recently published a position paper stating that neuroimaging provided no benefit to the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Using the diagnosis of depression as a model, we illustrate how setting aside the unrealistic expectation of a pathognomonic "fingerprint" for categorical diagnoses, we can avoid missing the biological and, therefore, treatable contributors to psychopathology which can and are visualized using functional neuroimaging. Infection, toxicity, inflammation, gut-brain dysregulation, and traumatic brain injury can all induce psychiatric manifestations which masquerade as depression and other psychiatric disorders. We review these and provide illustrative clinical examples. We further describe situations for which single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) functional neuroimaging already meet or exceed the criteria set forth by the APA to define a neuroimaging biomarker, including the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, the differential diagnosis of ADHD, and the evaluation of traumatic brain injury. The limitations, both real and perceived, of SPECT and PET functional neuroimaging in the field of psychiatry are also elaborated. An important overarching concept for diagnostic imaging in all its forms, including functional neuroimaging, is that imaging allows a clinician to eliminate possibilities, narrow the differential diagnosis, and tailor the treatment plan. This progression is central to any medical diagnostic process.

AB  - Issue addressed Social support is essential during early motherhood. Societal changes have altered the support networks of mothers of young children, placing them at greater risk of social isolation. The aim of this review was to explore the research related to the experience of social support for mothers of young children to understand how to best promote social connections for the current generation of mothers.
   Methods A systematic search of eight electronic databases through EBSCOhost was undertaken to identify Australian research published from 2013 onwards. No study design limits were applied. Research which focussed into understanding the social support of mothers with children 0-5 years and had outcomes related to mothers experiences were included.
   Results Fifteen studies were included. Both face-to-face and online support provided benefits to mothers of young children in terms of shared experiences and reciprocity; trust and intimacy; community connectedness and; mental well-being. While online communities offered immediacy of access to social support, contemporary mothers continued to value social support accessed in face-to-face settings. Accessing face-to-face support was a challenge for young mothers and those in new housing areas.
   Conclusions Face-to-face programs continue to promote the health of contemporary mothers; however, online settings provide avenues for alternative or complimentary support. There is a need to further develop support programs for vulnerable and isolated mothers.
   So what? Social support is essential for mothers of young children and opportunities to enhance social connections are important to boosting mental well-being. While face-to-face programs still need to be provided, services should consider including online options to promote the health of contemporary Australian mothers.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis examines how exercise modifies brain and behavior in healthy mice, dementia (D) and Parkinson disease (PD) models. A search was performed on the Medline and Scopus electronic databases (2008-2019). Search terms were "mice", "brain", "treadmill", "exercise", "physical exercise". In the total, 430 were found but only 103 were included. Animals n = 1,172; exercised 4-8 weeks (Range 24 h to 32 weeks), 60 min/day (Range 8-120 min per day), and 10/12 m/min (Range 0.2 m/min to 36 m/min). Hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum and whole brain were more frequently investigated. Exercise improved learning and memory. Meta-analysis showed that exercise increased: cerebral BDNF in health (n = 150; z = 5.8, CI 3.43-12.05; p < 0.001 I2 = 94.3 %), D (n = 124; z = 4.18, CI = 2.22-9.12; p < 0.001; I2 = 93.7 %) and PD (n = 16 z = 4.26, CI 5.03-48.73 p < 0.001 I2 = 94.8 %). TrkB improved in health (n = 84 z = 5.49, CI 3.8-17.73 p < 0.001, I2 = 0.000) and PD (n = 22; z = 3.1, CI = 2.58-67.3, p < 0.002 I2 = 93.8 %). Neurogenesis increased in health (n = 68; z = 7.08, CI 5.65-21.25 p < 0.001; I2 17.58) and D model (n = 116; z = 4.18, CI 2.22-9.12 p < 0.001 I2 93.7 %). Exercise augmented amyloid clearance (n = 166; z = 7.51 CI = 4.86-14.85, p < 0.001 I2 = 58.72) and reduced amyloid plaques in D models (n = 49; z = 4.65, CI = 3.94-15.3 p < 0.001 I2 = 0.000). In conclusion, exercise improved brain and behavior, neurogenesis in healthy and dementia models, reduced toxicity and cerebral amyloid. Evidence regarding inflammation, oxidative stress and energy metabolism were scarce. Studies examining acute vs chronic exercise, extreme training and the durability of exercise benefit were rare. Vascular or glucose metabolism changes were seldom reported.

AB  - Background: Peer support is recognized globally as an essential recovery service for people with mental health conditions. With the influx of digital mental health services changing the way mental health care is delivered, peer supporters are increasingly using technology to deliver peer support. In light of these technological advances, there is a need to review and synthesize the emergent evidence for peer-supported digital health interventions for adults with mental health conditions.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify and review the evidence of digital peer support interventions for people with a lived experience of a serious mental illness.
   Methods: This systematic review was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) procedures. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between 1946 and December 2018 that examined digital peer support interventions for people with a lived experience of a serious mental illness. Additional articles were found by searching the reference lists from the 27 articles that met the inclusion criteria and a Google Scholar search in June 2019. Participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) criteria were used to assess study eligibility. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and reviewed all full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Methodological Quality Rating Scale.
   Results: A total of 30 studies (11 randomized controlled trials, 2 quasiexperimental, 15 pre-post designs, and 2 qualitative studies) were included that reported on 24 interventions. Most of the studies demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of peer-to-peer networks, peer-delivered interventions supported with technology, and use of asynchronous and synchronous technologies.
   Conclusions: Digital peer support interventions appear to be feasible and acceptable, with strong potential for clinical effectiveness. However, the field is in the early stages of development and requires well-powered efficacy and clinical effectiveness trials.

AB  - Background: Effective occupational health and safety management (OHSM) is important to employee health, enterprise sustainability, and social stability. However, scientific research into OHSM lags behind practice, and contextualizing OHSM research from the perspective of its historical evolution is urgently required.
   Methods: The mapping of knowledge domains, based on bibliometric analysis, was adopted to classify 4,852 journal articles related to OHSM listed in the core database of Web of Science and published between 1900 and 2018.
   Results and Conclusions: Risk assessment/management at the organizational level were found to have always been research hotspots, and the relationship between safety culture/atmosphere, sickness absence, and safety performance, among other factors, have become core research topics in the field in recent years. Research at the individual level has gradually evolved from an early focus on physiological problems such as work-related musculoskeletal disorders and low back pain, further toward issues such as occupational stress, mental health, and quality of life. In addition, the results of clustering analysis based on high-frequency keywords indicated six aspects of OHSM: OHSM mode and method; OHSM systems and standards; OHS risk assessment and management; OHSM and safety culture; mental health and quality of life; and specific disease management. Future development trends in OHSM research are described providing theoretical and practical reference for further study.

AB  - Sadness is typically characterized by raised inner eyebrows, lowered corners of the mouth, reduced walking speed, and slumped posture. Ancient subcortical circuitry provides a neuroanatomical foundation, extending from dorsal periaqueductal grey to subgenual anterior cingulate, the latter of which is now a treatment target in disorders of sadness. Electrophysiological studies further emphasize a role for reduced left relative to right frontal asymmetry in sadness, underpinning interest in the transcranial stimulation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as an antidepressant target. Neuroimaging studies - including meta-analyses - indicate that sadness is associated with reduced cortical activation, which may contribute to reduced parasympathetic inhibitory control over medullary cardioacceleratory circuits. Reduced cardiac control may - in part - contribute to epidemiological reports of reduced life expectancy in affective disorders, effects equivalent to heavy smoking. We suggest that the field may be moving toward a theoretical consensus, in which different models relating to basic emotion theory and psychological constructionism may be considered as complementary, working at different levels of the phylogenetic hierarchy.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature from large databases and registries to assess the effects of ADHD medication on associated functional outcomes.
   Study design: A literature search was performed in PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for articles published prior to January 2019. Sample size, age range, country of origin, medication type, number of functional events and non-events, odds ratios and hazard ratios, and means and standard deviations were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for 21 studies examining functional outcomes.
   Results: 40 articles were included. The majority suggest a robust protective effect of ADHD medication treatment on mood disorders, suicidality, criminality, substance use disorders, accidents and injuries, traumatic brain injuries, motor vehicle crashes, and educational outcomes. Similarly, the meta-analyses demonstrated a protective effect of medication treatment on academic outcomes, accidents and injuries, and mood disorders.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that ADHD medication treatments are associated with decreases in the risks for a wide range of ADHD-associated functional outcomes supporting efforts aimed at early diagnosis and treatment of individuals with ADHD.

AB  - Background: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy is approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A recent 5-year comparative study prompted this review of its impact in this very severe population. Previous systematic literature reviews (SLR) cited concerns in terms of missing studies or patient duplication.
   Methods: This SLR addressed these criticisms, assessed all outcomes of longer-term adjunctive VNS in all studies, irrespective of TRD severity, comparing where feasible with treatment-as-usual (TAU). We searched for adult VNS +TAU studies (January 1, 2000 to June 24, 2019). Comparative and single-arm studies were eligible. All reported efficacy, safety and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were assessed. Where possible, meta-analysis was used to calculate overall pooled effect estimates across studies at several time points.
   Results: Of 22 identified studies, there were two randomized controlled (RCI'), sixteen single-arm and four nonrandomized comparative studies. Numerous depression-specific, safety and QOL measures were reported. Metaanalysis was possible for three efficacy [Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Clinician Global Impression-Improvement, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression] and three safety [serious adverse events, study drop-outs and all-cause mortality] but no QOL measures. Data beyond 2 years was not poolable. Analyses demonstrated that antidepressant benefits improved to 24 months and safety issues were minimal. Heterogeneity was high and statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Despite limitations in the evidence base, our comprehensive summary of VNS+TAU outcomes suggests that this treatment provides improving benefit and hope for this very hard-to-treat chronic population. More comparative TRD studies should describe safety and QOL. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background Approximately 188 million people use cannabis yearly worldwide, and it has recently been legalised in 11 US states, Canada, and Uruguay for recreational use. The potential for increased cannabis use highlights the need to better understand its risks, including the acute induction of psychotic and other psychiatric symptoms. We aimed to investigate the effect of the cannabis constituent Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alone and in combination with cannabidiol (CBD) compared with placebo on psychiatric symptoms in healthy people.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies published in English between database inception and May 21, 2019, with a within-person, crossover design. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting symptoms using psychiatric scales (the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]) following the acute administration of intravenous, oral, or nasal THC, CBD, and placebo in healthy participants, and presenting data that allowed calculation of standardised mean change (SMC) scores for positive (including delusions and hallucinations), negative (such as blunted affect and amotivation), and general (including depression and anxiety) symptoms. We did a random-effects meta-analysis to assess the main outcomes of the effect sizes for total, positive, and negative PANSS and BPRS scores measured in healthy participants following THC administration versus placebo. Because the number of studies to do a meta-analysis on CBD's moderating effects was insufficient, this outcome was only systematically reviewed. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019136674.
   Findings 15 eligible studies involving the acute administration of THC and four studies on CBD plus THC administration were identified. Compared with placebo, THC significantly increased total symptom severity with a large effect size (assessed in nine studies, with ten independent samples, involving 196 participants: SMC 1.10 [95% CI 0.92-1.28], p<0.0001); positive symptom severity (assessed in 14 studies, with 15 independent samples, involving 324 participants: SMC 0.91 [95% CI 0.68-1.14], p<0.0001); and negative symptom severity with a large effect size (assessed in 12 studies, with 13 independent samples, involving 267 participants: SMC 0.78 [95% CI 0.59-0.97], p<0.0001). In the systematic review, of the four studies evaluating CBD's effects on THC-induced symptoms, only one identified a significant reduction in symptoms.
   Interpretation A single THC administration induces psychotic, negative, and other psychiatric symptoms with large effect sizes. There is no consistent evidence that CBD induces symptoms or moderates the effects of THC. These findings highlight the potential risks associated with the use of cannabis and other cannabinoids that contain THC for recreational or therapeutic purposes.

AB  - The focus and inclusion of gay men in academic literature has fluctuated throughout the years. The purpose of the present rapid review was to establish the predominant discourses and research gaps in the literature surrounding gay men's sexual relationships within five high-impact sexuality journals. We included The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality to gain insight into the rhetoric of gay men's sexual relationships from a Canadian context to determine if there were any differences compared to the larger five journals. The present analysis used a rapid review design, and search criteria based on Hirsh's h-index. All articles in each of the six selected journals were examined over an eight-year period, from 2011-2018 with 336 articles identified and included in the thematic analysis. The results yielded the following key categories: a) sexual risk behaviours; b) need for interventions, harm/risk reduction, and prevention measures; c) minority stress; d) sexual scripts and masculinity; e) Internet use and online dating; f) mental health concerns; g) sexual satisfaction and sexual well-being; h) previous non-consensual sexual experiences/interpersonal violence; and i) sexual difficulties. These categories are further explored and areas for future research are discussed.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex, lifelong condition that is disproportionately prevalent among minority populations. Haitian immigrants (HIs) living in the US with T2D have unique factors that influence diagnosis, treatment, and self-management. The purpose of this integrative review was to provide a synthesis of the research on T2D in the HI population. In a systematic literature search, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. Three themes were identified: risk factors for less self-management and/or worse metabolic control; protective factors for better self-management and/or metabolic control; and mixed results. HIs had higher HbA(1c), yet better self-management, different genetic profiles, and lower levels of vitamin D and hemoglobin concentration compared to other ethnic groups. HIs also reported better dietary quality, less healthcare utilization, and higher perceived emotional/psychological stress compared to other ethnic groups. This study has implications for practice for integrating the unique cultural factors when assessing and intervening with HIs.

AB  - Introduction In light of growing concerns about an increasingly digital adolescence, the academic field investigating how digital technologies affect adolescents' psychological well-being is growing rapidly. In the last years, much research has amassed, and this has been summarised in over 80 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Materials and Methods Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and key studies are reviewed to provide insights into the state of current research linking digital technology and social media use to well-being; possible future directions and improvements are discussed. Results When examining the reviews, it becomes evident that the research field is dominated by cross-sectional work that is generally of a low quality standard. While research has highlighted the importance of differentiating between different types of digital technology use many studies do not consider such necessary nuances. These limitations aside, the association between digital technology use, or social media use in particular, and psychological well-being is-on average-negative but very small. Furthermore, the direction of the link between digital technology use and well-being is still unclear: effects have been found to exist in both directions and there has been little work done to rule out potential confounders. Conclusions Reviewing the last decade of reviews in the area, it is evident that the research field needs to refocus on improving transparency, interpreting effect sizes and changing measurement. It also needs to show a greater appreciation for the individual differences that will inherently shape each adolescent's reaction to digital technologies.

AB  - Although several empirical studies and systematic reviews have documented the mental health impacts of global climate change, the range of impacts has not been well understood. This review examines mental health impacts of three types of climate-related events: (1) acute events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires; (2) subacute or long-term changes such as drought and heat stress; and (3) the existential threat of long-lasting changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels and a permanently altered and potentially uninhabitable physical environment. The impacts represent both direct (i.e. heat stress) and indirect (i.e. economic loss, threats to health and well-being, displacement and forced migration, collective violence and civil conflict, and alienation from a degraded environment) consequences of global climate change.

AB  - The application of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for neuronal stimulation is studied in different animal models and in humans, and has shown to improve cerebral metabolic activity and blood flow, and provide neuroprotection via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways. Recently, intranasal PBMT (i-PBMT) has become an attractive and potential method for the treatment of brain conditions. Herein, we provide a summary of different intranasal light delivery approaches including a nostril-based portable method and implanted deep-nasal methods for the effective systemic or direct irradiation of the brain. Nostril-based i-PBMT devices are available, using either lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs), and can be applied either alone or in combination to transcranial devices (the latter applied directly to the scalp) to treat a wide range of brain conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular diseases, depression and anxiety as well as insomnia. Evidence shows that nostril-based i-PBMT improves blood rheology and cerebral blood flow, so that, without needing to puncture blood vessels, i-PBMT may have equivalent results to a peripheral intravenous laser irradiation procedure. Up to now, no studies were conducted to implant PBMT light sources deep within the nose in a clinical setting, but simulation studies suggest that deep-nasal PBMT via cribriform plate and sphenoid sinus might be an effective method to deliver light to the ventromedial part of the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex. Home-based i-PBMT, using inexpensive LED applicators, has potential as a novel approach for neurorehabilitation; comparative studies also testing sham, and transcranial PBMT are warranted.

AB  - Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) was approved by Food and Drug Administration for Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, primary generalised or segmental dystonia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment. The exact mechanism of DBS remains unclear which causes side effects. The aim of this review was to assess variables causing stimulation-induced chronic psychiatric/personality-changing side effects. Methods: The analysis of scientific database (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE) was conducted. The included articles had to be research study or case report and DBS to be conducted in therapeutic purposes. The researches with mental disorders in patients' medical histories were excluded. Results: Seventeen articles were used in the review. In the group of movement disorders the characteristic of side effects was strongly related to the placement of the electrode implantation. Tiredness/fatigue was correlated with DBS in thalamus. Implantations in subthalamic nucleus were mostly followed by affective side effects such as depression or suicide. The higher voltage of electrode was connected with more severe depression after implantation. The analysis of affective disorder contained only three articles - two about OCD and one about depression. Forgetfulness and word-finding problems as activities connected with cognition may be an inevitable side effect if obsessive thoughts are to be inhibited. Conclusion: DBS of subthalamic nucleus should be seen as the most hazardous place of implantation. As a result there is a strong need of 'gold standards' based on the connectivity research and closer cooperation of scientists and clinicians.

AB  - Background Evidence on workplace health promotion interventions at sea is scattered and includes different methodological approaches. The continued focus on lifestyle and health promotion on land-based industries makes it pertinent to evaluate available data from maritime settings to gain systematic knowledge on the field. Methods In this systematic review, we systematically searched PubMed and NLM Gateway (for MEDLINE), Institute of Scientific Information/Web of Science (ISI/WOS), and SCOPUS up to January 2019 using standard keywords including lifestyle interventions in the maritime setting. Two independent reviewers assessed papers and extracted the data. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Due to significant heterogeneity between studies, the effectiveness of interventions was presented as a qualitative synthesis. Results After the initial search and refinement based on a total of 4432 records, ten articles met eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. Six studies originated from US maritime settings, 3 studies were conducted on Danish seafarers and one study came from Finland. The main focus of 6 studies was educational interventions including stress management, healthy eating, anti-smoking and anti-drinking sessions, sexual behavior program, and advice about preventive strategies. Four studies described the implementation of interventions, including micro-nutrient supplementation, physical activity, and pharmacotherapy. Follow-up assessments occurred over a time period ranging from 80 days to 2 years. found a positive though limited effect of structural and/or education interventions in maritime settings. The quality of all included studies was modest. Conclusion Results of this systematic review show that a limited number of studies of lifestyle interventions in the maritime setting exist and that the quality of them is generally modest. Also, most of the interventions identified have failed to demonstrate substantial health benefits for seafarers. Systematic review registration number in PROSPERO: CRD42019134533

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are a prominent class of neurological diseases currently without a cure. They are characterized by an inexorable loss of a specific type of neurons. The selective vulnerability of specific neuronal clusters (typically a subcortical cluster) in the early stages, followed by the spread of the disease to higher cortical areas, is a typical pattern of disease progression. Neurodegenerative diseases share a range of molecular and cellular pathologies, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate toxicity, calcium load, proteolytic stress, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and aging, which contribute to neuronal death. Efforts to treat these diseases are often limited by the fact that they tend to address any one of the above pathological changes while ignoring others. Lack of clarity regarding a possible root cause that underlies all the above pathologies poses a significant challenge. In search of an integrative theory for neurodegenerative pathology, we hypothesize that metabolic deficiency in certain vulnerable neuronal clusters is the common underlying thread that links many dimensions of the disease. The current review aims to present an outline of such an integrative theory. We present a new perspective of neurodegenerative diseases as metabolic disorders at molecular, cellular, and systems levels. This helps to understand a common underlying mechanism of the many facets of the disease and may lead to more promising disease-modifying therapeutic interventions. Here, we briefly discuss the selective metabolic vulnerability of specific neuronal clusters and also the involvement of glia and vascular dysfunctions. Any failure in satisfaction of the metabolic demand by the neurons triggers a chain of events that precipitate various manifestations of neurodegenerative pathology.

AB  - Background
   Low back pain is a common disorder that has many consequences. This study is an attempt to meta-analyze the risk of depression symptoms in back pain.
   Method
   Four databases were selected for review, and this search was conducted using key words. Eleven eligible articles were selected for review and meta-analysis was conducted. Subgroup analyses were continued with study design and the method of measuring depression. Also, the heterogeneity and publication bias were examined.
   Results
   Eleven cohort and cross-sectional articles are used in the meta-analysis between back pain and depressive symptoms. The odds ratio 2.07 was calculated for this relationship. In prospective-cohort studies, 1.71 (95% confidence interval = 1.24-2.36) results indicated that back pain is a risk factor for depression symptoms and in cross-sectional studies, pooled odds ratio (2.33; 95% confidence interval = 1.29-4.21) showed that back pain is associated with depression symptoms. Some degree of publication bias was not found in the study.
   Conclusions
   Back pain is an effective factor in increasing the likelihood of depression. Adoption of effective prevention and treatment approaches can play an important role in reducing the psychological consequences in these individuals.

AB  - Late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) is dominated clinically and experimentally by a focus on dopamine neuron degeneration and ensuing motor system abnormalities. There are, additionally, a number of non-motor symptoms - including cognitive and psychiatric - that can appear much earlier in the course of the disease and also significantly impair quality of life. The neurobiology of such cognitive and psychiatric non-motor symptoms is poorly understood. The recognition of genetic forms of late-onset PD, which are clinically similar to idiopathic forms in both motor and non-motor symptoms, raises the perspective that brain cells and circuits - and the behaviors they support - differ in significant ways from normal by virtue of the fact that these mutations are carried throughout life, including especially early developmental critical periods where circuit structure and function is particularly susceptible to the influence of experience-dependent activity. In this focused review, we support this central thesis by highlighting studies of LRRK2-G2019S mouse models. We describe work that shows that in G2019S mutants, corticostriatal activity and plasticity are abnormal by P21, the end of a period of excitatory synaptogenesis in striatum. Moreover, by young adulthood, impaired striatal synaptic and non-synaptic forms of plasticity likely underlie altered and variable performance by mutant mice in validated tasks that test for depression-like and anhedonia-like behaviors. Mechanistically, deficits in cellular, synaptic and behavioral plasticity may be unified by mutation-linked defects in trafficking of AMPAR subunits and other membrane channels, which in turn may reflect impairment in the function of the Rab family of GTPases, a major target of LRRK2 phosphorylation. These findings underscore the need to better understand how PD-related mutant proteins influence brain structure and function during an extended period of brain development, and offer new clues for future therapeutic strategies to target non-motor cognitive or psychiatric symptoms of PD.

AB  - Problem identification: The aim was to synthesize the dyadic literature on depression among couples in which one person has breast cancer. Literature search: A database search (PubMed, PsychInfo, CINAHL) was conducted to synthesize the literature. Studies' methodological quality was evaluated, and correlates of depression/interdependence were abstracted. Data evaluation/synthesis: Ten (of 270) studies met the inclusion criteria and were of satisfactory methodological quality. Depression is prevalent in both patients and partners, and was correlated with many psychosocial variables including sexual satisfaction, relationship quality, social support, and appraisal of health. Depression in one member of the dyad predicted depression in their companion. Conclusions: Levels of relationship quality, sexual satisfaction, and support felt by couples facing breast cancer may be predictive of depression in each individual. The depressive state of one partner appears to influence the other. More research is needed to support dyadic strategies for mitigating depression in couples facing breast cancer.

AB  - Background: Mental health research output in the Arab region is increasing, yet little is known about its recent landscape. This study provides a bibliometric analysis of mental health research in all 22 Arab countries over the past decade.
   Method: We used 760 journals and numerous keywords to search for articles published between 2009 and 2018 by individuals affiliated with institutions located in the Arab region. We analyzed data within Arab countries and between Arab and non-Arab countries.
   Results: We found that research output in the Arab world has increased by almost 160% in the past ten years, in comparison to 57% for the rest of the world. The quality of publications has also steadily improved, and so did international collaboration. Despite the progress, the number of articles per capita remains remarkably lower for the Arab world compared to the rest of the world. Also, the majority of articles continue to emanate from a limited number of countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon) and institutions within these countries. Mental health research topics in the Arab region are similar to those found in low- and middle-income countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.
   Conclusion: The region needs to invest more in mental health research to close the gap with other medical and healthcare research areas and with the rest of the world. The region also needs to increase its international collaboration and research training to produce higher-quality studies, attract more funding, and publish more in top journals. As the region's population continues to face increasing trauma as a result of war and terrorism, among others, the field is afforded an opportunity to establish a major standing in the healthcare domain. Researchers are uniquely poised to use their body of research evidence to effectively help people reengage with their environments and return to daily life activities.

AB  - Predator-prey interactions are critical in ecological communities, but it is increasingly clear that a predator's effect goes beyond eating prey. Fear of predators may also alter the behaviour, physiology, and morphology of prey as they try to reduce risk. Such 'non-consumptive effects' (NCEs) may have important demographic effects on prey populations. The study of NCEs has recently grown significantly across marine ecosystems, including coral reefs. Coral reefs support diverse predator assemblages, and consumptive effects substantially impact prey populations, suggesting NCEs are also likely to be important. Indeed, a growing number of aquarium and field studies have demonstrated that the behaviour of reef fishes is changed by predators, typically using predator models or a gradient of fishing pressure. Here, we review these studies to summarise what is currently known about NCEs in reef-fish assemblages, including effects on individuals and populations and variations in space and time caused by predator and prey traits and environmental factors, and the evidence for NCEs driving trophic cascades. Critically, throughout we also draw on a wider literature to highlight hypotheses and theories emerging in other ecosystems that can inform further work on reefs. While it is clear NCEs are significant among reef fishes and can alter reef functioning, evidence of demographic changes, mechanistic pathways (e.g. behavioural vs. stress induced), and work with multiple predators and prey is lacking. We suggest that establishing an initial framework of interactions among different predator and prey types is needed, allowing the integration of factors such as habitat complexity and internal prey state (e.g. hunger), and an increased understanding of how fishes move around seascapes of fear and how to integrate NCEs into ecosystem models. Such integration is critical for a fuller understanding of how fish assemblages function, interact with benthic organisms, and will be affected by environmental stressors.

AB  - Introduction
   Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is often associated with impairments in emotional and cognitive domains. Contrarily to the emotional sphere, neural basis underpinnings to cognitive impairments are still not well known.
   Methods
   We performed a bibliographic search on PUBMED of all the studies investigating the cognitive impairments in PTSD individuals. We considered only studies that applied cognitive tasks using a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging technique. The inclusion criteria were met by nine studies.
   Results
   Overall, PTSD individuals reported significant impairments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, inferior temporal cortex, supplement motor area, and Default Mode Network (DMN). Moreover, abnormal activity was reported in subcortical structures (e.g. hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus) and in the cerebellum.
   Limitations
   Cognitive functioning was assessed using different cognitive tasks. Potential confounding factors such as age, sex, symptoms intensity, and comorbidities might have influenced the results.
   Conclusion
   So far, the evidence reported that PTSD is characterized by cognitive impairments in several domains, such as attention, memory and autonomic arousal, which may be due to selective dysfunctions in brain regions that are part of cortical networks, the limbic system and DMN. However, further studies are needed in order to better assess the role of cognitive impairments in PTSD and to develop more targeted therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Survival-maximizing, well-timed actions are a key responsibility of the brain. Hypothalamic neurons containing neurotransmitters orexins/hypocretins are important players in this process. Individuals without orexin neurons display inappropriately-timed transitions between arousal states, and other behavioural abnormalities including increased risk-taking. Deciphering neural circuits through which orexin neurons control brain states and behavior thus illuminates brain mechanisms of context-appropriate actions. This review outlines and puts into broader context recent examples of orexin circuit analyses in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), two brain regions clasically implicated in context-appropriate actions. In the LH, orexin neurons excite GAD65-expressing neurons. The LH(GAD65) neuron excitation induces elevated locomotor activity, while inhibition of LH(GAD65) neuron natural activity depresses voluntary locomotion. The orexin -> LH (GAD65) circuit may therefore assist in creating the drive to run. In the NAc shell region, orexin axons excite D2 neurons (dopamine-inhibited neurons expressing dopamine type-2 receptor). NAc(D2) cell activation increases risk-avoidance behaviors, while NAc(D2) cell inhibition reduces risk-avoidance. The excitatory orexin -> NAc (D2) circuit may thus assist in reducing risk-taking, and oppose the inhibitory VTA(dopamine) -> NAc(D2) circuit during computation of risk appetite. Neural computation in these local and long-range orexin circuits may thus assist in generating risk-avoiding locomotor responses to stressors known to activate orexin neurons, such as body energy depletion or potential external threats. A model is proposed where orexin-opposing, inhibitory inputs acting on the orexin target neurons may context-specifically channel orexin-induced brain excitation towards particular sets of actions.

AB  - Early-life adversity affects nearly half of all youths in the United States and is a known risk factor for psychiatric disorders across the life course. One strategy to prevent mental illness may be to target interventions toward children who are exposed to adversity, particularly during sensitive periods when these adversities may have even more enduring effects. However, a major obstacle impeding progress in this area is the lack of tools to reliably and validly measure the existence and timing of early-life adversity. In this review, we summarize empirical work across dentistry, anthropology, and archaeology on human tooth development and discuss how teeth preserve a time-resolved record of our life experiences. Specifically, we articulate how teeth have been examined in these fields as biological fossils in which the history of an individual's early-life experiences is permanently imprinted; this area of research is related to, but distinct from, studies of oral health. We then integrate these insights with knowledge about the role of psychosocial adversity in shaping psychopathology risk to present a working conceptual model, which proposes that teeth may be an understudied yet suggestive new tool to identify individuals at risk for mental health problems following early-life psychosocial stress exposure. We end by presenting a research agenda and discussion of future directions for rigorously testing this possibility and with a call to action for interdisciplinary research to meet the urgent need for new biomarkers of adversity and psychiatric outcomes.

AB  - Background Sensory symptoms are defined as atypical behavioral responses to daily sensory stimuli that impact on the performance of everyday routines. Sensory symptoms have been observed in young people with and without developmental concerns. There is uncertainty, however, regarding the best way to identify and manage sensory symptoms. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of current best evidence regarding measurement of and interventions for sensory symptoms. Methods A narrative review methodology is adopted to address the aims of this paper. First, sensory symptoms are defined, and then, an overview of the evidence for the relationship between sensory symptoms and childhood function is provided. Second, commonly used sensory assessment tools are summarized and evaluated. Finally, an overview and critique of the evidence for sensory and nonsensory-based interventions addressing sensory symptoms are given. Results The terminology used to describe sensory symptoms varies by discipline, and several conceptual taxonomies including sensory subtypes have been proposed. There is ample evidence to support the association of sensory symptoms with childhood function including social engagement, repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and participation in self-care routines. Measurement of sensory symptoms is dominated by proxy-report instruments, and few single instruments assess the entire domain of sensory symptomatology. The evidence for interventions for sensory symptoms is emerging but still limited by low quantity and methodological concerns. Conclusions Effective management of sensory symptoms may mitigate the burden of neurodevelopmental disability and mental illness in young people. Identification of sensory symptoms should be conducted by a skilled practitioner utilizing multiple measurement methods. Intervention protocols for sensory symptoms should be informed by current best evidence which is strongest for Ayres Sensory Integration(R), Qigong massage, the Alert Program(R), and Social Stories. To make significant progress in this field, however, new intervention studies must address the question of 'what intervention works for whom?'.

AB  - Background: Many studies have been conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) to identify the stress factors involved in the health of professionals and the quality and safety of care. The objectives are to identify the psychometric scales used in these studies to measure stressors and to assess their relevance and validity/reliability.
   Methods: All peer-reviewed full-text articles published in English between 1997 and 2016 and focusing on an empirical quantitative study of job stressors were identified through searches on seven databases and editorial portals.
   Results: From the 102 studies analyzed, we identified 59 different scales: 17 "all settings scales" (16 validated scales), 20 "healthcare settings scales" (13 validated scales), and 22 "ICU settings scales" (two validated scales). All these scales used measured stressors from at least one of the following eight broad categories: High job demands, Problematic relationships with other professionals, Lack of control over work situations and career, Lack of organizational resources, Problematic situations with users and relatives, Dealing with ethical- and moral-related situations, Risk management issues, and Disadvantages in comparison to other occupational situations. The "all settings scales" and "healthcare settings scales," the most often validated, did not measure, or only slightly measured, the stressors most specific to ICUs. Where these were taken into account, the authors were forced to develop their own tools or modify existing scales without testing the validity of the tool used.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the lack of a tool that meets both the criteria of validity and relevance with regard to the specificity of work in ICUs. Future research must focus on developing reliable/valid tools covering all types of relevant stressors to ensure the quality of the studies carried out in this field.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on the psychological and physiological health of rheumatoid arthritis patients. An extensive literature search was conducted, using the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI Scholar, WanFang, and VIP databases, from inception to December2018. The quality of the studies was evaluated by 2 independent authors, according to the basic criteria provided by the Cochrane Handbook for evaluating randomized trials. Meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.3. Six randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria of the current study. Using standard mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), our results showed that cognitive behavioral therapy could significantly reduce levels of anxiety (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.52, -0.09], P= 0.005) and depression (SMD = -0.48, 95% CI [-0.70, -0.27], P< 0.00001), and relieve fatigue symptoms (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI [-0.60, -0.10], P= 0.006) in rheumatoid arthritis patients.This is the first known assessment of the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy on rheumatoid arthritis patients using meta-analysis. Large-scale randomized controlled trials need to be implemented to further explore this issue.

AB  - Background
   Depression is a common threat to children and adolescents in terms of affecting psychosocial development and increasing their risk of suicide. Apart from conventional treatments for depression, physical exercise has become a promising alternative. This paper aims to systematically review the existing meta-analyses that focus on the impact of physical exercise on clinical and nonclinical depression in children and adolescents.
   Methods
   A systematic literature search was conducted using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MedLine, PubMed, and hand searching. Risk of bias analysis, effect sizes calculations, and evaluation of the methodological characteristics (AMSTAR 2) were carried out.
   Results
   Four meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria. After analysing the overlap, the total sample contained 30 single studies (mostly including gender mixed samples) and 2,110 participants (age range 5-20 years). The medium duration of the interventions was 11.5 weeks. The sessions had a medium length of 41 min, and the frequency of implementation was three sessions per week. The most implemented intervention type was aerobic exercise, while control groups mainly continued with their regular routine, among other related options. The overall mean effect of physical exercise on depression was medium (d = -0.50). The additional analysis in clinically depressed samples documented a small to medium mean effect (d = -0.48) in favor of the intervention.
   Conclusion
   The small to medium but consistently positive effects that were found in the present study place physical exercise as a promising and helpful alternative for children and adolescents with clinical and nonclinical depression. The limited literature focused on children and adolescents in comparison with adult samples points to the need for further research.

AB  - Background: Visual stimuli are frequently incorporated into interventions that use narratives to meet counseling, therapy, education, and clinical needs. However, the treatment efficacy of visual stimuli is unclear. This systematic review synthesizes and evaluates visual narrative interventions addressing anxiety. Methods: Databases (n = 9) and extended reference searches identified 13 original studies using visual artifacts in narrative interventions for adult anxiety. The visual stimulations were analyzed based on artifact origin, user interactivity, and functions of the stimuli. Results: Three types of visual artifacts- virtual reality (VR) (n = 4), videos (n = 4), and drawings (n = 5) were found. Dichotomous patterns of artifact origin (native vs. foreign) and interactivity (participatory vs. non-participatory) characterized the applications. A hierarchy of functions- engage, externalize, internalize, and rescript was observed. Most studies confirmed the positive effects on the varied anxiety conditions; however, unclear risk of bias and extraneous factors was present. Conclusions: Future visual narrative studies addressing adult anxiety are recommended to strengthen the current body of knowledge by using double-blinded randomized control trials with robust anxiety measures, incorporating artifact origin and user interactivity in intervention designs, considering alternative stimuli with high accessibility, such as images, and including employment-related anxiety conditions.

AB  - The field of disaster and emergency management has shifted in focus towards the goal of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). However, the degree to which the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) field has followed this trend is relatively unknown. Therefore, the objectives of this review were to identify relevant projects, materials, and publications relating to MHPSS and DRR integration and define current domains of action in this integration. A review was conducted using a two-pronged approach for data collection. This approach included 1) a mapping exercise eliciting relevant documentation and project descriptions from MHPSS actors, and 2) a database and internet literature search. The mapping exercise was conducted between January and November 2019, while the literature search was completed in March 2019. The majority of identified materials concerned actions of capacity and systems building; preparedness; policy development, consensus building, and awareness raising; school- and child-focused DRR; inclusive DRR; and resilience promotion. Results also suggested that relatively little consensus exists in terms of formal definitions of and frameworks or guidance for integrating MHPSS and DRR. Moreover, domains of action varied in terms of current implementation practices and empirical evidence. Materials and projects are reviewed and discussed in terms of implications for advancing the integration of DRR and MHPSS and expanding MHPSS approaches to include building better before emergencies.

KW  - CONSEQUENCES
AB  - Little scientific evidence exists on ways to decrease the psychological stress experienced by disaster responders, or how to maintain and improve their mental health. In an effort to grasp the current state of research, we examined research papers, agency reports, the manuals of aid organisations, and educational materials, in both English and Japanese. Using MEDLINE, Ichushi-Web (Japanese search engine), Google Scholar, websites of the United Nations agencies, and the database of the Grants System for Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, 71 pertinent materials were identified, 49 of which were analysed. As a result, 55 actions were extracted that could potentially protect and improve the mental health of disaster responders, leading to specific recommendations. These include (1) during the pre-activity phase, enabling responders to anticipate stressful situations at a disaster site and preparing them to monitor their stress level; (2) during the activity phase, engaging in preventive measures against on-site stress; (3) using external professional support when the level of stress is excessive; and (4) after the disaster response, getting back to routines, sharing of experiences, and long-term follow-up. Our results highlighted the need to offer psychological support to disaster responders throughout the various phases of their duties.

AB  - Objectives Pain and other physical symptoms commonly co-occur in childhood. There is debate about the relevance of somatization in understanding pain. The present review critically appraised and synthesized the extant literature on the relationship between pediatric pain and somatization.
   Methods A systematic review (PROSPERO registration #95956) was conducted in Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL using search terms related to pain and somatization in children and adolescents. A total of 156 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. For studies that measured somatization using a symptom questionnaire, descriptions of "somatization" were extracted. Data regarding the relationship between pain and somatization were extracted for studies measuring somatization using a diagnostic category (e.g., Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders [SSRDs]).
   Results While many studies using somatic symptom questionnaires described somatization as having a psychological component, this was not always captured in measurement tools. Pain was reported as a common symptom in patients with an SSRD diagnosis, though rates varied depending on the specific diagnosis and pain location. Rates of SSRD diagnoses among pain patients were less frequent than rates of pain amongst SSRD patients.
   Conclusions SSRDs and pain commonly co-occur, though rates differ depending on diagnosis and pain location. Understanding the relationship between pain and somatization is complicated by the discrepancy between how somatization is defined and measured in questionnaire studies. A comprehensive and measurable definition of somatization is needed so researchers can better identify the shared and unique contributions of pain and somatization in pediatric populations.

PsychINFO, Social Work Abstracts, PubMed, and Medline were searched for manuscripts published between January 1995 through July 2016 as part of a registered review protocol (PROSPERO) following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if they were an intervention study that used CBT to treat anxiety in predominately U.S. Latino adult samples. Risk of bias was assessed using two National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tools. Overall, 4 studies met inclusion criteria. Results supported CBT interventions to be efficacious for Latinos with anxiety and CBT interventions with cultural adaptations to address some barriers to treatment. Limitations and implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - Background Over 240 million children live in countries affected by conflict or fragility, and such settings are known to be linked to increased psychological distress and risk of mental disorders. While guidelines are in place, high-quality evidence to inform mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) interventions in conflict settings is lacking. This systematic review aimed to synthesise existing information on the delivery, coverage and effectiveness of MHPSS for conflict-affected women and children in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Methods We searched Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO) databases for indexed literature published from January 1990 to March 2018. Grey literature was searched on the websites of 10 major humanitarian organisations. Eligible publications reported on an MHPSS intervention delivered to conflict-affected women or children in LMICs. We extracted and synthesised information on intervention delivery characteristics, including delivery site and personnel involved, as well as delivery barriers and facilitators, and we tabulated reported intervention coverage and effectiveness data.
   Results The search yielded 37 854 unique records, of which 157 were included in the review. Most publications were situated in Sub-Saharan Africa (n=65) and Middle East and North Africa (n=36), and many reported on observational research studies (n=57) or were non-research reports (n=53). Almost half described MHPSS interventions targeted at children and adolescents (n=68). Psychosocial support was the most frequently reported intervention delivered, followed by training interventions and screening for referral or treatment. Only 19 publications reported on MHPSS intervention coverage or effectiveness.
   Discussion Despite the growing literature, more efforts are needed to further establish and better document MHPSS intervention research and practice in conflict settings. Multisectoral collaboration and better use of existing social support networks are encouraged to increase reach and sustainability of MHPSS interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic with 1771514 cases identified in the world and 70029 cases in Iran until April 12, 2020. The co-prescription of psychotropics with COVID-19 medication is not uncommon. Healthcare providers should be familiar with many Potential Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) between COVID-19 therapeutic agents and psychotropic drugs based on cytochrome P450 metabolism. This review comprehensively summarizes the current literature on DDIs between antiretroviral drugs and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and psychotropics, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics.
   Methods: Medical databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify studies in English with keywords related to psychiatric disorders, medications used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 medications.
   Results: There is a great potential for DDIs between psychiatric and COVID-19 medications ranging from interactions that are not clinically apparent (minor) to those that produce life-threatening adverse drug reactions, or loss of treatment efficacy. The majority of interactions are pharmacokinetic interactions via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.
   Conclusion: DDIs are a major concern in the comorbidity of psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 infection resulting in the alteration of expected therapeutic outcomes. The risk of toxicity or lack of efficacy may occur due to a higher or lower plasma concentration of medications. However, psychiatric medication can be safely used in combination with COVID-19 pharmacotherapy with either a wise selection of medication with the least possibility of interaction or careful patient monitoring and management.

AB  - Background: Neurodegenerative diseases cause progressive irreversible neuronal loss that has broad downstream effects. The neuroendocrine system regulates homeostasis of circuits that control critical functions such as the stress response, metabolism, reproduction, fluid balance, and glucose control. These systems are frequently disrupted in neurodegenerative disorders yet often overlooked in clinical practice. Objective: This review aims to gather the available data regarding these disturbances in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease and also to demonstrate the volume of literature in these individual arenas. Methods: Using the scoping review framework, a literature search was performed in Pub Med to identify relevant articles published within the past 30 years (January 1988 to November 2018). The search criteria produced a total of 2022 articles, 328 of which were identified as relevant to this review. Results: Several major themes emerged from this review. These neuroendocrine disturbances may be a precursor to the illness, a part of the primary pathophysiology, or a direct consequence of the disease or independent of it. They have the potential to further understanding of the disease, exacerbate the underlying pathology, or provide therapeutic benefit. Conclusions: By synthesizing the data from a systems' perspective, we aim to broaden how clinicians think about these illnesses and provide care.

AB  - Depression is a highly prevalent risk factor for both the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the mortality of CVD patients, and people suffering from CVD are more likely to develop depression than healthy individuals. The aim of this review is to summarize recent findings regarding the underlying relationship between CVD and depression. Literature search and review were conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, Wanfang Med Online, and Baidu Scholar databases. CVD and depression are intimately related and researchers from around the world have proposed and validated various mechanisms that may potentially explain the comorbidity of CVD and depression. Recent studies have suggested that depression and CVD may manifest as two distinct clinical conditions in two different organs, the brain and the heart, respectively, but may also be linked by shared mechanisms. Of these, inflammation involving the immune system is thought to be a common mechanism of depression and heart disease, with specific inflammatory cytokines or pathways being potential targets for the prevention and treatment of the concurrent diseases. Therefore, inflammation may play an important role in bridging the link between depression and CVD, a finding that can have important clinical implications for the prevention and early intervention of these conditions.

AB  - Oscillatory brain activities support many physiological functions from motor control to cognition. Disruptions of the normal oscillatory brain activities are commonly observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety/trauma-related disorders, major depressive disorders, and drug addiction. Therefore, these disorders can be considered as common oscillation defects despite having distinct behavioral manifestations and genetic causes. Recent technical advances of neuronal activity recording and analysis have allowed us to study the pathological oscillations of each disorder as a possible biomarker of symptoms. Furthermore, recent advances in brain stimulation technologies enable time- and space-targeted interventions of the pathological oscillations of both neurological disorders and psychiatric disorders as possible targets for regulating their symptoms.

AB  - Introduction: Smartphones have made promising contributions to the field of military mental health by providing novel app-based approaches to enhance training and deployment, data collection, and creating social domains for participants to share information and perform research. Methods: This article reviews four applications designed specifically for military members and Veterans that increase mental health literacy, overcome barriers to care, and enhance well-being and performance. Results: The Road to Mental Readiness (R2MR) app is an on-the-go training tool based on cognitive behavioural theory (CBT). Unit Victor connects Veterans in a secure chat environment and provides information on available supports. UrMMIND is a pre-deployment tool designed to reinforce healthy behaviours and teach coping techniques. iFeel passively collects and analyses individual smartphone data to detect early signs of depression. Discussion: Mobile apps are playing an ever-increasing role within health care and, when designed and integrated correctly, can yield many benefits. While security and privacy need to be carefully weighed and addressed, they hold the potential to empower the end user in a range of novel ways that were not possible before.

   Methods: A systematic search of eight databases (Web of Science, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Spring link, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM) was performed, to find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to January 2019. Using Cochrane Collaboration criteria, two reviewers critically and independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted correlated data using the designed form. All analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3.
   Results: In all, fifteen RCTs were included in the systematic review, fourteen of which, consisting of 3008 patients (MBSR, 1502; control, 1506), were included in the meta-analysis. MBSR had a significant effect on fatigue in cancer patients, particularly among lung cancer patients. The meta-analysis also indicated that MBSR could significantly mitigate CRF compared with usual care or no intervention. 8 weeks of MBSR, supervised by experts, had a large effect on CRF.
   Conclusions: MBSR is effective for CRF management and can be recommended as a beneficial complementary therapy for CRF patients.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in the general population and associated with high rates of impairment and disability. This burden highlights the need to identify risk factors that individuals can modify without professional intervention. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that examined modifiable risk and protective factors for anxiety disorders among adults in the general population. Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE using medical subject headings and text words related to risk factors, protective factors, and each anxiety disorder. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by three study authors. Modifiable risk and protective factors from 19 studies across seven countries were identified. Risk factors identified included cigarette smoking, alcohol use, cannabis use, negative appraisals of life events, avoidance, and occupational factors. Protective factors included social support, coping, and physical activity. Cigarette smoking was the most studied risk factor. Support was found for cigarette smoking as a risk factor for agoraphobia and panic disorder. Mixed results were found for generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Across disorders, smoking frequency was associated with greater risk. Results indicate an important gap in the literature in that few studies have examined modifiable risk factors for anxiety disorders.

AB  - More adults are undergoing autism assessment due to recent changes in awareness, diagnostic criteria and professional practices. This scoping review aimed to summarise research on autism diagnosis in adulthood and identify any gaps for future study. The authors searched for studies involving first-time assessment and diagnosis of autism in adults, which identified 82 studies from 13 countries using various methodologies. Six themes of (1) prevalence, (2) diagnostic pathways and processes, (3) gender, (4) psychosocial characteristics, (5) co-occurring conditions and (6) experiences of diagnosis were identified across the studies. Findings suggest that receiving an autism diagnosis has a significant emotional impact on adults, but accessibility and processes are inconsistent, and formal support services are lacking. More research is needed on autism diagnosis in adults with intellectual disability, consequences of the timing of diagnosis, and support after diagnosis.
   Lay abstract
   More adults are getting assessed for possible autism. Here, we give an overview on what is already known about autism diagnosis in adulthood and find areas that need more research. We divided results from the studies we found into six topics of (1) rates of autism in different groups; (2) the process of getting an autism diagnosis in adulthood; (3) gender; (4) personality traits, abilities and behaviours of diagnosed adults; (5) mental and physical health conditions that occur together with autism; and (6) how adults think and feel about being assessed and diagnosed. We found that adults often have strong emotions after being diagnosed, the process of getting a diagnosis can be unclear and different for everyone, and not many support services are available for adults. More research on diagnosing adults with intellectual disability, differences between early and late-diagnosed adults, and support after diagnosis would be useful.

AB  - Background
   Bipolar disorder is a disabling disease characterized by the recurrence of mood episodes. Successful strategies for the acute treatment of bipolar depression are still a matter of controversy. Total sleep deprivation (TSD) has shown acute antidepressant effect; however, the prompt relapse of depressive symptoms after sleep recovery has been reported. Taking this into consideration, we aimed to address a twofold research question: what are the acute effects of adding TSD to pharmacological treatment and what are the acute and chronic effects of adding medications to TSD.
   Methods
   MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for clinical trials assessing bipolar depression and TSD. Two independent reviewers selected and classified 90 abstracts. The outcomes we assessed were change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), sustained long-term response rate, treatment-emergent mania or hypomania, and tolerability (using dropout rates as a proxy). The compared groups were: TSD alone versus TSD plus medications and medications alone versus medications plus TSD. Data was analyzed using Stata 16.0.
   Results
   Patients treated with TSD plus medications compared with medications alone showed a significant decrease in depressive symptomatology after one week (SMD -0.584 [95% CI -1.126 to -0.042], p = 0.03. Also, a significant decrease in depressive symptomatology (SMD -0.894 [95% CI -1.388 to -0.399], p < 0.001) was found in the group with TSD plus medications compared with TSD alone, at the 10(th) day of treatment. We meta-analyzed the long-term effect of the TSD. It showed a sustained antidepressant effect (log OR = 2.365 (95% CI 0.95 to 3.779, p < 0.001) in the group where TSD was combined with medication when compared with patients treated only with TSD. Finally, no differences in tolerability (log OR = 0.234 (95% CI -1.164 to 1.632, p = 0.74) or affective switch were found.
   Conclusion
   Adding TSD to medications to bipolar depression treatment resulted in an augmentation in acute response. We also found that medications have a positive impact in acute response when added to TSD. Furthermore, this higher response rate was maintained after 3 months while keeping Lithium therapy.

AB  - Background: An increasing number of studies have investigated Social Networks Use Disorder (SNUD) among Western samples. In this context, the investigation of SNUD in Asia and especially in China has been much neglected. This poses a gap in the literature; it has been estimated that more than one billion Chinese people are using Chinese social networking sites (SNSs). Of note, many of these Chinese SNSs are rather unknown to researchers in Western countries.
   Aims: The primary objective of the present systematic review was to identify and evaluate studies that investigated Chinese SNS use and associations between SNUD and depression and anxiety symptoms.
   Method: A comprehensive search strategy identified relevant studies in PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, MEDLINE, ProQuest, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI).
   Results: The search strategy identified 35 potential studies, 13 studies were identified after shortlisting and full-text reviews of the studies, and finally 10 studies were included in the full review. Associations between SNUD, depression, and anxiety were reported in 10 studies. In eight (of the 10) studies, symptom severity of SNUD was associated with depression. Four studies reported associations between SNUD and anxiety. Most studies had utilized cross-sectional survey designs.
   Conclusions: Most associations were found between SNUD and depression symptoms, but effect sizes were higher between SNUD and anxiety symptoms. The results have the potential to inform prevention and interventions on SNUD in Eastern cultures, although we explicitly state that our work focuses on China, the transfer of the present observations to other Asian countries (and their cultures) still needs to be established.

AB  - Aim:
   To summarize, categorize, and describe published research on how birthing room design influences maternal and neonate physical and emotional outcomes.
   Background:
   The physical healthcare environment has significant effects on health and well-being. Research indicates that birthing environments can impact women during labor and birth. However, summaries of the effects of different environments around birth are scarce.
   Methods:
   We conducted a systematic review, searching 10 databases in 2016 and 2017 for published research from their inception dates, on how birthing room design influences maternal and neonate physical and emotional outcomes, using a protocol agreed a priori. The quality of selected studies was assessed, and data were extracted independently by pairs of authors and described in a narrative analysis.
   Results:
   In total, 3,373 records were identified and screened by title and abstract; 2,063 were excluded and the full text of 278 assessed for analysis. Another 241 were excluded, leaving 15 articles presenting qualitative and quantitative data from six different countries on four continents. The results of the analysis reveal four prominent physical themes in birthing rooms that positively influence on maternal and neonate physical and emotional outcomes: (1) means of distraction, comfort, and relaxation; (2) raising the birthing room temperature; (3) features of familiarity; and (4) diminishing a technocratic environment.
   Conclusions:
   The evidence on how birthing environments affect outcomes of labor and birth is incomplete. There is a crucial need for more research in this field.

AB  - Under-identification of mental health difficulties (MHD) in children and young people contributes to the significant unmet need for mental health care. School-based programmes have the potential to improve identification rates. This systematic review aimed to determine the feasibility of various models of school-based identification of MHD. We conducted systematic searches in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, British Education Index, and ASSIA using terms for mental health combined with terms for school-based identification. We included studies that assessed feasibility of school-based identification of students in formal education aged 3-18 with MHD, symptomatology of MHD, or exposed to risks for MHD. Feasibility was defined in terms of (1) intervention fit, (2) cost and resource implications, (3) intervention complexity, flexibility, manualisation, and time concerns, and (4) adverse events. Thirty-three studies met inclusion criteria. The majority focused on behavioural and socioemotional problems or suicide risk, examined universal screening models, and used cross-sectional designs. In general, school-based programmes for identifying MHD aligned with schools' priorities, but their appropriateness for students varied by condition. Time, resource, and cost concerns were the most common barriers to feasibility across models and conditions. The evidence base regarding feasibility is limited, and study heterogeneity prohibits definitive conclusions about the feasibility of different identification models. Education, health, and government agencies must determine how to allocate available resources to make the widespread adoption of school-based identification programmes more feasible. Furthermore, the definition and measurement of feasibility must be standardised to promote any future comparison between models and conditions.

AB  - There have been increases in adolescent depression and suicidal behaviour over the last two decades that coincide with the advent of social media (SM) (platforms that allow communication via digital media), which is widely used among adolescents. This scoping review examined the bi-directional association between the use of SM, specifically social networking sites (SNS), and depression and suicidality among adolescents. The studies reviewed yielded four main themes in SM use through thematic analysis: quantity of SM use, quality of SM use, social aspects associated with SM use, and disclosure of mental health symptoms. Research in this field would benefit from use of longitudinal designs, objective and timely measures of SM use, research on the mechanisms of the association between SM use and depression and suicidality, and research in clinical populations to inform clinical practice.

AB  - Objective: Maternal stress is associated with adverse child outcomes. Conception to 2-years postpartum (the first 1000 days) is a developmentally sensitive period for stress exposure. The role of maternal stress in the first 1000 days on child obesity risk is unclear. This review systematically examines the relationship between maternal stress across the first 1000 days and child obesity risk. Methods: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Maternity and Infant Care were searched from inception to June 2018. Eligible studies included women who experienced maternal stress in the first 1000 days; an included a measure of maternal stress and of child anthropometrics. Results: Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria, the majority of these examined prenatal stress exposure. Inconsistent effects were observed for psychological and physiological stress responses, on child weight outcomes. Environmental stress exposures, including natural disaster and bereavement, were more consistently associated with increased obesity risk. Conclusion: This review does not provide support for the effects of psychological or physiological maternal stress on child weight outcomes; there is some evidence of associations between environmental stress exposures and greater childhood adiposity. Variation in conceptualisation and measurement of stress, timing of stress exposure, and limited examination of stress-related behaviours were noted.

AB  - To review the available evidence about the prevalence and determinants of antenatal common mental disorders (antenatal CMDs) among women in India. We searched Ovid Medline, Embase and Psyinfo systematically from date of inception to Oct. 31, 2019 for publications in English language on the prevalence of antenatal CMDs and their determinants among women in India. All study designs were included. Quality was assessed with Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers. We performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model. Twenty-seven studies involving 7780 women were analysed. There was a high degree of heterogeneity ((I-2 = 97.53%). Publication bias [Egger bias = 0.65 (95% CI: 0.36; .94)] was evident. The overall pooled estimate of the prevalence of antenatal CMDs was 21.87% (95% CI: 17.46; 26.29). Significant risk factors reported in the 18 studies which examined them were negative reaction of husband or in-laws to the dowry, difficult relationship with husband/in-laws, lack of support or experiencing violence perpetrated by an intimate partner and preference for or feeling pressured to have a male child. Protective factors were having more education and being employed, having a supportive husband and opportunities for recreation during pregnancy. Antenatal CMDs are highly prevalent among women in India. There is an urgent need for locally developed policies and programmes for mental health promotion during pregnancy, preventive and early intervention for antenatal CMDs among women to be integrated into maternity care in India.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement neurodegenerative disorder. Although our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis in PD has greatly expanded, this knowledge thus far has failed to translate into disease-modifying therapies. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency to interrogate further the multifactorial etiology of PD. DNA repair defects cause many neurodegenerative diseases. An exciting new PD research avenue is the role that DNA damage and repair may play in neuronal death. The goal of this mini-review was to discuss the evidence for the types of DNA damage that accumulates in PD, which has provided clues for which DNA repair pathways, such as DNA double-strand break repair, are dysfunctional. We further highlight compelling data for activation of the DNA damage response in familial and idiopathic PD. The significance of DNA damage and repair is emerging in the PD field and linking these insights to PD pathogenesis may provide new insights into PD pathophysiology and consequently lead to new therapies.

AB  - Objective Anxiety disorders (AD) are known for its comorbidity and negative impact on the course of adult bipolar disorder (BD). However, there is limited research on AD comorbidity in pediatric BD (PBD). Here, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis and meta-regression study about the comorbidity and covariates of AD and PBD.
   Method We systematically searched relevant articles published until May 2019, as defined in PRISMA guidelines. Variables for associated features and prevalence of AD were extracted.
   Results Thirty-seven articles represented data for the analysis. Lifetime any AD comorbidity was 44.7%; panic disorder (PD) was 12.7%; generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was 27.4%; social phobia was 20.1%; separation anxiety disorder (SAD) was 26.1%; and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was 16.7%. Childhood-onset studies reported higher GAD and SAD comorbidity, while adolescent-onset studies reported higher PD, OCD, and social phobia. Age of onset, gender, comorbidity of ADHD, substance use, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder affected each anxiety disorders' comorbidity with PBD differently.
   Conclusion Anxiety disorders are highly comorbid with PBD. Early-onset PBD increases the risk of AD. Biopsychosocial aspects of this comorbidity and its course needs to be evaluated further.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances are a common symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD). Sleep is highly regulated by circadian rhythms, controlled by circadian genes, that act through a series of feedback loops to regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Objectives: To the best of our knowledge, a systematic review regarding the core circadian genes and their role in MDD has not been published recently. Also, a review of these genes and their role in sleep disturbances in depressed individuals appears to have never been done. We decided to integrate both concepts into one comprehensive review. Method: The review was done using the appropriate search terms in the following search engines: OVID Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Pubmed. Results: Based on the data reviewed, none of the circadian genes appear to be associated with MDD, but some are more promising than others. These genes are: CRY1, CRY2, PER2 and NPAS2. When investigating the role of circadian genes in sleep disturbances among individuals with MDD, the most promising candidate gene is TIMELESS. Although the results in this area are limited. Conclusion: Given the promising leads from this review, future studies should investigate circadian genes in sleep disturbances among the depressed population.

AB  - This systematic review examined whether early cognitive impairment after stroke is predictive of outcome within the "activity" and "participation" domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) at 6-12 months post-injury. Studies were included if cognitive functioning was assessed within 6 weeks of injury and outcome was measured at least 6 months post-injury. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were searched and 14 studies were identified. Studies were categorised according to whether "domain-general" or "domain-specific" cognitive assessment was undertaken and whether outcomes measured the ICF activities or participation domains, as determined by three independent raters using previous established linking rules. Quality of studies was assessed using a modified version of Downs and Black's Quality Index. Overall, early cognitive impairment predicted activities and participation 6-12 months post-stroke. This relationship was more consistent when domain-specific cognitive assessment was used. For the domain of activities, visuospatial perception/construction, visual memory, visual neglect, and attention/executive functioning predicted functioning 6-12 months post-stroke. Early domain-specific cognitive assessment may be clinically informative of longer term activities. For the domain of participation, further well-controlled studies are needed to determine the relationship with early post-stroke cognitive impairments.

AB  - Studies from several countries have reported occurrence of the highs (hypomanic symptoms) immediately after childbirth; however, questions remain about the relationship of the highs with mood disorders. This systematic review aims to clarify this relationship, critically review important aspects of the highs, and make treatment recommendations and suggestions for future research. The electronic databases of MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (EBMR) were searched using the keywords and their combinations: postpartum, euphoria, hypomania, and baby pinks. Reference lists of articles identified were also searched. Using the Highs scale, studies have found that 9.6-49.1% of postpartum women have hypomanic symptoms. Some but not all of the studies found an association of the highs with later depression. Symptoms of hypomania or mania are also common among women referred to specialized perinatal clinics for mood disorders. Depending on the instrument used, 12-30% of these women have symptoms of hypomania or mania after childbirth. The methodological limitations of current studies do not permit any definitive conclusions about the nosology of the highs. The discrepancy between the reported prevalence of the highs in non-clinical populations and the prevalence rates of bipolar disorder in the general population implies that the highs may be analogous to the baby blues in some women. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate whether the highs are limited to the postpartum period or whether there are some women who continue to have recurrences of the highs outside of the postpartum period.

AB  - Background
   Over the past decade, the use of commercial video games and serious games has developed in child and adolescent psychiatry. These games may become relevant alternatives or adjuncts to traditional psychotherapy, providing that their effectiveness is properly established. The purpose of this literature review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious games and commercial video games in the treatment or prevention of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.
   Methods
   Medline's database was used to search articles published between January 2012 and July 2019. The following keywords were used for this search: "Video games" OR "Active video game" OR "serious gaming" OR "Serious game" OR "Exergame" AND "Child mental disorder" OR "Adolescent" OR "Child" AND "Therapy" OR "Prevention". Only comparative studies which targeted interventions on children and adolescents suffering from psychiatric disorders were included.
   Results
   Twenty-two studies, focusing on a wide range of psychiatric conditions, met our inclusion criteria's: 14 evaluated serious games and 8 commercial games. All studies were randomized controlled trials but only two studies compared the intervention game to psychotherapeutic gold standard; other studies used a no-intervention control group or an alternative game as the control group. Eighteen studies reported significant improvements on the symptoms and test scores targeted.
   Conclusion
   Serious games and commercially available video games can be an effective trajectory for psychotherapy in child and adolescent psychiatry. However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies which assess the sustained effects of these games, and standards for proper evaluation of their effectiveness are missing.

AB  - The best-possible-self intervention has been shown to effectively increase positive affect and optimism. Differences in timing and conceptualization of outcome assessments, however, complicate interpretations regarding the practical significance of these effects. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic literature search and included 34 randomized controlled trials into several meta-analyses. We coded the exact time of measurement and how outcomes were assessed. Results reveal small overall effects on positive affect (Hedge's g = 0.28, 95% CI [0.16, 0.41]) and optimism (g = 0.21, 95% CI [0.04, 0.38]). Effects on positive affect were strongest among studies that assessed momentary affect immediately after the intervention, whereas effects on optimism were only significant if conceptualized as positive future expectations rather than a general orientation in life. Descriptive results indicate no substantial follow-up effects. Thus, the best-possible-self intervention might be thought of as a mood/expectation induction procedure. Further development may lead to sustained effects.

AB  - In classification and prediction of different types of medical disorders the neuro-fuzzy systems (NFS) are playing vital and significant role. To avoid false diagnosis the NFS assists medical practitioners to a greater extent in automating the domain dealing with medical disorders. With the passage of time the NFS approach has become apparent to enhance accuracy in dealing with a wide range of complicated research problems in the field of medical diagnosis. In this paper the author presents the literature review of the research done in implementing NFS in the field of medical diagnosis for current decade. Total of 100 publications in chronological advancement and up-gradation in models are considered for the time period of 10 years. A detailed study of each disease is carried out to discuss how NFS methodologies have been applied for classification and prediction in the diagnosis of different types of medical disorders. Ten (10) most severe medical disorders i.e. cancer, cardiovascular, depression and anxiety, diabetes, communicable, kidney, liver, neuro-degenerative, respiratory and thyroid has been undertaken for the study. Based on the study carried out it has been observed that NFS found to be effective as compared to the application of other AI techniques in medical diagnosis. Study reveals that effectiveness of NFS increases significantly when integrated with other AI approaches. This review adds into the knowledge of different researchers working in the field of medical diagnosis and will also give the comprehensive view of the effectiveness of the NFS techniques being used in medical diagnosis. The paper also incorporates a few research publications that were submitted in 2019 to incorporate the latest advances in medical science implementation of NFS.

AB  - Aims: Children and young adults are in general characterised by good health, but evidence shows increasing mental-health problems. Numerous interventions have been developed to target their mental health, but the effectiveness of these interventions remains varied. In this scoping review, we investigated factors associated with the effectiveness of interventions. Methods: A scoping review based on a three-block search strategy was performed to review the current literature of effective interventions. Each block (interventions, mental health and children and young adults) were operationalised to search terms. Systematic searches were conducted in three electronic databases and supplemented with citation searches, resulting in 51 studies in total. All studies were critically analysed, and a standardised extraction chart was used to systemise the data. Results: Our scoping review revealed a range of factors influencing the effectiveness of interventions. These factors were (a) characteristics of the target group (age, sex and level of baseline symptoms), (b) factors linked to implementation (use of manuals, training of implementers and context) and (c) characteristics of the interventions (universal versus indicated delivery, multiple-domain approaches, level of theory and adjustment to age and socio-economic status). Elements are discussed for each factor. Conclusions: Based on this review, it can be concluded that the use of stepwise, multi-domain approaches incorporating the social networks of the target group, adjusting activities to specific age groups and the social context, training implementers well and using stringent implementation manuals will improve the effectiveness of interventions targeting the mental health of children and young adults.

AB  - Background: Although people with severe mental illness (SMI) show high sedentary behaviour (SB) levels, there is little research on how SB patterns influence health and which type of intervention is the most critical for reducing this behaviour. The aims of this study are to examine associations between SB and physical and mental health in people with SMI; and the extent to which physical activity interventions may effectively reduce SB. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Experimental and observational studies were searched in Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, CINHAL and Scopus up to June 2018. Eighteen studies (n = 15 observational; n = 3 experimental) met the inclusion criteria. Results: Both subjective and objective measurements for SB (an average of 8.5 and 10 h day(-1), respectively) were positively associated with an increased cardiovascular and metabolic risk, worse global functioning, less quality of life, more severity of depressive symptoms, longer illness duration and higher doses of antipsychotic medication. Regarding intervention studies, active-lifestyle interventions (n = 2) reduced sedentary time (1.7-2.4 h day(-1)) while structured exercise (n = 1) reported no changes on SB. Conclusions: Levels of sedentariness in people with SMI are linked to an increased physical health risk, worse wellbeing and poorer mental health. Active-lifestyle interventions may be an indicated approach to reduce SB of people with SMI. However, a limited number of studies, their mixed quality and the heterogeneity of health outcomes made it difficult to provide robust conclusions on SB effects in people with SMI.

AB  - Longitudinal prospective cohorts have suggested that physical activity (PA) may be a protective factor against psychosis and schizophrenia. However, no meta-analysis has been conducted. The study aims to examine the prospective relationship between PA and incident psychosis/schizophrenia. Major databases were searched from inception to July 2019 for prospective studies that calculated the odds ratio (OR) or the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of incident psychosis/schizophrenia in people with higher PA against people with lower PA. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, for OR and AOR, separately. Across 4 cohorts (N = 30,025 median males = 50%, median follow-up = 32 years), people with high self-reported PA (versus low PA) were at reduced odds of developing psychosis/schizophrenia (OR = 0.73, 95%CI 0.532 to 0.995, p = 0.047). Analysis including 2 cohorts presenting AOR were not statistically significant (AOR = 0.59, 95%CI 0.253 to 1.383, p = 0.226). Overall study quality was high (mean NOS = 7.0). The literature on the topic is scarce, whilst crude analysis suggests that PA may be a protective factor against the emergence of psychosis/schizophrenia, but when adjusting for covariates, the association is no longer significant. Further studies with objective physical activity and adjustment for confounders are needed.

AB  - Background Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is thought to be a risk factor for postpartum depression (PPD), but results from studies examining the association have been mixed.
   Objectives: To estimate the association between pre-pregnancy history of PMS and development of PPD and evaluate the risk of bias of included evidence.
   Search strategy: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang Data, and reference lists of relevant papers were searched.
   Selection criteria: Observational studies that collected pre-pregnancy history of PMS and measured PPD status between one week and one year after delivery were included.
   Data collection and analysis: This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Random-effect models were used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Small study effect was analysed by funnel plot. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias Instrument for Non-Randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E).
   Main results: Our meta-analysis included 19 studies. Overall, women with a pre-pregnancy history of PMS had more than double the odds of PPD compared to those without PMS (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.81-2.68). However, the quality of evidence was low: five studies had moderate risk, eleven studies had serious risk, and three studies had critical risk of bias.
   Conclusions: Current evidence supports a significant association between history of PMS and development of PPD. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to further investigate this relationship.

AB  - We present a systematic review of literature examining leadership and the contagion of affective phenomena, namely emotion, mood, and affect. Specifically, an inductive thematic analysis approach was adopted to synthesize the findings from published studies. In addition, a mini meta-analysis was conducted to quantify reported effects. A rigorous search identified 25 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for further review. Results highlighted important relationships between leadership and contagion aligned with six themes: Charismatic and transformational leadership are conducive to contagion of leader and follower positive affective phenomena; greater contagion effects exists when there is congruence between leader and follower affective states; contagion of leader and follower affective phenomena is directly linked to leader effectiveness and performance; and, individual susceptibility to the contagion of affective phenomena can moderate these relationships. These findings have salient implications for conceptualization and measurement across multiple lines of inquiry and within numerous domains of application.

AB  - Objective: Cognitive impairment and depression are among the most prevalent and most disabling non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). The genetic factors that are associated with these symptoms remain uncertain. This systematic review aims to summarise the prevailing evidence from all genetic association studies investigating the genetic variants associated with cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms in people with PD. Method: A systematic review using five online databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and OpenGrey (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42017067431). We completed the quality assessment using the Q-Genie tool. Results: 2353 articles were screened, and 43 articles were found to be eligible to be included. A meta-analysis of studies investigating LRRK2 rs34637584 confirmed that the minor allele carriers had significantly less cognitive impairment (p = 0.015). Further meta-analyses showed that GBA variants rs76763715 (p < 0.001) and rs421016 (p = 0.001) were significantly associated with more cognitive impairment in people with PD. Minor alleles of GBA variants rs76763715, rs421016, rs387906315 and rs80356773 were associated with more depressive symptoms in PD. Moreover, APOE epsilon 4 allele has been associated with more cognitive impairment in PD. BDNF (rs6265) and CRY1 (rs2287161) variants have been associated with more depressive symptoms in people with PD. Conclusions: PD carriers of GBA variants are at high risk for cognitive decline and depression. Screening for these variants may facilitate early identification and effective management of these non-motor symptoms. The molecular mechanisms underlying favourable cognitive functioning in LRRK2 rs34637584 variant carriers warrant further investigation.

AB  - The relation between neurocognitive dysfunctions and disordered gambling has been firmly established in the last few decades. In this current opinions article, recent classification, translational, and longitudinal studies imply that combinations of cognitive (both neurocognitive and cognitive distortions) and emotional functioning (emotion regulation, stress), are related to more severe patterns of disordered gambling. The first longitudinal studies show that impulsivity is an important factor in treatment drop-out and relapse. These recent studies imply that therapeutic interventions in gambling disorder are needed, targeting cognitive, motivational, and affective factors. Recent developments in therapeutic methods, such as stress modulation, neuromodulation and neurocognitive training targeting these factors, are an emerging research field in addictive disorders, but are largely unexplored in gambling disorder.

AB  - There is a mortality gap of 15 to 20 years for people with severe mental illness (SMI - psychotic spectrum, bipolar, major depressive disorders). Modifiable risk factors include inactivity and low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Exercise can improve mental and physical outcomes; optimal type and intensity of exercise for people with SMI has yet to be determined. High Intensity Interval training (HIIT) is an exercise with distinct cardio-metabolic advantages in other disease populations compared to traditional moderate intensity continuous training (MCT). We investigated the feasibility and efficacy of HIIT for people with SMI. Major electronic databases were searched, identifying HIIT studies for adults experiencing SMI.Data on feasibility, safety, study design, sample characteristics, and physical and psychological outcomes were extracted and systematically reviewed. Meta-analyses were conducted within group, pre and post HIIT interventions, and between group, to compare HIIT with control conditions. Nine articles were identified including three pre/post studies, one non randomised and five randomised trials, (366 participants, 45.1% female). HIIT appears as feasible as MCT, with few safety concerns. Following HILT, there was a moderate improvement in CRF and depression. There was no difference between HIIT and MCT for adherence or CRF.HIIT improved depression more than MCT.

We conducted a systematic review of articles published between January 2000 and September 2018 (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019117163) using the following four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, CiNii, and ICHUSHI. The search formulas were created by combining search terms "agricultural experience," "garden," "diet," "food," "physical activity," "health," and "well-being." The articles were identified by titles, abstracts, and whole texts. We evaluated the content of the articles that met the adoption criteria. We included original articles from peer-reviewed scientific journals, articles written in Japanese or English, observational or interventional studies with statistical analyses, and articles targeting general Japanese people (except for those targeting patients or disabled) to examine the relationship according to the purpose of this review. Nineteen articles met the study criteria, including 10 cross-sectional studies, one retrospective study, seven pre-post studies, and three non-randomized controlled trials. Two studies combined multiple research designs. Thus, food production experiences were suggested to have a positive influence on dietary knowledge, dietary awareness, food preference, dietary behaviors, and mental health among the Japanese. However, the overall quality of the included studies was low. Further verification with randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies is required.

AB  - Establishing the diagnosis of trauma-related disorders such as Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) have always been a challenge in clinical practice and in academic research, due to clinical and biological heterogeneity. Machine learning (ML) techniques can be applied to improve classification of disorders, to predict outcomes or to determine person-specific treatment selection. We aim to review the existing literature on the use of machine learning techniques in the assessment of subjects with ASD or PTSD. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for articles published in any language up to May 2019. We found 806 abstracts and included 49 studies in our review. Most of the included studies used multiple levels of biological data to predict risk factors or to identify early symptoms related to PTSD. Other studies used ML classification techniques to distinguish individuals with ASD or PTSD from other psychiatric disorder or from trauma-exposed and healthy controls. We also found studies that attempted to define outcome profiles using clustering techniques and studies that assessed the relationship among symptoms using network analysis. Finally, we proposed a quality assessment in this review, evaluating methodological and technical features on machine learning studies. We concluded that etiologic and clinical heterogeneity of ASD/PTSD patients is suitable to machine learning techniques and a major challenge for the future is to use it in clinical practice for the benefit of patients in an individual level.

AB  - Ionizing radiation resistance occurs among many phylogenetic groups and its mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Tolerances to acute and chronic irradiation do not always correlate because different mechanisms may be involved. The radioresistance phenomenon becomes even more complex in the field than in the laboratory because the effects of radioactive contamination on natural populations are intertwined with those of other factors, such as bioaccumulation of radionuclides, interspecific competition, seasonal variations in environmental conditions, and land use changes due to evacuation of humans from contaminated areas. Previous reviews of studies performed in radioactive sites like the Kyshtym, Chernobyl, and Fukushima accident regions, and of protracted irradiation experiments, often focused on detecting radiation effects at low doses in radiosensitive organisms. Here we review the literature with a different purpose: to identify organisms with high tolerance to chronic irradiation under environmental conditions, which maintained abundant populations and/or outcompeted more radiosensitive species at high dose rates. Taxa for which consistent evidence for radioresistance came from multiple studies conducted in different locations and at different times were found among plants (e.g. willow and birch trees, sedges), invertebrate and vertebrate animals (e.g. rotifers, some insects, crustaceans and freshwater fish). These organisms are not specialized "extremophiles", but tend to tolerate broad ranges of environmental conditions and stresses, have small genomes, reproduce quickly and/or disperse effectively over long distances. Based on these findings, resistance to radioactive contamination can be examined in a more broad context of chronic stress responses.

   Parents make important treatment decisions for their children based on symptoms they perceive their child to be experiencing. Multiple psychological factors are associated with subjective symptom perception, but factors affecting perception of symptoms in others have been explored less. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify parent and child psychological factors associated with parental report of physical symptoms in their child.
   Methods
   We searched Embase, Ovid, PsycINFO, and Scopus for studies that investigated associations between psychological factors and parental report of symptoms in their child.
   Results
   Thirty-six citations reporting on 34 studies that assessed the association between parent or child psychological factors and parental report of physical symptoms in the child were included in the review. Three main factors were identified as being associated with parental symptom report. First, there was evidence for an association between parental symptom report and affect, in particular parent and child anxiety. Second, child behavioral and conduct problems, and temperament-related challenges (problems with feeding and sleeping) were associated with parental symptom report. Third, parental expectations and beliefs that symptoms would occur were associated with parental symptom report, although few studies investigated these associations.
   Conclusions
   Parent and child affect, and parental expectations and beliefs may influence parents' cognition, causing them to pay more attention to their child, interpret their child's behavior as symptomatic, and recall symptoms in the child. Given the importance of parental perception of symptoms in driving decisions around care, additional research in this field is needed.

AB  - Purpose Neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs reduce psychotic symptoms, but how they achieve these effects and how the drugs' effects are experienced by people who take them are less well understood. The present study describes a synthesis of qualitative data about mental and behavioural alterations associated with taking neuroleptics and how these interact with symptoms of psychosis and people's sense of self and agency. Methods Nine databases were searched to identify qualitative literature concerning experiences of taking neuroleptic medication. A thematic synthesis was conducted. Results Neuroleptics were commonly experienced as producing a distinctive state of lethargy, cognitive slowing, emotional blunting and reduced motivation, which impaired functioning but also had beneficial effects on symptoms of psychosis and some other symptoms (e.g. insomnia). For some people, symptom reduction helped restore a sense of normality and autonomy, but others experienced a loss of important aspects of their personality. Across studies, many people adopted a passive stance towards long-term medication, expressing a sense of resignation, endurance or loss of autonomy. Conclusions Neuroleptic drugs modify cognition, emotions and motivation. These effects may be associated with reducing the intensity and impact of symptoms, but also affect people's sense of self and agency. Understanding how the effects of neuroleptics are experienced by those who take them is important in developing a more collaborative approach to drug treatment in psychosis and schizophrenia.

AB  - Anxiety and depression symptoms are frequently experienced by individuals with psychosis, although prevalence rates have not been reviewed in first-episode psychosis (FEP). The aim of this systematic review was to focus on the prevalence rates for both anxiety and depression, comparing the rates within the same study population. A systematic review and meta-analysis was completed for all studies measuring both anxiety and depression in FEP at baseline. The search identified 6040 citations, of which n = 10 met inclusion criteria. These reported 1265 patients (age 28.3 +/- 9.1, females: 39.9%) with diagnosed FEP. Studies which used diagnosis to define comorbidity count were included in separate meta-analyses for anxiety and depression, although the heterogeneity was high limiting interpretation of separate prevalence rates. A random-effects meta-analysis also compared the mean difference between anxiety and depression within the same studies. We show that anxiety and depression co-occur at a similar rate within FEP, although the exact rates are not reliable due to the heterogeneity between the small number of studies. Future research in FEP should consider routinely measuring anxiety and depression using continuous self-report measures of symptoms. Clinically we recommend that both anxiety and depression are equally targeted during psychological intervention in FEP, together with the psychotic symptoms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The EBSCO PsycARTICLES, EMBASE, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched, and 14 studies were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis. We calculated odds risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using random-effect or fixed-effect models. Heterogeneity was assessed using I-2 and chit statistics. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on country, adjusted variables, the methods of statistical analysis, outcome measures and publication year. We found significantly increased risks of poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety in people with PSU. Our findings highlight the necessity of managing the PSU. However, further studies are required to confirm the results due to the high heterogeneity and methodological limitations.

AB  - Calcium (Ca2+) is a ubiquitous mediator of a multitude of cellular functions in the central nervous system (CNS). Intracellular Ca2+ is tightly regulated by cells, including entry via plasma membrane Ca2+ permeable channels. Of specific interest for this review are L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCCs), due to their pleiotropic role in several CNS disorders. Currently, there are numerous approved drugs that target L-VDCCs, including dihydropyridines. These drugs are safe and effective for the treatment of humans with cardiovascular disease and may also confer neuroprotection. Here, we review the potential of L-VDCCs as a target for the treatment of CNS disorders with a focus on microglia L-VDCCs. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, have attracted recent attention for their emerging inflammatory role in several CNS diseases. Intracellular Ca2+ regulates microglia transition from a resting quiescent state to an "activated" immune-effector state and is thus a valuable target for manipulation of microglia phenotype. We will review the literature on L-VDCC expression and function in the CNS and on microglia in vitro and in vivo and explore the therapeutic landscape of L-VDCC-targeting agents at present and future challenges in the context of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, neuropsychiatric diseases, and other CNS disorders.

AB  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was studied from the 1950s to the 1970s to evaluate behavioral and personality changes, as well as remission of psychiatric symptoms in various disorders. LSD was used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, psychosomatic diseases and addiction. However, most of the studies were not performed under contemporary standards, and it has taken several decades for a resurgence of interest in LSD research and its therapeutic potential for psychiatry. The aim of this review is to identify controlled and randomized clinical trials that assess the potential use of LSD in psychiatry. PRISMA guidelines for systematic review were followed. A literature search of PubMed and Psychedelic bibliography from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) databases was performed as well as a manual search of references from evaluated studies. Only randomized-controlled clinical trials were included. Study quality was systematically calculated by using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for assessing risk of bias. A final selection of 11 articles was made after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. LSD was administered to 567 patients in a dose ranging from 20 to 800 mcg. Despite the design heterogeneity of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in the future.

AB  - Background: Pharmacological treatment is of great importance in forensic psychiatry, and the vast majority of patients are treated with antipsychotic agents. There are several systematic differences between general and forensic psychiatric patients, e.g. severe violent behavior, the amount of comorbidity, such as personality disorders and/or substance abuse. Based on that, it is reasonable to suspect that effects of pharmacological treatments also may differ. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of pharmacological interventions for patients within forensic psychiatry. Methods: The systematic review protocol was pre-registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017075308). Six databases were used for literature search on January 11, 2018. Controlled trials from forensic psychiatric care reporting on the effects of antipsychotic agents, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, as well as pharmacological agents used for the treatment of addiction or ADHD, were included. Two authors independently reviewed the studies, evaluated risk of bias and assessed certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: The literature search resulted in 1783 records (titles and abstracts) out of which 10 studies were included. Most of the studies included were retrospective and non-randomized. Five of them focused on treatment with clozapine and the remaining five on other antipsychotics or mood stabilizers. Five studies with a high risk of bias indicated positive effects of clozapine on time from treatment start to discharge, crime-free time, time from discharge to readmission, improved clinical functioning, and reduction in aggressive behavior. Psychotic symptoms after treatment were more pronounced in the clozapine group. Mainly due to the high risk of bias the reliability of the evidence for all outcomes was assessed as very low. Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the shortage of knowledge on the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment within forensic psychiatry. Due to very few studies being available in this setting, as well as limitations in their execution and reporting, it is challenging to overview the outcomes of pharmacological interventions in this context. The frequent use of antipsychotics, sometimes in combination with other pharmacological agents, in this complex and heterogeneous patient group, calls for high-quality studies performed in this specific setting.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is highly prevalent worldwide with no modifying therapy. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in most patients with AD, and depression is one of the most common AD-related BPSD. Kaixinsan (KXS) is an ancient Chinese herbal prescription widely used to treat dementia and forgetfulness. In this systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess preclinical evidence for the effects of KXS on cognitive impairment and depression. Thirty-eight articles involving 1,050 animals were included after searching from six databases from the inception up to June 2019. The primary outcome measures were behavioral outcome. Indicators of cognitive function in AD included escape latency, time spent on the target quadrant, and the number of target platform crossings in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Indicators of depression included number of rearing events and total distance in the open-field test, duration of immobility in the forced swim test, and sucrose consumption or sucrose preference index in the sucrose preference test. The secondary outcomes were mechanisms of KXS for treatment of AD and depression. The results showed that KXS significantly reduced escape latency (P < 0.01), increased time spent in the target quadrant (P < 0.01), and increased the number of target platform crossings (P < 0.01) in the MWM test in AD models compared with control. The possible mechanisms for KXS-mediated improvements in cognitive function were antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity, antiapoptotic activity, neuroprotection, and synapse protection. In addition, the results demonstrated that KXS significantly increased the number of rearing instances (P < 0.01) in the open-field test, decreased the duration of immobility (P < 0.01) in forced swim test, and increased sucrose consumption or sucrose preference index (P < 0.01) in the sucrose preference test in depression models compared with control. The mechanisms of KXS-mediated anti-depressive effects were HPA axis regulation, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity, synapse protection, and neuroprotection. The results of this study suggested that KXS can be used to effectively treat AD and depression through multiple mechanisms, extrapolating the therapeutic potential of KXS for treating AD-related BPSD.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in the use of smartphone applications (apps) and other consumer technology in mental health care for a number of years. However, the vision of data from apps seamlessly returned to, and integrated in, the electronic medical record (EMR) to assist both psychiatrists and patients has not been widely achieved, due in part to complex issues involved in the use of smartphone and other consumer technology in psychiatry. These issues include consumer technology usage, clinical utility, commercialization, and evolving consumer technology. Technological, legal and commercial issues, as well as medical issues, will determine the role of consumer technology in psychiatry. Recommendations for a more productive direction for the use of consumer technology in psychiatry are provided.

AB  - Background: The concept of resilience offers a strengths-based framework for interventions to enhance Indigenous adolescent social and emotional well-being. Resilience interventions in or with schools encompass individual, social, and environmental factors that encourage health-promoting behaviors and assist adolescents in navigating toward resources that can sustain their health and well-being in times of adversity. This scoping review examined the literature on resilience-enhancing interventions for Indigenous adolescent students in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (CANZUS nations). Intervention strategies, adherence to theoretical constructs, and outcomes were analyzed. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of intervention studies aimed at improving Indigenous adolescent resilience and published in CANZUS nations between January 1990 and May 2016. Eleven peer-reviewed databases and 11 websites and clearing houses were searched for relevant studies. Following double-blinded screening, a total of 16 intervention papers were included for analysis. Study characteristics were identified and study quality was assessed using appropriate assessment tools. Results: Twelve interventions (75%) were delivered in school settings and four (25%) were community-based, conducted in partnership with schools. Seven publications (44%) reported interventions focused exclusively on fostering individual resilience. Another seven (44%) included components that aimed to build staff, school, and/or community capacity to support adolescent resilience, and two (12.5%) had community/school capacity-building as the primary focus. Culturally based approaches to enhancing resilience were evident in most studies (81%). The publications documented the use of a range of program models, processes, and activities aligned with resilience theory. Positive outcomes were reported for improved individual assets (e.g., strengthened self-esteem and Indigenous identity), environmental resources (e.g., increased peer support and social/community connection), and increased community capacity (e.g., increased youth training and leadership opportunities). On average, study quality was assessed as moderate to high. The strongest evidence of intervention effectiveness was for improvements in mental health symptoms and outcomes. Conclusion: Interventions indicated strong alignment with ecological and culturally based resilience theories and models. While the results of the studies indicate some positive impacts on the resilience of Indigenous adolescents, future evaluations should aim to ensure high study quality and focus on measuring strengths-based resilience outcomes.

AB  - In a short time, oxytocin has progressed from being a regular hormone involved in parturition and breastfeeding to be possibly the neuromodulator that has gathered the most attention. Attributed many positive roles in the modulation of different aspects of social behavior, such as bonding, empathy, cooperation, trust, and generosity, as well as roles as a natural anxiolytic and antidepressant, the expectations on oxytocin becoming a treatment for a number of disorders with associated social deficits have dramatically raised over the last years. However, despite the field has been investigating oxytocin's role in social behavior for over twenty years, there are still many unknowns on oxytocin's mechanisms of action and efficiency and the increasing number of clinical trials administering oxytocin to different clinical groups seem to disagree in its properties and report in most cases conflicting results. This has led to some disappointment among researchers and clinicians as oxytocin might not be the miraculous molecule that works in a "one size fits all" fashion initially considered. Conversely, this down-side of oxytocin might merely reflect the complexity of its neurotransmission system. The current reality is that, although oxytocin seems to have potential therapeutic value, there are key questions that remain unanswered as to decide the optimal target groups and treatment course. Here, we present an overview on critical points regarding the oxytocin system in health and disease that need to be better understood to establish its therapeutic properties and to decide who could benefit the most from its treatment.

KW  - CONTEXT
KW  - STRESS
AB  - Purpose Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals experience higher rates of mental health difficulties in comparison to their heterosexual counterparts (Meyer, 2003; Ploderl and Tremblay, 2015). This is in part due to the experience of homophobia and stigmatisation within society. This discrimination has also been perpetuated within the mental health field, where LGB individual's sexuality has been pathologised. In response to this historical stigmatisation a number of policies have been created to develop ethical practice while working with this minority group (APA, 2012; BPS, 2019; HSE, 2009; PSI, 2015). The purpose of this paper is to capture the experience of LGB individuals within mental health services and examine if these guidelines are being adhered to. Design/methodology/approach This study is a meta-narrative synthesis of 13 empirical papers, published between 1999 and 2019. Findings This study has found both negative and positive experiences of service users. The paper discusses major themes, implications for practice and directions for future research. Originality/value This is the first systematic review to look at the experiences of clients who have attended mental health services.

AB  - The current systematic literature review aimed to analyse the associations between temporary agency work (TAW), job satisfaction, and mental health in Europe, as well as to outline a future research agenda. Twenty-eight scientific articles were identified by searching different data bases (i.e. PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science) for the time span from January 2000 to December 2016. Our review reveals first that TAW is not consistently negatively related to job satisfaction. However, job insecurity and working conditions are important mediators in the relation of TAW and lowered job satisfaction. Second, TAW is not consistently related to all investigated types of mental health impairments. However, when focusing on specific outcomes and comparing temporary agency workers to permanent employees, we still find consistent evidence regarding higher levels of depression and fatigue among temporary agency workers. Inconsistent associations between TAW, job satisfaction and mental health can partly be attributed to unfavourable methodological aspects of the included primary studies. To address these aspects, future research should consider applying a standard measurement of TAW, including a minimum of meaningful confounding variables, improving the operationalisation of outcome variables and the study design.

AB  - The prevalence of burnout in midwives has been briefly studied. Given the negative effects of burnout syndrome in the physical and mental health, and also related to the quality of care provided, rates of absenteeism and sick leave; identifying related factors for the syndrome are needed. The aim was to determine the prevalence, levels, and factors related to the burnout syndrome, measured with the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory in midwives. A systematic review and meta-analysis were selected from CINAHL, LILACS, ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, SciELO, and Scopus databases, with the search equation "burnout AND (midwife OR midwives OR nurses midwives)". Fourteen articles were found with a total of 8959 midwives. Most of the studies showed moderate levels of personal burnout. The prevalence obtained was 50% (95% CI = 38-63) for personal burnout; 40% (95% CI = 32-49) for work-related burnout; and 10% (95% CI = 7-13) for client-related burnout. Midwives' age, less experience, and living alone constitute the main related factors, as well as, the scarcity of resources, work environment, and the care model used. Most midwives present personal and work-related burnout, which indicates a high risk of developing burnout. Personal factors and working conditions should be taken into account when assessing burnout risk profiles of midwives.

AB  - Due to the high accessibility and mobility of smartphones, widespread and pervasive smartphone use has become the social norm, exposing users to various health and other risk factors. There is, however, a debate on whether addiction to smartphone use is a valid behavioral addiction that is distinct from similar conditions, such as Internet and gaming addiction. The goal of this review is to gather and integrate up-to-date research on measures of smartphone addiction (SA) and problematic smartphone use (PSU) to better understand (a) if they are distinct from other addictions that merely use the smartphone as a medium, and (b) how the disorder(s) may fall on a continuum of addictive behaviors that at some point could be considered an addiction. A systematic literature search adapted from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method was conducted to find all relevant articles on SA and PSU published between 2017 and 2019. A total of 108 articles were included in the current review. Most studies neither distinguished SA from other technological addictions nor clarified whether SA was an addiction to the actual smartphone device or to the features that the device offers. Most studies also did not directly base their research on a theory to explain the etiologic origins or causal pathways of SA and its associations. Suggestions are made regarding how to address SA as an emerging behavioral addiction.

AB  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major public health issue in Malaysia and worldwide. Depression is highly associated with ESRD and with the increasing number of ESRD, the rate of depression will also grow. There are limited data on clinical trials of antidepressant medication on ESRD due to safety reasons. Due to that, psychological intervention is a preferred treatment for this population. Previously, studies on the effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) have been focused more on patients with depression with no comorbid chronic medical illness. Therefore, the present article is set out to analyse the existing literature on the effectiveness of CBT on depression among ESRD undergoing haemodialysis treatment. Guided by the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review method, a systematic review on Scopus database has identified 10 studies. Further review of these articles resulted in two main themes-single-group trial and two-groups trial. The two-groups trial is further producing another two sub-themes. The discussion is mainly on the lack of randomized trial in the depression treatment among haemodialysis patients in Malaysia. Several recommendations are being highlighted, where are to compare CBT treatment group with another active therapy and to use more than one database for the research searching tools.

The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine initial and relapse prodromes identifying adult patients with BD.Methods.PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched using a predetermined strategy. A controlled process of study selection and data extraction was performed.Results.The 22 articles selected included 1,809 adult patients with BD. Initial prodromes cited most frequently in these studies showed low specificity. Among relapse prodromes cited most frequently, more talkative than usual, increased energy/more goal-directed behavior, thoughts start to race, increased self-esteem, strong interest in sex, increase in activity, and spending too much were identified exclusively before a manic/hypomanic episode, while loss of interest and hypersomnia were detected only before a depressive episode. Initial prodromal phases lasted longer than prodromal relapse phases. In the selected studies, the most used prodrome identification procedure was the clinical interview.Conclusions.For adult patients with BD, initial and relapse prodromes of manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes were identified. It is proposed that the most frequent prodromes found in this review be incorporated into a smartphone app that monitors the functioning of people at risk of BD and patients who have already been diagnosed. Data from this app would constitute a relevant source of big data.

AB  - This study investigated whether antenatal exposure to antidepressants (ADs) increases the risks of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, and cognitive and developmental deficits in infants or preschool children. PubMed, EMBASE, BIREME/BVS databases were searched to identify studies examining associations of ADs in pregnancy with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Twenty studies addressed ASD and/or ADHD risks while 30 focused on developmental and cognitive deficits in infants or preschool children. Most studies detected no association of antenatal AD with ASD after adjustment of risk ratios for maternal depression or psychiatric disorders. Some studies showed that maternal depression, regardless of whether it is treated or untreated, increased ASD risks. Seven out of 8 studies found no increase in ADHD risk associated with antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the most commonly used AD. No consistent evidence was found linking AD in pregnancy to neurocognitive developmental deficits in infants or preschool children. A residual confounding by indication (depression severity) remained in almost all studies. This systematic review found no consistent evidence suggesting that ADs in pregnancy increase risks of ASD, ADHD, and neurocognitive development deficits. Some studies, however, found evidence that maternal depression increases ASD risks.

AB  - Introduction: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) represent a cluster of severe mental illnesses. Diet has been identified as a modifiable risk factor and opportunity for intervention in many physical illnesses and more recently in mental illnesses such as unipolar depression; however, no dietary guidelines exist for patients with SSD. Objective: This review sought to systematically scope the existing literature in order to identify nutritional interventions for the prevention or treatment of mental health symptoms in SSD as well as gaps and opportunities for further research. Methods: This review followed established methodological approaches for scoping reviews including an extensive a priori search strategy and duplicate screening. Because of the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) was used for screening and tagging. Data were extracted based on the dietary constituents and analyzed. Results: Of 55,330 results identified by the search, 822 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Observational evidence shows a connection between the presence of psychotic disorders and poorer quality dietary patterns, higher intake of refined carbohydrates and total fat, and lower intake or levels of fibre, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, vegetables, fruit, and certain vitamins and minerals (vitamin B-12 and B-6, folate, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium). Evidence illustrates a role of food allergy and sensitivity as well as microbiome composition and specific phytonutrients (such as L-theanine, sulforaphane, and resveratrol). Experimental studies have demonstrated benefit using healthy diet patterns and specific vitamins and minerals (vitamin B-12 and B-6, folate, and zinc) and amino acids (serine, lysine, glycine, and tryptophan). Discussion: Overall, these findings were consistent with many other bodies of knowledge about healthy dietary patterns. Many limitations exist related to the design of the individual studies and the ability to extrapolate the results of studies using dietary supplements to dietary interventions (food). Dietary recommendations are presented as well as recommendations for further research including more prospective observational studies and intervention studies that modify diet constituents or entire dietary patterns with statistical power to detect mental health outcomes.

AB  - Objective Positive mood has been associated with enhanced immune function. Interventions that improve mood could therefore provide a mechanism for optimizing immune-related health outcomes. Brief interventions that improve mood, also known as mood inductions, potentially offer a pragmatic approach to enhancing immune function for finite periods where this would be beneficial to health (e.g., in advance of vaccination or surgery). This review sought to systematically examine the evidence regarding the effects of brief, single-session positive mood interventions on immunity. Methods Systematic searches of electronic databases were performed from earliest records to July 25, 2018. We identified 42 interventions suitable for inclusion, 6 of which were tested in multiple subpopulations. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for pre-post experimental group immune outcomes measured in at least five intervention studies. Results Although interventions were heterogeneous, 81% resulted in a statistically significant change in at least one immune parameter after the positive mood intervention for one or more of the subpopulations examined. However, studies were, in general, of low-to-moderate quality with small sample sizes (median n = 32) and did not examine the persistence or clinical relevance of the immune changes observed. Random-effects meta-analyses showed a significant medium-sized effect of interventions on increasing secretory IgA concentration (g = 0.65), a small but statistically significant effect for increased Interleukin-6 production (g = 0.12), and nonsignificant effects on natural killer cell activity (g = 0.15). Conclusions The current literature suggests that improvements in mood resulting from brief interventions can influence some immune parameters in ways indicative of enhanced immune function. However, there is a need for higher-quality research in this area that focuses on clinically relevant immune outcomes and mechanisms.

The selection criteria required that articles be randomized controlled trials involving outpatient adults diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia; that they involve telemedicine interventions; and that they include an outcome of medication adherence. Initially, 1 author identified relevant titles. Two authors independently reviewed the abstracts and titles.
   Results: Of 512 articles identified through database searching, we identified 17 articles that we categorized by intensity of intervention and rated by quality of evidence. There were 3 low-, 3 medium- and 11 high-intensity interventions. The most common type of technology used was the phone. Efficacy for adherence was demonstrated by 9 studies.
   Conclusions: Telemedicine may improve medication adherence in patients with depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Future studies are needed to better understand how technology can be tailored to different types of nonadherence.

KW  - PROFESSIONALS
AB  - Introduction: Burnout is considered to be a job related problem that is associated with complications including decreased job performance, and physical and psychological disorders. Burnout dimensions include the emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA). Due to the importance of burnout and its negative impacts on individual and organization, the present study would evaluate the prevalence of burnout in Iran using systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Materials and Methods: The present study has been done based on PRISMA protocol for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The information was obtained from searching standard Persian and English keywords in accessible databases including: Scopus, Magiran, SID, Science Direct, Google scholar and PubMed from database commencement to April 2017. The metaregression was performed to evaluate the relationship between the year of the study and burnout. Data Analysis was performed using Stata software version 11.1., and p value was considered less than 0.05.
   Results: In the systematic review 43 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 9456 people were evaluated. The prevalence of burnout was calculated in any of the three dimensions of burnout. The prevalence of the Emotional Exhaustion (EE) dimension of burnout was%36 (%95CI: 29-42), the Depersonalization (DP) dimension was%23 (%95CI: 18-29) and the Personal Accomplishment (PA) dimension was%46 (%95CI: 39-53). Based on the type of the job, the maximum prevalence of the EE, DP and PA dimensions was in librarians 67% (%95CI:40-93), university staff 51% (14-88) and dentists 72%(%95CI:65-79), respectively. Meta regression results showed that there was no significant relationship between the year of publication and the prevalence of burnout.
   Conclusion: According to the prevalence of burnout in Iran and the high prevalence of the PA dimension, it is recommended to consider mediating strategies for reducing and controlling stressful occupational events and burnout in organizational schedule.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the cognitive functions and processes through, also related to deficits, on the Rorschach test. The Rorschach is a projective method can be a valid predictor tool to identify neuropsychological levels, also many cognitive deficits. According to literature, the Rorschach test is most important in clinical practice, to improve the knowledge of patient's personality, but also neuropsychological aspects, for assessing on perceptual and visuospatial abilities, verbal output skills, memory impairment, emotional control and impulses. In addition, the literature suggested the utility of the projective methods, in the study of brain lesions. In conclusion, the Rorschach task proves to be a valuable instrument including in clinical setting and assessment field of cognitive psychopathology. The method, usually considered in personality disease and mental health setting, improves understanding of the subject's cognitive level and can be used on psychological diagnosis and assessment in neuropsychological field.

AB  - Background: Aquatic therapy offers an alternative physiotherapy approach to managing the motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (PD).
   Objective: This review examined exercise prescription for aquatic therapy in PD and evaluated if aquatic therapy is as effective as land-based physiotherapy for improving movement, disability and wellbeing in people living with PD.
   Methods: A systematic search of eight databases was conducted to identify suitable randomized controlled trials from inception until August 2019. Aquatic therapy prescription data and outcomes of interest included gait, balance, motor disability, mobility, falls, mood, cognitive function and health related quality of life data was extracted and synthesised. A meta-analysis was performed where appropriate.
   Results: Fourteen studies involving 472 participants (Hoehn & Yahr scale I-IV) met the inclusion criteria. Eight were of modest quality, scoring 70-80% on the PEDro scale. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Exercise prescription was highly variable and often insufficiently dosed Similar gains were shown for aquatic therapy and land exercises for balance, motor disability or quality of life. A statistically significant difference was found for mobility as measured using the TUG (-1.5 s, 95 % CI -2.68 to -0.32; p = 0.01, I-2 = 13%), in favor of aquatic therapy.
   Conclusion: Aquatic therapy had positive outcomes for gait, balance and mobility that were comparable to land-based physiotherapy in the early stages of PD. The optimal dosage, content and duration of aquatic interventions for PD could not be confirmed in this meta-analysis. Many trials appeared to be under-dosed and therapy duration was low, ranging from 3-11 weeks.

AB  - Aims To identify and categorise core components of effective stigma reduction interventions in the field of mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and compare these components across cultural contexts and between intervention characteristics. Methods Seven databases were searched with a strategy including four categories of terms ('stigma', 'mental health', 'intervention' and 'low- and middle-income countries'). Additional methods included citation chaining of all papers identified for inclusion, consultation with experts and hand searching reference lists from other related reviews. Studies on interventions in LMICs aiming to reduce stigma related to mental health with a stigma-related outcome measure were included. All relevant intervention characteristics and components were extracted and a quality assessment was undertaken. A 'best fit' framework synthesis was used to organise data, followed by a narrative synthesis. Results Fifty-six studies were included in this review, of which four were ineffective and analysed separately. A framework was developed which presents a new categorisation of stigma intervention components based on the included studies. Most interventions utilised multiple methods and of the 52 effective studies educational methods were used most frequently (n= 83), and both social contact (n= 8) and therapeutic methods (n= 3) were used infrequently. Most interventions (n= 42) based their intervention on medical knowledge, but a variety of other themes were addressed. All regions with LMICs were represented, but every region was dominated by studies from one country. Components varied between regions for most categories indicating variation between cultures, but only a minority of studies were developed in the local setting or culturally adapted. Conclusions Our study suggests effective mental health stigma reduction interventions in LMICs have increased in quantity and quality over the past five years, and a wide variety of components have been utilised successfully - from creative methods to emphasis on recovery and strength of people with mental illness. Yet there is minimal mention of social contact, despite existing strong evidence for it. There is also a lack of robust research designs, a high number of short-term interventions and follow-up, nominal use of local expertise and the research is limited to a small number of LMICs. More research is needed to address these issues. Some congruity exists in components between cultures, but generally they vary widely. The review gives an in-depth overview of mental health stigma reduction core components, providing researchers in varied resource-poor settings additional knowledge to help with planning mental health stigma reduction interventions.

AB  - Objectives: The Nursing Interventions Classification is used for planning nursing care. Animal-assisted practices, an intervention within this classification, is a treatment method that is widely used around the world. However, its use is limited in Turkey. Animal-assisted practices, which are used to support various groups today, constitute an intervention option in addition to medical treatments, ensuring health protection and promotion. This systematic review aims to analyze the randomized controlled studies that used animal-assisted practices and to determine the effects of this procedure and the interventions made, thereby contributing to the literature.
   Methods: The databases on this subject were analyzed without any limitations on the publication year, and a total of 1,985 studies were accessed. The search was made using the keywords "animal assisted therapy," "animal assisted therapies," "pet therapy," "pet therapies," and "nursing" in the CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Medline/Pubmed, Web of Science, and Science Direct; and the keywords "hayvan destekli uygulama," "hayvan destekli terapi," and "hemsirelik" in the electronic databases of the National Thesis Center of the Council of Higher Education and the ULAKBIM. Six randomized controlled studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. These six studies were evaluated in terms of the characteristics of their samples, the animals used, the place of the practice, the measurement tools, and their results.
   Results: All studies were conducted in the last six years. In the randomized controlled studies, the sample comprised 66.66% old people, 16.67% adults, and 16.67% adolescents. The studies were conducted in elderly care centers (33.33%), hospitals (33.33%), elderly day care center (16.67%), and healthcare centers and hospitals (16.67%); they used dogs (as live animal), robotic pets, and humanoid robots within the scope of the intervention programs. They used different measurement tools to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Animal-assisted practices were found to reduce stress and the use of analgesics, positively affect vital signs, support other treatments for mental diseases, and increase self-esteem, social interaction, and quality of life.
   Conclusion: The results of this study showed that animal-assisted practices were an effective nursing intervention. However, it was found that randomized controlled studies indicating the effectiveness of animal-assisted practices were limited, and that no studies have been conducted in Turkey on this subject. It is suggested that studies should be conducted which use animal-assisted treatment as a nursing intervention, the results of which would further contribute to the literature. It is recommended that animal-assisted practices should be included more in nursing studies.

AB  - The complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) complicates the search for effective treatments. While the key roles of pathologically modified proteins has occupied a central role in hypotheses of the pathophysiology, less attention has been paid to the potential role for transition metals overload, subsequent oxidative stress, and tissue injury. The association of transition metals, the major focus heretofore iron and amyloid, the same can now be said for the likely pathogenic microtubular associated tau (MAPT). This review discusses the interplay between iron, pathologically modified tau and oxidative stress, and connects many related discoveries. Basic principles of the transition to pathological MAPT are discussed. Iron, its homeostatic mechanisms, the recently described phenomenon of ferroptosis and purported, although still controversial roles in AD are reviewed as well as considerations to overcome existing hurdles of iron-targeted therapeutic avenues that have been attempted in AD. We summarize the involvement of multiple pathological pathways at different disease stages of disease progression that supports the potential for a combinatorial treatment strategy targeting multiple factors.

AB  - Aims. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric disorder associated with a high risk of suicide. This meta-analysis examined the prevalence of suicide attempts (SA) in patients with BD and its associated factors.
   Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Web of Science databases from their inception to 11 June 2018. The prevalence of SA in BD was synthesised using the random-effects model.
   Results. The search identified 3451 articles of which 79 studies with 33 719 subjects met the study entry criteria. The lifetime prevalence of SA was 33.9% (95% CI 31.3-36.6%; I-2 = 96.4%). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that the lifetime prevalence of SA was positively associated with female gender, BD-I, BD Not Otherwise Specified and rapid cycling BD subtypes, income level and geographic region.
   Conclusion. This meta-analysis confirmed that SA is common in BD and identified a number of factors related to SA. Further efforts are necessary to facilitate the identification and prevention of SA in BD. Long-term use of mood stabilisers coupled with psycho-social interventions should be available to BD patients to reduce the risk of suicidal behaviour.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trauma and stress-related mental health conditions can impact a person's ability to participate in work and can cause disruptions in employment. Best practice guidelines for occupational therapy return to work interventions with these populations are limited.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify and describe occupational therapy return to work interventions for trauma and stress-related mental health conditions.
   METHODS: Using a scoping review methodology, research databases were searched for papers relating to occupational therapy, return to work interventions, and trauma and stress-related mental health conditions. Three reviewers independently applied selection criteria and systematically extracted information. Data were extracted and synthesized in a narrative format.
   RESULTS: The search produced 18 relevant papers. The interventions described were more often person-focused versus environment- and occupation-focused, and many were carried out by multidisciplinary teams, making it difficult to identify best practices for occupational therapists in this area.
   CONCLUSION: Emerging practices include the Swedish "ReDO" intervention, support for active military members to manage operational stress to remain at work, and multidisciplinary team treatment. Further research, including studies with direct focus on the implications of occupational therapy interventions for return to work with trauma and stress-related mental health conditions, is required.

AB  - Opioid addiction and overdose are at record levels in the United States. This is driven, in part, by their widespread prescription for the treatment of pain, which also increased opportunity for diversion by sensation-seeking users. Despite considerable research on the neurobiology of addiction, treatment options for opioid abuse remain limited. Mood disorders, particularly depression, are often comorbid with both pain disorders and opioid abuse. The endogenous opioid system, a complex neuromodulatory system, sits at the neurobiological convergence point of these three comorbid disease states. We review evidence for dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system as a mechanism for the development of opioid addiction and/or mood disorder. Specifically, individual differences in opioid system function may underlie differences in vulnerability to opioid addiction and mood disorders. We also review novel research, which promises to provide more detailed understanding of individual differences in endogenous opioid neurobiology and its contribution to opioid addiction susceptibility.

AB  - Emotion regulation patterns are shaped, in part, by the quality of interpersonal interactions during early development. Given the important contribution of caregiver emotion socialization, parenting programs targeting these socialization practices represent an effective method of preventative intervention for childhood difficulties with emotion regulation. This review examines emotion socialization parenting programs that target the development of emotion regulation in young children aged 0-6. Through a systematic search of multiple databases, 1117 articles were retrieved for title, abstract, and full-text screening. After screening, 12 articles remained and were summarized using a narrative approach. Herein, we provide an overview of 3 main intervention frameworks: Tuning in to Kids (TIK), Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Emotion Development (PCIT-ED), and Emotion Enhanced Triple P (EETP). Overall, these emotion socialization programs have demonstrated efficacy in their ability to improve parenting behaviors related to the coaching of young children's emotion regulation; however, there has been limited examination of their effectiveness in promoting children's emotion regulation. Future research is required to address this limitation, with rigorous parenting intervention studies incorporating valid assessments of children's emotion regulation in order to promote children's development of adaptive emotion regulation.

AB  - Integration of services into primary health care for people with common mental disorders is considered a key strategy to improve access to mental health care in low-income and middle-income countries, yet services at the primary care level are largely unavailable. We did a systematic review to understand the barriers and facilitators in the implementation of mental health programmes. We searched five databases and included studies published between Jan 1,1990, and Sept 1, 2017, that used qualitative methods to assess the implementation of programmes for adults with common mental disorders at primary health-care settings in low-income and middle-income countries. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist was used to assess the quality of eligible papers. We used the so-called best fit framework approach to synthesise findings according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We identified 24 papers for inclusion. These papers described the implementation of nine programmes in 11 countries. Key factors included: the extent to which an organisation is ready for implementation; the attributes, knowledge, and beliefs of providers; complex service user needs; adaptability and perceived advantage of interventions; and the processes of planning and evaluating the implementation. Evidence on implementation of mental health programmes in low-income and middle-income countries is scarce. Synthesising results according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research helped to identify key areas for future action, including investment in primary health-care strengthening, capacity building for health providers, and increased support to address the social needs of service users.

AB  - Introduction: There has long been a need for diagnostic, theragnostic, and prognostic biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. Biomarkers help in reducing ambiguity and arbitrariness and increase objectivity. In this context, many candidates for hormonal, immunological, serological, and neuroimaging markers have been proposed, but none of these marker candidates alone nor a biomarker panel has been approved for any disease. The fact that almost all psychiatric disorders are heterogeneous makes this process challenging. However, strong biomarker candidates have been identified, especially in light of the large number of clinical and preclinical studies conducted within the last five years.
   Objective: The aim of this article was to compile and discuss the current information on immune biomarkers in major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders.
   Methods: In this study, respected scientific databases were searched using key terms related to the subject, and the related literature was examined in detail.
   Results: There are many relationships between psychiatric disorders and immune system parameters. Evidence also suggests that neuroinflammation is involved in the etiopathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Markers, such as proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and C-reactive protein have been associated with psychiatric disorders in numerous studies.
   Conclusions: The neuroinflammation hypothesis has an important place in the etiopathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Uncertainty remains as to whether neuroinflammation is a cause or consequence of psychiatric disorders. Some researchers have indicated that intestinal microbiota composition disorders and dysbiosis are sources of neuroinflammation. Immune marker studies are of great importance in terms of eliminating this uncertainty and overcoming diagnostic and treatment difficulties in the clinic. In this review, biomarker studies on psychiatric disorders were examined from the viewpoint of the immune system and discussed in light of the current studies.

AB  - Psychiatric diseases are the manifestations that result from the individual's genetic structure, physiology, immunology and ways of coping with environmental stressors. The current psychiatric diagnostic systems do not include any systematic characterization in regard to neurobiological processes that reveal the clinical picture in individuals who got psychiatric diagnosis. It is obvious that further research in different areas is needed to understand the psychopathology. The problems in the functions of immune system and the correlation of neuroinflammatory processes with psychiatric disorders have been one of the main research topics of psychiatry in recent years and have contributed to our understanding of psychopathology. Recent advances in the fields of immunology and genetics as well as rapidly increasing knowledge on the effects of immunological processes on brain functions have drawn attention to the correlations between psychiatric disorders and immune system dysfunctions. There are still unfilled gaps in the biology, pathophysiology, and treatment of major depressive disorder, which is quite prevalent among the psychiatric disorders, can lead to significant disability, and frequently has a recurrent course. It appears that low-grade chronic neuroinflammation plays a key role in forming a basis for the interaction between psychological stress, impaired gut microbiota and major depressive disorder. In this review, the role of neuroinflammation in the etiopathogenesis of depression and the mechanism of action of the gut-brain axis that leads to this are discussed in the light of current studies.

AB  - Objectives: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the main techniques available for the treatment of such serious mental illnesses as schizophrenia and drug-resistant depression. The pre-anaesthetic assessment appropriate for patients with various mental disorders or pathologies does not differ substantially from that of any patient prior to undergoing anaesthesia for a surgical procedure. The present review aims to propose guidelines to achieve a higher level of safety and effectiveness during ECT in the most frequent situations, in accordance with the current literature.
   Methods: We conducted a search on the role of anaesthesia in ECT in the Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) databases, with special attention to the populations undergoing this type of therapy. The search was carried out between 1978 and December 2016.
   Results: We included the 96 articles that contained the most important recommendations for the preparation of this guide.
   Conclusions: We propose these guidelines in order to achieve a higher level of safety and effectiveness during ECT in special conditions. We also summarize the most important attitude to be taken into account by the anaesthesiologist in these cases. (C) 2018 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

KW  - SAMPLE
AB  - The comorbidity of bipolar disorder (BD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is widely known. The overall rate of association between BD and OCD is very high and varies, depending on the authors, from 11% to 18%, with peaks of 21% in primarily bipolar patients. Vice versa, about 60% of patients with OCD have a second psychiatric diagnosis, which in 23% of cases turns out to be BD. The differences between the BD patients with and without OCD were so numerous and important (e.g., different onset of mood episodes, history of suicide attempts, seasonality, rapid cycling and impulsivity) that the comorbidity between BD and OCD may represent a distinct form of BD, similar to cyclothymic BD for psychopathological features. However, the comorbidity does not seem to have any impact on cognitive performance, such as there is no specific difference between patients who first develop BD and then OCD or vice versa. Anyway, the detection of the neurocognitive profile of these patients at the time of the first clinical evaluation could have clinical implications also in the therapeutic and rehabilitative management of this type of patient. Indeed, it would be desirable to develop a new model of rehabilitation that is less differentiated for both BD and OCD or for their comorbidity, also to make cognitive rehabilitation faster and less expensive. The purpose of this mini-review is to update the knowledge currently available on the impact of BD and OCD comorbidity on neurocognitive profile.

AB  - Introduction: Tinnitus occurs in 10-15% of the world's population. It may lead to hearing loss, depression, and suicidal tendencies, as well as reduced quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess whether Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) effectively reduces tinnitus handicapping after six months or more of follow-up.
   Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with follow-up of six months was undertaken. The review took place through searching Medline, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases using the keywords "tinnitus" and "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation" and limiting the search results to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted on adults (19 years and older) published between 2005-2015. Meta-analysis was performed on the similarly designed studies.
   Results: Five RCTs with six month follow-up were found conforming to the inclusion criteria. In total, there were 119 patients in the TMS arms and 115 in the placebo arms. However, designs were different between the studies and were therefore not all comparable. Different parameters were used to measure the severity of tinnitus and depression scores. Tinnitus handicapped inventory (THI) was the common measured outcome parameter used in all studies. THI score decreased after the TMS in four studies. Meta-analysis was performed on three similarly designed RCTs with the overall effect being insignificant.
   Conclusion: TMS reduced the THI score and decreased the severity of tinnitus in 45% of patients and lead to a complete recovery in 32% of cases in one study. However, the meta-analysis demonstrated lack of significant effect of TMS on tinnitus management.

AB  - Background: Language is a valuable source of clinical information in Alzheimer's disease, as it declines concurrently with neurodegeneration. Consequently, speech and language data have been extensively studied in connection with its diagnosis.
   Objective: Firstly, to summarize the existing findings on the use of artificial intelligence, speech, and language processing to predict cognitive decline in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Secondly, to detail current research procedures, highlight their limitations, and suggest strategies to address them.
   Methods: Systematic review of original research between 2000 and 2019, registered in PROSPERO (reference CRD42018116606). An interdisciplinary search covered six databases on engineering (ACM and IEEE), psychology (PsycINFO), medicine (PubMed and Embase), and Web of Science. Bibliographies of relevant papers were screened until December 2019.
   Results: From 3,654 search results, 51 articles were selected against the eligibility criteria. Four tables summarize their findings: study details (aim, population, interventions, comparisons, methods, and outcomes), data details (size, type, modalities, annotation, balance, availability, and language of study), methodology (pre-processing, feature generation, machine learning, evaluation, and results), and clinical applicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias, and strengths/limitations).
   Conclusion: Promising results are reported across nearly all 51 studies, but very few have been implemented in clinical research or practice. The main limitations of the field are poor standardization, limited comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims and clinical applications. Active attempts to close these gaps will support translation of future research into clinical practice.

AB  - Objective The functions of both the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), are affected by psychology and physiology This review summarizes the results of studies comparing the evaluation of HRV parameters between individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and healthy controls.
   Methods Eligible studies (11=499) were identified through literature searches of the EMBASE, Medlin, PubMed and Web of Science databases. Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria. A random effects model was used, and standardized mean differences for high-frequency HRV(HF-I IRV), low-frequency HRV(LF-HRV) and the root mean square of successive R-R interval differences (RMSSD) were calculated.
   Results Significant effects were found for HF-HRV [p<0.0001, Z=4.18; Hedges'g=-1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-2.32, -0.84); k=14] and RMSSD [p<0.00001, Z=4.80; Hedges'g -1.96, 95% CI (-2.76, -1.16); k=9] relative to healthy controls. Considerable heterogeneity was revealed, but the main effects for HF-HRV and RMSSD were robust in subsequent meta-regression and subgroup analyses.
   Conclusion Given the relationships among low vagal gate, inflammation, and alterations in brain structure and function, including executive function and emotion regulation, reduced HRV may be regarded as an endophenotype in PTSD research.

AB  - Current medical countermeasures for organophosphate (OP)-induced status epilepticus (SE) are not effective in preventing long-term morbidity and there is an urgent need for improved therapies. Rat models of acute intoxication with the OP, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), are increasingly being used to evaluate therapeutic candidates for efficacy in mitigating the long-term neurologic effects associated with OP-induced SE. Many of these therapeutic candidates target neuroinflammation and oxidative stress because of their implication in the pathogenesis of persistent neurologic deficits associated with OP-induced SE. Critical to these efforts is the rigorous characterization of the rat DFP model with respect to outcomes associated with acute OP intoxication in humans, which include long-term electroencephalographic, neurobehavioral, and neuropathologic effects, and their temporal relationship to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. To address these needs, we examined a range of outcomes at later times post-exposure than have previously been reported for this model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given pyridostigmine bromide (0.1 mg/kg, im) 30 min prior to administration of DFP (4 mg/kg, sc), which was immediately followed by atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, im) and pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, im). This exposure paradigm triggered robust electroencephalographic and behavioral seizures that rapidly progressed to SE lasting several hours in 90% of exposed animals. Animals that survived DFP-induced SE (similar to 70%) exhibited spontaneous recurrent seizures and hyperreactive responses to tactile stimuli over the first 2 months post-exposure. Performance in the elevated plus maze, open field, and Pavlovian fear conditioning tests indicated that acute DFP intoxication reduced anxiety-like behavior and impaired learning and memory at 1 and 2 months post-exposure in the absence of effects on general locomotor behavior. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed significantly increased expression of biomarkers of reactive astrogliosis, microglial activation and oxidative stress in multiple brain regions at 1 and 2 months post-DFP, although there was significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity across these endpoints. Collectively, these data largely support the relevance of the rat model of acute DFP intoxication as a model for acute OP intoxication in the human, and support the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and/or oxidative stress represent potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the long-term neurologic sequelae of acute OP intoxication.

AB  - Aims. This systematic review compiled evidence on interventions to reduce mental health-related stigma among medical and nursing students in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Primary outcomes were stigmatising attitudes and discriminatory behaviours.
   Methods. Data collection included two strategies. First, previous systematic reviews were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria of the current review. Second, a new search was done, covering the time since the previous reviews, i.e. January 2013 to May 2017. Five search concepts were combined in order to capture relevant literature: stigma, mental health, intervention, professional students in medicine and nursing, and LMICs. A qualitative analysis of all included full texts was done with the software MAXQDA. Full texts were analysed with regard to the content of interventions, didactic methods, mental disorders, cultural adaptation, type of outcome measure and primary outcomes. Furthermore, a methodological quality assessment was undertaken.
   Results. A total of nine studies from six countries (Brazil, China, Malaysia, Nigeria, Somaliland and Turkey) were included. All studies reported significant results in at least one outcome measure. However, from the available literature, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the most effective interventions. No meta-analysis could be calculated due to the large heterogeneity of intervention content, evaluation design and outcome measures. Studies with contact interventions (either face-to-face or video) demonstrated attitudinal change. There was a clear lack of studies focusing on discriminatory behaviours. Accordingly, training of specific communication and clinical skills was lacking in most studies, with the exception of one study that showed a positive effect of training interview skills on attitudes. Methods for cultural adaptation of interventions were rarely documented. The methodological quality of most studies was relatively low, with the exception of two studies.
   Conclusions. There is an increase in studies on anti-stigma interventions among professional students in LMICs. Some of these studies used contact interventions and showed positive effects. A stronger focus on clinical and communication skills and behaviour-related outcomes is needed in future studies.

AB  - Aims. This systematic review compiled evidence on interventions to reduce mental health-related stigma in primary health care (PHC) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Studies targeting PHC staff (including non-professionals) were included. Primary outcomes were stigmatising attitudes and discriminatory behaviours.
   Methods. Data collection included two strategies. First, previous systematic reviews were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria of the current review. Second, a new search was done, covering the time since the previous reviews, i.e. January 2013 to May 2017.

A qualitative analysis of all included full-texts was done with software MAXQDA. Full-texts were analysed with regards to the content of interventions, didactic methods, mental disorders, cultural adaptation, type of outcome measure and primary outcomes. Furthermore, a risk of bias assessment was undertaken.
   Results. A total of 18 studies were included. Risk of bias was rated as high in most included studies. Only six studies had tested their intervention against a control condition, two of which had used random allocation. Most frequently used interventions were lectures providing theoretical information. Many studies also used interactive methods (N = 9), discussed case studies (N = 8) or used role plays (N = 5). Three studies reported that they had used clinical practice and supervision. Results of these studies were mixed. No or little effects were found for brief training interventions (e.g. 1 h to 1 day). Longer training interventions with more sophisticated didactic methods produced statistically significant changes in validated stigma questionnaires. These results have to be interpreted with caution due to risk of bias. Methods for cultural adaptation of interventions were rarely documented.
   Conclusions. More rigorous trials are needed in LMICs to test interventions that target discriminatory behaviours in relationship with patients. Cultural adaptation of stigma interventions and structural/institutional factors should be more explicitly addressed in such trials.

AB  - What people think about, the intentional aspect of cognition, is distinguished from its operational aspect, or how proficiently they think. Many psychiatric disorders as well as social problems like racism, are defined largely by specified thought contents, whereas neurological disorders including dementia are defined by low proficiency. Intentionality contrasts with operational cognition in resisting objectification and in being expressed primarily in verbal narratives and subjective self-disclosure. This yields insecure data that have slowed progress in fields where intentional cognition plays a key role. The question is how to produce more secure knowledge and open the intentional domain itself to objective investigation. The use of operational methods to infer intentionality has provided only partial answers. However, the science of reconstructing mental events with neural data is providing a new horizon for the study of intentional cognition. Reconstruction science must address major challenges related to fidelity and validity. Nevertheless, this approach is showing the first steps on the road to accessing and revealing objectively the contents of thought.

AB  - Introduction: Depression is considered as one of the most serious health issues worldwide, and the search for the most effective and safe treatments for depression is essential. Aromatherapy with lavender have attracted the attention of many researchers due to their low cost and ease of use, so this study was conducted to review of the effects of aromatherapy with lavender essential oil on depression.
   Methods: This systematic review study was conducted by searching the databases (SID, Magiran, Google-Scholar, Medline via PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) by using the keywords such as depression, Lavandula, Lavender, and Aromatherapy, as well as applying OR and AND operators to the end of January 1, 2020 A.D. The inclusion criteria were: 1) Interventional studies that determined keywords were in the title or keywords of the article, 2) aromatherapy was conducted through inhalation or massage, 3) the full text of paper was accessible, and 4) published in English or Persian. Finally, the information obtained from articles was extracted using a checklist.
   Results: Out of 278 studies, 9 studies were included to the systematic review process after screening and eliminating duplicate papers according to the purpose of the study. Aromatherapy with lavender essential oil was conducted on the patients suffering from migraine, patients with the acute coronary syndrome, patients undergoing hemodialysis, community-dwelling older adult, and postpartum depression. The results obtained from some studies showed the positive effect of aromatherapy with lavender essential oil on depression whereas some studies did not report the effect of aromatherapy with lavender on depression significantly.
   Conclusion: It seems that aromatherapy with lavender probably can be used as a complementary, simple, and inexpensive method to improve mild and moderate depression. It is recommended to earmark using a collaborative approach and make use of interdisciplinary and psychology specialists as well as complementary medicine in applying aromatherapy with lavender essential oil.

AB  - Background: Chronic pain is commonly associated with anxiety and depression, making it more challenging to be managed. Psychological interventions are suggested for such complicated issues which are well evident in the United States and Europe. However, generalizing the evidence to Iranian population - as a Middle Eastern society - might be questionable. We aimed to synthesize our evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions among Iranian populations.
   Methods: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. Persian and English literature were searched through Iran-doc, Elm-net, and PubMed until March 2019 using the following terms (or its Persian synonyms): chronic pain; persistent pain; chronic fatigue; fibromyalgia; neuropath*; LBP; irritable bowel; CFS; psycho*; cogniti*; acceptance; meaning; mindfulness; relaxation; biopsychosocial; rehabilitation; educate*. Eligible trials were randomized trials that evaluated the effectiveness of psychological interventions on Iranian adults with chronic pain. No setting restriction was considered. Risk of bias for each trial was assessed, and the random-effect model was used to pool summary effect across trials.
   Results: In all 30 eligible RCTs, the risk of bias for randomization was low except for one study. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) for depression and anxiety were 1.33 (95% CI: -1.42 to -0.68) and 1.25 (95% CI: -1.55 to -0.96), respectively.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that psychological interventions are highly effective in reducing depression and anxiety in Iranian patients with chronic pain, compared to what observed in the U.S. and European studies. However, there are still some methodological issues to be addressed. Future research should focus on high-quality trials with considerations on the methodological issues reported in the present study.

AB  - Background: Acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches have gained popularity in recent years.
   Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of acceptance- and mindfulness-based therapies for persons with a psychotic or schizophrenia spectrum disorder.
   Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, relevant databases were searched for published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to October 2018. Outcomes were severity of overall symptomatology, hospitalization, positive and negative symptoms, depression, anxiety, social functioning, quality of life, acceptance, mindfulness skills and safety of the interventions.
   Results: Sixteen studies comprising 1268 people with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were included in the meta-analyses. Moderate to large effect sizes were found for overall symptomatology and hospitalization at endpoint (SMD .80,95% CI -1.31, -029 and MD 4.38, -5.58, -3.17 respectively) and follow-up (SMD 1.10, -2.09, -0.10 and MD 7.18, -8.67, - 5.68 respectively). There were significant small effects on negative symptoms (SMD .24; -0.44, -0.03), small to moderate effects for depression (SMD .47; -0.80, -0.14), social functioning (SMD .43; -0.75,-0.12) and mindfulness (SMD .51; -0.97, -0.05), moderate to large effects for acceptance (SMD .78; -1.44, -0.12), while no significant effects for positive symptoms (SMD .27; -0.65,0.00), anxiety (SMD 2.11; -4.64,0.42) or quality of life (SMD .43; -0.88,0.02). Majority of studies (75%) had low risk of bias and sensitivity analyses supported the findings.
   Conclusion: Acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches appear to be effective and safe interventions for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and could be a useful extension of standard casemanagement and psychofarmacology. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To systematically evaluate the effects of mind-body exercises (Tai Chi, Yoga, and Health Qigong) on motor function (UPDRS, Timed-Up-and-Go, Balance), depressive symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) of Parkinson's patients (PD). Methods: Through computer system search and manual retrieval, PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang Database, and CQVIP were used. Articles were retrieved up to the published date of June 30, 2019. Following the Cochrane Collaboration System Evaluation Manual (version 5.1.0), two researchers independently evaluated the quality and bias risk of each article, including 22 evaluated articles. The Pedro quality score of 6 points or more was found for 86% (19/22) of these studies, of which 21 were randomized controlled trials with a total of 1199 subjects; and the trial intervention time ranged from 4 to 24 weeks. Interventions in the control group included no-intervention controls, placebo, waiting-lists, routine care, and non-sports controls. Meta-analysis was performed on the literature using RevMan 5.3 statistical software, and heterogeneity analysis was performed using Stata 14.0 software. Results: (1) Mind-body exercises significantly improved motor function in PD patients, including UPDRS (SMD = -0.61, p < 0.001), TUG (SMD = -1.47, p < 0.001) and balance function (SMD = 0.79, p < 0.001). (2) Mind-body exercises also had significant effects on depression (SMD = -1.61, p = 0.002) and QoL (SMD = 0.66, p < 0.001). (3) Among the indicators, UPDRS (I-2 = 81%) and depression (I-2 = 91%) had higher heterogeneity; according to the results of the separate combined effect sizes of TUG (I-2 = 29%), Balance (I-2 = 16%) and QoL (I-2 = 35%), it shows that the heterogeneity is small; (4) After meta-regression analysis of the age limit and other possible confounding factors, further subgroup analysis showed that the reason for the heterogeneity of UPDRS motor function may be related to the sex of PD patients and severity of the disease; the outcome of depression was heterogeneous. The reason for this may be the use of specific drugs in the experiment and the duration of intervention in the trial. Conclusion: (1) Mind-body exercises were found to have significant improvements in motor function, depressive symptoms, and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease, and can be used as an effective method for clinical exercise intervention in PD patients. (2) Future clinical intervention programs for PD patients need to fully consider specific factors such as gender, severity of disease, specific drug use, and intervention cycle to effectively control heterogeneity factors, so that the clinical exercise intervention program for PD patients is objective, scientific, and effective.

AB  - The main aim of the paper is to show that many previously forgotten discoveries within the field of neuroscience own their rediscovery and renaissance to the refinement of tools provided by the technological advances. Most spectacular is the advancement of brain imaging techniques, which provide hard data that support for evidence for previously neglected presumptions and ideas. Neuroplasticity is an example of such a long ignored historical discovery. One reason for that neglect is that it stood in contradiction to beliefs and theories prevailing at the first half of the twenties century. The idea of neuronal plasticity is not disputed any longer since it has found confirmation not only in a dramatic development of neuroimaging but also in the advancement of neurobiology. Most authors concentrate upon neuronal plasticity, recent studies, however, have produced a wealth of information regarding neurogenesis, in which astrocytes have proved to play a significant role. The significance of adult neurogenesis for learning and memory and for treatment of depression is outlined. Moreover, it was observed that neuroplasticity benefits patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who undergo effective, evidence-based treatment. Convincing examples of brain plasticity brings also clinical practice, which often unveils the appearance of hitherto hidden artistic abilities in people who have suffered from brain damage. In addition, the possibilities of altering the brain functions by mental force alone are discussed. Thus, the paper reveals that many "controversial" ideas were confirmed by contemporary studies forcing changes in a traditional view on brain works.

AB  - Objective: Some people might be more prone to placebo and nocebo responses than others depending on their personality traits. We aimed to provide a systematic review on the influence of personality traits on placebo and nocebo responses in controlled and uncontrolled studies.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in the databases CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO and EMBASE for relevant publications published between January 1997 and March 2018. For all included papers, we conducted an additional forward search.
   Results: After screening 407 references, we identified 24 studies. The Big Five (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness) and optimism were the most frequently investigated personality traits. Several studies found a positive association between optimism and the placebo response. Furthermore, we found that higher anxiety was associated with increased nocebo responses.
   Conclusion: Evidence points to a possible association between optimism and the placebo response. Therefore, further emphasising the investigation of the influence of optimism on the placebo/nocebo response seems warranted. For clinical practice, the impact of anxiety on the nocebo response might be important to identify patients who might be more prone to experiencing side effects of medical treatments.

AB  - Social cognition refers to the mental operations governing social interactions. Recent research has highlighted the importance of social cognition in determining functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia and in psychosis risk populations. The aim of this review is to investigate the neural correlates of social cognition in different psychosis risk populations, potentially representing different levels of risk i.e. high schizotypy (SR), familial risk (FR) and clinical high risk (CHR). PsychINFO, Web of Science and PubMed were systematically searched, and 39 papers were included in the final review. Results in FR samples were highly inconclusive. In SR samples, findings showed a tendency towards increased task related activity in frontal cortex regions. The most consistent results come from CHR samples, where findings suggest increased task related activity in frontal and cingulate cortices. Interestingly, all studies of CHR populations also report increased activity in temporal cortex and abnormal response to neutral stimuli during emotional processing tasks. These findings are discussed in relation to dopamine models of psychosis due to temporal cortex abnormally.

AB  - Objectives The lack of a common definition for precarious employment (PE) severely hampers the comparison of studies within and between countries, consequently reducing the applicability of research findings. We carried out a systematic review to summarize how PE has been conceptualized and implemented in research and identify the construct's dimensions in order to facilitate guidance on its operationalization.
   Methods According to PRISMA guidelines, we searched Web of Science and Scopus for publications with variations of PE in the title or abstract. The search returned 1225 unique entries, which were screened for eligibility. Exclusion criteria were (i) language other than English, (ii) lack of a definition for PE, and (iii) non-original research. A total of 63 full-text articles were included and qualitative thematic-analysis was performed in order to identify dimensions of PE.
   Results We identified several theory-based definitions of PE developed by previous researchers. Most definitions and operationalizations were either an accommodation to available data or the direct result of qualitative studies identifying themes of PE. The thematic-analysis of the selected articles resulted in a multidimensional construct including the following three dimensions: employment insecurity, income inadequacy, and lack of rights and protection.
   Conclusions Despite a growing number of studies on PE, most fail to clearly define the concept, severely restricting the advancement of the research of PE as a social determinant of health. Our combined theoretical and empirical review suggests that a common multidimensional definition could be developed and deployed in different labor market contexts using a variety of methodological approaches.

AB  - Existing literature identified numerous positive consequences of vitality, including somatic health, mental well-being, and improved performance. Despite the immense scientifically proven beneficial importance of vitality, the concept has not been accurately conceptualized to ensure its uniform, comprehensive understanding and application. Through a detailed analysis of 93 qualified research studies on vitality, the present study provides a contemporary and concise scoping review of the vitality research domain, in particular how researchers addressed vitality, what aspects of vitality they explored, and how they designed their investigations on vitality. The vitality research domain appears to be composed of mainly quantitative inquiries in the field of psychology. The findings disclose vitality as a quantifiable subjective positive concept consisting of fluctuating physiological and psychological energy, which can be regulated and harnessed by a person possessing it. In addition to outlining features and measurements of vitality, the review generalized its empirically identified antecedents and consequences.

AB  - Aim: Stress is prevalent among doctors, and interventions are offered, often as part of their continuing professional development, to help doctors learn in the workplace about the recognition, prevention and management of the harmful effects of stress. The aim of this review was to examine existing research to ascertain the features of successful educational interventions with practising doctors and any factors that may affect outcomes. Methods: We searched key databases for papers published between 1990 and 2017 on the themes of stress that included an education-based intervention and practising doctors. Using an inclusive approach to the review, a broad evaluation was made of the primary research using both quantitative and/or qualitative evidence where the study reported a positive outcome in terms of stress management. Results: Review criteria were met in 31 studies of 1,356 originally retrieved. Three broad categories of interventions emerged from the coding process: mindfulness-type (n = 12), coping and solutions focused (CSF) (n = 12) and reflective groups (n = 7). There is evidence that these interventions can be successful to help doctors deal with stress. Based on the results from this review, an original guide is advanced to help educators choose an educational intervention. Conclusion: Although evidence for some interventions may be 'hierarchically stronger', it is misleading to assume that interventions can be imported as successfully into any context. Factors such as medical specialty and health care systems may affect which intervention can be used. The guide offers an evidence base on which further research can be built.

AB  - The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak was labeled a global pandemic by the WHO in March of 2020. Understanding how crisis influence an individual's reactions to stressful events (and vice versa) is important in order to create meaningful and effective interventions. Our literature search have revealed lack of the papers related to psychodynamic approach to recent crisis. Psychodynamic places a large emphasis on defense mechanisms and unconscious mind, where upsetting feelings, urges, and thoughts that are too painful for us to directly look at are housed. Even though these painful feelings and thoughts are outside of our awareness, they still influence our behavior in many ways. Optimal application of psychodynamic approach offers the frame for acceptance of psychological stress in a more positive way and benefits psychological growth. We believe that including psychodynamic approach in the national public and mental health emergency system will empower Croatia and the world during (and after) COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

AB  - In recent years, due to its great economic and social potential, the recognition of facial expressions linked to emotions has become one of the most flourishing applications in the field of artificial intelligence, and has been the subject of many developments. However, despite significant progress, this field is still subject to many theoretical debates and technical challenges. It therefore seems important to make a general inventory of the different lines of research and to present a synthesis of recent results in this field. To this end, we have carried out a systematic review of the literature according to the guidelines of the PRISMA method. A search of 13 documentary databases identified a total of 220 references over the period 2014-2019. After a global presentation of the current systems and their performance, we grouped and analyzed the selected articles in the light of the main problems encountered in the field of automated facial expression recognition. The conclusion of this review highlights the strengths, limitations and main directions for future research in this field.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence points to the role of vitamin D in the pathobiology and treatment of depression. However, the evidence is inconsistent in many aspects. The objectives of this narrative review were to evaluate the state of the evidence, synthesize the knowledge gaps, and formulate recommendations for more enhanced research in this growing area. Methods: Electronic searches of MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were carried out from inception till February 2019 to identify relevant English language peer-reviewed articles. Abstracts generated were systematically screened for eligibility. Included articles were grouped under three broad themes: The association between vitamin D and depression, its biological underpinnings, and trials evaluating the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in depression. Relevant data were extracted as per a structured proforma. Results: A total of 61 articles were included in the present review. Overall findings were that there is a relationship between vitamin D and depression, though the directionality of this association remains unclear. The association appears to be driven by the homeostatic, trophic, and immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D. Evidence from supplementation trials suggest a more robust therapeutic effect on subjects with major depression and concurrent vitamin D deficiency. Conclusion: Serum vitamin D levels inversely correlate with clinical depression, but the evidence is not strong enough to recommend universal supplementation in depression. Enriching depression treatment trials with subjects having concurrent vitamin D deficiency appears to be a potential step forward in identifying subgroups who may maximally benefit from this approach.

AB  - Computerized and blended treatments seem to be an attractive treatment for adolescents as an alternative to face-to-face treatment, but mental health professionals seem hesitant to use these treatment modalities. This review provides an overview of factors contributing to and withholding from using computerized or blended treatment in routine care. Three databases were searched with terms related to (1) adolescents, (2) depression, (3) computerized or blended, and (4) treatment. Of the 33 articles identified, 10 focused on unguided computerized treatments, six on guided, two on blended, two compared unguided, blended- and face-to-face treatment to no treatment, and eight studies on games. Further, two articles that were focused on an online monitoring tool and three on intervention characteristics or preferred modes of help-seeking. Evidence for effectiveness, adherence, drop-out, and forming therapeutic relations were suspected to be barriers, but are no reason to reject computerized or blended treatment. Improvement in mental health literacy and the possibility to tailor the intervention are facilitators. However, adolescents' intention to seek help, acceptability of computerized treatment, symptom severity, time spent by therapist, and other facilities are identified as barriers and they need to be taken into account when using computerized or blended interventions. Nevertheless, computerized and blended are promising treatments for depressed youth.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Palliative medicine is a special status focusing on the quality of life of patients suffering from special or advanced diseases. Palliative medicine can be helpful at any stage of the disease, including the diagnosis. Thus, the present study aims at reviewing the application of palliative care in mental disorders. Method: In the present study, as many as 1,149 studies were found in the period of 1985 to 2018 by searching on different websites including Medline, Embase, ProQuest, Global Health, GoogleScholar, and Scopus. As many as 53 studies having to do with mental disorders were found, and more specifically, as many as 36 articles related to palliative medicine were applied. Findings: Reviewing the related literature indicates that the care needs of mental disorders patients are quite complicated. The findings indicated that predicting the complications of the disease, as well as advanced planning in terms of caring for these patients, are of significant importance. The findings indicated that over the last decade two palliative care models have been developed: integrative and consultative. Conclusion: With the growth development of palliative care in developed countries, the knowledge of palliative care can be shared with the nurses and practitioners of neurological diseases, and this knowledge can be applied to palliate and reduce the pains and sufferings of the patients and their families.

AB  - Background: Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) comprise a group of heterogeneous hereditary connective tissue disorders [1, 2]. Psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, panic disorder, agoraphobia, schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental disorders, personality disorder, eating disorders, substance misuse and interpersonal issues have been reported in the literature to be associated with EDS [1-3].
   Objectives: The case of a 15-year old male who was hospitalized after a suicide attempt by gunshot, who was discovered to have symptoms suggestive of EDS, is presented in this paper along with the results of a literature search of psychiatric manifestations of EDS in children and adolescents.
   Methods: Literature review was conducted on the UpToDate website on March 11, 2020 to review symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome for the purpose of preliminary diagnosis of this patient. Additional literature search was conducted on PubMed on 4/2/20 at 12:10 P.M. and on 4/9/20 at 10:51 P.M. and on the search engine Google on 4/2/20 at 12:25 P.M. On May 11, 2020 at 2 P.M., another web search was conducted with a review of 6 different websites pertaining to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
   Results: A systematic review of psychiatric manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes revealed a strong incidence of psychiatric symptoms.
   Conclusion: Our patient's psychiatric symptoms of depression, suicidal ideations, anxiety and social and educational struggles may have been at least partially due to chronic pain- abdominal, headache and musculoskeletal, and social ostracization associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Education regarding this illness helped our patient's recovery as he came to understand why he was so "odd" and the cause of his multisystemic chronic pain.

AB  - This study sought to update knowledge on unsafe abortion in Brazil. We carried out a systematic review with study search and selection on MEDLINE and LILACS, with no language restriction, from 2008 to 2018. We evaluated article quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute instruments. We evaluated 50 articles. The prevalence of induced abortion in Brazil was estimated by a direct method to be 15% in 2010 and 13% in 2016. Higher prevalences were observed in more socially vulnerable populations. There was a decrease in the ratio of induced abortions by 1,000 women of reproductive age in the period 1995-2013, reaching 16 per 1,000 in 2013. Half of all women reported using medications for terminating pregnancies and the number of hospital admissions due to complications from abortion, especially severe complications, decreased from 1992 to 2009. Maternal morbimortality from abortion had a reduced frequency but reached high values in specific contexts. It is likely that maternal deaths from abortion are under-reported. Common mental disorders during pregnancy and postpartum depression were more frequent among women who unsuccessfully attempted to induce an abortion. Findings indicate that abortion is frequently used in Brazil, especially in less-developed regions and by more socially-vulnerable women. Access to safer methods probably contributed to the reduction in hospitalizations due to complications and to the reduction in morbimortality from abortion. However, half of all women still resort to other methods and the number of admissions due to complications from abortion is still high.

AB  - Interest of the study: mindfulness is a concept describing the focus on the present moment, intentionally and without judgement. This approach has only recently been applied to sport psychology. Objectives: the aim of the current review is to investigate which indicators and questionnaires are used in mindfulness research in sport, being specifically interested in mindfulness assessment. Methods: PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. Literature searches were conducted in Psychinfo, PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Results: From 2,203 records initially retrieved, 17 articles were included. The results show that mindfulness, anxiety and acceptance are the most commonly studied psychological indicators. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire is the most frequently used mindfulness scale. We also discuss the possibility of using physiological indicators as complementary assessment. Conclusions: It is recommended to specifically adapt some questionnaires, such is already done with the Sport Anxiety Scale or the Mindfulness Inventory for Sport, for their use in sport psychology.

AB  - Background: It has been estimated that one third of dementia cases may be preventable through modifiable lifestyle interventions. Epidemiological evidence suggests a link between stressful life events and aging-related cognitive decline and dementia; however, inherent methodological limitations in examining subjective and biological measures of stress separately leads to interpretive constraints.
   Objective: The aim of the current study was to conduct a systematic review of the research literature investigating the effect of perceived and biological measures of stress on dementia risk.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted of cohort, case-control, longitudinal prospective or retrospective studies examining the association between stress and risk of developing dementia. Studies were identified from a systematic search across major electronic databases from inception to February 2020.
   Results: Overall, 22 studies were identified including a total of 496,556 participants, approximately 50% were females, with sample sizes ranging from 62-270,977. There was considerable heterogeneity in the definition and measurement of stress. Most of the identified studies reported a significant positive association between stress and dementia risk.
   Conclusion: Evidenced from the current review is that personality traits linked to increased perceived stress and elevated reported perceived stress, are associated with greater statistical risk for dementia. However, this review highlights that caution must be exhibited in interpreting these findings, as methodological issues with confounding adjustment may mediate these results. Future research should focus on the investigation of stress on dementia risk with a full range of confounding adjustment, and on biological measures of stress.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that patients with essential tremor (ET) show impairment in psychosocial functions and subsequently increasing vulnerability to anxiety. Here we review evidence supporting a positive relationship between self-reported motor disability and psychological symptoms in ET and critically analyze evidence suggesting how psychosocial factors enhance tremor disability in ET. Theories related to motor competency, behavioral conditioning, and social anxiety have been proposed to relate self-concepts to self-reported tremor disability. We review these theories and then propose a new model in an effort to focus on the self-concepts among ET patients as a factor in tremor disability. Patients with ET exhibited cognitive abnormalities, depression, anxiety, and a higher prevalence of avoidant personality types. Although anxiety, depression and personality types may influence tremor disability in ET, self-concepts may better explain perceived tremor disability in social situations. We conclude by discussing a proposed biopsychosocial model and suggesting future research on ET specific assessment tools and intervention methods.

AB  - Background: Caring for patients with dementia at home is often a long-term process, in which the independence of the patient declines, and more responsibility and supervision time is required from the informal caregiver.
   Objective: In order to minimize and reduce caregiver burden, it is important to explore its trajectory and the accompanying risk factors as dementia progresses; the objective of this systematic review.
   Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed in this systematic review. Three databases, PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMbase, were systematically searched in November 2019 using specific keywords.
   Results: 1,506 hits emerged during the systematic search but only eleven articles actually met the inclusion criteria for this review. The trajectory of caregiver burden is highly variable and depends on multiple factors. Important risk factors included: patients' behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and their decline in functioning in (I)ADL; the caregiver's age, gender, and physical and mental health; and, within the dyads (patient/caregiver), cohabitation and kinship.
   Conclusion: There is no one-size-fits-all for predicting how caregiver burden will change over time, but specific factors (like being a spouse and increased behavioral impairment and decline in functional status in the patient) may heighten the risk. Other factors, not yet comprehensively included in the published studies, might also prove to be important risk factors. Future research in the field of reducing caregiver burden is recommended to integrate the patient, caregiver, and context characteristics in the trajectory of caregiver burden, and to assess more clearly the phase of the dementia progression and use of external resources.

AB  - Depression is both prevalent and costly, and many individuals do not adequately respond to existing psychopharmacological and behavioral interventions. The current article describes the use of neuroscience in augmenting behavioral interventions for depression in two primary areas: anhedonia and cognitive deficits/biases. Neuroscience research has increased our understanding of the neural bases of reward processing and regulation of positive affect, and anhedonia among depressed samples can be related to deficits in each of these domains. Treatments that specifically target reward processing and regulation of positive affect in order to reduce anhedonia represent a recent advance in the field. Depression is also associated with aberrant processes relating to working memory, autobiographical memory, attentional bias, and interpretive bias. Neuroscience findings have increasingly been leveraged to augment the efficacy of cognitive-training and bias-modification interventions in these domains. The use of neuroscience to inform the development and augmentation of behavioral interventions for depression is a promising avenue of continued research.

AB  - Background We systematically reviewed implementation research targeting depression interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to assess gaps in methodological coverage. Methods PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched for evaluations of depression interventions in LMICs reporting at least one implementation outcome published through March 2019. Results A total of 8714 studies were screened, 759 were assessed for eligibility, and 79 studies met inclusion criteria. Common implementation outcomes reported were acceptability (n = 50; 63.3%), feasibility (n = 28; 35.4%), and fidelity (n = 18; 22.8%). Only four studies (5.1%) reported adoption or penetration, and three (3.8%) reported sustainability. The Sub-Saharan Africa region (n = 29; 36.7%) had the most studies. The majority of studies (n = 59; 74.7%) reported outcomes for a depression intervention implemented in pilot researcher-controlled settings. Studies commonly focused on Hybrid Type-1 effectiveness-implementation designs (n = 53; 67.1), followed by Hybrid Type-3 (n = 16; 20.3%). Only 21 studies (26.6%) tested an implementation strategy, with the most common being revising professional roles (n = 10; 47.6%). The most common intervention modality was individual psychotherapy (n = 30; 38.0%). Common study designs were mixed methods (n = 27; 34.2%), quasi-experimental uncontrolled pre-post (n = 17; 21.5%), and individual randomized trials (n = 16; 20.3). Conclusions Existing research has focused on early-stage implementation outcomes. Most studies have utilized Hybrid Type-1 designs, with the primary aim to test intervention effectiveness delivered in researcher-controlled settings. Future research should focus on testing and optimizing implementation strategies to promote scale-up of evidence-based depression interventions in routine care. These studies should use high-quality pragmatic designs and focus on later-stage implementation outcomes such as cost, penetration, and sustainability.

AB  - Aims. Mental disorders in children are a significant and growing cause of morbidity worldwide. Although interventions to help overcome barriers along the pathway to accessing health care for children with mental disorders exist, there is no overview of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on these interventions as yet. This study aimed to systematically identify RCTs of interventions to improve access to mental health care for children and synthesise them using a conceptual framework of access to health care.
   Methods. This systematic review was performed following a predefined protocol registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018081714). We searched the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CENTRAL for RCTs up to 15 May 2019 using terms related to the concepts 'young people,' 'mental disorders' and 'help-seeking interventions' and scanned reference lists from relevant studies. Two reviewers independently screened all identified articles in a two-stage process, extracted results on outcomes of interest (knowledge, attitudes, intentions, help-seeking, accessing care, mental health outcomes and satisfaction), assessed the risk of bias and conducted meta-analyses where deemed appropriate.
   Results. After screening 5641 identified articles, 34 RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Eighty per cent of universal school-based interventions measuring knowledge (n = 5) and 67% measuring attitudes (n = 6) reported significantly better results compared with controls on those outcomes, whereas 20% measuring access to care (n = 5) and none measuring mental health outcomes (n = 7) did. In contrast, 71% of interventions targeting at-risk individuals (n = 21) reported better access to care compared with controls, while just 33% (n = 6) did for mental health outcomes. For satisfaction with care, this proportion was 80% (n = 5). Meta-analyses of interventions measuring initial appointment attendance yielded combined odds ratios of 3.11 (2.07-4.67) for appointment reminder interventions and 3.51 (2.02-6.11) for treatment engagement interventions. The outcomes for universal school-based interventions were heterogeneous and could not be summarised quantitatively through meta-analysis.
   Conclusions. To have a population-level effect on improving children's access to mental health care, two-stage interventions that identify those in need and then engage them in the health-care system may be necessary. We need more evidence on interventions to target contextual factors such as affordability and infrastructural barriers.

AB  - Depression and depressive symptoms are prevalent in patients with cancer. Depression is underdiagnosed and therefore, patients often receive inadequate treatment for depression. We have assessed the evidence of primary prophylactic treatment for depression in patients with cancer. The systematic review was prospectively registered at PROSPERO and was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Five electronic databases were searched on the 31st of May 2018 and two independent reviewers screened the papers. Randomized controlled trials of adult patients with cancer treated prophylactically with an antidepressive intervention of any kind using validated assessment tools to measure depression or depressive symptoms were included. No language or publication year restrictions were applied. Seven out of eighteen studies reported a statistically significant prophylactic effect on depression. The studies were classified into three groups based on the type of intervention. The meta-analyses showed a significant difference in favour of pharmacotherapy (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18; 0.63), psychotherapy (SMD -0.23,95% CI -0.46; 0.00), and other interventions (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.31; - 0.03). Only one study had overall low risk of bias and the rest had high risk of bias predominantly due to blinding, incomplete data, or allocation concealment. Preventive measures have been examined in patients with cancer, but no convincing evidence for any specific intervention is present. Depression in patients with cancer can be prevented and prophylactic treatment should be given during oncological treatment but further high quality studies testing safe interventions are still needed.

AB  - About 99% of the unique genes and almost half of the cells found in the human body come from microbes including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. Collectively these microorganisms contribute to the microbiome and often reside in the gut. The gut microbiome plays an important role in the body and contributes to digestive health, the immune system, and brain function. The gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system through the vagal pathways as well as the endocrine or immune pathways. Changes in the proportion or diversity of the microbiota can have an impact on normal physiology and has been implicated in inflammation, depression, obesity, and addiction. Several animal studies suggest the involvement of gut microbiome in the regulation of pain, emotion, and cognition. Alcoholism has been linked with gut microbiome dysbiosis and thus can have deleterious effects on the gut-brain axis balance. Gut microbiome produces important metabolites such as gastrointestinal hormones, short chain fatty acids, precursors to the neuroactive compounds and neurotransmitters that impact the physiology and normal functioning of the body. The microbiome imbalance has been correlated with behavioral changes and alcohol dependence in the host. The objective of this study is to elucidate the link between alcohol induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and any behavioral impact that could incur. A thorough literature search of various databases was conducted to gather data for the alcohol prompted gut microbiome dysbiosis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA(1)) software was then utilized to identify links between alcoholism, gut microbiome derived metabolites, and their role in behavior alterations. Overall, this metaanalysis reviews information available on the connection between alcohol induced gut microbiome dysbiosis and the resulting behavioral impact.

AB  - Costus afer (C. afer) is a plant commonly known as ginger lily, spiral ginger, or bush cane. It is reportedly used in traditional medicine practice (TMP) to treat and manage many ailments including diabetes mellitus, stomach ache, arthritis, inflammation, and gout. These purported ethnomedicinal uses have triggered many research studies on the plant to amass scientific evidence. However, these research reports are scattered, and thus, this systematic review seeks to provide a comprehensive update on it covering its traditional uses, phytochemical and nutritional constituents, pharmacological activities, and toxicological effects. An online search was done using search engines such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect from the period 1970 to 2019. The online search included the use of keywords, "Costus afer Ker-Gawl" or "Costus afer." The search revealed that the stem and leaves of the plant contain substantial amounts of micronutrients and macronutrients. The leaves, stem, rhizomes, and roots of C. afer contain several steroidal sapogenins, aferosides, dioscin, and paryphyllin C and flavonoid glycoside kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside. Experimental studies on various parts of the plant showed bioactivities such as antihyperglycemic, hepatocellular protection, cardioprotection, nephroprotection, testicular protection, CNS depressant, analgesic, antiarthritis, antibacterial, and antioxidant. Based on these evident data, it is concluded that the plant could be used as an alternative and complementary therapy for many oxidative stress-related diseases, provided further scientific studies on the toxicological and pharmacological aspects are carried out.

AB  - The uneven distribution of mental health resources contributes to the burden of mental disorders in vulnerable groups, especially in developing countries. Internet-based interventions and digital technologies can contribute to reducing the gap between high prevalence of mental disorders, demand for treatment, and access to mental health care, thereby reducing inequities in mental health. This mini review summarizes the current state of the field of e-mental health research in Chile, showing its progress, limitations, and challenges. Internet-based interventions are at an early stage of development in Chile. The interventions included are heterogeneous in terms of participants (e.g., secondary students, patients, healthcare professionals) and contexts (e.g., rural, urban, schools, primary health care), aims, and modalities (e.g., website, online games). While these studies confirmed the feasibility of Internet-based interventions, the shortage of studies on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness makes it difficult to disseminate and scale up these Internet-based programs. However, the growing amount of knowledge accumulated in the Chilean context could guide practices in other developing countries for supporting the mental health of underserved populations.

AB  - Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) is challenging to treat, and fewer treatments are available for depressive episodes compared to mania. Light therapy is an evidence-based nonpharmacological treatment for seasonal and nonseasonal major depression, but fewer studies have examined its efficacy for patients with BD. Hence, we reviewed the evidence for adjunctive light therapy as a treatment for bipolar depression. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of databases from inception to June 30, 2019, for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of light therapy in patients with BD (CRD42019128996). The primary outcome was change in clinician-rated depressive symptom score; secondary outcomes included clinical response, remission, acceptability, and treatment-emergent mood switches. We quantitatively pooled outcomes using meta-analysis with random-effects models. Results: We identified seven trials representing 259 patients with BD. Light therapy was associated with a significant improvement in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (standardized mean difference = 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 0.82, P = 0.03). There was also a significant difference in favor of light therapy for clinical response (odds ratio [OR] = 2.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.81; P = 0.024) but not for remission. There was no difference in affective switches between active light and control conditions (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.38 to 4.44; P = 0.67). Study limitations included different light treatment parameters, small sample sizes, short treatment durations, and variable quality across trials. Conclusion: There is positive but nonconclusive evidence that adjunctive light therapy reduces symptoms of bipolar depression and increases clinical response. Light therapy is well tolerated with no increased risk of affective switch.

AB  - Short-chain chlorinated paraffin (SCCP) pollution has become a global threat. Much attention has been paid to their environmental occurrence and toxicity. In this review, we summarized the wide distribution of SCCPs in various environmental matrices and biota, including human be ings.Toxicokinetics and the toxicities of SCCPs, including lethality, hepatotoxicity, developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity, endocrine- and metabolism-disrupting effects, and immunomodulatory effects have been considered. The mechanisms of SCCP toxicity are mainly related to oxidative stress, metabolic disturbance, endocrine disruption and binding to biomacromolecules. In the future, further studies of SCCPs should focus on searching for their novel toxicity targets, and uncovering their toxic effects using transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and mutigenerational toxicity.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental disorder associated with significant distress and reduced functioning. Its occurrence after a severe traumatic event and association with characteristic neurobiological changes make PTSD a good candidate for pharmacological prevention and early treatment. The primary aim for this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether pharmacological interventions when compared to placebo, or other pharmacological/psychosocial interventions resulted in a clinically significant reduction or prevention of symptoms, improved functioning or quality of life, presence of disorder, or adverse effects. A systematic search was undertaken to identify RCTs, which used early pharmacotherapy (within three months of a traumatic event) to prevent and treat PTSD and acute stress disorder (ASD) in children and adults. Using Cochrane Collaboration methodology, RCTs were identified and rated for risk of bias. Available data was pooled to calculate risk ratios (RR) for PTSD prevalence and standardised mean differences (SMD) for PTSD severity. 19 RCTs met the inclusion criteria; 16 studies with adult participants and three with children. The methodological quality of most trials was low. Only hydrocortisone in adults was found to be superior to placebo (3 studies, n = 88, RR: 0.21 (CI 0.05 to 0.89)) although this was in populations with severe physical illness, raising concerns about generalisability. No significant effects were found for the other pharmacotherapies investigated (propranolol, oxytocin, gabapentin, fish oil (1470 mg DHA/147 mg EPA), fish oil (224 mg DHA/22.4 mg EPA), dexamethasone, escitalopram, imipramine and chloral hydrate). Hydrocortisone shows the most promise, of pharmacotherapies subjected to RCTs, as an emerging intervention in the prevention of PTSD within three months after trauma and should be a target for further investigation. The limited evidence for hydrocortisone and its adverse effects mean it cannot be recommended for routine use, but, it could be considered as a preventative intervention for people with severe physical illness or injury, shortly after a traumatic event, as long as there are no contraindications. More research is needed using larger, high quality RCTs to establish the most efficacious use of hydrocortisone in different populations and optimal dosing, dosing window and route. There is currently a lack of evidence to suggest that other pharmacological agents are likely to be effective.

AB  - Purpose The term "Mental health literacy" is defined as knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management or prevention. The importance of health literacy for physical health is widely studied; however, the area of mental health literacy in Pakistan has been comparatively neglected. The purpose of this paper is to address the knowledge about mental health in people living in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach Relevant literature relating to mental health literacy was identified through various database searches. The databases searched included: PubMed, Cochrane database of Systemic Reviews, PsycINFO using the terms mental health, mental health literacy, mental health education, Pakistan. Findings Literature suggests that there is dearth of knowledge about mental illnesses and their treatment among public. This review also highlights the importance of mental health literacy among professionals working in the field of health care. In Pakistan, due to low literacy rate, a high percentage of poverty and dearth of trained professionals warrants an emendation in approaches established for attaining the goal of public health and psychiatric care. Practical implications - Findings have implications for practitioners in the field of mental health care as well as designing targeted interventions for enhancing mental health literacy and help-seeking behavior in the future. Originality/value A limited understanding and lack of improvement in mental health literacy may interfere with society's acceptance of evidence-based mental health care which may hamper the delivery of adequate mental health services to the needy.

AB  - Drugs with anticholinergic action are widely prescribed in the elderly population due to their potential clinical benefits. However, these benefits are limited by adverse effects which may be serious in particular circumstances. This review presents different aspects of the use of anticholinergics in old age with a focus in psychogeriatric patients. We critically review published data on benefits and disadvantages of anticholinergics, which are often controversial. Prevalence, pathophysiology and measurement methods of the anticholinergic action of drugs are discussed. We also present the most important drawbacks resulting from its use, including effects on cognition in healthy and cognitively impaired people, in aged schizophrenia patients, emergence of delirium and psychiatric symptoms, influence in functionality, hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality, and the potential benefits and limitations of their discontinuation. Finally, we suggest practical recommendations for the safe use of anticholinergics in clinical conditions affecting elderly patients, such as dementia, schizophrenia and acute hallucinatory episodes, depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular conditions and urinary incontinence.

Methods We searched for and included any publication detailing dementia research in the UK that included any ethnic minority. The search results and all titles and abstracts were screened according to the inclusion criteria followed by screening of the full texts. We extracted data regarding the recruitment and methodological issues faced by the researchers. This data was combined and listed, and related issues were grouped into overarching themes and subthemes. Results Of 52 publications suitable for analysis, 33 provided data collated into six themes: attitudes and beliefs about dementia in ethnic minority communities, recruitment process, data collection issues, practical issues, researcher characteristics, and lack of published research and normative data. These themes allowed us to identify three areas responsible for addressing these recruitment and methodological issues: community and patient education, health services, and researchers' training. Conclusions This is the first review identifying recruitment and methodological issues within UK dementia research that included ethnic minorities. We now have a compilation of reported existing issues and a framework of areas responsible for addressing them and devising solutions.

AB  - Purpose Social capital has been studied as a risk factor for psychotic disorders. The purpose of this scoping review was to scope the literature and synthesize findings on the association between social capital and psychosis. Methods Three electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Studies were included if they examined the association between social capital and either diagnosed psychotic disorders or symptoms of psychosis. Results Of 191 studies reviewed, 12 met the inclusion criteria. Ten studies measured social capital at the ecological level. Seven studies focused on risk of psychotic disorders or symptoms of psychosis, three studies focused on course of psychotic illness, and two studies focused on both risk and course of illness. A variety of social capital measures were used including scales, surveys, and census-based measures. The association between social capital and both the incidence of psychosis and patterns of service use varied based on measures used and study population. There was no association between social capital and recovery or duration of untreated illness. Conclusions Prior literature has examined the impact of social capital on the incidence of psychotic disorders, as well as symptoms and course of illness. Based on the scant literature to date, it is difficult to make firm conclusions regarding the role of social capital in psychotic disorders. Heterogeneous measures of social capital make comparisons between studies challenging. Further specificity in measuring and defining dimensions of social capital is required for meaningful study of social capital and its association with psychotic disorders.

AB  - Background: The vast majority of older people with mental illness prefer to live independently in their own homes. Barriers caused by the health care system often prevent adequate, adapted treatments. With regard to the increasing ageing of the population, the determination of effective, age-appropriate service models for elderly patients with mental illness is clearly required. The aim of this review is to examine and to evaluate multidisciplinary psychogeriatric treatment models that include home visits, particularly with regard to the effects on psychiatric symptoms, social and mental health rehabilitation and quality of life.
   Methods: A systematic review was carried out of empirical studies with participants who were diagnosed with a mental illness according to ICD-10, aged 60 years or older, and who were living at home. The inclusion criteria comprised a duration of intervention of at least 12 weeks and a minimum of two interventions and domiciliary visits delivered by a multidisciplinary team. The online databases Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar, as well as hand search, were used to search for relevant studies published between 1996 and 2016. An additional search was performed for studies published between 2016 and 2019. After removing duplicates, abstracts were screened and the remaining articles were included for full-text review.
   Results: Of the 3536 records discovered in total, 260 abstracts appeared to be potentially eligible. Of these, 30 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. For the additional search 415 records and abstracts were screened and 11 articles were read full text. Finally, only three studies fully met the inclusion criteria for this review. The results indicate that psychogeriatric home treatment is associated with significant improvements of psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial problems, fewer admissions to hospital and nursing homes, as well as lower costs of care.
   Conclusions: Psychogeriatric home treatment has positive effects on older people with mental illness. However, these findings are based upon a small number of studies. The need for further research, especially to specify the effective factors in psychogeriatric home treatment, is clearly indicated.

AB  - Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers such as amyloid, p-tau and neuronal injury markers have been associated with affective symptoms in cognitively impaired individuals, but results are conflicting.
   Methods: CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO and PubMed were searched for studies evaluating AD biomarkers with affective symptoms in mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. Studies were classified according to AT(N) research criteria.
   Result: Forty-five abstracts fulfilled eligibility criteria, including in total 8,293 patients (41 cross-sectional studies and 7 longitudinal studies). Depression and night-time behaviour disturbances were not related to AT(N) markers. Apathy was associated with A markers (PET, not CSF). Mixed findings were reported for the association between apathy and T(N) markers; anxiety and AT(N) markers; and between agitation and irritability and A markers. Agitation and irritability were not associated with T(N) markers.
   Discussion: Whereas some AD biomarkers showed to be associated with affective symptoms in AD, most evidence was inconsistent. This is likely due to differences in study design or heterogeneity in affective symptoms. Directions for future research are given.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a key player in both chronic and acute brain disease due to the higher metabolic demand of the brain. Among the producers of free radicals, NADPH-oxidase (NOX) is a major contributor to oxidative stress in neurological disorders. In the brain, the superoxide produced by NOX is mainly found in leukocytes. However, recent studies have reported that it can be found in several other cell types. NOX has been reported to regulate neuronal signaling, memory processing, and central cardiovascular homeostasis. However, overproduction of NOX can contribute to neurotoxicity, CNS degeneration, and cardiovascular disorders. Regarding the above functions, NOX has been shown to play a crucial role in chronic CNS diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and in acute CNS disorders such as stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and related cerebrovascular diseases. NOX is a multi-subunit complex consisting of two membrane-associated and four cytosolic subunits. Thus, in recent years, inhibition of NOX activity has drawn a great deal of attention from researchers in the field of treating chronic and acute CNS disorders and preventing secondary complications. Mounting evidence has shown that NOX inhibition is neuroprotective and that inhibiting NOX in circulating immune cells can improve neurological disease conditions. This review summarizes recent studies on the therapeutic effects and pharmacological strategies regarding NOX inhibitors in chronic and acute brain diseases and focuses on the hurdles that should be overcome before their clinical implementation.

AB  - Objectives: We review studies of whether cortisol levels following psychosocial stress exposure differ between patients with psychosis and healthy control subjects.
   Methods: Original research published between 1993 and February 2019 was included in the literature search. Studies that used experimentally induced psychosocial stress and reported stress response measures of plasma or saliva cortisol levels in patients at any stage of illness (i.e. high risk, first episode and chronic phase) were included.
   Results: A total of 17 studies were included. Although there was evidence of inconsistencies in measures, we observed moderate evidence of an association with stress-induced cortisol blunting response across studies.
   Conclusions: This review highlights recent evidence of blunting of cortisol response following experimentally induced psychosocial stress. While there was some evidence of this blunted response across illness types and stages, the strongest evidence was observed for those with chronic schizophrenia. Due to the low number of studies, in particular in bipolar disorder, much work is still needed to accurately characterise the biological effects of stress in psychosis.

AB  - Guilt appeals in the field of persuasion are quite common. However, the effectiveness of these messages is sometimes ambivalent. It is widely acknowledged that guilt leads people to engage into prosocial behaviors, but the effects of guilt can also be counter-productive (e.g., reactance-like effects). We argue that the explanations for these contradictions remain unsatisfactory and suggest that taking into account the implications of underlying cognitive-especially attentional-mechanisms would provide a better understanding of these paradoxical outcomes. This article provides a brief review of the literature on the link between guilt and pro-social behaviors and its classical interpretations. We propose a reinterpretation of this link by taking into account specific attentional processes triggered by the emotion of guilt. Attentional biases are, in our opinion, better predictors of the effectiveness of a message than the amount of emotion induced by the same message. This consideration should guide future research in the field of guilt appeals and pro-social behaviors. Implications, in terms of a broader comprehension of the emotion-behavior association in decision making processes, are discussed.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Bipolar spectrum disorder (BSD) is an extended concept of bipolar disorder (BD) that includes conditions that do not fulfill the criteria. There is no recommendation today about its treatment. We reviewed relevant literature focusing on pharmacological treatments, looking for high-strength evidence leading to guidelines.
   Methodology: A literature search was conducted using MedLine / PubMed database and Google Scholar up to September 2018. Search words were related to BSD and pharmacological treatment.
   Results: The literature search yielded 621 articles. Out of these, 35 articles met our selection criteria. There was limited high quality data. Only one randomized control trial (RCT) and one randomized open label trial were found. Most studies used different definition of BSD.
   Conclusions: There is a considerable lack of data and no evidence supporting efficacy of pharmacological treatment for BSD. There is a need for a consensus on the definition of BSD and more evidence studies to evaluate drug's effectiveness in this condition.

AB  - There is a growing interest in developing resilience-building programs in the work context. Yet the resilience literature provides no clear answer about what constitutes such a prop am. The aim of this article is to shed light on this question by presenting a set of criteria for resilience-building programs. We developed these criteria by systematically reviewing studies that synthesized the evidence about the definition, conceptualization, measurement, and enhancement of psychological resilience. A literature search in peer-review journals published between 2009 and 2018 using PsycINFO resulted in 286 hits. Twenty-one studies met our inclusion criteria. In addition, we consulted 3 handbooks on resilience. The result of our review is a checklist of 12 criteria for resilience-building programs to improve program consistency and quality. These criteria address the necessity to: specify which working population is in need of psychological resilience; cite which definition is being used; display and explain the process that people go through in order to adapt to adversity; describe how resilience will be measured and enhanced as a dynamic process, as well as say which type of positive adaptation-to which adversity, in which work context, and when-is involved; and make clear the starting point and purpose of the work. These criteria can be regarded as a valuable navigation tool in the complex field of resilience: Program developers can use them to optimize the content of resilience-building programs and to ensure that relevant information is reported; reviewers of resilience-building programs can use them to analyze, evaluate, and compare programs. Therefore, the checklist could become an indispensable tool for both researchers and practitioners to improve designing, describing, and reviewing resilience-building programs at work.

AB  - Perinatal anxiety and depression are common and associated with negative outcomes if left untreated. Internet-delivered treatments can improve treatment accessibility and have demonstrated effectiveness in treating anxiety and depression in the general adult population. However, little is known about how effective and acceptable these interventions are for perinatal women. This paper describes a systematic review and preliminary meta-analysis of internet-delivered psychological interventions for the treatment of clinical anxiety and depression in perinatal women. A systematic search was carried out of seven electronic databases. Seven studies evaluating six distinct internet-delivered psychological interventions were identified. Of the seven studies included, two were open trials and five were randomized controlled trials with a total of 595 participants. Preliminary findings indicate large improvements in depression (Hedges g = 1.67; 95% CI 1.38-1.96) and anxiety (Hedges g = 1.08; 95% CI 0.80-1.36) from pre- to post-treatment. However, between-group differences between interventions and control conditions were only moderate for depression (Hedges g = 0.60; 95% CI 0.43-0.78) and anxiety (Hedges g = 0.54; 95% CI 0.24-0.85). While our preliminary findings are promising, this review identifies an area of research still in its early stages with significant gaps in the literature that need to be addressed. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy and acceptability of these interventions in this population, especially for antenatal depression and anxiety disorders.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic disease characterized by a progressive decline in mental abilities and quality of life alongside behavioral abnormalities associated with high economic burden. The purpose of this study was to investigate epidemiology and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease in Iran.
   Methods: In this systematic review study, both Persian and English-language databases including Medlin . e, Google Scholar, PubMed, web of science and Magiran were searched using following keywords: epidemiology, Alzheimer, dementia and Iran without time limit up to 2017. Thirty articles abstract out of 50 studies related to this topics, were reviewed. Of which 12 full text entered into the quality assessment process and finally, four articles were selected for inclusion in this study and their results was extracted.
   Results: The total sample size of the 4 selected studies was 2781. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the current study was estimated to be 2.3% in the population of 67-78 years old. Age, genetics, depression and hypertension were determined as the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, while daily listening to music, meeting weekly with friends and daily intake of vitamin E were considered as the factors with protective role in this disease.
   Conclusion: Alzheimer's disease is one of the main causes of functional dependence and mortality in the elderly people. Lifestyle changes and multiple mental activities in elderly increases the cognitive ability of these population, which will reduce direct and indirect costs of this disease.

AB  - The association between chronic psychological stress and uterine fibroids (UFs) risk remains unclear. In this study, a meta-analysis of observational studies was performed to explore the reported association between them. A literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify relevant published articles. A random-effect model was used to examine pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, subgroup analyses and two-stage random-effect dose-response meta-analysis were performed. A total of six articles with seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. For the highest versus lowest category of chronic psychological stress, the pooled OR was 1.24 (95% CI [1.15, 1.34]; p = .000). Through subgroup analyses, we found a positive association between chronic psychological stress and UFs risk especially in non-Hispanic Blacks studies (OR, 1.24, 95% CI [1.14, 1.34], p = .000). When evaluating for a dose-response, we found a weak correlation between chronic psychological stress and UFs risk, especially for the severe (OR, 1.17, 95% CI [1.07, 1.29]) and very severe (OR, 1.23, 95% CI [1.07, 1.41]) categories. Our meta-analysis shows a statistically significant association between chronic psychological stress and UFs risk particularly for non-Hispanic Blacks. Interventions aiming to reduce chronic psychological stress may be useful to decrease the prevalence of UFs.

AB  - Background: Anxious personality characteristics form a risk factor for anxiety disorders. A proposed mechanistic pathway is that anxious personality could lead to greater vulnerability by increasing fear generalization. Here, we investigate if there is evidence for this relationship before the onset of pathological anxiety, with a metaanalysis in healthy subjects.
   Methods: Our search (anxious personality & fear generalization) was performed in PubMed, PsychInfo, and Embase and via snowballing.
   Results: In total, 4892 studies were screened and 19 studies (1348 participants) were included in the current review (meta-analysis: 18 studies, 1310 participants). The meta-analysis showed a significant, small, positive relationship between anxious personality and fear generalization (r g .19, 95%CI [.126, .260], p < .001). No moderators of the relationship were identified.
   Conclusions: The identified robust relation suggests that people who score high on anxious personality have a somewhat stronger tendency to generalize fear to safe or novel situations. This might explain their vulnerability to anxiety disorders mechanistically, yet future (prospective) studies are warranted to confirm the hypothesized directionality of this effect.

AB  - Different alternative forms of therapy have been studied in relation to their applicability and effectiveness. The use of art therapy in the treatment of depressive disorder is an example frequently employed in several countries. The aim of this research was to identify and discuss which artistic techniques have been applied most frequently in the treatment of depressive disorders and what their main effects are. The research was conducted in the MEDLINE/PubMed, American Psychological Association (APA) and Web of Science databases. The articles were selected through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA protocol). 14 articles were selected, among which the main techniques of art therapy used were: manual work (drawing, painting, and modeling), music, poetry, photography, theater and contemplation of art pieces. It was found that most of the researches are European and as a field of knowledge they depart mainly from medicine. Of the 14 researches of this review, only two failed in the use of art therapy techniques as a therapeutic tool. It can be understood that art therapy is a safe and reliable tool for treatment not only of depression but also of other mental disorders.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychological disorder, which could be caused by traumatic events. The prevalence of PTSD among survivors after a typhoon or hurricane varied widely. Therefore, this study aimed to determine a combined prevalence of PTSD among survivors after a typhoon or hurricane. A systematic search of literature was performed in the 3 English databases: PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), ISI Web of Science (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY), and Embase (Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Also, a similar search was performed in the 2 Chinese databases such as Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang. Loney et al.'s criteria were used to evaluate the quality of the selected articles for this study. The combined prevalence of PTSD among the study population was estimated using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation method. Subgroup analyses and a meta-regression analysis were carried out to explore the origin of heterogeneity. Thirty-nine eligible articles were included in this study. They comprised 43 123 typhoon and hurricane survivors of which 9373 were diagnosed with PTSD. The combined prevalence of PTSD among this population was 17.81%. Subgroup analyses revealed that the combined prevalence of PTSD related to typhoon and hurricane Categories 5, 4, and 2 showing a corresponding decreasing tendency. About 18% of people who experienced a severe typhoon or hurricane develop PTSD with the prevalence decreasing with reduced severity of the typhoon or hurricane.

AB  - To review the prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults after moderate to severe TBI. A systematic literature search was conducted on literature published up to December 2018 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and PsychInfo. A systematic review of the identified literature was based on PRISMA guidelines. Risk of Bias was evaluated based on the aspects of Risk of Bias assessment described by the Agency of Health Research and Quality. Seven studies were deemed eligible and information on the prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults (age 13-35) after moderate to severe TBI was extracted. Depression was assessed at 12 months (n = 2), >12 months (n = 2) or at varying times (n = 3) after TBI. The identified studies reported a prevalence proportion of depression from 1.6% to 60%. The Risk of Bias assessment showed a range of study quality with the selection of subjects and analysis of attrition being problematic. Although literature is sparse and of varying quality, depression was found to be common among adolescents and young adults with moderate to severe TBI which implies a need to focus on depression in the rehabilitation process and calls for further research.

AB  - Despite the large body of empirical and theoretical work that has emerged from positive psychology in the recent decades, surprisingly little work has been done by this field on joy. As a result, the work that has been done on joy is disjointed, and frequently does not build on the previous literature; indeed, the various definitions of joy that psychologists use often conflict with one another. The present article, therefore, seeks to address this gap in the positive psychology literature and provide suggestions for future directions, by placing the existing psychological work on joy in dialogue with itself and also in dialogue with the work on joy done in other fields, including, theology and religious studies, philosophy, and literature. The first part of this paper provides a systematic review of the existing work on joy and aims to develop an overarching framework that can be used to operationalize and define joy. This paper will then provide some suggestions for future directions for psychological research into joy, and will close by suggesting reasons why joy is an important phenomenon toward which positive psychology should turn its focus.

AB  - Background: Depressive disorders are significantly more common in the medically ill compared to the general population. Depression is associated with worsening of physical symptoms, greater healthcare utilization and poorer treatment adherence. The present paper provides a critical review on the assessment and management of depression in the medically ill.
   Methods: Relevant articles pertaining to depression in the medically ill were identified, reviewed and synthesized qualitatively. A systematic review was not performed due to the large breadth of this topic, making a meaningful summary of all published and unpublished studies not feasible. Notable studies were reviewed and synthesized by a diverse set of experts to provide a balanced summary.
   Results: Depression is frequently under-recognized in medical settings. Differential diagnoses include delirium, personality disorders and depressive disorders secondary to substances, medications or another medical condition. Depressive symptoms in the context of an adjustment disorder should be initially managed by supportive psychological approaches. Once a mild to moderate major depressive episode is identified, a stepped care approach should be implemented, starting with general psychoeducation, psychosocial interventions and ongoing monitoring. For moderate to severe symptoms, or mild symptoms that are not responding to low-intensity interventions, the use of antidepressants or higher intensity psychotherapeutic interventions should be considered. Psychotherapeutic interventions have demonstrated benefits with small to moderate effect sizes. Antidepressant medications have also demonstrated benefits with moderate effect sizes; however, special caution is needed in evaluating side effects, drug-drug interactions as well as dose adjustments due to impairment in hepatic metabolism and/or renal clearance. Novel interventions for the treatment of depression and other illness-related psychological symptoms (e.g. death anxiety, loss of dignity) are under investigation.
   Limitations: Non-systematic review of the literature.
   Conclusion: Replicated evidence has demonstrated a bidirectional interaction between depression and medical illness. Screening and stepped care using pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is merited.

AB  - Tachykinins (TKs) are ancient neuropeptides present throughout the bilaterians and are, with some exceptions, characterized by a conserved FX(1)GX(2)Ramide carboxy terminus among protostomes and FXGLMamide in deuterostomes. The best-known TK is the vertebrate substance P, which in mammals, together with other TKs, has been implicated in health and disease with important roles in pain, inflammation, cancer, depressive disorder, immune system, gut function, hematopoiesis, sensory processing, and hormone regulation. The invertebrate TKs are also known to have multiple functions in the central nervous system and intestine and these have been investigated in more detail in the fly Drosophila and some other arthropods. Here, we review the protostome and deuterostome organization and evolution of TK precursors, peptides and their receptors, as well as their functions, which appear to be partly conserved across Bilateria. We also outline the distribution of TKs in the brains of representative organisms. In Drosophila, recent studies have revealed roles of TKs in early olfactory processing, neuromodulation in circuits controlling locomotion and food search, nociception, aggression, metabolic stress, and hormone release. TK signaling also regulates lipid metabolism in the Drosophila intestine. In crustaceans, TK is an important neuromodulator in rhythm-generating motor circuits in the stomatogastric nervous system and a presynaptic modulator of photoreceptor cells. Several additional functional roles of invertebrate TKs can be inferred from their distribution in various brain circuits. In addition, there are a few interesting cases where invertebrate TKs are injected into prey animals as vasodilators from salivary glands or paralyzing agents from venom glands. In these cases, the peptides are produced in the glands of the predator with sequences mimicking the prey TKs. Lastly, the TK-signaling system appears to have duplicated in Panarthropoda (comprising arthropods, onychophores, and tardigrades) to give rise to a novel type of peptides, natalisins, with a distinct receptor. The distribution and functions of natalisins are distinct from the TKs. In general, it appears that TKs are widely distributed and act in circuits at short range as neuromodulators or cotransmitters.

AB  - Purpose Subjective and objective social isolation are important factors contributing to both physical and mental health problems, including premature mortality and depression. This systematic review evaluated the current evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to improve subjective and/or objective social isolation for people with mental health problems. Primary outcomes of interest included loneliness, perceived social support, and objective social isolation. Methods Three databases were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Studies were included if they evaluated interventions for people with mental health problems and had objective and/or subjective social isolation (including loneliness) as their primary outcome, or as one of a number of outcomes with none identified as primary. Results In total, 30 RCTs met the review's inclusion criteria: 15 included subjective social isolation as an outcome and 11 included objective social isolation. The remaining four evaluated both outcomes. There was considerable variability between trials in types of intervention and participants' characteristics. Significant results were reported in a minority of trials, but methodological limitations, such as small sample size, restricted conclusions from many studies. Conclusion The evidence is not yet strong enough to make specific recommendations for practice. Preliminary evidence suggests that promising interventions may include cognitive modification for subjective social isolation, and interventions with mixed strategies and supported socialisation for objective social isolation. We highlight the need for more thorough, theory-driven intervention development and for well-designed and adequately powered RCTs.

Methods OVID, Scopus, EBSCO Collections, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant publications published between January 1950 and May 2018 and a total of 188 potentially eligible studies were identified. Results Following review, 16 primary studies were eligible for inclusion. Antidepressant exposure was associated with an increased risk of lower gestational age, preterm birth, but not low birthweight or being small for gestational age compared to untreated depression. There is some evidence that congenital defects are associated with antidepressant use, particularly between cardiac defects and paroxetine use. There is conflicting evidence regarding neurodevelopment in offspring, with some reports of increased incidence of autistic spectrum disorders and depression, but also reports of no problems when measuring emotional symptoms, peer problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity-inattention scores. Conclusion When compared with an untreated depressed group, antidepressant exposure was associated with adverse outcomes at birth, while there is insufficient data to determine whether the association between antidepressants and congenital defects or developmental disorders is a true association. However, although we compared treated vs. untreated depression there still may be residual confounding as an untreated depressed group is likely to have less severe depression.

AB  - The metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises abdominal obesity, preclinical or full diabetes type 2, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidemia and affects a significant proportion of the general population with a remarkably higher prevalence in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. However, studies exploring the pathogenetic link between MetS and psychiatric diseases are rare. Here, we aim to narrow this gap in knowledge by providing a narrative review on this topic that focuses on two psychiatric diseases, namely on schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since we assume them to be associated with two different main causalities of MetS: in schizophrenia, MetS evidently develops or aggravates in response to antipsychotic drug treatment while it assumingly develops in response to stress-induced endocrine and/or epigenetic alterations in PTSD. First, we compared the prevalences of MetS and associated pathologies (which we took from the latest meta-analyses) among different psychiatric disorders and were surprised that the prevalences of arterial hypertension and hyperglycemia in PTSD almost doubles those of the other psychiatric disorders. Next, we performed a literature search on the neurobiology of MetS and found numerous articles describing a role for proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in MetS. Thus, we concentrated further analysis on POMC and one of its downstream effector hormones, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). We found some evidence for a role of POMC in both PTSD and schizophrenia, in particular in antipsychotic-induced MetS, as well as for alpha-MSH in schizophrenia, but, surprisingly, no study on alpha-MSH in PTSD. Taken together, our synopsis reveals, first, a potential interaction between the POMC system and stress in the assumingly at least partially shared pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders and MetS, second, that modulation of the POMC system, in particular of the melanocortin 3 and 4 receptors, might be a promising target for the treatment of MetS and, third, that the DNA methylation status of POMC might speculatively be a promising biomarker for MetS in general and, possibly, in particular in the context of stress-related psychiatric conditions such as PTSD. To best of our knowledge, this is the first review on the role of the POMC system in MetS in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background Youth often experience unique pathways into homelessness, such as family conflict, child abuse and neglect. Most research has focused on adult homeless populations, yet youth have specific needs that require adapted interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on interventions for youth and assess their impacts on health, social, and equity outcomes. Methods We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and other databases from inception until February 9, 2018 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on youth interventions conducted in high income countries. We screened title and abstract and full text for inclusion, and data extraction were completed in duplicate, following the PRISMA-E (equity) review approach. Results Our search identified 11,936 records. Four systematic reviews and 18 articles on randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Many studies reported on interventions including individual and family therapies, skill-building, case management, and structural interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to improvements in depression and substance use, and studies of three family-based therapies reported decreases in substance use. Housing first, a structural intervention, led to improvements in housing stability. Many interventions showed inconsistent results compared to services as usual or other interventions, but often led to improvements over time in both the intervention and comparison group. The equity analysis showed that equity variables were inconsistently measured, but there was data to suggest differential outcomes based upon gender and ethnicity. Conclusions This review identified a variety of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. Promising interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy for addressing depression, family-based therapy for substance use outcomes, and housing programs for housing stability. Youth pathways are often unique and thus prevention and treatment may benefit from a tailored and flexible approach.

AB  - Background The use of computers/TV has become increasingly common worldwide after entering the twenty-first century and depression represents a growing public health burden. Understanding the association between screen time-based sedentary behavior (ST-SB) and the risk of depression is important to the development of prevention and intervention strategies. Methods We searched the electronic databases of Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. The odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was adopted as the pooled measurement. Subgroup analyses were investigated by stratified meta-analyses based on age, gender and reference group (reference category of screen time, e.g. 2 h/day, 4 h/day). Results There were 12 cross-sectional studies and 7 longitudinal studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the pooled OR was 1.28 with high heterogeneity (I-2 = 89%). Compared to those who reported less SB, persons reporting more SB had a significantly higher risk of depression. When the gender was stratified, the pooled OR was 1.18 in female groups while no significant association was observed in males. Among the 19 studies, 5 studies used a reference group with ST = 2 h/days (pooled OR = 1.46), 9 studies used >= 4 h as a reference group (pooled OR = 1.38), 2 studies used 1 h as a reference group (pooled OR = 1.07) and for the remaining 3 studies, hours of ST were calculated as a continuous variable (pooled OR = 1.04). Conclusions ST-SB is associated with depression risk and the effects vary in different populations. In addition, valid objective measures of SB should be developed in future studies.

AB  - Background Patients suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorders demonstrate various cognitive deficiencies, the most pertinent one being impairment in autobiographical memory. This paper reviews quantitative research investigating deficits in the content, and characteristics, of autobiographical memories in individuals with schizophrenia. It also examines if the method used to activate autobiographical memories influenced the results and which theoretical accounts were proposed to explain the defective recall of autobiographical memories in patients with schizophrenia. Methods PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were searched for articles published between January 1998 and December 2018. Fifty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies implemented the generative retrieval strategy by inducing memories through cue words or pictures, the life-stage method, or open-ended retrieval method. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement guidelines were followed for this review. Results Most studies reported that patients with schizophrenia retrieve less specific autobiographical memories when compared to a healthy control group, while only three studies indicated that both groups performed similarly on memory specificity. Patients with schizophrenia also exhibited earlier reminiscence bumps than those for healthy controls. The relationship between comorbid depression and autobiographical memory specificity appeared to be independent because patients' memory specificity improved through intervention, but their level of depression remained unchanged. The U-shaped retrieval pattern for memory specificity was not consistent. Both the connection between the history of attempted suicide and autobiographical memory specificity, and the relationship between psychotic symptoms and autobiographical memory specificity, remain inconclusive. Patients' memory specificity and coherence improved through cognitive training. Conclusions The overgeneral recall of autobiographical memory by patients with schizophrenia could be attributed to working memory, the disturbing concept of self, and the cuing method implemented. The earlier reminiscence bump for patients with schizophrenia may be explained by the premature closure of the identity formation process due to the emergence of psychotic symptoms during early adulthood. Protocol developed for this review was registered in PROSPERO (registration no: CRD42017062643).

AB  - Learning that certain cues or environments predict threat enhances survival by promoting appropriate fear and the resulting defensive responses. Adapting to changing stimulus contingencies by learning that such cues no longer predict threat, or distinguishing between these threat-related and other innocuous stimuli, also enhances survival by limiting fear responding in an appropriate manner to conserve resources. Importantly, a failure to inhibit fear in response to harmless stimuli is a feature of certain anxiety and trauma-related disorders, which are also associated with dysfunction of the neural circuitry underlying learned fear and its inhibition. Interestingly, these disorders are up to twice as common in women, compared to men. Despite this striking sex difference in disease prevalence, the neurobiological factors involved remain poorly understood. This is due in part to the majority of relevant preclinical studies having neglected to include female subjects alongside males, which has greatly hindered progress in this field. However, more recent studies have begun to redress this imbalance and emerging evidence indicates that there are significant sex differences in the inhibition of learned fear and associated neural circuit function. This paper provides a narrative review on sex differences in learned fear and its inhibition through extinction and discrimination, along with the key gonadal hormone and brain mechanisms involved. Understanding the endocrine and neural basis of sex differences in learned fear inhibition may lead to novel insights on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the enhanced vulnerability to develop anxiety-related disorders that are observed in women.

AB  - Background Identifying low-cost and easy to implement measures of infant markers of later psychopathology may improve targeting of early intervention for prevention. Because of their early manifestation, relative stability and overlap with constructs central to affect-based dimensions of child and adolescent psychopathology, negative emotionality and self-regulation have been the focus of this research. We conducted a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies examining the prospective association between infant temperament measured with parent ratings and child/adolescent psychopathology. Methods A systematic literature search for prospective longitudinal studies, which included measures of questionnaire-assessed infant temperament (negative emotionality, self-regulation, behavioural inhibition, surgency/extraversion, activity level) and symptoms of child or adolescent mental health (externalising, internalising) and neurodevelopmental problems (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD]), was conducted. Standardised estimates of association were calculated and pooled in meta-analyses. Results Twenty-five studies (n = 28,425) met inclusion criteria. Small associations were seen between psychopathology aggregated across all domains and infant negative emotionality (r = .15; p < .001) and self-regulation (r = -.19; p = .007). Effects were also significant but weaker for behavioural inhibition (r = .10; p = .027) and activity level (r = .08; p = .016). Surgency/extraversion was not significantly associated with psychopathology in general (r = -.04; p = .094); however, it was negatively associated with ASD (r = -.10, p = .015). Significant correlations were observed with some outcomes isomorphic with predictors, internalising problems and behavioural inhibition (r = .10; p = .013), ADHD symptoms and activity level (r = .19; p = .009). Conclusion Questionnaire-based assessments of infant negative emotionality may have transdiagnostic potential to contribute to a risk index of later childhood psychopathology. Behavioural inhibition, surgency/extraversion and activity ratings may provide more specific predictive power. More data from prospective studies are required before the potential of self-regulation and surgency/extraversion can be properly gauged.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this literature review was to highlight the studies on mental health in relation to acculturation and ethnic identity and to identify research gaps. The results can be used to help inform future immigrant mental health workers and policy makers as well as provide information about the implications of immigrant mental health. Methods: The literature search was conducted electronically, directed by a variety of key words. The search focused on five areas of immigrant mental health importance: (1) acculturation; (2) acculturation and mental health; (3) ethnic identity; (4) ethnic identity and mental health; and (5) acculturation, ethnic identity and mental health. A total of 171 articles were examined and 110 were included in the review. Results: The information is presented in the following categories: acculturation; acculturation and mental health; ethnic identity; ethnic identity and mental health; and acculturation, ethnic identity and mental health. Research gaps are also presented. Conclusion: Overall, literature shows that acculturation, ethnic identity and mental health are closely related to one another affecting both, individuals and communities. This literature review will help to better inform practitioners who may encounter immigrants experiencing mental health issues due to acculturation and ethnic identity pressure. This review may also help policy makers identify specific obstacles that are not addressed in immigration policies which can affect the implementation of these policies. In addition, the information presented can be used as an instrument for researchers in the field. Despite the limited amount of information about immigrant mental health challenges, much work remains to fully support the affected individuals and their families.

AB  - Reconsolidation is the return of a memory to a transient state of lability, following memory consolidation, that can occur when memories are evoked. During the process of reconsolidation, memories may be modified by different means, including the administration of drugs, during a period called the "reconsolidation window". This process has been widely studied in animals, but human studies are limited and include several methodological pitfalls. Our objective was to conducte a systematic review of the literature that utilizes pharmacological interventions during the process of reconsolidation of aversive memories in humans, with a critical analysis of the methodologies used. Searches were made in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and SciELO using the following search terms: (memory) AND (consolidation OR reconsolidation) AND (pharmacological manipulation OR pharmacological intervention). We found 294 references and ten (3.4%) were included in the review, based on preestablished eligibility criteria. All studies were randomized, double-blind clinical trials. The most commonly studied drug was propranolol. Two studies used a protocol involving autobiographical aversive memories, while in the remaining aversive memories were produced in the laboratory. The timing of pharmacological interventions is a controversial issue in the field, as drug activity must occur within the reconsolidation window. The small number of studies and some methodological difficulties of this type of research highlights the need for studies that individually evaluate some of the issues discussed, particularly the timing of pharmacological interventions and the duration of reconsolidation windows.

AB  - Childhood abuse is common among people with psychosis and it is associated with poor illness outcomes. Some forms of childhood abuse are more common in women, but the impact of gender and childhood abuse in psychosis has been little investigated and evidence has never been put into a congruent frame. Herein, we conducted a narrative review to assess the impact of gender and childhood abuse in psychosis. Research articles were identified (n = 44) using a comprehensive electronic search of PubMed, Web-of-Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases. Women appeared to be at greater risk of sexual abuse than men. Women with childhood abuse report more positive and mood symptoms, and more suicide attempts compared to men. In addition, women exposed to childhood abuse display an earlier age of onset compared to not exposed, but this association is not present in men. Conversely, men with childhood abuse show more negative symptoms, substance use and a poorer cognitive performance compared to women. It seems therefore confirmed that gender and childhood abuse may impact on the outcome of psychosis, since not all gender differences found in patients who had been abused in their childhood are accounted by the overall differences between men and women with psychosis.

AB  - Psychiatry has been at the forefront of advancing clinical transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) since the mid-1990s, shortly after the invention of modern TMS in 1985 by Barker. Clinical TMS for psychiatric applications is advancing rapidly, with novel methods and innovations for treating depression, as well as a new clinical indication in obsessive-compulsive disorder. This review summarizes the recent findings and peers into the near future of this fertile and rapidly changing field. It is possible that many, perhaps even most, psychiatrists will be incorporating some form of brain stimulation into their practice within the next decade. The author summarizes the reasons for this optimistic view.

AB  - Purpose Although excess risks particularly for a diagnosis of schizophrenia have been identified for ethnic minority people in England and other contexts, we sought to identify and synthesise up-to-date evidence (2018) for affective in addition to non-affective psychoses by specific ethnic groups in England. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis of ethnic differences in diagnosed incidence of psychoses in England, searching nine databases for reviews (citing relevant studies up to 2009) and an updated search in three databases for studies between 2010 and 2018. Studies from both searches were combined in meta-analyses allowing coverage of more specific ethnic groups than previously. Results We included 28 primary studies. Relative to the majority population, significantly higher risks of diagnosed schizophrenia were found in Black African (Relative risk, RR 5.72, 95% CI 3.87-8.46, n = 9); Black Caribbean (RR 5.20, 95% CI 4.33-6.24, n = 21); South Asian (RR 2.27, 95% CI 1.63-3.16, n = 14); White Other (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.59-3.14, n = 9); and Mixed Ethnicity people (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.32-3.80, n = 4). Significantly higher risks for diagnosed affective psychoses were also revealed: Black African (RR 4.07, 95% CI 2.27-7.28, n = 5); Black Caribbean (RR 2.91, 95% CI 1.78-4.74, n = 16); South Asian (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.07-2.72, n = 8); White Other (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.32-1.83, n = 5); Mixed Ethnicity (RR 6.16, 95% CI 3.99-9.52, n = 4). Conclusions The risk for a diagnosis of non-affective and affective psychoses is particularly elevated for Black ethnic groups, but is higher for all ethnic minority groups including those previously not assessed through meta-analyses (White Other, Mixed Ethnicity). This calls for further research on broader disadvantages affecting ethnic minority people.

AB  - Introduction Despite increasing numbers of persons living with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's-related dementias (AD/ADRD) in Asia, particularly in low-income countries (LIC) and middle-income countries (MIC), surprisingly little is known about the current state of the evidence for family caregiver interventions. The objectives of this scoping review were to: (1) describe the evidence for efficacy of family dementia-caregiver psychosocial interventions in Asian countries, (2) compare evidence across LIC, MIC, and high-income countries (HIC), and (3) characterise cultural adaptions to interventions developed outside Asia.
   Methods The inclusion criteria included: (1) conducted in Asia (2) included an intervention delivered to a family caregiver of a person living with AD/ADRD, (3) reported quantitative outcomes for the family caregiver and (4) published in a peer-reviewed journal with full text available in English.
   Results Thirty intervention trials were identified meeting inclusion criteria and all reported statistically significant (p<0.05) improvement in one or more caregiver outcomes. Interventions usually included multiple components. The most frequently reported outcomes (ie, by >= 20% of studies) were caregiver depression, burden, quality of life and self-efficacy. Overall, 26 (87%) of the studies were conducted in HIC in Asia, primarily in Hong Kong SAR-China and Taiwan, and only 4 (13%) in LIC and MIC in Asia. Seven studies (23%) used interventions developed in USA and several described cultural adaptations.
   Conclusion This scoping review found substantial evidence, particularly from high-income Asian countries, that a wide range of interventions improve AD/ADRD family caregiver outcomes. However, critical knowledge gaps exist, particularly for LIC and MIC in Asia, where the number of persons with dementia is numerically largest and projected to increase dramatically in coming decades. The field could also benefit from more detailed descriptions of the process and types of cultural adaptations to interventions.

AB  - There are significant disparities in access to mental health care. With the burgeoning of technologies for health, digital tools have been leveraged within mental health and psychosocial support programming (eMental health). A review of the literature was conducted to understand and identify how eMental health has been used in resource-limited settings in general. PubMed, Ovid Medline and Web of Science were searched. Six-hundred and thirty full-text articles were identified and assessed for eligibility; of those, 67 articles met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The most common mental health use cases were for depression (n = 25) and general mental health and well-being (n = 21). Roughly one-third used a website or Internet-enabled intervention (n = 23) and nearly one-third used an SMS intervention (n = 22). Technology was applied to enhance service delivery (n = 32), behavior change communication (n = 26) and data collection (n = 8), and specifically dealt with adherence (n = 7), ecological momentary assessments (n = 7), well-being promotion (n = 5), education (n = 8), telemedicine (n = 28), machine learning (n = 5) and games (n = 2). Emerging trends identified wearables, predictive analytics, robots and virtual reality as promising areas. eMental health interventions that leverage low-tech tools can introduce, strengthen and expand mental health and psychosocial support services and can be a starting point for future, advanced tools.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the existing literature on the association between prenatal stress and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring. Methods Based on a registered protocol, we searched several electronic databases for articles in accordance with a detailed search strategy. We performed this study following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Results Prenatal stress was significantly associated with an increased risk of both ASD (pooled OR 1.64 [95% CI 1.15-2.34]; I-2 = 90%; 15 articles) and ADHD (pooled OR 1.72 [95% CI 1.27-2.34]; I-2 = 85%; 12 articles). Conclusions This study suggests that prenatal stress may be associated with ASD and ADHD; however, several limitations in the reviewed literature should be noted including significant heterogeneity and there is a need for carefully controlled future studies in this area.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are regarded as the standard pharmacotherapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent studies indicate that neuroinflammation is associated with PTSD. We conducted a search of the literature to determine if SSRI efficacy is associated with a decrease in inflammation levels.
   METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify studies published from January 2000 to January 2019 that measured changes in inflammatory biomarkers before and after SSRI treatment in patients with PTSD.
   RESULTS: Four studies met the criteria for inclusion. In one study, SSRI use significantly reduced interleukein-1beta. An open trial of paroxetine found a significant decline in cortisol. In a third study, paroxetine treatment in patients with PTSD and depression showed no significant changes in cortisol. Finally, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with PTSD showed no significant changes in corticotropin-releasing factor, interleukin-6, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or insulin-like growth factor 1. Substance P was found to be decreased.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our review had mixed results regarding whether SSRI therapy for PTSD is associated with a reduction in inflammation. These findings may be due to the heterogeneity of PTSD. More randomized controlled trials are needed due to the potential benefits of SSRIs for reducing inflammation in patients with PTSD (as has been reported in depression studies).

AB  - Purpose: To scope the literature concerning irritability in Huntington's disease to determine whether or not irritability is a valid and meaningful construct within this population.
   Method: A scoping literature review was conducted based on findings from a search of five databases (Academic Search Ultimate, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science) in November 2018. From an initial return of 453 papers, 40 were found suitable for review.
   Results: Review of the 40 studies highlighted several aspects of irritability in people with HD which influence its validity as an independent construct in context of the disease. While various measures are used to assess irritability, a gold standard has yet to be identified and consequently irritability is assessed inconsistently across the literature. In addition, the results suggest that irritability may not reflect pathological disease processes in HD, but rather comprises a multidimensional construct which appears to be strongly associated with other psychological difficulties such as depression and anxiety.
   Conclusions: The current concept of irritability in people with HD continues to lack a general consensus in the clinical literature, in terms of both operationalisation and assessment. Consequently, further research is warranted in order to determine the extent to which irritability is a valid construct within the context of HD, including its associated behavioural, cognitive and affective dimensions.

AB  - Objective: To examine predictors associated with quality of life (QoL) in Brazilian medical students.
   Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, LILACS, and Google Scholar were searched for research articles in English or Portuguese published through August 2018. Observational studies that measured QoL with standard instruments were selected. Three instruments were used to evaluate QoL: the World Health Organization QoL questionnaires (WHOQOL-Bref and WHOQOL-100) and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Hedges' g was used to calculate effect sizes. A random-effects model was used in meta-analyses. PRISMA guidelines were followed.
   Results: The initial search retrieved 8,504 articles; 24 met the eligibility criteria for systematic review, and seven for meta-analyses of gender (n=3,402 students). Predictors of QoL such as gender, years of medical school(years of study), economic class, educational environment, academic efficacy, depression, burnout, resilience, empathic concern, sleep difficulties, chronic illness, body mass index, and leisure-time physical activity were identified in the systematic review. The most frequent predictors of QoL detected in Brazilian medical students were associated with gender and years of study.
   Conclusions: Female medical students had lower QoL scores in the physical health and psychological domains of WHOQOL-Bref compared to male students. Specific interventions should be designed for this group as appropriate.

AB  - Construction safety is critical in the success of a project. A considerable amount of effort has been placed on research and practice in order to reduce the potential risks on the construction site. Recent application of electroencephalogram (EEG) to construction research enables researchers to gain insight into construction workers' physical and mental status during construction tasks. By summarizing existing studies that involve EEG and construction safety, the literature review aims to provide practical suggestions for future research and on-site safety management. The literature search and inclusion process included eleven eligible studies. Comprehensive analysis was conducted based on primary and secondary measures. The primary measures considered the frequency bands of EEG and the channels for detecting electrical activity of the brain. The secondary measures that were involved with physical and mental status with respect to EEG signal variations as a result of task, working hour, and work conditions. Although the field of study that combines EEG measures with construction tasks is still emerging, it is worth continuous attention in the future, as relevant findings would be of great value to the safety management and risk control in the construction industry.

AB  - Objectives: Recent clinical studies and meta-analyses have reported the clinical effects of mindfulness-based interventions as a complementary treatment for patients with schizophrenia, but their possible efficacy in patients with first episode of psychosis (FEP) and in individuals with ultra-high risk (UHR) of transition to psychosis is less clear. Here, we investigated the current evidence on the usefulness of mindfulness-based interventions in these two populations. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the literature according to the PRISMA guidelines. Results: Among the 102 references retrieved, 9 responded to the inclusion criteria (8 in FEP patients and 1 in UHR individuals). In FEP patients, mindfulness interventions are well-tolerated and have a satisfactory level of adherence. The clinical benefits consist primarily of reduced anxiety and sadness and improved quality of life. None of the studies reported any increase in positive symptoms. Conclusion: Future sham-controlled studies with large sample sizes are needed to definitively conclude on the clinical interest of mindfulness-based interventions in FEP patients and UHR individuals as well as to understand their underlying mechanisms of action.

AB  - Background: Skin disease is a global public health problem that often has physiological, psychological and social impacts. However, it is not very clear how to adapt to these impacts, especially psychosocial adaptation of patients with skin disease.
   Methods: We searched EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO from 2009 to 2018. The following themes were extracted from the included articles: the concepts, related factors, and interventions for psychosocial adaptation of patients with skin disease. Two reviewers independently screened and analyzed.
   Results: From 2261 initial records, 69 studies were identified and analyzed. The concept of psychosocial adaptation in patients with skin disease was referred to under an assortment of descriptions. The related factors for psychosocial adaptation in patients with skin disease included the following: demographic factors (sex, age, education level, ethnicity, BMI, sleep quality, marital status, exercise amount, family history, the use of topical treatment only, personality and history of smoking); disease-related factors (disease severity, clinical symptoms, localization and duration); psychological factors (anxiety/depression, self-esteem, body image, stigma and suicidal ideation); and social factors (social support, social interaction, sexual life, economic burden and social acceptance). Despite being limited in quantity, several studies have clarified the benefits of adjuvant care in the form of cognitive behavioral training, educational training and self-help programs, all of which have become common methods for dealing with the psychosocial impacts.
   Conclusions: Based on the previous literatures, we constructed a protocol of care model for psychosocial adaptation in patients with skin disease. It not only provided the direction for developing new instruments that could assess psychosocial adaptation statue, but also a basis for helping patients adjust to changes in skin disease.

AB  - Perinatal mental illness affects 15% of women; however, only half of these women access treatment. Some women with untreated perinatal mental illness may continue to suffer with mental illness after the perinatal period. Evidence suggests that one barrier to accessing treatment is stigma. Forums may provide an acceptable place for women to converse about the stigmatised symptoms of maternal mental illness. Reducing stigma may increase treatment uptake. This study aimed to review and synthesise the qualitative research on maternal mental illness forums and stigma so that stigma can be addressed and treatment improved. A meta-synthesis was conducted to describe and interpret qualitative studies regarding forum use and maternal mental illness stigma. A systematic search of seven electronic databases and Google Scholar was performed. Additional references were collected through screening references of the identified studies. Five studies were identified that reported women's experiences of online forums for maternal mental illness and stigma. The synthesis identified four key themes: (1) a safe place to talk; (2) virtual support; (3) stigma and identity; and (4) repair of the mother identity. Stigma maybe reduced by forum discourse that reconceptualises what is to be a "good mother" and separates stigma and maternal identity. This synthesis provides a novel and more detailed framework for the stigma of maternal mental illness and forum use. This suggests forums may enable women to explore their dual identity and repair their maternal identity, and this may reduce stigma. Healthcare providers could discuss forum use with their clients.

AB  - Background: Cognitive biases refer to automatic attentional or interpretational tendencies, which result in individuals with addictive disorders to automatically attend to substance-related stimuli and those with anxiety disorders to attend to threatening stimuli. To date, several studies have examined the efficacy of cognitive bias modification, and meta-analytical studies have synthesized the evidence for overall efficacy. The clinical utility of cognitive bias modification interventions has previously been limited to the confines of a laboratory, but recent advances in Web technologies can change this.
   Objective: This scoping review aimed to determine the scope of Web-based cognitive bias interventions and highlight their effectiveness.
   Methods: Databases (PubMed and MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Central) were searched from inception to December 5, 2017. The following search terminologies were used: ("attention bias" OR "cognitive bias" OR "approach bias" OR "avoidance bias" OR "interpretative bias") AND ("Internet" OR "Web" OR "Online"). The methods for this scoping review are based on the previously published protocol. For the synthesis of the evidence, a narrative synthesis was undertaken, as a meta-analysis was not appropriate, given the lack of reported effect sizes and the heterogeneity in the outcomes reported.
   Results: Of the 2674 unique articles identified, we identified 22 randomized controlled studies that met our inclusion criteria: alcohol use disorder (n=2), tobacco use disorder (n=2), depressive disorder (n=3), anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents (n=3), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n=2), social anxiety disorder (n=9), and anxiety disorder (n=1). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 16 to 434 participants. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that Web-based interventions could reduce biases among adolescents with heightened symptoms of anxiety and depression and among individuals with OCD.
   Conclusions: This is the first scoping review that mapped out the scope of cognitive bias modification interventions for psychiatric disorders. Web-based interventions have been applied predominantly for social anxiety and addictive disorders. Larger cohorts must be used in future studies to better determine the effectiveness of Web-based cognitive bias interventions.

AB  - Background Burnout is a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, increased depersonalization, and a diminished sense of personal accomplishment due to chronic emotional stress at work. Burnout impacts job satisfaction, job performance, vulnerability to illnesses, and interpersonal relationships. There is a gap in the systematic data on the burden of burnout among healthcare professionals from different sectors of healthcare in Middle Eastern countries. Our objective was to examine the burden of burnout among healthcare providers in the Middle East, how it was assessed, which sectors were included, and what interventions have been used. Methods Articles were found through a systematic review of search results including PubMed, Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), and PsycINFO (EBSCO) using search terms reflecting burnout in Middle Eastern countries among populations of healthcare providers. Studies were included if they examined a quantitative measure of burnout among healthcare providers in the Middle East. Results There were 138 articles that met our inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Studies focused on burnout in the Middle East among physicians (N = 54 articles), nurses (N = 55), combined populations of healthcare workers (N = 22), and medical students (N = 7). The Maslach Burnout Inventory was the most common tool to measure burnout. Burnout is common among physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals, with prevalence estimates predominantly ranging between 40 and 60%. Burnout among healthcare providers in the Middle East is associated with characteristics of their work environments, exposure to violence and terror, and emotional distress and low social support. Conclusions Burnout is highly prevalent among healthcare providers across countries in the Middle East. Previous studies examining burnout in this region have limitations in their methodology. More thoroughly developed epidemiologic studies of burnout are necessary. Health system strengthening is needed in a region that has endured years of ongoing conflict, and there is an urgency to design and implement programs that tackle burnout among health professionals.

AB  - This paper updates guidelines for effective treatments of children with specific types of acquired brain injury (ABI) published in 2007 with more recent evidence. A systematic search was conducted for articles published from 2006 to 2017. Full manuscripts describing treatments of children (post-birth to 18) with acquired brain injury were included if study was published in peer-reviewed journals and written in English. Two independent reviewers and a third, if conflicts existed, evaluated the methodological quality of studies with an Individual Study Review Form and a Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist. Strength of study characteristics was used in development of practice guidelines. Fifty-six peer-reviewed articles, including 27 Class I studies, were included in the final analysis. Established guidelines for writing practice recommendations were used and 22 practice recommendations were written with details of potential treatment limitations. There was strong evidence for family/caregiver-focused interventions, as well as direct interventions to improve attention, memory, executive functioning, and emotional/behavioural functioning. A majority of the practice standards and guidelines provided evidence for the use of technology in delivery of interventions, representing an important trend in the field.

AB  - This systematic review aimed to synthesise multimorbidity profiling literature to identify replicable and clinically meaningful groupings of multimorbidity. We searched six electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science) for articles reporting multimorbidity profiles. The identified profiles were synthesised with multidimensional scaling, stratified by type of statistical analysis used in the derivation of profiles. The 51 studies that met inclusion criteria reported results of 98 separate analyses of multimorbidity profiling, with a total of 407 multimorbidity profiles identified. The statistical techniques used to identify multimorbidity profiles were exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis of diseases, cluster analysis of people, and latent class analysis. Reporting of methodological details of statistical methods was often incomplete. The discernible groupings of multimorbidity took the form of both discrete categories and continuous dimensions. Mental health conditions and cardio-metabolic conditions grouped along identifiable continua in the synthesised results of all four methods. Discrete groupings of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with asthma, falls and fractures with sensory deficits and of Parkinson's disease and cognitive decline where partially replicable (identifiable in the results of more than one method), while clustering of musculoskeletal conditions and clustering of reproductive systems were each observed only in one statistical approach. The two most replicable multimorbidity profiles were mental health conditions and cardio-metabolic conditions. Further studies are needed to understand aetiology and evolution of these multimorbidity groupings. Guidelines for strengthening the reporting of multimorbidity profiling studies are proposed.

AB  - In 2011, it was reviewed that a) there is a strong co-occurrence between major depression and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), with fatigue and physio-somatic symptoms being key symptoms of depression, and depressive symptoms appearing during the course of CFS; and b) the comorbidity between both disorders may in part be explained by activated immune-inflammatory pathways, including increased translocation of Gram-negative bacteria and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1. Nevertheless, the possible involvement of activated microglia in this comorbidity has remained unclear. This paper aims to review microglial disturbances in major depression, CFS and their comorbidity. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed / MEDLINE database to identify studies, which are relevant to this current review. Depressed patients present neuroinflammatory alterations, probably related to microglial activation, while animal models show that a microglial response to immune challenges including lipopolysaccharides is accompanied by depressive-like behaviors. Recent evidence from preclinical studies indicates that activated microglia have a key role in the onset of fatigue. In chronic inflammatory conditions, such as infections and senescence, microglia orchestrate an inflammatory microenvironment thereby causing fatigue. In conclusion, based on our review we may posit that shared immune-inflammatory pathways and especially activated microglia underpin comorbid depression and CFS. As such, microglial activation and neuro-inflammation may be promising targets to treat the overlapping manifestations of both depression and CFS.

AB  - The goal of this article is to clarify the role of various growth factors in the establishment and progression of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a chronic mental disorder with recurrent intrusive thoughts and/or repetitive compulsive behaviors that increase during stressful periods. Growth and neurotrophic factors may be contributing factors in the pathophysiology of OCD. Many of them are synthesized and released within the central nervous system and act as trophic agents in neurons; some of them are involved in brain growth, development, neurogenesis, myelination and plasticity, while others take part in the protection of the nervous system following brain injuries. This paper attempts to identify all articles investigating the relationship between OCD and neurotrophic and growth factors, in both animal and human studies, with a focus on adult brain studies. Based on the PubMed and Scopus and Science Direct search tools, the available articles and studies are reviewed. Out of 230 records in total, the ones related to our review topic were taken into account to further understand the pathophysiological mechanism(s) of OCD, providing methods to improve its symptoms via the modification of neurotrophins and growth factor imbalances.

AB  - DSM-5 lists 9 different symptoms for major depressive disorder and dictates that either "depressed mood" or "loss of interest or pleasure" should be present for diagnosis. Both are relatively high-level symptoms of the complex affecto-cognitive disease. However, the single most common behavioral paradigm and the gold standard animal (rodent) test for depression, the forced swim test (FST), measures a low-level mechanical feature that resembles "psychomotor retardation" observed in depression. This symptom refers to the slowing down of cognitive processes and an associated reduction in mobility. Likewise, the FST involves placing a rodent (mouse or rat) in a water-filled cylinder to measure its escape-related mobility over periods of immobility. Avoiding the term depression, this particular form of immobility observed in the FST was termed behavioral despair. Behavioral despair does not correlate with general mobility levels of the animal as measured in an open field test; and FST can reliably differentiate antidepressant treatments from other treatments that merely lead to increased mobility. It is therefore not a mere reflection of decreased physical energy or locomotion, but indicates the level of psychomotor activity of the animal. This review discusses the clinical significance and neurobiology of psychomotor retardation, and evaluates how FST, measuring this mechanical aspect of the disease, emerges as a reliable method and a critical step in antidepressant research.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) research has gone through rapid advances and the technology has established itself as a valuable training tool in many domains. While research in the field of emergency response, and more specifically in the field of firefighting, is still catching up, the future potential of VR technology for training is promising. This paper uses the SWOT framework to analyse the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats immersive VR technology faces in the field of firefighter training. While using VR for training is cost-effective, safe to use and provides the ability to prepare trainees with a large variety of high fidelity training environments, the lack in specialization of the applications for the fire-service sector and issues with technology acceptance and limitations need to be addressed. Looking to current research, there are promising findings that might be directly transferable, creating affective, and multi-sensory experiences for more effective mental and physical training of firefighters in the future. More research is needed to establish methods of skills transfer from VR to real life scenarios and to evaluate the potential risk of frequent training in engaging and physiologically stimulating virtual environments.

AB  - The restrictions and the concerted action of the global ban on the use and presence of tributyltin (TBT) in marine applications to protect ecosystems in the marine environment in 2008 was mainly based on the economic impact on shellfish industries and the dramatic extinction of local mollusk populations in the past. In contrast to the vast datasets on effects on mollusks, the knowledge on impacts on species from other taxa remained in the uncertain until almost two decades ago. The assumption on a long-term TBT-mediated pernicious metabolic bottom-up regulation of the crustacean Crangon crangon population was provoked by the outcome of an EU-project 'Sources, Consumer Exposure and Risks of Organotin Contamination in Seafood.' This study reported high TBT body burdens in C. crangon in 2003, at the start of the transition period to the global ban. Experimental research on the TBT impact in C. crangon focused on agonistic interference with natural ecdysteroid hormones at the metabolic pathways regulating growth and reproduction and the biogeochemical distribution of the chemical. In this paper, metabolic, topical and population-relevant biological endpoints in C. crangon and other crustaceans are evaluated in relation to the temporal and spatial trends on TBT's occurrence and distribution in the field during and after the introduction of the tributyltin restrictions and endocrine-related incidents. Arguments are forwarded to relate the German Bight incident on growth and reproduction failure in the C. crangon population, despite the lack of direct evidence, to the pernicious impact of tributyltin in 1990/91 and previous years. The extreme occurrence of TBT in C. crangon from other parts of the southern North Sea and evidence on the high body burdens as dose metrics of exposure also feeds the suspicion on detrimental impacts in those areas. This paper further demonstrates the complexity of distinguishing and assessing the individual roles of unrelated stressors on a population in an integrated evaluation at the ecosystem level.

AB  - The number of marine watercraft is on the rise-from private boats in coastal areas to commercial ships crossing oceans. A concomitant increase in underwater noise has been reported in several regions around the globe. Given the important role sound plays in the life functions of marine mammals, research on the potential effects of vessel noise has grown-in particular since the year 2000. We provide an overview of this literature, showing that studies have been patchy in terms of their coverage of species, habitats, vessel types, and types of impact investigated. The documented effects include behavioral and acoustic responses, auditory masking, and stress. We identify knowledge gaps: There appears a bias to more easily accessible species (i.e., bottlenose dolphins and humpback whales), whereas there is a paucity of literature addressing vessel noise impacts on river dolphins, even though some of these species experience chronic noise from boats. Similarly, little is known about the potential effects of ship noise on pelagic and deep-diving marine mammals, even though ship noise is focused in a downward direction, reaching great depth at little acoustic loss and potentially coupling into sound propagation channels in which sound may transmit over long ranges. We explain the fundamental concepts involved in the generation and propagation of vessel noise and point out common problems with both physics and biology: Recordings of ship noise might be affected by unidentified artifacts, and noise exposure can be both under- and over-estimated by tens of decibel if the local sound propagation conditions are not considered. The lack of anthropogenic (e.g., different vessel types), environmental (e.g., different sea states or presence/absence of prey), and biological (e.g., different demographics) controls is a common problem, as is a lack of understanding what constitutes the 'normal' range of behaviors. Last but not least, the biological significance of observed responses is mostly unknown. Moving forward, standards on study design, data analysis, and reporting are badly needed so that results are comparable (across space and time) and so that data can be synthesized to address the grand unknowns: the role of context and the consequences of chronic exposures.

AB  - Background Several typologies and guidelines are available to address the methodological and practical considerations required in mental health research. However, few studies have actually attempted to systematically identify and synthesise these considerations. This paper provides an integrative review that identifies and synthesises the available research evidence on mental health research methodological considerations. Methods A search of the published literature was conducted using EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus. The search was limited to papers published in English for the timeframe 2000-2018. Using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, three reviewers independently screened the retrieved papers. A data extraction form was used to extract data from the included papers. Results Of 27 papers meeting the inclusion criteria, 13 focused on qualitative research, 8 mixed methods and 6 papers focused on quantitative methodology. A total of 14 papers targeted global mental health research, with 2 papers each describing studies in Germany, Sweden and China. The review identified several methodological considerations relating to study design, methods, data collection, and quality assurance. Methodological issues regarding the study design included assembling team members, familiarisation and sharing information on the topic, and seeking the contribution of team members. Methodological considerations to facilitate data collection involved adequate preparation prior to fieldwork, appropriateness and adequacy of the sampling and data collection approach, selection of consumers, the social or cultural context, practical and organisational skills; and ethical and sensitivity issues. Conclusion The evidence confirms that studies on methodological considerations in conducting mental health research largely focus on qualitative studies in a transcultural setting, as well as recommendations derived from multi-site surveys. Mental health research should adequately consider the methodological issues around study design, sampling, data collection procedures and quality assurance in order to maintain the quality of data collection.

AB  - Background: This literature review examined the existing evidence base for the impact of both live and recorded music interventions involving active participation in a dementia population. Methodology: PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched and 15 studies met inclusion criteria. Results: There was a positive impact on behavioural and psychological symptoms, quality of life, communication and some aspects of cognitive function; methodological limitations, however, make it difficult to offer firm conclusions. Interventions using recorded music resulted in more consistent positive behavioural and psychological outcomes, whereas interventions using live music reported a benefit to communication and relationships. Conclusions: Although live and recorded music showed benefits, and should be considered in dementia care, the use of different outcome measures made definitive comparisons problematic. In order to better understand mechanisms of change, one future research area should explore how group music interventions affect communication by more closely assessing processes during live and recorded music.

AB  - The growth of the literature about neuroimaging of major depressive disorder (MDD) over the last several decades has contributed to the progress in recognizing precise brain areas, networks, and neurotransmitter processes related to depression. However, there are still doubts about the etiology and pathophysiology of depression that need answering. The authors did a nonsystematic review of the literature using PubMed database, with the following search terms: "major depressive disorder," "neuroimaging," "functional imaging," "magnetic resonance imaging," "functional magnetic resonance imaging," and "structural imaging," being selected the significant articles published on the topic. Anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala basal ganglia, and the cerebellum were the main affected areas across the selected studies. These areas respond to particular neurotransmitter systems, neurochemicals, hormones, and other signal proteins; even more, the evidence supports a distorted frontolimbic mood regulatory pathway in MDD patients. Despite the positive findings, translation to treatment of MDD remains illusory. In conclusion, this article aims to be a critical review of the neuroimaging correlates of depression in clinical research with the purpose to improve clinical practice.

AB  - Aims. For the past quarter of a century, Frank et al.'s (1991) consensus-based definitions of major depressive disorder (MDD) episode, remission, recovery, relapse and recurrence have been the paramount driving forces for consistency in MDD research as well as in clinical practice. This study aims to review the evidence for the empirical validation of Frank et al.'s proposed concept definitions and to discuss evidence-based modifications.
   Methods. A literature search of Web of Science and PubMed from 1/1/1991 to 08/30/2017 identified all publications which referenced Frank et al.'s request for definition validation. Publications with data relevant for validation were included and checked for referencing other studies providing such data.
   Results. A total of 56 studies involving 39 315 subjects were included, mainly presenting data to validate the severity and duration thresholds for defining remission and recovery. Most studies indicated that the severity threshold for defining remission should decrease. Additionally, specific duration thresholds to separate remission from recovery did not add any predictive value to the notion that increased remission duration alleviates the risk of reoccurrence of depressive symptoms. Only limited data were available to validate the severity and duration criteria for defining a depressive episode.
   Conclusions. Remission can best be defined as a less symptomatic state than previously assumed (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item version (HAMD-17) <= 4 instead of <= 7), without applying a duration criterion. Duration thresholds to separate remission from recovery are not meaningful. The minimal duration of depressive symptoms to define a depressive episode should be longer than 2 weeks, although further studies are required to recommend an exact duration threshold. These results are relevant for researchers and clinicians aiming to use evidence-based depression outcomes.

AB  - An exhaustive overview of heavy metal pollution in Chaohu Lake illustrating enrichment intensity, temporal and spatial distribution, chemical speciation, and ecological risk under natural and anthropogenic changes was conducted. Low concentrations of heavy metals excluding Hg were found in water whereas high Hg might be ascribed to surrounding coal-fired power plants. Copper, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg were enriched in sediment whereas Cr and Ni were comparable to background values. Besides, As demonstrated an equal accumulation from natural and anthropogenic fluxes. Heavy metals were at a low level prior to the 1950s; it increased gradually during the 1950s-1960s owing to population growth and agricultural expansion; then it displayed abrupt increase since the late 1970s due to rapid modern urbanization and industrialization and agricultural intensification. Spatial distribution of heavy metals was a good indicator of natural and anthropogenic changes, where higher enrichment was found in the western lake. Apart from fluvial input, anthropogenic disturbances such as land use changes, atmospheric deposition, and algae-derived organic matter, along with natural stressors including climate change, hydrological alteration, and soil erosion, made significant contribution to the biogeochemical cycle of heavy metals in the lake. Heavy metals mainly from anthropogenic sources were dominantly partitioned in non-residual fractions, whereas those mainly from natural sources were predominantly distributed in residual form. Mercury and Cd were below the threshold effect concentration (TEC) indicating that adverse effects were excluded. However, result of chemical speciation demonstrated Cd would pose a considerable potential ecological risk. Besides, most of the heavy metals were in the range of TEC-PEC suggesting possible toxicity.

AB  - This article presents findings from a meta-analysis which sought to determine the effectiveness of interventions adopting a whole school approach to enhancing children and young people's social and emotional development. Whole school interventions were included if they involved a coordinated set of activities across curriculum teaching, school ethos and environment, and family and community partnerships. A total of 45 studies (30 interventions) involving 496,299 participants were included in the analysis. Post-intervention outcomes demonstrated significant but small improvements in participants' social and emotional adjustment (d = 0.220), behavioural adjustment (d = 0.134), and internalising symptoms (d = 0.109). Interventions were not shown to impact on academic achievement. Origin of study and the inclusion of a community component as part of a whole school approach were found to be significant moderators for social and emotional outcomes. Further research is required to determine the active ingredients of whole school interventions that we can better understand the components necessary to achieve successful outcomes.

AB  - Latinas in the USA and Spanish-speaking countries experience elevated rates of perinatal depression (PND) because of high psychosocial stressors. Latinas are heterogeneous and have varying cultural practices. It is unclear whether specific cultural orientations have differential risks for PND. This systematic review aimed to determine whether degree of acculturation, Marianismo, and religiosity are risks or protective factors for PND in Latina women living in the USA, Latin America, and other countries. The review included PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Academic Search Ultimate (EBSCO), and Social Services s, and used Boolean combined keywords. English and Spanish language articles were considered. The review was conducted between July 2017 and February 2018, with no boundaries on publication dates. Ten studies were selected for inclusion. Of those, two studies were conducted in Mexico and most studies conducted in the USA included women of Mexican descent. Degree of acculturation (adoption of mainstream values) was inconsistently directly associated with PND; evidence suggest indirect associations. Marianismo, the traditional female role of virtue, passivity, and priority of others over oneself, was inconsistently correlated with risk for depression in pregnancy, but significantly and indirectly associated with postpartum depression. Two of three studies found religiosity to be protective postpartum. Further research on protective and risk factors of specific cultural orientations, particularly degree of acculturation and Marianismo, for PND in Latinas in the USA and abroad is needed. Attention to specific perinatal periods is necessary given the inconsistent findings.

   Methods: The PRISMA statement was used to conduct a systematic search of the literature on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Sociological abstract, DOAJ, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Of the original number of 749 studies, 34 were included in the systematic review, and 7 in the meta-analysis.
   Results: A total of 119,361 participants from 15 different countries took part in these studies which were published between 1999 and 2019. Significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies (I-2 = 96%). In a random-effects meta-analysis model, pooled odds ratio (OR) analysis revealed that there was a direct relationship between occupational exposure to violence and sleep problems (OR = 2.55; 95% CI = 1.77-3.66). According to the GRADE guidelines, the quality of evidence of the association was low.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that occupational exposure to physical, verbal, or sexual violence is associated with sleep problems. Further research on the relationship between violence and sleep is needed so that appropriate measures can be taken to prevent violence and improve sleep hygiene in the workplace.

AB  - Background: Evidence suggests that externalizing and internalizing symptoms are expressed early in life and are associated with problematic drinking in young adulthood. However, few studies have examined their role during childhood and adolescence in predicting alcohol problems later in life. Objectives: To examine the role of childhood and adolescent externalizing and internalizing symptoms in predicting alcohol use disorders in young adulthood. Methods: We searched five electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Sciences and Embase) for studies which diagnosed alcohol use disorders through either the International Classification of Diseases or American Psychiatric Association - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria and followed up children or adolescents into the transition to young adulthood. We performed a meta-analysis and obtained pooled odds ratio estimates with 95% confidence intervals using random-effects models. Results: A total of 12 longitudinal studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. All measured the outcome using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. The majority were of good quality and were conducted in the United States. A total of 19,407 participants (50% female) were included in this meta-analysis. Of these, n = 2337 (12%) had diagnoses of alcohol use disorders/alcohol dependence. Participant ages ranged from birth to 36 years. Internalizing symptoms increased the risk of young adult alcohol use disorders by 21% (odds ratio = 1.21; 95% confidence interval = [1.05, 1.39]), with no strong evidence of publication bias. Subgroup analysis suggested significantly lower heterogeneity than for externalizing studies. Externalizing symptoms increased the risk of alcohol use disorders by 62% (odds ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval = [1.39, 1.90]). We found some evidence of publication bias and significant heterogeneity in the studies. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the contribution of early behavioural problems to the development of alcohol use disorders in young adulthood and the need for timely scrutiny of and intervention on early behavioural problems.

AB  - Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is of paramount importance to achieve the optimum control of viral load and progression of disease among people living with HIV (PLHIV). An overview of systematic reviews to summarize the factors influencing adherence to ART was not found in the literature; hence, the systematic review of systematic reviews was conducted to provide global view of factors influencing adherence to ART. Systematic reviews ever published till May 2018 were searched and retrieved between May 2015 and May 2018 from Cochrane and PubMed databases. Among 88 studies initially chosen based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 were selected for further analysis. Qualitative analysis of included reviews was made through narrative synthesis approach. Results of the study show that among the 60 factors enlisted, 5 were most highly significant, 7 were highly significant, 19 were moderately significant, and 29 were emerged as significant factors. Substance abuse, financial constraints, social support, HIV stigma, and depressive symptoms were the most highly significant factors influencing the adherence, whereas age, employment status, long distance, side effects of drugs, pill burden, education, and mental health were regarded as highly significant factors influencing ART. Fatigue, away from home, being too busy in other things, simply forgot, and beliefs about the necessity of ART emerged as significant factors. The study concludes that findings from the overview give global insight into the factors determining adherence to ART which would further influence the innovations, program, and policy-making to mitigate the problem of nonadherence.

AB  - Background Faltering in linear growth and neurobehavioural development during early childhood are often assumed to have common causes because of their consistent association. This notion has contributed to a global focus on the promotion of nutrition during pregnancy and childhood to improve both conditions. Our aim was to assess whether effects of interventions on linear growth are associated with effects on developmental scores and to quantify these associations.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included randomised trials done during pregnancy and in children aged 0-5 years that reported effects of any intervention on length-for-age or height-for-age Z scores (LAZ or HAZ) and on any of the following outcomes: motor, cognitive or mental, language, and social-emotional or behavioural development. We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and PsycINFO (EBSCO) from database inception to June 25, 2019. Study-level data were extracted and, when required, authors were contacted for missing information. We calculated weighted meta-regression coefficients of the association between standardised effect sizes of interventions on LAZ or HAZ and developmental outcome scores and calculated pooled effect sizes for different types of intervention.
   Findings Of the 7207 studies identified, we included 75 studies with 122 comparisons between intervention and control groups and outcomes reported for 72 275 children. Across all interventions, effect sizes on LAZ or HAZ were significantly associated with effect sizes on social-emotional scores (beta 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.41; p=0.02), but not on cognitive (0.18, -0.36 to 0.72; p=0.51), language (0.12, -0.07 to 0.31; p=0- 21), or motor development scores (0.23, -0.05 to 0.50; p=0.11). In studies that provided nutritional supplements, we observed positive significant pooled effect sizes on all five outcomes of LAZ or HAZ (effect size 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0-09; p=0. 01; n=50), cognitive or mental (0.06, 0.03-0.10; p<0.01; n=38), language (0-08, 0-03-0-13; p=0.01; n=21), motor (0-08,0-04-0-12; p<0.01; n=41), and social-emotional (0.07, 0.02-0.12; p=0 . 01; n=20) scores. The effect sizes of nutritional supplementation on LAZ or HAZ scores were significantly associated with effect sizes on cognitive (beta 0.40, 95% CI 0.04-0.77; p=0 . 049) and motor (0.43, 0.11-0 - 75; p=0 . 01) scores. In the 14 interventions promoting responsive care and learning opportunities, the pooled effect size on LAZ or HAZ score was not significant (-0.01, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.05; p=0 . 74), but pooled effect sizes on cognitive, language, and motor scores were 4 to 5 times larger (range 0.38-0.48) than the pooled effect sizes of nutritional supplementation (0.05-0.08).
   Interpretation In nutritional supplementation interventions, improvements in linear growth were associated with small improvements in child development, whereas nurturing and stimulation interventions had significant effects on child development but no effects on linear growth. The determinants of linear growth and neurodevelopment are only partly shared. To nurture thriving individuals and communities, interventions should specifically target determinants of neurodevelopment and not simply linear growth. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Fear is an emotion that serves as a driving factor in how organisms move through the world. In this review, we discuss the current understandings of the subjective experience of fear and the related biological processes involved in fear learning and memory. We first provide an overview of fear learning and memory in humans and animal models, encompassing the neurocircuitry and molecular mechanisms, the influence of genetic and environmental factors, and how fear learning paradigms have contributed to treatments for fear-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Current treatments as well as novel strategies, such as targeting the perisynaptic environment and use of virtual reality, are addressed. We review research on the subjective experience of fear and the role of autobiographical memory in fear-related disorders. We also discuss the gaps in our understanding of fear learning and memory, and the degree of consensus in the field. Lastly, the development of linguistic tools for assessments and treatment of fear learning and memory disorders is discussed.

AB  - Objective: Mental health recovery narratives are often shared in peer support work and antistigma campaigns. Internet technology provides access to an almost unlimited number of narratives, and yet little is known about how they affect recipients. The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework characterizing the impact of recovery narratives on recipients. Method: A systematic review of evidence about the impact of mental health recovery narratives was conducted. Searches used electronic databases (n = 9), reference tracking, hand-searching of selected journals (n = 2), grey literature searching, and expert consultation (n = 7). A conceptual framework was generated through a thematic analysis of included articles, augmented by consultation with a Lived Experience Advisory Panel. Results: In total, 8137 articles were screened. Five articles were included. Forms of impact were connectedness, understanding of recovery, reduction in stigma, validation of personal experience, affective responses, and behavioural responses. Impact was moderated by characteristics of the recipient, context, and narrative. Increases in eating disorder behaviours were identified as a harmful response specific to recipients with eating disorders. Conclusions: Mental health recovery narratives can promote recovery. Recovery narratives might be useful for clients with limited access to peers and in online interventions targeted at reducing social isolation in rural or remote locations, but support is needed for the processing of the strong emotions that can arise. Caution is needed for use with specific clinical populations. Protocol registration: Prospero-CRD42018090923.

AB  - Background: Subjects with panic disorder are nearly 4 times as likely to attempt suicide as compared to subjects without this condition.
   Methods: We searched the literature from Jan 1, 1960 to May, 4, 2019. Articles that reported a dichotomous sample of patients with panic disorder with and without suicidal behavior were included.
   Outcomes: Twelve studies with 1958 participants were included. Comorbid depression (k = 3, ES = 4.47 [2.63; 7.60]), depressive symptoms (k = 2, ES = 1.98 [1.26; 3.11]), older age (k = 3, ES = 1.66 [1.32; 2.10]), younger age of panic disorder onset (k = 2, ES = 0.65 [0.45; 0.94]), and history of alcohol dependence (k = 2, ES = 8.70 [1.20; 63.04]) were associated with suicide attempt in panic disorder. Depressive symptoms (k = 2, ES = 2.29 (1.60; 3.37]), anxiety symptoms (k = 2, ES = 1.90 [1.33; 2.69]), longer illness duration (k = 2, ES = 3.31 [1.90; 5.74]), comorbid depressive disorder (k = 4, ES = 3.88 [2.03; 7.41]), agoraphobia (k = 2, ES = 4.60 [1.47; 14.42]) and younger age of onset (k = 2, ES = 0.60 [0.38; 0.96]) were associated with suicidal ideation in panic disorder.
   Interpretation Our findings provide a framework for the development of suicide prevention strategies in this population.

AB  - Introduction: Evidence suggests that in convenience stores across the United States (U.S), sales of e-cigarettes (EC) continue to grow, indicating their rising popularity. ECs have been touted as a means for traditional cigarette (TC) smokers to quit smoking. However, the dramatic increase in the number of adolescents and young adults using e-cigarettes (vaping) in America is a cause for concern as their long-term effects remain unknown.
   Methods: Search was done by accessing PubMed/Medline, EBSCO, and PsycINFO databases. The search string used was "(Cigarettes OR E-Cigarettes* OR Vaping) AND (Oxidative Stress* OR Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)) AND (Adolescents OR Teens OR Young Adults)". The electronic databases were searched for titles or abstracts containing these terms in all published articles between January 1, 1970, and June 30, 2019. Over 3000 articles were found in the first round of search which was filtered to 129 articles.
   Results: Oxidative Stress is a critical underlying molecular factor that drives the harmful effects of traditional cigarettes. The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of oxidative stress and e-cigarettes just like traditional cigarettes induces oxidative stress. Many ecigarette components including the flavoring, vapor, e-liquids and metallic coil, trigger oxidative stress, indicating that both nicotine and non-nicotine e-cigarette use may be harmful.
   Conclusions: E-cigarettes use could potentially play a role in adolescent/young adults social maladjustments including poor learning and academic performance, increased aggressive and impulsive behavior, poor sleep quality, attention deficits, impaired memory, and cognition, and increased depression and suicidal ideation. The government, parents, school authorities and clinicians should be advised on these potentially harmful effects.

AB  - Background Many patients with bipolar disorder (BD) fail to experience benefit following traditional pharmacotherapy, necessitating alternative treatment options that will enable such patients to achieve remission. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a relatively new, noninvasive neuromodulation technique that involves the application of magnetic pulses on hyperactive or hypoactive cortical brain areas. We evaluated the existing literature on TMS as a treatment for BD across varied mood states. Methods We searched PubMed up to October 2018 for original data articles published in English that evaluated outcomes in a bipolar sample across depressive, manic, mixed, and maintenance phases of BD. Results Clinical trials of TMS for BD particularly suggest the potential of repetitive TMS for reducing depressive symptoms. Studies of TMS for mania have yielded more mixed findings. Few studies have evaluated TMS in other phases of the bipolar illness. TMS is generally associated with mild side effects though, in a few studies, it has been shown to contribute to a manic switch in previously depressed bipolar patients. Conclusions Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a promising approach for treating patients with BD who have failed to respond to pharmacological or psychosocial treatment. Future research should more clearly elucidate which TMS protocols may be most effective for a given bipolar patient.

AB  - The coastal area is the most productive and dynamic environment of the world ocean, offering significant resources and services for mankind. As exemplified by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, it has a tremendous potential for innovation and growth in blue economy sectors. Due to the inherent complexity of the natural system, the answers to many scientific and societal questions are unknown, and the impacts of the cumulative stresses imposed by anthropogenic pressures (such as pollution) and climate change are difficult to assess and forecast. A major challenge for the scientific community making observations of the coastal marine environment is to integrate observations of Essential Ocean Variables for physical, biogeochemical, and biological processes on appropriate spatial and temporal scales, and in a sustained and scientifically based manner. Coastal observations are important for improving our understanding of the complex biotic and abiotic processes in many fields of research such as ecosystem science, habitat protection, and climate change impacts. They are also important for improving our understanding of the impacts of human activities such as fishing and aquaculture, and underpin risk monitoring and assessment. The observations enable us to better understand ecosystems and the societal consequences of overfishing, disease (particularly shellfish), loss of biodiversity, coastline withdrawal, and ocean acidification, amongst others. The European coastal observing infrastructure JERICO-RI, has gathered and organized key communities embracing new technologies and providing a future strategy, with recommendations on the way forward and on governance. Particularly, the JERICO community acknowledges that the main providers of coastal observations are: (1) research infrastructures, (2) national monitoring programs, and (3) monitoring activities performed by marine industries. The scope of this paper is to present some key elements of our coastal science strategy to build it on long term. It describes how the pan-European JERICO community is building an integrated and innovation-driven coastal research infrastructure for Europe. The RI embraces emerging technologies which will revolutionize the way the ocean is observed. Developments in biotechnology (molecular and optical sensors, omics-based biology) will soon provide direct and online access to chemical and biological variables including in situ quantification of harmful algae and contaminants. Using artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things will soon provide operational platforms and autonomous and remotely operated smart sensors. Embracing key technologies, high quality open access data, modeling and satellite observations, it will support sustainable blue growth, warning and forecasting coastal services and healthy marine ecosystem. JERICO-FP7 is the European 7th framework project named JERICO under Grant Agreement No. 262584. JERICO-NEXT is the European Horizon-2020 project under Grant Agreement No. 654410. JERICO-RI is the European coastal observing research infrastructure established and structured through JERICO-FP7 and JERICO-NEXT, and beyond.

AB  - Despite the importance of the role of caregivers of people with psychosis being widely recognized, comprehensive understanding of their experience is limited. A thorough understanding of the experience of caregivers over the journey of the illness, particularly during its early stages, is crucial. Qualitative studies published between 1 January 1949 and 31 January 2018 were obtained from seven databases based on PICo search strategy. Meta-aggregation methodology of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) was adopted to aggregate existing qualitative findings about caregivers' experiences. Twenty-eight qualitative studies on 635 caregivers and family members were included in the review. Six inter-related categories-'stigma', 'help-seeking', 'service encounter', 'emotional challenges', 'on becoming a caregiver' and 'making sense of experience'-were aggregated from 129 themes from the sub-acute stage, the acute stage and the recovery or residual stage. Three statements about caregivers' experiences of their relative's first episode of psychosis were synthesized from the findings. Results highlighted the need of incorporating caregiver intervention into the existing services to support the emotional challenges, uncertainty, and stigma-related burden along the caregiving journey.

AB  - Stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, exact enormous socioeconomic and individual consequences. Resilience, the process of adaptation in the face of adversity, is an important concept that is enabling the field to understand individual differences in stress responses, with the hope of harnessing this information for the development of novel therapeutics that mimic the body's natural resilience mechanisms. This review provides an update on the current state of research of the neurobiological mechanisms of stress resilience. We focus on physiological and transcriptional adaptations of specific brain circuits, the role of cellular and humoral factors of the immune system, the gut microbiota, and changes at the interface between the brain and the periphery, the blood-brain barrier. We propose viewing resilience as a process that requires the integration of multiple central and peripheral systems and that elucidating the underlying neurobiological mechanisms will ultimately lead to novel therapeutic options.

AB  - Background: Convincing evidence on Virtual Reality (VR) exposure for phobic anxiety disorders has been reported, however, the benchmark and golden standard for phobia treatment is in vivo exposure. For direct treatment comparisons, the control of confounding variables is essential. Therefore, the comparison of VR and in vivo exposure in studies applying an equivalent amount of exposure in both treatments is necessary.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search of reports published until June 2019. Inclusion criteria covered the diagnosis of Specific Phobia, Social Phobia, or Agoraphobia, and a randomized-controlled design with an equivalent amount of exposure in VR and in vivo. We qualitatively reviewed participants' characteristics, materials, and the treatment procedures of all included studies. For quantitative synthesis, we calculated Hedges' g effect sizes for the treatment effects of VR exposure, in vivo exposure, and the comparison of VR to in vivo exposure in all studies and separately for studies on each diagnosis.
   Results: Nine studies (n = 371) were included, four on Specific Phobia, three on Social Phobia, and two on Agoraphobia. VR and in vivo exposure both showed large, significant effect sizes. The comparison of VR to in vivo exposure revealed a small, but non-significant effect size favoring in vivo (g = -0.20). Specifically, effect sizes for Specific Phobia (g = -0.15) and Agoraphobia (g = -0.01) were non-significant, only for Social Phobia we found a significant effect size favoring in vivo (g = -0.50). Except for Agoraphobia, effect sizes varied across studies from favoring VR to favoring in vivo exposure.
   Conclusions: We found no evidence that VR exposure is significantly less efficacious than in vivo exposure in Specific Phobia and Agoraphobia. The wide range of study specific effect sizes, especially in Social Phobia, indicates a high potential of VR, but also points to the need for a deeper investigation and empirical examination of relevant working mechanisms. In Social Phobia, a combination of VR exposure with cognitive interventions and the realization of virtual social interactions targeting central fears might be advantageous. Considering the advantages of VR exposure, its dissemination should be emphasized. Improvements in technology and procedures might even yield superior effects in the future.

AB  - Background Dementia represents a mental and economic burden for both patients and their caregivers. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of animal assisted therapy (AAT) with special focus on canis therapy among people with dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. Methods The key method of this review study is a systematic review of the research studies detected in the Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. The search was conducted for the studies dating from 2016 till 31 August 2018 because several review studies were published before. Eventually, only six studies were involved into the final analysis. Results The findings of this review, based on significant effect sizes, reveal that AAT may work as a beneficial and effective complementary treatment, especially in the area of behavioral and psychological symptoms, for patients with different degree of dementia severity if AAT is targeted at their specific needs and interests. Conclusions More research in the area of methodology for the implementation of AAT is necessary, and more research should be conducted with respect to the use of AAT for the improvement of cognitive functions in people with dementia.

Methods PubMed, Embase, Scopus and PsycINFO and reference lists were systematically searched for studies of depressed patients where two unilateral placements were compared and clinical outcomes were reported. Computational modelling was done to generate electric field maps for each unilateral placement identified in the systematic review. Results A total of 29 studies met criteria for inclusion. Eight studies reported efficacy outcomes and 23 studies reported cognitive outcomes. Most studies found no significant difference in efficacy between right unilateral (RUL) and left unilateral (LUL) ECT, and no difference was found between temporo-parietal and fronto-temporal ECT. For the majority of studies, RUL placements had better verbal anterograde memory outcomes compared with the LUL placements. There was some evidence suggestive of cognitive advantages for fronto-frontal and fronto-parietal placements relative to temporo-parietal ECT. Conclusions For efficacy, studies mainly focused on the comparison of right vs. left hemispheric stimulation, with the available evidence suggesting no substantive difference. RUL placements tended to have better verbal anterograde memory outcomes relative to LUL placements, though limited differences were found between the RUL placements.

AB  - Background: The Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ) and its derivatives have been instrumental in research examining the Self-Regulatory Executive Function Model in adults. Studies testing whether findings are applicable to children and adolescents have been increasing and several different measures adapting the MCQ for younger populations have been developed. The current study aimed to systematically review the psychometric properties of MCQ measures or derivatives used in young people (aged 18 or less), to help assess current findings in this population and to guide future research in this growing area of investigation.
   Method: Systematic searches were carried out on PubMed and PsycINFO of studies published up to June 2018. Additional studies were identified through Google Scholar and article references. Validity, reliability, range and responsiveness of measures were examined as well as analyses of age and gender differences on scores.
   Results: Forty-five articles were identified. The total sample consisted of 7,803 children and adolescents (6,922 non-clinical, 881 clinical) aged 7-18. Studies used one of seven versions of the questionnaire, five adapted from the MCQ for younger populations: (1) The Metacognitions Questionnaire-Adolescent version; (2) The Metacognitions Questionnaire-Child version; (3) The Metacognitions Questionnaire-Child Version-Revised; (4) The Metacognitions Questionnaire-Child-30; and (5) The Metacognitions Questionnaire-65 Positive Beliefs Scale Revised; and two adult versions used without adaptation: (1) The Metacognitions Questionnaire-30 and (2) The Cognitive Self Consciousness Scale-Expanded. The validity and reliability of the Metacognitions Questionnaire-Adolescent version had the most extensive support. Other questionnaires had either mixed psychometrics or promising initial findings but more limited data.
   Conclusions: It is recommended that studies using adolescents (age 12-18) consider using the Metacognitions Questionnaire-Adolescent version. Based on initial data, it is suggested studies using younger populations should consider the Metacognitions Questionnaire-Child-30 but further psychometric research into this and other measures is needed.

AB  - Objectives The question whether mental illness prevalence rates are increasing is a controversially debated topic. Epidemiological articles and review publications that look into this research issue are often compromised by methodological problems. The present study aimed at using a meta-analysis technique that is usually applied for the analysis of intervention studies to achieve more transparency and statistical precision. Methods We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Google Scholar and reference lists for repeated cross-sectional population studies on prevalence rates of adult mental illness based on ICD- or DSM-based diagnoses, symptom scales and distress scales that used the same methodological approach at least twice in the same geographical region. The study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018090959). Results We included 44 samples from 42 publications, representing 1 035 697 primary observations for the first time point and 783 897 primary observations for the second and last time point. Studies were conducted between 1978 and 2015. Controlling for a hierarchical data structure, we found an overall global prevalence increase in odds ratio of 1.179 (95%-CI: 1.065-1.305). A multivariate meta-regression suggested relevant associations with methodological characteristics of included studies. Conclusions We conclude that the prevalence increase in adult mental illness is small, and we assume that this increase is mainly related to demographic changes.

AB  - Background Migraines have adverse psychological consequences, one of which is the tendency towards depression. This study aimed to investigate the effects of migraine on adults' depression in the form of a systematic review and meta-analysis Methods Several scientific databases were searched using relevant keywords until the end of January 2018. After reviewing the titles and abstracts and the full texts, the researchers eventually included 16 eligible articles. Major and sub-group analyses were carried out using random effects. Publication bias was also measured. Results Pooled Odd Ratio (PR)& x202f;= 1.95; and 95% confidence interval (CI)& x202f;= CI & x202f;= 1.61-2.35 were obtained in studying the effects of migraine on depression. This effect was equal to OR & x202f;= 1.81 (95% CI & x202f;= 1.20-2.72) in cohort studies, and OR & x202f;= 2.00; 95% CI & x202f;= 1.64-2.43 in cross sectional studies. The heterogeneity was high, and no publication bias was found. Conclusions Migraine can play an important role in increasing the incidence of depression in affected patients. Therefore, identifying and ultimately treating the disease can be beneficial in reducing the negative psychological effects of this disease.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are still under recognized and undertreated, especially in primary care settings. One of the challenges faced by clinicians is the remarkable inter-individual variability among patients with these conditions. In addition, each patient with MDD and BD experiences a unique pattern of longitudinal changes across time, i.e., intra-individual variability can also be problematic. The immense amount of data generated and collected through the use of smartphones or personal devices offers an opportunity to obtain continuous and reliable information on each individual's behavior, a less burdensome way to capture both intra and inter-individual variability over time. Digital phenotypes (DP) are a promising strategy to be integrated with other "Omics" platforms for prediction of relevant outcomes in mood disorders, including but not restricted to, relapse, recurrence, cognitive decline and functional impairment. Despite existing limitations and some skepticism, digital phenotyping represents a field in great expansion and might eventually constitute a feasible strategy in biomarkers research for mood disorders.

AB  - Objective Positive psychology interventions, which involve systematic completion of activities designed to promote well-being, are being increasingly studied in medically ill patients. However, the extent to which these interventions ameliorate patient anxiety remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the study was to conduct a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of positive psychology interventions in reducing anxiety in medical patients. Methods Electronic databases Medline, PsycINFO, SciELO, Cochrane (Central), and were searched from inception to June 18, 2018, to identify studies of positive psychology interventions that included a validated measure of anxiety as an outcome measure. Results The search generated a total of 1024 studies. Twelve randomized controlled trials (n = 1131) delivered to medical patients were included in the review, and a further 11 nonrandomized trials (n = 300) were included in a secondary analysis. Positive psychology interventions were effective at reducing patient anxiety relative to a control with a small to medium effect size (g = -0.34, 95% confidence interval = -0.50 to -0.18), and results were maintained at a mean of 8-week follow-up (g = -0.31, 95% confidence interval = -0.54 to -0.08). Clinician-led interventions seemed to be more effective than self-administered interventions, and longer interventions were more effective than shorter interventions. Secondary analysis of nonrandomized trials also found that positive psychology interventions are associated with reduced anxiety. Conclusions Positive psychology interventions seem to be effective at reducing medical patient anxiety. Future research is needed to determine optimal intervention characteristics, including dose and intervention content, that maximize the observed treatment effects.

AB  - Redox-active, strongly magnetic, combustion and friction-derived nanoparticles (CFDNPs) are abundant in particulate matter air pollution. Urban children and young adults with Alzheimer disease Continuum have higher numbers of brain CFDNPs versus clean air controls. CFDNPs surface charge, dynamic magnetic susceptibility, iron content and redox activity contribute to ROS generation, neurovascular unit (NVU), mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) damage, and are catalysts for protein misfolding, aggregation and fibrillation. CFDNPs respond to external magnetic fields and are involved in cell damage by agglomeration/clustering, magnetic rotation and/or hyperthermia. This review focus in the interaction of CFDNPs, nanomedicine and industrial NPs with biological systems and the impact of portals of entry, particle sizes, surface charge, biomolecular corona, biodistribution, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular toxicity, anterograde and retrograde axonal transport, brain dysfunction and pathology. NPs toxicity information come from researchers synthetizing particles and improving their performance for drug delivery, drug targeting, magnetic resonance imaging and heat mediators for cancer therapy. Critical information includes how these NPs overcome all barriers, the NPs protein corona changes as they cross the NVU and the complexity of NPs interaction with soluble proteins and key organelles. Oxidative, ER and mitochondrial stress, and a faulty complex protein quality control are at the core of Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases and NPs mechanisms of action and toxicity are strong candidates for early development and progression of both fatal diseases. Nanoparticle exposure regardless of sources carries a high risk for the developing brain homeostasis and ought to be included in the AD and PD research framework.

AB  - Suicide and self-harm represent serious global health problems and appear to be especially elevated amongst indigenous minority groups, and particularly amongst young people (aged 24 years or younger). This systematic review investigates for the first time the antecedents and prevalence of suicide, self-harm and suicide ideation among Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth. Web of Science, PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL databases and grey literature were searched from earliest records to April 2019 for eligible articles. Twenty-two empirical articles met the inclusion criteria. The data confirmed that indigenous youth in Australia have elevated rates of suicide, self-harm and suicidal ideation relative to the nonindigenous population. Risk factors included being incarcerated, substance use and greater social and emotional distress. Notably, though, information on predictors of suicide and self-harm remains scarce. The findings support and justify the increasing implementation of public health programs specifically aimed at tackling this crisis. Based on the review findings, we argued that Aboriginal communities are best positioned to identify and understand the antecedents of youth self-harm, suicide ideation and suicide, and to take the lead in the development of more effective mental health preventive strategies and public policies within their communities.

AB  - There is growing interest in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) as a novel treatment option for substance-use disorders (SUDs). Recent momentum stems from a foundation of preclinical neuroscience demonstrating links between neural circuits and drug consuming behavior, as well as recent FDA-approval of NIBS treatments for mental health disorders that share overlapping pathology with SUDs. As with any emerging field, enthusiasm must be tempered by reason; lessons learned from the past should be prudently applied to future therapies. Here, an international ensemble of experts provides an overview of the state of transcranial-electrical (tES) and transcranial-magnetic (TMS) stimulation applied in SUDs. This consensus paper provides a systematic literature review on published data-emphasizing the heterogeneity of methods and outcome measures while suggesting strategies to help bridge knowledge gaps. The goal of this effort is to provide the community with guidelines for best practices in tES/TMS SUD research. We hope this will accelerate the speed at which the community translates basic neuroscience into advanced neuromodulation tools for clinical practice in addiction medicine.

AB  - A growing body of recent research has identified associations between various parenting practices and styles and internalizing problems among adolescents. However, the reported findings are inconsistent and the studies in question have been conducted from different theoretical backgrounds. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the literature on the association of parental socialization styles with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. To this end, we conducted a systematic search of the PsycInfo, Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases, covering literature published from 2010 to 2019. The search was restricted to peer-reviewed studies in English or Spanish. The results show that parental warmth, behavioural control, and autonomy granting are inversely related to internalizing symptoms in adolescents. Conversely, psychological control and harsh control by parents are positively associated with adolescent anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Although the associated effect sizes are only small or moderate, the results suggest that these variables should be taken into account when designing programmes aimed at promoting parenting styles conducive to the wellbeing of adolescents.

AB  - The latest scientific advances on the impacts of climate change on the health of the elderly in East China were reviewed consulting peer-reviewed publications from 2000 to 2017. The direct impacts of climate change result from rising temperatures, heat waves, and increases in the frequency of complex extreme weather events such as windstorms, floods, and droughts. The health and social consequences of these events are far reaching, ranging from reduced labour productivity and heat-related deaths through to direct physical injury during extreme weather events, the spread of infectious diseases, and mental health effects following widespread flooding or prolonged drought. Research has indicated that climate change will have the greatest impact on vulnerable groups of people, including the elderly population. However, there is a dearth of empirical evidence, a lack of focus on vulnerable segments of the population (especially elderly), limited understanding of how health status will change in the future, and lack of acknowledgement of how different regions in China vary in terms of the consequences of climate change. The main risk in East China that climate change may exacerbate is flooding (sea level rise, coastal and riverine, flood risk). However in some regions of East China such as in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shandong the biggest climate change risk is considered to be drought. Main health risks linked to climate change are evident as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (heat stroke, exhaustion, and asthma), often caused by interactions between heat wave episodes and concurrent poor air quality.

AB  - The neuroimaging has been applied in the study of pathophysiology in major depressive disorder (MDD). In this review article, several kinds of methodologies of neuroimaging would be discussed to summarize the promising biomarkers in MDD. For the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalography field, the literature review showed the potentially promising roles of frontal lobes, such as anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In addition, the limbic regions, such as hippocampus and amygdala, might be the potentially promising biomarkers for MDD. The structures and functions of ACC, DLPFC, OFC, amygdala and hippocampus might be confirmed as the biomarkers for the prediction of antidepressant treatment responses and for the pathophysiology of MDD. The functions of cognitive control and emotion regulation of these regions might be crucial for the establishment of biomarkers. The near-infrared spectroscopy studies demonstrated that blood flow in the frontal lobe, such as the DLPFC and OFC, might be the biomarkers for the field of near-infrared spectroscopy. The electroencephalography also supported the promising role of frontal regions, such as the ACC, DLPFC and OFC in the biomarker exploration, especially for the sleep electroencephalogram to detect biomarkers in MDD. The positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in MDD demonstrated the promising biomarkers for the frontal and limbic regions, such as ACC, DLPFC and amygdala. However, additional findings in brainstem and midbrain were also found in PET and SPECT The promising neuroimaging biomarkers of MDD seemed focused in the Pronto-limbic regions.

This review highlights established, emerging, and inconsistent findings, suggesting areas for future research, and implications for theory and practice. Methods A systematic search for meta-analyses and systematic reviews measuring adult attachment and concerning mental health difficulties was conducted. In total, 17 studies met the selection criteria. Results Findings were presented according to four identified themes, (1) measurement of attachment; (2) measurement of mental health difficulty; (3) intrapersonal processes related to attachment and mental health difficulties; and (4) interpersonal processes related to attachment and mental health difficulties. Conclusions This review highlights the connection between attachment style and mental health difficulties, and suggests that relationships can facilitate both mental health and illheath. However, the mechanisms through which insecure attachment confers risk for mental health difficulties require further research.

AB  - Introduction: Military service affects the health and well-being of both Veterans and their family members, with increasing recognition of the need for support to be provided to Veterans' families. In 2017 the Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs commissioned a rapid review of the literature to explore whether the delivery of support services to families of contemporary Veterans results in better outcomes for the Veteran. Methods: A systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature resulted in the extraction of 30 articles, reduced to 29 following quality assessment. We then produced a narrative synthesis of the articles. Results: All of the studies were undertaken in the United States (US). The majority (n = 20) focused on couples/family therapy, in particular, to address post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Veterans. Discussion: The studies overall reported significant psychological and relational benefit for Veterans when families are supported. However, the diversity of approaches suggests that currently, no one approach suits all family situations. More work is needed to develop interventions that address the broader psychosocial needs of families, such as work commitments and childcare needs, and to evaluate how these might benefit Veterans.

AB  - Individuals with schizophrenia die, on average, 20 years before their peers, with 'natural causes' accounting for 80% of premature deaths. The aim of this narrative review is to address this phenomenon from the perspective of known factors that contribute to long life. The relevant literature from the last decade was searched in PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Four factors have been shown to be common to centarians, people who live to be a hundred: genes, life style behaviors that favor a healthy heart, social support, and a subjective purpose in life. The latter three factors are potentially modifiable but, in the context of schizophrenia, there are barriers to change, namely poverty, illness symptoms, stress, stigma, and side effects of antipsychotic medication. Barriers to change need to be addressed before substantial progress can be made in increasing the health and mortality risk of people with schizophrenia.

AB  - Context: Gender identity disorder (GID) or gender dysphoria is a disorder in which an individual identifies him/herself with the opposite sex. GID following sex reassignment surgery (SRS) is usually associated with severe distress and several limitations in the personal and social aspects of life as a transgender.
   Objectives: The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the quality of life (QoL) after SRS in transgender individuals.
   Data Sources: A search was conducted in English databases, including PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. In addition, the reference lists of the included articles were reviewed without any time limitations. The final literature search was performed on 12 June 2017.
   Study Selection: All relevant cross sectional and observational studies were evaluated in the current review. The keywords included sex, gender, reassignment surgery, reassignment operation, sex change, sex reversal, transpersonal, sexual transition, gender dysphoria, transsexual, transgender, gender identity, male-to-female transsexual, female-to-male transsexual, quality of life, QoL, quality adjusted, and wellbeing.
   Data Extraction: After screening 941 articles, 16 studies were reviewed systematically, six of which were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software version 2 was used for all meta-analyses.
   Results: QoL improved after SRS in some dimensions, including bodily pain, emotional role, and mental health in male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals, and physical function and physical role in female-to-male (FtM) transsexuals. Physical role, vitality, and social function in MtF transsexuals were not significantly different from the general population. In other words, bodily pain, general health, social function, vitality, mental health, and emotional role in FtM transsexuals, as well as physical function and general health in MtF transsexuals, were lower than the general population.
   Conclusions: Based on the findings, SRS could improve some dimensions of QoL, including bodily pain, emotional role, and mental health in MtF transsexuals, and physical function as well as physical role in FtM transsexuals. Nevertheless, further research is necessary in this area.

AB  - Background: Maternal care refers to the behavior performed by the dam to nourish and protect her litter during its early development. Frequent and high-quality performance of such maternal behaviors is critical for the neurodevelopment of the pups. Maternal exposure to stress during early development can impair maternal care and amplify the deleterious effects of poor maternal caregiving and neglect. As such, a thorough understanding of the effects caused by several models of early life stress on maternal care may yield more insights into the relationship between stress and maternal behavior.
   Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify and address the effects of early life stress on maternal behavior. The search was conducted using three online databases: PUBMED, Embase, and Web of Science. To provide clear evidence of the impact of stress on maternal care, in every study, the stress group was always compared to a control group. Outcomes were categorized into eight different behaviors: (1) licking/grooming; (2) arched-back nursing; (3) blanket-nursing/passive nursing; (4) nest building; (5) contact with pups; (6) harmful/adverse caregiving; (7) no contact; (8) nest exits. Additionally, the methodological quality of the studies was evaluated.
   Results: A total of 12 different early life stress protocols were identified from the 56 studies included in this systematic review. Our data demonstrate that different stress models can promote specific maternal patterns of behavior. Regarding the maternal separation protocol, we observed an overall increase in nursing and licking/grooming behaviors, which are essential for pup development. An increase in the number of nest exits, which represents a fragmentation of maternal care, was observed in the limited bedding protocol, but the total amount of maternal care appears to remain similar between groups.
   Conclusions: Each stress protocol has unique characteristics that increase the difficulty of rendering comparisons of maternal behavior. The increase in maternal care observed in the maternal separation protocol may be an attempt to overcompensate for the time off-nest. Fragmented maternal care is a key component of the limited bedding protocol. Moreover, the methodological approaches to evaluate maternal behavior, such as time, duration, and behavior type should be more homogeneous across studies.

AB  - Background: Dance is an embodied activity and, when applied therapeutically, can have several specific and unspecific health benefits. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of dance movement therapy(1) (DMT) and dance interventions for psychological health outcomes. Research in this area grew considerably from 1.3 detected studies/year in 1996-2012 to 6.8 detected studies/year in 2012-2018.
   Method: We synthesized 41 controlled intervention studies (N = 2,374; from 01/2012 to 03/2018), 21 from DMT, and 20 from dance, investigating the outcome clusters of quality of life, clinical outcomes (with sub-analyses of depression and anxiety), interpersonal skills, cognitive skills, and (psycho-) motor skills. We included recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in areas such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, elderly patients, oncology, neurology, chronic heart failure, and cardiovascular disease, including follow-up data in eight studies.
   Results: Analyses yielded a medium overall effect (d(2) = 0.60), with high heterogeneity of results (I-2 = 72.62%). Sorted by outcome clusters, the effects were medium to large (d = 0.53 to d = 0.85). All effects, except the one for (psycho-) motor skills, showed high inconsistency of results. Sensitivity analyses revealed that type of intervention (DMT or dance) was a significant moderator of results. In the DMT cluster, the overall mediumeffect was small, significant, and homogeneous/consistent (d = 0.30, p < 0.001, I (2) = 3.47). In the dance intervention cluster, the overall medium effect was large, significant, yet heterogeneous/non-consistent (d = 0.81, p < 0.001, I-2 = 77.96). Results suggest that DMT decreases depression and anxiety and increases quality of life and interpersonal and cognitive skills, whereas dance interventions increase (psycho-) motor skills. Larger effect sizes resulted from observational measures, possibly indicating bias. Follow-up data showed that on 22 weeks after the intervention, most effects remained stable or slightly increased.
   Discussion: Consistent effects of DMT coincide with findings from former meta-analyses. Most dance intervention studies came from preventive contexts and most DMT studies came from institutional healthcare contexts with more severely impaired clinical patients, where we found smaller effects, yet with higher clinical relevance. Methodological shortcomings of many included studies and heterogeneity of outcome measures limit results. Initial findings on long-term effects are promising.

AB  - A full understanding of Parkinson's Disease etiopathogenesis and of the causes of the preferential vulnerability of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is still an unsolved puzzle. A multiple-hit hypothesis has been proposed, which may explain the convergence of familial, environmental and idiopathic forms of the disease. Among the various determinants of the degeneration of the neurons in Substantia Nigra pars compacta, in this review we will focus on the endotoxicity associated to dopamine dyshomeostasis. In particular, we will discuss the relevance of the reactive dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) in the catechol-induced neurotoxicity. Indeed, the synergy between the catechol and the aldehyde moieties of DOPAL exacerbates its reactivity, resulting in modification of functional protein residues, protein aggregation, oxidative stress and cell death. Interestingly, alpha Synuclein, whose altered proteostasis is a recurrent element in Parkinson's Disease pathology, is considered a preferential target of DOPAL modification. DOPAL triggers alpha Synuclein oligomerization leading to synapse physiology impairment. Several factors can be responsible for DOPAL accumulation at the pre-synaptic terminals, i.e. dopamine leakage from synaptic vesicles, increased rate of dopamine conversion to DOPAL by upregulated monoamine oxidase and decreased DOPAL degradation by aldehyde dehydrogenases. Various studies report the decreased expression and activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases in parkinsonian brains, as well as genetic variants associated to increased risk in developing the pathology. Thus, we discuss how the deregulation of these enzymes might be considered a contributing element in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease or a down-stream effect. Finally, we propose that a better understanding of the impaired dopamine metabolism in Parkinson's Disease would allow a more refined patients stratification and the design of more targeted and successful therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Background Hairdressers are exposed to various work-related biomechanical and organizational risk factors. To date, there has been no overview of the evidence for this occupational group. The purpose of this scoping review is to gain insight into the current state of research on work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) in hairdressing. Methods Studies published up to November 2018 were identified by a systematic search using electronic databases (MEDLINE, PUBMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, LIVIVO), Google Scholar and reference lists of articles. Studies were screened by two researchers and synthesized in a descriptive manner. Results Overall 44 studies with different study designs, scopes and approaches were included. Nineteen studies provided data on MSD prevalence in at least one body site. The prevalence values between the studies varied considerably. On average, the highest 12-month prevalence was reported for the lower back (range 13-76%), neck (range 9-58%), shoulder (range 28-60%) and hand/wrist (range 11-53%). In comparison to other occupational groups, hairdressers reported more frequent MSD in all body regions or exhibited a greater risk of leaving the profession for health reasons. Common risk factors include working with arms above shoulder level, repetitive movements, forceful exertion of upper extremities, awkward back postures and movements, high mechanical workload and standing. In addition to physical stress, lack of adequate breaks, overtime, and general distress may deteriorate health and performance of hairdressers. Three rehabilitative and three preventive interventional studies were found. Only the rehabilitative studies showed positive effects on the management of physical and mental strain and resulted in significant pain reduction, increased physical capacity and knowledge of potential risk factors for MSD. Conclusion This data provides some evidence for work-related risk factors for MSD in hairdressers and indicate that there should be an intense focus on preventive measures. High quality and long-term interventional studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of complex preventive concepts in hairdressing.

AB  - Non-intervention-related effects have long been recognized in an array of medical interventions, to which surgical procedures like deep-brain stimulation are no exception. While the existence of placebo and micro-lesion effects has been convincingly demonstrated in DBS for major depression and Parkinson's disease, systematic investigations for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are currently lacking. We therefore undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis with the aim of quantifying the effect of DBS for severe, treatment-resistant OCD that is not due to the electrical stimulation of brain tissue. The MEDLINE/PubMed database was searched for double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trials published in English between 1998 and 2018. Individual patient data was obtained from the original authors and combined in a meta-analysis. We assessed differences from baseline in obsessive-compulsive symptoms following sham treatment, as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Four studies met the inclusion criteria, randomizing 49 patients to two periods of active or sham stimulation. To preclude confounding by period effects, our estimate was based only on data from those patients who underwent sham stimulation first (n = 24). We found that sham stimulation induced a significant change in the Y-BOCS score (t = -3.15, P < 0.005), lowering it by 4.9 +/- 1.6 points [95% CI = (-8.0, -1.8)]. We conclude that non-stimulation-related effects of DBS exist also in OCD. The identification of the factors determining the magnitude and occurrence of these effects will help to design strategies that will ultimately lead to a betterment of future randomized clinical trials.

AB  - Background: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an efficacious treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), however there is limited safety and efficacy data in the peripartum period. The purpose of this review is to systematically examine the safety, acceptability and effectiveness of rTMS administered during the peripartum period as an intervention for MDD.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO from 2008 to January 2019 to identify peer reviewed publications evaluating rTMS during the peripartum period as an intervention for peripartum MDD. We systematically extracted reported adverse events, side effects, rates of discontinuation, as well as clinical response and remission.
   Results: Data was synthesized from 1 randomized control trial, 3 uncontrolled trials, 3 case series and 5 case studies, representing a total of 87 patients. No serious adverse events were reported. Side effects occurred at rates comparable to those observed in the non-peripartum population, and obstetric and neonatal complications are infrequent and do not separate from sham-rTMS. Randomized controlled data suggests antidepressant efficacy with an effect size of 0.87. Uncontrolled studies report rates of clinical response between 41.4% and 71.4%, and rates of clinical remission between 20.7 and 30.0%. The treatment appears acceptable, with few patients opting to discontinue treatment.
   Limitations: Due to the paucity of research in this population, majority of data comes from sources with inherently higher risk of bias.
   Conclusions: rTMS in the peripartum period appears to be efficacious, acceptable and well tolerated. Additional research is required, however rTMS's risk benefit profile may be attractive to women in the peripartum period.

AB  - There is a pressing need for better pharmacological treatment strategies for psychiatric disorders as current treatment often results in partial symptom remission and unwanted side effects. A point of entry may be the glutamatergic system since glutamatergic dysregulation contributes to multiple psychiatric disorders. We evaluated the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the use of the glutamatergic drug riluzole in mental illnesses; and conducted preliminary meta-analyses of its effectiveness in treating obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression.
   A systematic search was performed using PubMed (Medline), Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PsycINFO. Meta-analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.
   Twenty-three RCTs were included for qualitative analysis and showed positive effects of adjunctive/monotherapy riluzole in patients with OCD, depression, autism, substance abuse and schizophrenia. Seven studies were also used for quantitative analysis, which revealed positive but non-significant effects on OCD and depression. Riluzole was generally well tolerated with few serious adverse events.
   The studies included in this systematic review were highly heterogeneous and the number of studies was limited per diagnostic condition. Moreover, few studies have examined riluzole as a single treatment. We suggest carrying out further work to provide definitive evidence for the benefit of riluzole in psychiatric illness.

AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a mounting public health problem with substantial morbidity and mortality. Stress involvement in the course of OUD is generally accepted, but little is understood about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms in part due to a lack of laboratory-based models for chronic stress exposure. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be construed as a psychopathological prototype of chronic stress owing to the essential diagnostic criteria of experiencing and reliving a stressful event(s). Literature search on OUD and PTSD neurobiology was undertaken and the relevant data were integrated within four key areas: (1) OUD and PTSD comorbidity; (2) neurobiological overlap between OUD and PTSD; (3) chronic opioids- and stress-induced alterations of the reward-, stress- (i.e., "anti-reward") and related circuits and (4) mechanistically informed treatments of OUD and/or PTSD. Our findings suggest that even in the absence of prior opioid exposure PTSD patients may be susceptible for the development of OUD by the reason of similar (to those induced by opioids) reward alterations that may be targeted for therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Background The cortisol awakening response (CAR) is characterised by an increase in cortisol in the 30 to 60 min after waking. Research has found significant associations between an atypical CAR and symptoms of stress and anxiety in typically developing (TD) children and adolescents. A number of studies have explored the CAR in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but no evidence synthesis is available to date. Objective and methods Based on a preregistered protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42017051187), we carried out a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) of CAR studies to explore potential significant differences between children and adolescents with ASD and TD controls. Web of Science, PubMed and PsychInfo were searched until January 2019. A random-effects model was used to pool studies and we used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) to assess study quality and risk of bias. Findings The SR retrieved a total of nine studies, with mixed findings on the comparison of the CAR between children and adolescents with ASD and TD controls. The MA, based on four studies (ASD; n=117 and TD n=118), suggested no differences between the CAR in ASD and TD populations (SMD: -0.21, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.08). In terms of NOS items, no study specified Representativeness of the cases and Non-response rate. Discussion and clinical implications Given the relatively few studies and lack of appropriately matched TD controls, additional research is needed to further understand and recommend the utility of the CAR as a reliable marker to differentiate ASD and TD.

AB  - PurposePeople with personality disorders have significantly reduced life expectancy and increased rates of cardiovascular disease compared to members of the general population. Given that more people die annually of cardiovascular disease across the globe than from any other cause, it is important to identify the evidence for interventions aimed at improving cardiovascular health among people with personality disorders.MethodsSystematic literature review. PsycINFO, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched using NICE Healthcare Databases, as well as CENTRAL and trial registries. We sought to identify randomised controlled trials of interventions pertaining to adults with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder, where the primary outcome measure was cardiovascular health before and after the intervention.ResultsA total of 1740 records were identified and screened by two independent reviewers. No papers meeting the inclusion criteria were identified.ConclusionsThis systematic review did not identify any randomised controlled trials testing interventions aimed at improving the cardiovascular health of people with personality disorders. Research in this area could have important public health implications, spanning the fields of psychiatry and general medicine.

AB  - Background: Several studies have shown cerebellar abnormalities during depressive and manic states, although the specific cerebellar role in mood fluctuations remains poorly defined. Therefore, the study of pathologies characterized by frequent mood swings, such as bipolar disorder, is of great interest to investigate the relationship between the cerebellum and mood alterations.
   Methods: A systematic literature search on the occurrence of mood disorders in patients with cerebellar pathologies (1st research strategy) and on the presence of cerebellar alterations in mood disorders (2nd research strategy) was conducted using the PubMed electronic Internet database. For this systematic review all information was written based on the PRISMA-P statement.
   Results: The results of the 1st research strategy generated 9 articles, and in one of these, a direct correlation between cerebellar damage and the onset of mood disorder was reported. The 2nd research strategy generated 14 articles that were grouped according to the patient's mood phase (manic or depressive) or diagnosis (bipolar I or bipolar II).
   Conclusions: The present review suggests that the cerebellum should be considered a key structure involved in the regulation of mood.

AB  - Light exerts a major influence on human behaviour and health, mainly owing to the importance of sight in our lives, but also due to its entrainment of daily rhythms via the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master pacemaker. Light may also be a useful clinical medium, as in lumino-therapy for the improvement of depressed mood. Further, as discussed herein, local application of near infrared light to the substantia nigra exerts neuroprotective properties in models of Parkinson's disease. However, light also has a darker side. In general, as regards the growing problem to human health - and the natural world - of excess exposure to artificial light: both urban glow and ubiquitous screens. Moreover, over-exposure to light, in particular fluorescent light, disrupts circadian rhythms and sleep, and may damage dopaminergic neurons. Is it, then, a neglected risk factor for Parkinson's disease? The present article discusses epidemiological and experimental evidence supporting beneficial and potentially deleterious impact of light on dopaminergic neurons and highlights the mechanisms whereby light might influence neuronal tissue.

AB  - Among the factors that are thought to underlie gambling problems, alexithymia has been recognized to contribute to their development. For the first time, we reviewed the literature on the relationship between alexithymia and gambling. A systematic search of literature was run in the major reference databases including PubMed, Cochrane Database for Systematic Review, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus until April 2019. The search produced 182 articles that produced 20 papers included in the review. Fourteen studies were conducted with community samples of pathological gamblers while six studies with clinical samples of disordered gamblers. All studies assessed alexithymia with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale while gambling problems were assessed mostly with the South Oaks Gambling Screen. Alexithymic features were significantly more prevalent in pathological gamblers both at the community and clinical levels, increased symptom severity, and showed interactive mechanisms with personality, psychiatric, and cognitive factors. Alexithymia is likely to associate with gambling as a coping behavior to increase emotional arousal and avoid negative emotions, according to the affect dysregulation model. Further studies are needed to widen the knowledge on this association.

AB  - Lithium is among the best proven treatments for patients diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, however response to Lithium appears to be considerably variable among individuals and it has been suggested that this inconstancy in Lithium response could be genetically determined. Starting from this perspective, in the last few decades, a number of pharmacogenetic studies have attempted to identify genetic variants, which might be associated with response to Lithium in bipolar patients, in order to develop a pharmacogenetics test to tailor treatment on patients, identifying who will benefit the most from therapy with Lithium. Within this context, authors have critically reviewed pharmacogenetic studies of Lithium response in bipolar disorder, suggesting strategies for future work in this field. Computerized searches of PubMed and Embase databases, for studies published between 1998 and January 2018, was performed: 1162 studies were identified but only 37 relevant papers were selected for detailed review. Despite some interesting preliminary findings, the pharmacogenetics of Lithium and the development of a specific pharmacogenetics test in bipolar disorder appears to be a field still in its infancy, even though the advent of genome-wide association studies holds particular promise for future studies, which should include larger samples.

AB  - Indices based on community structure provide a global ecological status of the biological communities but they are of limited value as early-warning indicators of contamination. Almost two decades after the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) was adopted, we reviewed publications that measured biomarkers in benthic macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring programmes of fluvial systems. The focus was on studies that attempted to incorporate both biomarkers and community-based approaches in the evaluation of the ecological status of rivers and streams. Overall, the data showed that biomarker measurements in benthic macroinvertebrate species can offer complementary information on the factors threatening these communities. This information is particularly useful for water authorities, in order to take actions before a system collapses into a state from which recovery is difficult or impossible. Gaps in need to be addressed for rapid and efficient implementation of biomarkers in benthic macroinvertebrates in routine wide-scale monitoring are discussed. In particular, site-specific baselines have to be defined, taking into account the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on these biochemical responses. Further studies, including different biomarkers, environmental stressors, macroinvertebrate taxa and river types, will provide crucial information on how to establish adequate biomarker strategies to indicate future ecological damage.

AB  - Question Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent childhood mental disorders. They also start early and persist, causing high individual and collective costs. To inform policy and practice, we therefore asked: What is the best available research evidence on preventing and treating these disorders? Methods We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions addressing anxiety problems in young people. We identified RCTs by searching CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Thirty-three RCTs met inclusion criteria-evaluating 8 prevention programmes, 12 psychosocial treatments and 7 pharmacological treatments. We then conducted meta-analyses by intervention type. Findings For prevention, the cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) programme Coping and Promoting Strength stood out for reducing anxiety diagnoses. For psychosocial treatment, 9 CBT interventions also reduced diagnoses: Cool Kids; Cool Little Kids Plus Social Skills; Coping Cat; Coping Koala; One-Session Treatment; Parent Education Program; Skills for Academic and Social Success; Strongest Families and Timid to Tiger. Successful CBT interventions were used with children ranging from pre-schoolers to teens in homes, communities/schools and clinics. For pharmacological treatment, selective-serotonergic-reuptake-inhibitors (SSRIs) significantly improved symptoms. Fluoxetine stood out for also reducing post-test diagnoses, but caused adverse events. Meta-analyses indicated strongest effects for CBT (Log OR=0.95; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21) and SSRI treatments (1.57; 1.09 to 2.06). Conclusions CBT is effective for preventing and treating childhood anxiety-across a range of ages and formats. Fluoxetine is also an effective treatment but side effects must be managed. CBT prevention and treatment interventions should be made widely available, adding fluoxetine in severe cases.

AB  - Aim Resilience is rapidly gaining momentum in mental health literature. It provides a new understanding of the highly variable trajectories of mental illness, and has consistently been linked with improved mental health outcomes. The present review aims to clarify the definition of resilience and to discuss new directions for the field. Methods After discussing the definition of resilience, this narrative review synthesizes evidence that identifies the specific protective factors involved in this process. This review also addresses the mechanisms that underlie resilience. Results Recent literature has clarified the three core components of resilience, which are the presence of an adversity or specific risk for mental illness; the influence of protective factors that supersede this risk; and finally, a subsequently more positive outcome than expected. Now that these are largely agreed upon, the field should move on to addressing other topics. Resilience is a dynamic process by which individuals utilize protective factors and resources to their benefit. It can vary within one individual across time and circumstance. It can also refer to good functional outcomes in the context of diagnosable illness. While previous research has focused on psychological resilience, it is essential that resilience is conceptualized across modalities. Conclusions The field should move towards the development of a multimodal model of resilience. Researchers should now focus on producing empirical research which clarifies the specific protective factors and mechanisms of the process, aligning with the core concepts of resilience. This growing, more homogeneous evidence base, can then inform new intervention strategies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to provide a summary estimate of depression prevalence among people with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in comparison to those without AS. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, the Cochrane database library China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Database from their inception to December 2016. The results showed that thirty-one eligible studies involving 8,106 patients were analyzed. Fifteen methods of defining depression were reported. The overall pooled prevalence of depression was 35% (95% CI, 28-43%), with high between-study heterogeneity (I-2 =98.8%, p<0.001). The relative risk of depression among people with AS was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.21-2.55, eight studies, n=3,006) compared with people without AS. The depression score [standardized mean difference (SMD)=0.43, 95% CI: 0.19-0.67, seven studies, n=549] was higher in AS patients than in controls. The main influence on depression prevalence was the sample size and country of origin. In conclusion, one-third of people with AS experience symptoms of depression. Depression was more prevalent in AS patients than in controls. Further research is needed to identify effective strategies for preventing and treating depression among AS patients.

AB  - BackgroundShift work is common. However, research findings are mixed regarding the impact of shift work on mental health. This systematic review sought to provide a comprehensive summary of existing research examining the association between different types of shift work and mental health. The review included large-scale, non-occupation-specific research.MethodsFour electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and SCOPUS were searched to identify studies that reported on the statistical association between shift work and mental health and that used population-based samples. Two reviewers extracted information about study characteristics and data on the association between shift work and mental health. A meta-analysis was performed for longitudinal studies adopting a broad binary' measure of shift work.ResultsThirty-three studies were included in the final review-10 cross-sectional studies, 22 longitudinal studies, and 1 study that included both. Findings were grouped based on whether the measure of shift work focussed on: (1) night/evening work, (2) weekend work, (3) irregular/unpredictable work schedule, or (4) a broad binary measure. There was a reasonable level of evidence that overall, when a broad binary measure was adopted, shift work was associated with poorer mental health-this finding was supported by the meta-analysis results. There was also some evidence that irregular/unpredictable work was associated with poorer mental health. There was less evidence for night/evening and minimal evidence for weekend work. Inconsistencies in study methodology, limited contrasting and combining the results.ConclusionsThe association between shift work and mental health is different across types of shift work. The evidence is strongest for a broad binary, general measure of shift work and for irregular or unpredictable shift work. There is a need for continued research that adopts consistent and clear measures of shift work.

AB  - Objective: Suicide is a growing public health concern with a global prevalence of approximately 800,000 deaths per year. The current process of evaluating suicide risk is highly subjective, which can limit the efficacy and accuracy of prediction efforts. Consequently, suicide detection strategies are shifting toward artificial intelligence platforms that can identify patterns within 'big data' to generate risk algorithms that can determine the effects of risk (and protective) factors on suicide outcomes, predict suicide outbreaks and identify at-risk individuals or populations. In this review, we summarize the role of artificial intelligence in optimizing suicide risk prediction and behavior management. Methods: This paper provides a general review of the literature. A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases with coverage from January 1990 to June 2019. Results were restricted to peer-reviewed, English-language articles. Conference and dissertation proceedings, case reports, protocol papers and opinion pieces were excluded. Reference lists were also examined for additional articles of relevance. Results: At the individual level, prediction analytics help to identify individuals in crisis to intervene with emotional support, crisis and psychoeducational resources, and alerts for emergency assistance. At the population level, algorithms can identify at-risk groups or suicide hotspots, which help inform resource mobilization, policy reform and advocacy efforts. Artificial intelligence has also been used to support the clinical management of suicide across diagnostics and evaluation, medication management and behavioral therapy delivery. There could be several advantages of incorporating artificial intelligence into suicide care, which includes a time- and resource-effective alternative to clinician-based strategies, adaptability to various settings and demographics, and suitability for use in remote locations with limited access to mental healthcare supports. Conclusion: Based on the observed benefits to date, artificial intelligence has a demonstrated utility within suicide prediction and clinical management efforts and will continue to advance mental healthcare forward.

AB  - Objective: This review examines the evidence from head-to-head randomised controlled trials addressing whether the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorders in adults delivered by computer or online (computer- and Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy) is not inferior to in-person cognitive-behavioural therapy for reducing levels of symptoms and producing clinically significant gains at post-treatment and at follow-up. A supplementary aim is to examine the evidence for severity as a moderator of the relative efficacy of computer- and Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy and in-person cognitive-behavioural therapy. Method: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane database of randomised trials were searched for randomised controlled trials of cognitive-behavioural therapy for these disorders with at least an in-person cognitive-behavioural therapy and Internet or computer cognitive-behavioural therapy arm. Results: A total of 14 randomised controlled trials (9 Internet, 5 computer) of cognitive-behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and specific phobia and 3 reports of effect moderators were included. One study showed a low risk of bias when assessed against risk of bias criteria for non-inferiority trials. The remaining studies were assessed as high or unclear risk of bias. One study found that Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy was superior and non-inferior at post-treatment and follow-up to group in-person cognitive-behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder. One study of Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy for panic disorder showed non-inferiority to individual in-person cognitive-behavioural therapy for responder status at post-treatment and one of Internet cognitive-behavioural therapy for panic disorder for symptom severity at follow-up. Other comparisons (22 Internet, 13 computer) and for estimates pooled for Internet cognitive-behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder, Internet cognitive-behavioural therapy for panic disorder and computer-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy studies did not support non-inferiority. Evidence of effect moderation by severity and co-morbidity was mixed. Conclusion: There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials which supports claims that computer- or Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders is not inferior to in-person delivery. Randomised controlled trials properly designed to test non-inferiority are needed before conclusions about the relative benefits of in-person and Internet- and computer-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy can be made.

AB  - The concept of intersectionality has gradually been introduced to health inequality research, adding depth and breadth to the way inequalities in health are approached. We conducted a scoping review with the purpose to systematically map, describe and analyze the literature about intersectional inequalities in mental health. For eligibility, the study had to analyze and report inequality defined by combinations of socioeconomic position, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation or religion. The mental health outcome had to be measured as self-reported symptoms assessed through validated scales, or disorders assessed through diagnostic interviews. The search strategy was applied in two databases and the screening process yielded 20 studies. The interaction of intersectional positions showed no consistent patterns in mental health across studies, but both synergistic and antagonistic effects were observed. In most studies an absolute measure of inequality was used and few studies analyzed factors potentially explaining the intersectional inequalities. Taken together, the findings of this review highlight the value of assessing intersectional inequalities across population groups for priority setting and action on mental health inequalities.

The objective is to update knowledge about coping strategies used by people with a FEP, to compare these strategies with those used by other mental disorders, and to examine the relationship between coping strategies and other variables in FEP. Method A search was conducted using PsycINFO, MEDLINE and PSICODOC between 1995 and 2018 using the following terms: coping strategies or Adaptation, Psychological and FEP. Results A total of 167 studies were found, of which 14 were selected for review. The results suggest the need for a multiple and integrated approach, since there are several factors that are involved in the coping strategies (eg, socio-demographic, clinical and psychological variables) used in the different profiles of psychotic spectrum, specifically in FEP. Conclusions The role of coping skills is an important issue in psychopathological research in addition to clinical outcome, especially from the point of view of the patients, their social context and their recovery. Moreover, personalized therapies addressed to personal recovery should be considered to develop better coping specifically addressed to patients' needs.

AB  - Since Salovey and Mayer (1990) first proposed the emotional intelligence (EI) as an independent intellectual component, research on the field of EI has developed rapidly. A large number of studies have shown that emotional intelligence is an important predictor that affects our lives, such as job performance, mental health, and so on. However, we observed that some effect sizes in the field of emotional intelligence decreased over time. Is this kind of decline simply due to random errors, or is emotional intelligence field undergoing decline effects? The present study analyzed 484 effect sizes based on the responses of 102,579 participants from nine meta-analyses in emotional intelligence field to estimate the average effect size, and evidence for decline effects in this field. This study finds that the average effect size of EI is 0.244 (p < 0.001), and the average effect size of mixed EI (r = 0.272, p < 0.001) is significantly higher than that of ability EI (r = 0.160, p < 0.001). Effect sizes in the field of EI decrease with time, there are decline effects in emotional intelligence field. Furthermore, there are also decline effects in mixed EI field. However, we find no evidence that there are decline effects in ability EI field. Base on the significant average effect size of mixed EI, the most likely explanation for the decline in effect sizes is that effect sizes of mixed EI in the original studies were overestimate. This study considers decline effects in mixed EI research as inflated decline effects. To sum up, decline effects in the field of emotional intelligence are mainly due to the choice of emotional intelligence model and measurement method.

AB  - Anxiety has long been associated with diminished performance within a number of domains involving evaluative interpersonal interactions, including Sex, Sport, and Stage. Here, we pose three questions: (1) how do these disparate fields approach and understand anxiety and performance; (2) how does the understanding of the issue within one field offer insight to another field; and (3) how could each field benefit from the ideas and strategies used by the others. We begin with a short review of models of anxiety/arousal and performance and then explore definitions, models, presumed underlying physiological processes, and characterizing and influencing factors within each domain separately in a narrative review. This discussion is followed by a synthesis that identifies elements specific to and common across the various domains, with the latter captured in a model of essential characteristics. Concluding remarks note the potential value of promoting increased cross-disciplinary conversation and research, with each domain likely benefiting from the conceptualizations and expert knowledge of the others.

AB  - Aim This paper aims to investigate the extent to which mindfulness-based interventions serve to reduce anxiety in children and adolescents. A heterogeneous sample was used, including clinical and non-clinical population. Methods A literature search of controlled intervention studies published up to December 31, 2016, was carried out in PubMed, Lilacs, Cochrane, Embase, PsycInfo, Opengrey and Teseo databases. The effect size was calculated by Cohen's d. The Cochran Q statistic and the I-2 index were used for the study of heterogeneity. An analysis was conducted using the random effects model. Results 829 articles were identified, of which 18 were finally selected. Of these, only three had statistically significant effect sizes. The overall combined result obtained was .013, but it did not result statistically significant (CI95% [-.102, .128].) The Q statistic was statistically significant (Q [18] = 28.497, P = . 39) and the I-2 index was 40.34%, indicating a moderate heterogeneity. Conclusions This meta-analysis did not obtain statistically significant results that could provide conclusions. In general, the studies analysed are small, of low power and have a marked heterogeneity, which implies that the findings are provisional and need to be supported by more robust studies. Although it cannot be ruled out that mindfulness-based interventions are not effective in the infant-juvenile population, it is also possible that this effect could not be detected due to the limited number of available studies. Larger investigations are needed, with sufficient statistical power and designs that control the variables potentially moderating, to establish clear conclusions.

AB  - Background: Fear of childbirth is a common feeling among expectant mothers. Although it represents a physiological expression of women's concerns, it can become a clinical condition compromising the woman's daily activities as well as her coping strategies during labour and delivery. Research has focused on adverse intrapartum and postpartum outcomes of fear of childbirth. As regards intrapartum outcomes, some studies have investigated the association between fear of childbirth and type of delivery, with contrasting results. Objective: This study aimed at reviewing the literature on the association between fear of childbirth and emergency caesarean section delivery. Method: This systematic review was based on an electronic search of English-language published studies through 31 December 2018. Following the search process, 14 studies were included. Studies were analysed specifically considering the sample parity and tools for evaluating fears. Results: These studies revealed that both sample characteristics and assessment instruments are not criteria for explaining the different result. Conclusions: The importance of distinguishing between fear and severe fear was highlighted because the effect of fear on the type of delivery was present only for clinical fear. However, the different cut-off values did not make it possible to reach a clear result, making further investigation necessary.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Depression, which is the most common comorbidity in breast cancer (BC) patients, has adverse effects on patients' quality of life, disease progress, and survival.
   METHODS: The protocol of this study was registered in PROSPERO (registration No. CRD42019121494). We electronically searched published studies through January 2019 with the aim of finding articles that investigated the prevalence of depression among BC survivors. Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were searched to obtain relevant published studies. This review included 14 cross-sectional and 4 cohort studies published from 2000 to 2018. We used a random-effects model to conduct the meta-analysis and generated a summary estimate for the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A subgroup analysis was also conducted based on the depression assessment tool used and the study design.
   RESULTS: The total sample size of the studies contained 2,799 women with BC, including 1,228 women who were diagnosed with depression. The pooled prevalence of depression among Iranian women with BC was 46.83% (95% CI, 33.77 to 59.88) with significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 98.5%; p<0.001). The prevalence of depression ranged from 14.00% (95% CI, 4.91 to 23.09) to 95.90% (95% CI, 91.97 to 99.83). The results of the subgroup analyses suggested that the depression assessment tool, year of publication, and study design were sources of heterogeneity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a high prevalence of depression among BC patients, underscoring the urgent need for clinicians and health authorities to provide well-defined social and psychological supportive care programs for these patients.

AB  - In order to provide insight for employers in maintaining a mentally healthy and productive workforce, it is essential to understand how bereaved employees experience workplace support. A global literature search was conducted between February 2018 and April 2018, resulting in 15 papers directly matching stipulated inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three common themes emerged from the data, namely Instrumental Support, Informational Support and Emotional Support. Findings suggest that while various employers endeavoured to show sympathy and flexibility to bereaved employees, others were found to be less responsive with certain areas of workplace support being reported as insufficient.

AB  - Objective: Mobile apps provide opportunities for innovative, accessible and attractive support of adolescent mental health. Although preliminary research evaluates the effectiveness of specific apps for various conditions, the way in which apps are being used to support adolescent mental health and the role of particular app functions are not well understood. This study presents a systematic scoping review exploring app functionality and delivery method used in treating adolescent mental health concerns. Method: A systematic search of health sciences databases including Medline, PubMed and PsycInfo was undertaken in March, 2017. Seven studies were identified totalling 806 participants (531 females, 253 males, and 22 identifying as trans/intersex, or other) with a combined M-age of 16.06 years, and a range of mental health issues and conditions including anorexia nervosa, obesity, emotional and general mental health concerns. Results: App functionality included monitoring, assessment, psychoeducation and skills practice. Apps were used independent of ongoing practitioner support in all studies. Apps were used for intake, assessment and intervention. Overall, app use was reported as beneficial. Discussion: Function-based categorisation of apps permits practitioners to consider and select apps that 'fit' best with individualised, evidence-based practice approaches. Limitations of independent use are identified and discussed, and recommendations for adjunctive use (i.e. alongside ongoing practitioner support) are presented. Clinical recommendations and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - Introduction: The present paper aims to identify and characterize studies that assess the repercussions of parental rearing styles on development of psychopathological symptoms and to examine the possible relations between parental rearing behaviors and development of early maladaptive schemas (EMS).
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted on the PsychNet, BVS, Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed databases for empirical studies published up to 2018 in Portuguese, English, or Spanish that investigated and characterized the effects of parental rearing styles.
   Results: The electronic search identified 321 articles on the various different databases, only 22 of which met the criteria for inclusion and were read in full. Correlations were found between EMS and maternal rejection, parental rearing styles and depression in the studies. EMS were also found to act as mediators in the relationship between parental rearing styles and/or education and dysfunctional symptoms during personality development.
   Conclusions: In the studies selected, parental rearing styles stood out from other variables that influence personality development and activation of schematic patterns. It is therefore important to highlight the importance of conducting studies in this area to provide information that can promote care and prevention strategies in early childhood.

AB  - Antidepressant drugs are a standard biological treatment for various neuropsychiatric disorders, yet relatively little is known about their electrophysiologic and synaptic effects on mood systems that set moment-to-moment emotional tone. In vivo electrical recording of local field potentials (LFPs) and single neuron spiking has been crucial for elucidating important details of neural processing and control in many other systems, and yet electrical approaches have not been broadly applied to the actions of antidepressants on mood-related circuits. Here we review the literature encompassing electrophysiologic effects of antidepressants in animals, including studies that examine older drugs, and extending to more recently synthesized novel compounds, as well as rapidly acting antidepressants. The existing studies on neuromodulator-based drugs have focused on recording in the brainstem nuclei, with much less known about their effects on prefrontal or sensory cortex. Studies on neuromodulatory drugs have moreover focused on single unit firing patterns with less emphasis on LFPs, whereas the rapidly acting antidepressant literature shows the opposite trend. In a synthesis of this information, we hypothesize that all classes of antidepressants could have common final effects on limbic circuitry. Whereas NMDA receptor blockade may induce a high powered gamma oscillatory state via direct and fast alteration of glutamatergic systems in mood-related circuits, neuromodulatory antidepressants may induce similar effects over slower timescales, corresponding with the timecourse of response in patients, while resetting synaptic excitatory versus inhibitory signaling to a normal level. Thus, gamma signaling may provide a biomarker (or neural readout) of the therapeutic effects of all classes of antidepressants.

AB  - Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is indicated for critical psychiatric conditions, which themselves constitute a risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) owing to prolonged immobility, dehydration, and venous stasis. Objective: We describe challenging instances of ECT implementation while taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Method: We report on 8 patients receiving DOACs for DVT who were successfully treated with ECT at the University of Yamanashi Hospital. We also provide a literature review on this topic. Results: There were 6 female patients (the average age was 60.9+/-13.4 y.o.) and diagnoses included major depression, bipolar depression and schizophrenia. DOACs were edoxaban for 4 patients, rivaroxaban for 2, and apixaban for 2. A total of 92 ECT sessions were cautiously and safely completed in collaboration with multidisciplinary medical professionals without problematic adverse events, such as bleeding. A literature search found one case series of warfarin but currently available evidence is confined to sporadic case reports regarding ECT and DOACs for DVT. These reports were represented by successful implementation of ECT to patients receiving treatment with anticoagulants for DVT or thromboembolism. Ours is the first of a successful treatment with ECT while taking apixaban or edoxaban. Conclusion: A clinical dilemma is that ECT is indicated for critical conditions that are likely to predispose patients to developing DVT. Paucity of data clearly highlights the need for more studies to support a contention that ECT, when carefully performed in consultation with other medical experts, is a viable treatment for those with DVT receiving oral anticoagulants.

AB  - Plants produce and release a vast variety of secondary metabolites with diversified functions, and possess ecological, toxicological and biological effects that mimic the activities of synthetic chemicals. Coumarins extracted from bacteria, fungi and many edible plants are widely used for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-HIV and anticancer activities. This review presents a concise summary based on the latest knowledge of the biological and pharmaceutical uses of coumarin and its derivatives, including an evaluation of future therapeutic potential. The presence of coumarins in various plant organs like fruits, seeds, roots, leaves and latex supplement recent work reported in scientific literature related to these compounds and their development. Due to low production in plants, the upscaling and industrial scale production, commercialization and industry demand of coumarins has faced hurdles. We searched Google Scholar and Web of Science for relevant literature upto 2018 using the keywords pharmaceutical, biological activities and coumarins. This review has thoroughly overviewed the related facts and figures about coumarins and its derivatives, especially in terms of biological and pharmaceutical properties including anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-diabetic, anticoagulant, estrogenic, dermal photosensitizing, vasodilator, molluscacidal, antithelmintic, sedative and hypnotic, analgesic, hypothermic, anti-cancer activity, anti-oxidant, anti-parasitic, antihelmintic, anti-proliferative, anti-convulsant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypertensive activities. The pharmaceutical impact of coumarins on public health is a complex phenomenon, with several questions in relation to safety during medical therapies and consumption through diet. The present review focuses on coumarin clinical studies in the treatment of various chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, depression, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV. However, further research and review are necessary to broaden the therapeutic effectiveness of coumarin in patients suffering from such ailments.

   Methods: A systematic literature review was performed in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, aiming to identify original research evaluating GAD patients with the use of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as diffusion tensor imaging.
   Results: The available studies have shown impairments in ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, posterior parietal regions, and amygdala in both pediatric and adult GAD patients, mostly in the right hemisphere. However, the literature is often tentative, given that most studies have employed small samples and included patients with comorbidities or in current use of various medications. Finally, different methodological aspects, such as the type of imaging equipment used, also complicate the generalizability of the findings.
   Conclusions: Longitudinal neuroimaging studies with larger samples of both juvenile and adult GAD patients, as well as at risk individuals and unaffected relatives, should be carried out in order to shed light on the specific biological signature of GAD.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to consider the factors that influence fatigue related to physical activity in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and to identify the necessary adaptations undertaken by patients to remain active. A review using a thematic synthesis methodology situated within a subtle realist paradigm was undertaken. The review was completed in three stages: 1) search of relevant studies; 2) critical appraisal of literature; and 3) thematic synthesis. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. This included a total of 263 participants of whom 243 were PwMS (159 females, 70 males and 14 unknown). The aggregated mean age was 53.3 years and aggregated mean time living with MS post diagnosis 11.3 years. Following critical appraisal, no articles were excluded. Three major themes were identified: (1) fatigue-related consequences, (2) exercise related barriers affecting fatigue, and (3) factors that make fatigue bearable for MS individuals. The thematic synthesis identified the cycle of activity and inactivity as a result of fatigue perception. Exercise experience, professional and social support, as well as the necessary adaptation of a training programme empower PwMS to adopt a more active coping strategy and enjoy the benefits of exercise. Clinicians could consider the implementation of a suitable, individualised exercise programme to reduce PwMS's stress during physical activities.

AB  - Environmental stressors, such as childhood maltreatment, have been recognized to contribute to the develop. ment of depression. Growing evidence suggests that epigenetic changes are a key mechanism by which stressors interact with the genome leading to stable changes in DNA structure, gene expression, and behaviour. The current review aimed to evaluate the relationship between stress-associated epigenetic changes and depression. Human studies were identified via systematic searching of PubMed/Medline from inception to February 2018. Seventeen articles were identified. Stress-associated epigenetic changes in the following genes were correlated with depression: NRC31, SLCA4, BDNF, FKBP5, SKA2, OXTR, LINGO3, POU3F1 and ITGB1. Epigenetic changes in glucocorticoid signaling (e.g., NR3C1, FKBP5), serotonergic signaling (e.g. SLC6A4), and neurotrophin (e.g., BDNF) genes appear to be the most promising therapeutic targets for future research. However, continued research is warranted due to inconsistent findings regarding the directionality of epigenetic modification. Future studies should also aim to control for the use of psychotropic agents due to their widespread use in depressed populations and established effects on DNA methylation.

AB  - Research on self-compassion and depressive symptoms is growing at an exponential pace. This systematic review provides an in-depth exploration of the relation between self-compassion and depressive symptoms in adolescents. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were systematically searched and 18 studies were identified. Results demonstrate the potentially pertinent role that self-compassion may play in the development, maintenance, and treatment of depression in adolescents, yet reflect on the paucity of research on this topic with respect to mechanisms of change. These studies further highlight how the impact of self-compassion may differ according to gender and age and underscore the need to account for other diversity-related variables, such as ethnic-racial group, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation. Despite such limitations in the literature, the current findings extend research in adults by providing support for the relevance of self-compassion in adolescence, particularly with respect to the prevention of depressive symptoms.

AB  - In recent years interest in integrating the affective and decision sciences has skyrocketed. Immense progress has been made, but the complexities of each field, which can multiply when combined, present a significant obstacle. A carefully defined framework for integration is needed. The shift towards computational modeling in decision science provides a powerful basis and a path forward, but one whose synergistic potential will only be fully realized by drawing on the theoretical richness of the affective sciences. Reviewing research using a popular computational model of choice (the drift diffusion model), we discuss how mapping concepts to parameters reduces conceptual ambiguity and reveals novel hypotheses.

AB  - Introduction: Depression is a common mental health disorder and affects many adolescents worldwide. Depression literacy can improve mental health outcomes. The aim of this study was to collate and analyse the extant evidence on depression literacy among adolescents, with particular focus on tools used to examine depression literacy and the findings on components of depression literacy.
   Methods: Nine electronic databases and 1 grey literature source were searched for studies published in English between January 2006 and December 2018 and involving adolescents aged 10-19 years. We included studies that reported on components of depression literacy such as knowledge, help-seeking and stigmatising attitudes. We excluded qualitative studies. Two independent reviewers verified that the studies met the inclusion criteria, assessed the quality of the studies and extracted their characteristics. The data were descriptively analysed and appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (QATSQ).
   Results and conclusion: Fifty of the 14,626 references identified met the inclusion criteria. Depression literacy was most commonly (58%) assessed using tools that utilize a vignette-based methodology. A lack of uniformity in reporting of depression literacy was noted. Adolescents were poor at recognising depression, likely to seek help from informal sources and tended to attach stigma to depression. The implications of the findings are discussed and suggestions made for future research.

AB  - Psychological trauma has developed into a very common concept in the scientific community, in mental health care, as well as in popular language and mass media. The purpose of this article is to show the relevance of the discipline of traumatic stress studies to the field of public mental health by examining central concepts and findings concerning trauma and its aftermath and examining implications for public mental health. Attention is paid to the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the construct of resilience as well as to specific areas of public mental health activities. A public mental health perspective will help to develop preventive approaches to trauma and extend the impact of various forms of interventions. It will also make clear that trauma care will have to consider the community and the society at large.

These parameters are commonly applied as prognostic and diagnostic tools in fish health status. However, there are both extrinsic and intrinsic factors to consider when performing a blood test, because a major limitation for field researchers is that the "rules" for animal or human haematology do not always apply to wildlife. The main objective of this review is to show how some environmental and xenobiotic factors are capable to modulating the haematic cells. Visualizing the strengths and limitations of a haematological analysis in the health assessment of wild and culture fish. Finally, we point out the importance of the use of mitochondrial activities as part of haematological evaluations associated to environment or aquaculture stress. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is involved in the regulation of physiologic and homeostatic parameters relating particularly to the visceral organs and the co-ordination of physiological responses to threat. Blood pressure and heart rate, respiration, pupillomotor reactivity, sexual function, gastrointestinal secretions and motility, and urine storage and micturition are all under a degree of ANS control. Furthermore, there is close integration between the ANS and other neural functions such as emotion and cognition, and thus brain regions that are known to be important for autonomic control are also implicated in emotional functions. In this review we explore the role of the central ANS in the control of the bladder, and the implications of this for bladder dysfunction in diseases of the ANS.

AB  - Objective: Teacher burnout has hardly been compared across countries, although it has become a global health issue. This review aimed to examine teacher burnout (effect size) and its variation across countries by testing the effects of gender, gender egalitarianism, and national learning assessments (NLAs). Design: A systematic literature search was carried out using keywords. In all, 156 studies from 36 countries were included that used quantitative methodology. Meta-analytical procedures were used to estimate effect sizes of three dimensions of burnout. Two-level multilevel mixed-effect model tested moderator variables at the country level. Results: The overall effect size found for emotional exhaustion was 38.29 (95% CI = 35.26, 41.32), 29.45 (95% CI = 25.91, 32.99) for cynicism, and 68.75 (95% CI = 65.63, 71.87) for personal accomplishment, with significant differences across countries. Gender was negatively significant for personal accomplishment. Significant linear, curvilinear and interaction effects of NLAs and gender egalitarianism explained variations in burnout. Whereas more NLAs tends to increase burnout, more gender egalitarianism tends to decrease it, although this effect is not linear. Conclusion: Teacher burnout, as a health issue, varies significantly across countries suggesting that programmes to prevent this problem should consider environmental (educational system) and cultural conditions for a greater impact.

AB  - Aim The objective of this narrative review is to address the question: Should sport-based life skills interventions be developed for young people recovering from first episode psychosis? Methods A prose was developed through a broad, critical narrative review of literatures on (1) first episode psychosis recovery (FEP); and (2) life skills and sport, highlighting the conceptual (and limited empirical) links between the two. This style of review allowed for a critical examination of evidence from seemingly distinct literatures to address a question yet to be explored empirically. Results The review process highlighted important overlaps between psychosis recovery and sport. A review of the FEP recovery literature reveals that important components of an individual's recovery following a psychotic episode are: (1) physical activity, (2) opportunities to build life skills, and (3) social connectivity. A review of the sport and life skills literature suggests that sport can be a powerful platform from which to: (1) promote physical activity, (2) teach life skills, and (3) foster social connectivity within vulnerable populations. Despite the clear links between the two fields, mental health interventions that combine both life skills training components and physical activity in a context that promotes social connectivity are scarce to none. Conclusions We suggest that sport-based interventions could be an opportunity to provide life skills training, social connectivity and physical activity opportunities in one intervention to individuals recovering from their first psychotic episode. We call for their development, and provide empirically-based recommendations for intervention design.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The expression of affectivity and sexuality are fundamental human lights. However, people diagnosed with severe mental disorders (SMDs) living in psychiatric facilities may find it difficult to fulfil their needs. which may be neglected and misunderstood by mental health professionals (MHPs). This paper summarizes current knowledge on this topic using a narrative review.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus were searched for studies of the affectivity and sexual needs of service users with SMDs living in residential and other long-term-stay facilities. Of the 451 articles initially retrieved, 26 met the inclusion criteria of this review.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The findings were reported under six main headings: sexual, affective and relational needs of mental health service users, views of MHPs on users' sexuality, policies on the regulation and responses to users' sexual and affective needs, sexual education and training aimed at both mental health service users and professionals, HIV/sexually transmitted diseases (STD) risk assessment and prevention programs, and contraception.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sexual relations are generally prohibited or discouraged within residential facilities, but it has nevertheless been found that many residents are sexually active. The denial of their sexual needs by residential staff and the absence of any dedicated setting for sexual relations within facilities are sources of substantial distress for residents. Studies have also found a lack of knowledge of STDs among users and discomfort of MHPs in dealing with the topic. Hence, educational and training interventions for both users and MHPs should be implemented. Specific policies and guidelines could be coproduced to enhance patients' emotional and relational capabilities and encourage them to adopt healthier and safer sexual practices.

AB  - Objective Several studies have investigated whether in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with increased risk of developing mental or behavioural disorders. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis based on this literature. Methods A systematic search of eligible literature in PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO and subsequent meta-analysis was conducted in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Results A total of 20 studies were included in the review, and results from 18 of these were meta-analyzed. We found a statistically significant positive association between in utero exposure to SSRIs and mental or behavioural disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-1.47), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.06-1.66) and mental retardation (HR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.03-1.91). Confounding by indication was identified in five of seven studies investigating this aspect. Conclusion Exposure to SSRIs in utero is associated with increased risk of developing mental or behavioural disorders. However, these associations do not necessarily reflect a causal relationship since the results included in this meta-analysis are likely affected by residual confounding by indication, which is likely to account for some (or all) of the positive association.

AB  - Background: Typically, we try to protect our own bodies and this is supported by internal representations that specify one's body identity, spatial parameters, and bodily sensations, but in self-harm the body becomes the target. First acts of self-harm are typically reported in adolescence. At this age, the body also becomes more salient to one's self-concept. It may be possible that disturbances in representations of one's own body and its sensations contribute to self-harm.
   Methods: To investigate these links, we conducted a systematic review critically examining the potential role of body representation and sensation disturbances in self-harm (non-suicidal or suicidal) in adolescents and young adults (12-25 years).
   Results: The search strategy identified 64 studies (275,183 participants) and overall, young people engaging in self-harm reported greater levels of body dissatisfaction, body disownership, and deficits in the experience and evaluation of bodily sensations compared to non-injuring control groups; however, there was subscale variability and gender differences.
   Conclusion: Our results emphasise the strong link between body representations and self-protection, as well as a need for investigating self-harm interventions that take body image and awareness into account.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to assess the evidence regarding economic evaluations of worksite health promotion programs in Europe. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, the literature search, study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed independently by two researchers. Full economic evaluations of worksite health promotion programs carried out in a European workplace were included. Results: From 1728 search results, 39 articles describing 37 studies were included. Regarding methodological quality, 9 studies were rated as strong, 15 as moderate and 15 as weak. Six of the studies fulfilled the minimum standard for health economic evaluations. Worksite health promotion was applied in many different forms for a wide range of settings. Cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and cost-utility analyses were performed from different perspectives. Effects on health outcomes tended to be small and uncertain. Only 9 out of 21 cost-benefit analyses reported a financial benefit and 10 out of 23 cost-effectiveness analyses concluded that the intervention was cost-effective. Two out of eight cost-utility analyses were found to be cost-effective. Productivity loss accounted for more than 85% of the total costs and thus, was the main cost driver in the analyses. Conclusions: Due to considerable heterogeneity, no specific type of intervention could be identified to be particularly effective and the economic value of worksite health promotion remains uncertain. Further studies, investigating comprehensive worksite health promotion programs are needed to provide evidence on their efficiency. Guidelines to perform economic evaluations in the field of worksite health promotion, especially for valuation of productivity loss, are required.

AB  - Patients with diabetes have an increased risk of developing depression compared with non-diabetic individuals. We aimed to examine the utility of physical activity in the treatment of diabetes-related depression using a meta analysis. Multiple databases were searched from inception to February 1, 2018. A random effects pooling model was used to examine the standardized mean difference and mean difference in the meta-analysis. A sensitivity analysis and meta-regression analyses were performed. Fourteen studies were included in a systematic review (1020 patients), while 13 were included in a meta-analysis (962 patients). Physical activity had a beneficial effect on depression as measured by Hedge's g (standardized mean difference = -0.59; 95% CI = -0.93 to -0.24). A sensitivity analysis indicated that the findings did not change in a meaningful way with the exclusion of studies with a high or unknown risk of bias in incomplete outcome data. Meta-regression analyses demonstrated that no covariate significantly influenced the main effect size. Physical activity had a significantly beneficial effect on depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (mean difference = -2.90; 95% CI = -4.53 to -1.28). These findings suggest that physical activity may help ameliorate depression in patients with diabetes.

Clinical trial reports suggest that midday or morning bright light treatment and novel chronotherapeutic interventions are effective for bipolar depression. Mechanisms of response may relate to effects on the circadian system and other changes in neural functioning.SummaryUsing bright light to manage depressive symptoms in BD is reasonable but also requires concurrent antimanic treatment and careful clinical monitoring for response, safety, and mood polarity switch.

AB  - Well-being is a critical outcome in the recovery from psychosis and the prevention of symptoms. Previous reviews of the effectiveness of psychological interventions have focused on psychotic symptoms and general psychopathology, not recognising well-being as an essential outcome. This study conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of psychological interventions on the well-being and quality of life (QoL) of people with schizophrenia and analysed some critical moderating factors. A systematic literature search was conducted yielding 12986 published reports, 2043 of which were clinical trials. After a detailed review, 36 articles were included in the analyses. Measures of related concepts, well-being and quality of life were included in the present meta-analysis to reflect the current state of the literature and to ensure the representativeness of RCTs that have evaluated the effect of psychological interventions on the extent to which people with schizophrenia experience a good life. Our findings reflect a significant, small, treatment effect on the outcomes of well-being. Subgroup analysis also suggested a significant moderating effect when the primary aim of the intervention was well-being. These findings suggest that symptom or functional improvement does not necessarily lead to an improvement in well-being and would imply the need to focus specifically on those. We recommend psychological interventions that target well-being as a complementary strategy in mental health promotion and treatment. In addition, we stress the need to include well-being outcome measure in RCT as well as to clearly identify the different domains of well-being being measured. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The opioid system regulates affective processing, including pain, pleasure, and reward. Restricting the role of this system to hedonic modulation may be an underestimation, however. Opioid receptors are distributed widely in the human brain, including the more cognitive regions in the frontal and parietal lobes. Nonhuman animal research points to opioid modulation of cognitive and decision-making processes. We review emerging evidence on whether acute opioid drug modulation in healthy humans can influence cognitive function, such as how we choose between actions of different values and how we control our behavior in the face of distracting information. Specifically, we review studies employing opioid agonists or antagonists together with experimental paradigms of reward-based decision making, impulsivity, executive functioning, attention, inhibition, and effort. Although this field is still in its infancy, the emerging picture suggests that the mu-opioid system can influence higher-level cognitive function via modulation of valuation, motivation, and control circuits dense in mu-opioid receptors, including orbitofrontal cortex, basal ganglia, amygdalae, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex. The framework that we put forward proposes that opioids influence decision making and cognitive control by increasing the subjective value of reward and reducing aversive arousal. We highlight potential mechanisms that might underlie the effects of mu-opioid signaling on decision making and cognitive control and provide directions for future research.

AB  - Maternal psychological distress is common in pregnancy and may influence the risk of adverse outcomes in children. Psychological distress may cause a suboptimal intrauterine environment leading to growth and developmental adaptations of the fetus and child. In this narrative review, we examined the influence of maternal psychological distress during pregnancy on fetal outcomes and child cardiometabolic, respiratory, atopic and neurodevelopment-related health outcomes. We discussed these findings from an epidemiological and life course perspective and provided recommendations for future studies. The literature in the field of maternal psychological distress and child health outcomes is extensive and shows that exposure to stress during pregnancy is associated with multiple adverse child health outcomes. Because maternal psychological distress is an important and potential modifiable factor during pregnancy, it should be a target for prevention strategies in order to optimize fetal and child health. Future studies should use innovative designs and strategies in order to address the issue of causality.

AB  - Recent studies have reported an association between air pollution exposure and depression, with inconsistent results. To address this controversy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published observational studies that investigated outdoor air pollution and depression. Five electronic databases were searched, and fifteen articles were finally identified. Pooled odds risks were calculated separately based on pollutant type, exposure duration and outcome. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on design, population, important potential confounders, and pollutants levels. We found a significantly increased risk of depression with long-term exposure to PM2.5 and short-term exposure to PM10, NO2, SO2, CO. No evidence was found in the association between exposure to O-3 and depression. Besides, exposure to high levels of pollutants indicates a higher risk of depression. Our results highlight the necessity of air pollution control for depression. However, further studies with standardized methods are still required to support the results due to the inconsistent results in stratified analyses and methodological limitations of the included studies.

AB  - Background: There has been an increasing interest in urban agriculture (UA) practice and research in recent years. Scholars have already reported numerous beneficial and potential adverse impacts of UA on health-related outcomes. This scoping review aims to explore these impacts and identify knowledge gaps for future UA studies.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted in seven electronic bibliographic databases to identify relevant peer-reviewed studies. Articles were screened and assessed for eligibility. From eligible studies, data were extracted to summarize, collate, appraise the quality and make a narrative account of the findings.
   Results: A total of 101 articles (51 quantitative, 29 qualitative, and 21 mixed methods studies) were included in our final analysis. Among these articles, 38 and 37% reported findings from North America and Sub-Saharan Africa respectively. Quantitative studies revealed evidence of positive impacts of UA on food security, nutrition outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and social capital. The qualitative studies reported a wide range of perceived benefits and motivations of UA. The most frequently reported benefits include contributions to social capital, food security, health and/or wellbeing. However, the evidence must be interpreted with caution since the quality of most of the studies was assessed as weak to moderate. While no definitive conclusions can be drawn about the adverse impacts of UA on health, paying particular attention to contamination of UA soil is recommended.
   Conclusion: More peer-reviewed studies are needed in areas where UA is practiced such as Latin America and Caribbean. The inconsistency and the lack of strong quality in the methodology of the included studies are proof that more rigorous studies are also needed in future research. Nevertheless, the substantial existing evidence from this review corroborate that UA can influence different determinants of health such as food security, social capital, health and well-being in a variety of contexts.

AB  - Emotional Intelligence (EI) emerged in the 1990s as an ability based construct analogous to general Intelligence. However, over the past 3 decades two further, conceptually distinct forms of EI have emerged (often termed "trait EI" and "mixed model EI") along with a large number of psychometric tools designed to measure these forms. Currently more than 30 different widely-used measures of EI have been developed. Although there is some clarity within the EI field regarding the types of EI and their respective measures, those external to the field are faced with a seemingly complex EI literature, overlapping terminology, and multiple published measures. In this paper we seek to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners seeking to utilize EI in their work. We first provide an overview of the different conceptualizations of EI. We then provide a set of recommendations for practitioners and researchers regarding the most appropriate measures of EI for a range of different purposes. We provide guidance both on how to select and use different measures of EI. We conclude with a comprehensive review of the major measures of EI in terms of factor structure, reliability, and validity.

AB  - Emerging preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that the lateral habenula plays a major role in the pathophysiology of depressive illness. Aberrant increases in neuronal activity in the lateral habenula, an anti-reward center, signals down-regulation of brainstem dopaminergic and serotonergic firing, leading to anhedonia, helplessness, excessive focus on negative experiences, and, hence, depressive symptomatology. The lateral habenula has distinctive regulatory adaptive role to stress regulation in part due to its bidirectional connectivity with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In addition, studies show that increased lateral habenula activity affects components of sleep regulation including slow wave activity and rapid eye movement (REM), both disrupted in depressive illness. Lack of perceived reward experienced during the adverse outcomes also precipitates lateral habenula firing, while outcomes that meet or exceed expectations decrease lateral habenula firing and, in turn, increase midbrain dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. The ability to update expectations of the environment based on rewards and aversive stimuli reflects a potentially important survival mechanism relevant to the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances. What if one lives in a continuously aversive and invalidating environment or under the conditions of chronic stress? If there is a propensity of the habenula to release many burst discharges over time, an individual could habitually come to perceive the world as perpetually disappointing. Conceivably, the lateral habenula could learn to expect an adverse outcome systematically and communicate it more easily. Thus, if the lateral habenula fires more frequently, it may lead to a state of continuous disappointment and hopelessness, akin to depression. Furthermore, postmortem studies reveal that the size of the lateral habenula and total number of neurons are decreased in patients who had depressive illness. Novel research in the field shows that ketamine induces rapid and sustained antidepressant effect. Intriguingly, recent preclinical animal models show that ketamine abolishes N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent lateral habenula bursting activity, leading to rapid resolution of depressive symptoms.

AB  - Introduction: Aboriginal Health and Wellbeing staff are crucial for successful primary health care for Aboriginal communities. However, they are often affected by high rates of stress, burnout, and staff turn-over, which can impact primary health care delivery to Aboriginal peoples. The aim of this review was to identify organisational factors that help support the retention of Aboriginal Health and Wellbeing staff in Aboriginal Health services.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature review was undertaken. Eleven electronic databases were searched for papers published between 2002 and 2017 and supplemented by hand searching. Papers were included if they were in English, full text, peer-reviewed, and had a focus on retention of Aboriginal Health and Wellbeing staff, or health staff in comparable roles working in Aboriginal health services. Twenty-six papers were included in the final review.
   Results: Five key themes were identified as being important to the retention of Aboriginal Health and Wellbeing staff in Aboriginal Health Services: feeling culturally safe and secure within the workplace; teamwork and collaboration; supervision and strong managerial leadership and support from peers (to debrief, reflect, receive emotional support and strengthen coping mechanisms); professional development (the opportunity for skill development and role progression); and recognition (of work load, quality of work performed, being trusted to work autonomously, and financial remuneration that reflected the high pressure of the role).
   Conclusion: Aboriginal Health and Wellbeing staff are fundamental to successful primary health care for Aboriginal peoples. State and Federal Governments should consider formalising recognition of the significant cultural knowledge that Aboriginal Health and Wellbeing staff bring to their roles. Formal recognition could also pave the way to revise remuneration as well as ensure adequate support mechanisms are put in place to improve retention and reduce stress and burnout affecting Aboriginal Health and Wellbeing staff.

AB  - Hypohydration is generally considered to have a negative effect on cognitive function, despite several studies reporting comparable findings between hydration states. Recommendations to avoid moderate dehydration (>= 2% loss in body mass) are commonly made to athletes, on the provision that this deficit may impair optimal cognitive performance. To determine whether cognitive function is impaired by hypohydration, and investigate the existence of the proposed critical water deficit of >= 2% loss in body mass purported to diminish cognitive performance, we conducted a systematic search of the literature and examined appropriate studies by meta-analysis. Overall, cognitive performance was not found to be impaired by hypohydration (g = -0.177; 95% CI = -0.532-0.179; P = .331). Nor were the underlying cognitive domains (complex attention, executive function, learning and memory) impaired (all P > .236), independent of the incurred fluid loss (less than or > 2% loss in body mass), although results were not always homogenous (I-2 ranging between 0% and 93%). Collectively, these results suggest that hypohydration may not compromise cognitive function, nor any of the investigated subdomains to a greater extent than if euhydration had been maintained. Furthermore, recommendations to avoid moderate hypohydration on the basis of maintaining optimal cognitive function are not substantiated by this meta-analysis.

AB  - Oxytocin (OT) is widely known for promoting social interactions, but there is growing appreciation that it can sometimes induce avoidance of social contexts. The social salience hypothesis posed an innovative solution to these apparently opposing actions by proposing that OT enhances the salience of both positive and negative social interactions. The mesolimbic dopamine system was put forth as a likely system to evaluate social salience owing to its well-described role in motivation. Evidence from several sources supports the premise that OT acting within the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area facilitates social reward and approach behavior. However, in aversive social contexts, additional pathways play critical roles in mediating the effects of OT. Recent data indicate that OT acts in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis to induce avoidance of potentially dangerous social contexts. Here, we review evidence for neural circuits mediating the effects of OT in appetitive and aversive social contexts. Specifically, we propose that distinct but potentially overlapping circuits mediate OT-dependent social approach or social avoidance. We conclude that a broader and more inclusive consideration of neural circuits of social approach and avoidance is needed as the field continues to evaluate the potential of OT-based therapeutics.

AB  - Backgrounds: Social cognition deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and deteriorate functionality of patients. However, evidence is sparse for the treatment effect on social cognition impairments in the early stage of psychosis. Here, we provide a systematic review of the literature on social cognitive impairment in early psychosis in relation to its intervention.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted on English articles identified by Web of Science and PubMed databases, according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement.
   Results: Five papers met the inclusion criteria. Results from two studies of cognitive training and one study of modafinil indicate positive results regarding social cognition outcomes in patients with early psychosis. On the other hand, two studies with oxytocin and modafinil did not suggest such effects.
   Conclusions: Further research is warranted to explore the benefit of early intervention into disturbances of social cognition in psychoses.

AB  - Worldwide, antibiotic usage exceeds 100,000 tons per year and there is increasing concern over the fate of these substances. Antibiotics are ubiquitous in the environment and significant concentrations have been detected in fresh waters. In this review, we highlight important aspects of antibiotic pollution in fresh waters: that concentrations of antibiotics in the environment are substantial, that micro-organisms are susceptible to this, that bacteria can evolve resistance in the environment, and that antibiotic pollution affects natural food webs while interacting with other stressors; which taken together poses a number of challenges for environmental scientists. In the literature, we found examples of considerable antibiotic pollution in fresh waters. In the Americas, antibiotic concentrations of up to 15 mu g/L have been measured; with higher concentrations reported from European and African studies (over 10 mu g/L and 50 mu g/L respectively), and in Asian-pacific countries concentrations over 450 mu g/L have been detected.
   While these concentrations might not be deemed harmful to humans, non-target freshwater organisms could be affected by them. Bioassays show that some of the antibiotics found in surface waters affect microbes at concentrations below 10 mu g/L. Among the most potent antibiotics are those that prevail in streams and rivers in these concentrations, such as ciprofloxacin. Sub-lethal concentrations might not kill prokaryotes but contribute to increased bacterial resistance and change the composition of single-celled communities, as demonstrated in laboratory experiments. This has implications tot the microbial food web (e.g. interactions among and between bacteria and their protozoan consumers) and by extension, larger organisms and ecosystem health.
   The tact that the effects of antibiotics are extremely context-dependent represents a challenge, particularly for in vitro research. We suggest future research avenues, taking into account food web experiments, antibiotics interacting with one another (and other stressors) and discuss how these can help to answer multi-layered research questions.

AB  - It is uncertain whether sleep preferentially consolidates emotional over neutral material. Some studies suggest that sleep enhances emotional memory (i.e., that there are large differences in strength of memory for valenced material compared to neutral material after a sleep-filled interval, but that this difference is smaller after a wake-filled interval). Others find no such effect. We attempted to resolve this uncertainty by conducting a meta-analysis that compared valenced to neutral material after both sleep-and wake-filled delays. Standard search strategies identified 31 studies (containing 36 separate datasets) that met our inclusion criteria. Using random effects modeling, we conducted separate analyses for datasets comparing (a) negative vs. neutral material, (b) positive vs. neutral material, or (c) combined negative and positive vs. neutral material. We then specified several subgroup analyses to investigate potential moderators of the relationship between sleep and emotional memory consolidation. Results showed no overall effect for preferential sleep-dependent consolidation of emotional over neutral material. However, moderation analyses provided evidence for stronger effects when (a) studies used free recall rather than recognition outcome measures, or (b) delayed recall or recognition outcomes were controlled for initial learning. Those analyses also suggested that other methodological features (e. g., whether participants experience a full night of sleep and a regular daytime waking control condition rather than a nap and a night-time sleep deprivation control condition) and sample characteristics (e.g. all-male or not, young adult or not) should be carefully addressed in future research in this field. These findings suggest that sleep does enhance emotional memory, but that in the laboratory the effect is only observed under particularmethodological conditions. The conditions we identify as being critical to consider are consistent with general theories guiding scientific understanding of memory consolidation during sleep.

AB  - Objective: Gabapentin (GBP) is an anticonvulsant medication that is also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS) and posttherapeutic neuralgia. GBP is commonly prescribed off-label for psychiatric disorders despite the lack of strong evidence. However, there is growing evidence that GBP may be effective and clinically beneficial in both psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. This review aimed to perform a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed published literature on the efficacy of GBP in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders.
   Methods: This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE literature databases were screened and filtered by using specific search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The full texts of selected studies were subsequently retrieved and reviewed. The search terms generated 2,604 results from the databases. After excluding all duplicates, 1,088 citations were left. Thereafter, we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria; a total of 54 papers were retained for detailed review.
   Results: This literature review concludes that GBP appears to be effective in the treatment of various forms of anxiety disorders. It shows some effectiveness in bipolar disorder as an adjunctive therapeutic agent, while the evidence for monotherapy is inconclusive. In substance use disorders, GBP is effective for acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) with mild to moderate severity; it reduces cravings, improves the rate of abstinence, and delays return to heavy drinking. GBP may have some therapeutic potential in the treatment of opioid addiction and cannabis dependence, but there is limited evidence to support its use. No significant benefit of GBP has been conclusively observed in the treatment of OCD, PTSD, depression, or cocaine and amphetamine abuse.
   Conclusion: GBP appears to be effective in some forms of anxiety disorders such as preoperative anxiety, anxiety in breast cancer survivors, and social phobia. GBP has shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of alcohol dependence. However, the literature suggests that GBP is effective as an adjunctive medication rather than a monotherapy. More clinical trials with larger patient populations are needed to support gabapentin's off-label use in psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. It is worth noting that numerous clinical studies that are discussed in this review are open-label trials, which are inherently less rigorously analyzed. Therefore, more extensive investigations are required to examine not only the efficacy of GBP, but also its safety and tolerance.

AB  - Background: There is an urgent need for a meta-analysis that characterizes the brain states of major depression disorder (MDD) patients and potentially provides reliable biomarkers, because heterogeneity in the results of resting-state functional neuroimaging has been observed between studies, with some patients not showing the consistent changes, or even opposite patterns. Thus, we evaluated consistent regional brain activity alterations in medication-naive patients with first-episode unipolar MDD and compared the results with those in healthy controls (HCs).
   Methods: A systematic database search was conducted (in PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Knowledge) between January 1984 and July 2016 to select resting-state functional activity studies with a voxel-wise analysis in MDD. We used anisotropic effect size-signed differential mapping to perform a whole-brain meta-analysis, comparing functional alterations between first-episode medication-naive unipolar MDD patients and HCs by integrating the studies. In addition, subgroup meta-analysis was conducted to control for the MRI analysis method. Moreover, the meta-regression analyses were performed to examine the potential effects of mean age, education duration, illness duration, and severity of depressive symptoms.
   Results: A total of 12 studies were included, comparing 313 MDD patients with 283 HCs. The pooled and subgroup meta-analysis found that the MDD patients showed hyperactivity in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left supplementary motor area, left amygdala, left hippocampus, and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG; orbital part), and hypoactivity in the left lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, right cuneus cortex, right MFG (orbital part), and left cerebellum. In the meta-regression analyses, the mean illness duration was positively associated with hyper-activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus and hypoactivation in the hemispheric lobule IV/V of the left cerebellum.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated that MDD patients had significant and robust resting-state brain activity alteration in amygdala, left hippocampus and other regions, which implicated this finding in the pathophysiology of cognitive and emotional impairment in MDD patients.

AB  - BackgroundElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for all bipolar states. However, ECT remains underutilized, likely stemming from stigma and the risk of neurocognitive impairment. Neuroimaging research has identified state-specific areas of aberrant brain activity that may serve as targets for therapeutic brain stimulation. Electrode placement determines the geometry of the electric field and can be either non-focal (bitemporal) or more focal (right unilateral or bifrontal). Previous research has shown that electrode placement can impact clinical and cognitive outcomes independent of seizure activity. This review critically examines the evidence that focal (unilateral or bifrontal) electrode placements target specific aberrant circuitry in specific bipolar states to optimize clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that optimal target engagement for a bipolar state will be associated with equivalent efficacy relative to bitemporal non-focal stimulation with less neurocognitive impairment.MethodsWe performed a literature search in the PubMed database. Inclusion criteria included prospective, longitudinal investigations during the ECT series with specific electrode placements within a bipolar state from 2000 to 2018.ResultsWe identified investigations that met our inclusion criteria with bipolar mania (n=6), depression (n=6), mixed (n=3) and catatonia (n=1) states. These studies included clinical outcomes and several included cognitive outcomes, which were discussed separately.ConclusionsWhile the heterogeneity of the studies makes comparisons difficult, important patterns included the reduced cognitive side effects, faster rate of response, and equivalent efficacy rates of the focal electrode placements (right unilateral and bifrontal) when compared to non-focal (bitemporal) placement. Further avenues for research include more robust cognitive assessments to separate procedure-related and state-related impairment. In addition, future studies could investigate novel electrode configurations with more specific target engagement for different bipolar states.

AB  - Background: Depression is the largest cause of mental ill health worldwide. Although interventions such as Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) may offer interesting and acceptable treatment options, current clinical guidelines do not include these interventions in their recommendations mainly because of what is perceived as insufficient research evidence. The 2015 Cochrane review on DMT for depression includes only three studies leading to inconclusive results. In a small and underfunded field such as DMT, expensive multi-centered Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are as yet rare. It is therefore, necessary to not only capture evidence from RCTs, but to also look beyond such designs in order to identify and assess the range of current evidence.
   Methods: We therefore conducted a systematic review of studies that aimed to explore the effectiveness in the use of DMT with people with depression. This led to a qualitative narrative synthesis. We also performed meta-analyses that calculated the effect size for all included studies, studies with RCT designs only, followed by a subgroup analysis and a sensitivity analysis. In all meta-analyses a random effects model was used with Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) to accommodate for the heterogeneity of studies and outcome measures.
   Results: From the 817 studies reviewed, eight studies were identified as meeting our inclusion criteria. Three hundred and fifty one people with depression (mild to severe) participated, 192 of whom attended DMT groups while receiving treatment as usual (TAU) and 159 received TAU only. Qualitative findings suggest there was a decrease in depression scores in favor of DMT groups in all studies. Subgroup analysis performed on depression scores before and 3 months after the completion of DMT groups suggested changes in favor of the DMT groups. When sensitivity analysis was performed, RCTs at high risk of bias were excluded, leaving only studies with adult clients up to the age of 65. In these studies, the highest effect size was found favoring DMT plus TAU for adults with depression, when compared to TAU only.
   Conclusions: Based on studies with moderate to high quality, we concluded that DMT is an effective intervention in the treatment of adults with depression. Furthermore, by drawing on a wide range of designs with diverse quality, we were able to compile a comprehensive picture of relevant trends relating to the use of DMT in the treatment of depression. Despite the fact that there remains a paucity of high-quality studies, the results have relevance to both policy-making and clinical practice, and become a platform for further research.

AB  - The critical regulatory role of leptin in the neuroendocrine system has been widely reported. Significantly, leptin can improve learning and memory, affect hippocampal synaptic plasticity, exert neuroprotective efficacy and reduce the risk of several neuropsychiatric diseases. In terms of depression, leptin could modulate the levels of neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors and reverse the dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). At the same time, leptin affects neurological diseases during the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. With regards to neurodegenerative diseases, leptin can affect them via neuroprotection, mainly including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This review will summarize the mechanisms of leptin signaling within the neuroendocrine system with respect to these diseases and discuss the therapeutic potential of leptin.

AB  - Objective Over the past 20 years, there has been a growing interest in the psychosocial outcomes of children and adolescents born with a congenital heart defect (CHD). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to appraise and synthesize current literature on the psychosocial outcomes of children and adolescents with severe CHD. Methods A search of studies examining psychosocial outcomes in children and adolescents with severe CHD was performed. Meta-analyses were used to calculate the prevalence of psychosocial impairments and the standardized mean differences between cases and controls. Results that were not included in the meta-analysis were collated using descriptive statistics. Results A total of 16 studies were included in this review, and results were summarized according to three domains: behavior, social cognition, and self-esteem. Results from a meta-analysis identified that 25% of children and adolescents with CHD presented behavioral problems. Children and adolescents with CHD had more problematic behavior than healthy peers (standardized mean difference; g = 0.71). Young people with CHD had significantly more difficulties inferring on the mental states of others (standardized mean difference; g = 0.72). In contrast, identifying the emotions of others and self-esteem was not statistically different from healthy controls. Conclusion This review and meta-analysis provides evidence to support the presence of psychosocial difficulties in children and adolescents born with a severe CHD giving grounds for the systematic assessment of behavior and social cognition during their clinical follow-up.

TI  - A focus on postpartum depression among African American women: A literature review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some studies have reported a higher rate of postpartum depression in African American vs White women. We reviewed the literature to identify the possible factors associated with a greater risk of postpartum depression in African American women.
   METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using journal databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Keywords used in the search included postpartum depression, ethnicity, and race. Using the PRISMA (Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) method for review articles, 8 studies were identified and included.
   RESULTS: We identified 8 studies that met the criteria for our review. Most of the studies showed that African American and Hispanic women had a higher odds ratio of reported postpartum depression due to lack of social support, access, trust, past depression, and other factors. However, 1 study found that although African Americans are more likely to report symptoms of postpartum depression, they are less likely to seek treatment due to cultural stigma regarding mental illness.
   CONCLUSIONS: The data we reviewed confirm the ethnic differences in postpartum depression. Addressing the factors involved will lead to better health outcomes for both mothers and their children.

AB  - Purpose: Bipolar disorder is a common, severe mental health condition and a major financial burden for healthcare systems across the globe. There is some evidence that unrecognized bipolar disorder is prevalent amongst patients with depression in primary care which can lead to non-optimal treatment. However, a systematic synthesis of this literature is lacking. We aimed to determine the percentage of primary care patients who are diagnosed with depression that have unrecognized bipolar disorder.
   Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane and PsycINFO were searched to January 2019. We included quantitative observational studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa cohort scale. Analyses were performed using random-effects models, heterogeneity was quantified using I-2 and formal tests of publication bias were undertaken.
   Results: Ten studies with 3803 participants with depression in primary care were included. The pooled prevalence of bipolar disorder in those with depression was 17% (95% CI = 12 to 22). The prevalence of unrecognized bipolar depression was higher in studies which used questionnaires as assessment tools for bipolar disorder compared to studies which used clinical interviews but this difference was not significant (14%, 95% CI = 8 to 20 versus 22%, 95% CI = 16 to 28, Q = 1.27, p = 0.12). The prevalence of unrecognized bipolar disorder was not significantly affected by study-level variations in the risk of bias and we found no evidence for publication bias.
   Conclusion: Over 3 in 20 patients with depression have unrecognized bipolar disorder in primary care which can lead to harmful patient outcomes. Increased awareness of unrecognition of bipolar disorder in primary care patients with depression and efficient assessment strategies in primary care are warranted.

AB  - Objective: Cognitive representations of an illness have an important impact on psychological outcomes. The current systematic review explored 1) the characteristics of illness representations held by parents of children and adults with serious mental illness (SMI), and 2) the associations of these representations with both parents' and patients' psychological outcomes.
   Method: PSYINFO and PUBMED were screened for eligible studies published between January 2000 and August 2018. Selection was based on PRISMA guidelines. Reference lists of these papers were checked for additional references. Two independent coders extracted all relevant data.
   Results: The search resulted in 31 relevant studies, which were divided, by type of methodology, into three sections: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed quantitative-qualitative. In each section, findings were divided in accordance with the two research questions.
   Conclusion: Parents struggle to make meaning of their child's illness, often holding stigmatizing ideas about the illness and blaming themselves for its existence. More longitudinal studies that include both of the child's parents, as well as interventional studies, are needed to expand our knowledge of ways to help parents construct more beneficial representations of their children's illnesses.

AB  - Objective Due to limited efficacy of medications, non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) are frequently co-administered to people with moderate to severe dementia (PWMSD). This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effects of NPI on activities of daily living (ADL), behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and cognition and quality of life (QoL) of PWMSD.
   Methods A literature search was conducted in the following databases: Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, Medline, CIHNAL, PsycINFO, KoreaMED, KMbase, and KISS. We conducted a meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials and used the generic inverse variance method with a fixed-effects model to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD). The protocol had been registered (CRD42017 058020).
   Results Ten randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria of the current meta-analysis. NPI were effective in improving ADL [SMD=0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.11-0.45] and reducing depression (SMD=-0.44, 95% CI=-0.70--0.19). However, NPI were not effective in reducing agitation, anxiety, or overall, or improving cognitive function. In a subgroup analysis, music therapy was effective in reducing overall BPSD (SMD=-0.52, 95% CI=-0.90--0.13).
   Conclusion Albeit the number of studies was limited, NPI improved ADL and depression in PWMSD.

KW  - OUTCOMES
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is known as one of the most common cancers among women and has severe psychological effects. This study aimed to identify the psychological consequences of breast cancer in previous studies based on meta-analysis.
   Methods: Meta-analytic procedures were conducted by Prisma guidelines. A literature search was conducted by using following electronic databases including scientific information databases (SID), Magiran, Medlib, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL and Medline from 1991 through 2017 regarding the psychological consequences associated with breast cancer in Iran. The content of all articles was evaluated by the Prisma checklist and analyzed meta-analysis in CMA software.
   Results: The final synthesis was carried out on 56 quantitative studies. Considering the findings of meta-analysis of the psychological consequences of patients with breast cancer in seven classes, anxiety (ES=-0.76), body image (ES=0.199), coping strategies (ES= 0.214), depression (ES=-0.700), fatigue (ES=0.322), quality of life (ES= 0.428), and sexual function (ES=0.355) were achieved.
   Conclusion: Based on the results of the high level of psychological consequences of breast cancer in women with breast cancer, it is necessary to formulate appropriate therapeutic protocols in order to adjust the psychological consequences.

AB  - Introduction: Extensive research has made it possible to conclude that dysfunctions in serotoninergic transmission are associated with a tendency toward violence and behavioral dysregulations in humans. In this regard, it has been suggested that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline, which regulate the serotonin system, might reduce proneness to violence. Aims: This review aims to explore changes in feelings of anger-state (e.g., irritability and hostility) and anger expression as primary outcomes after sertraline treatment. Methods: Based on PRISMA quality criteria for reviews, a literature search was carried out through PubMed, PsycINFO, Dialnet, Psicodoc, Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Library. Results: Initially, 605 publications were identified, removing 219 duplicate manuscripts and screening the titles and abstracts of the remaining 386 records. This process left 248 articles for full-text reading, finally including 15 entries. Thus, several empirical studies were included that employed different research designs. In this regard, we considered 3 case reports, 5 open clinical trials, and 7 randomized placebo-controlled trials. The majority of the studies were unanimous in concluding that a large percentage of patients with high irritability levels responded satisfactorily to sertraline treatment. In fact, their mood improved, and they experienced a reduction in irritability and anger expression after a few weeks of treatment (approximately two weeks). However, it was necessary to increase the sertraline dose after months of treatment to avoid exhaustion effects. Moreover, not all the patients responded to the treatment and it is particularly interesting that a small percentage of patients were refractory to treatment or even showed an increase in irritability after a few weeks of treatment. In those cases, it was necessary to discontinue the treatment or reduce the dose to the initial levels. Discussion: Although it is necessary to be cautious about the benefits of sertraline as a way to control anger and irritability, it is relevant to consider pharmacological strategies to reduce anger-state as coadjutant treatments to psychotherapy in order to promote lasting changes in violent populations.

AB  - Over the past two decades, research in the biology and treatment of major depression has led to advances in our understanding of the biology of the disorder and to the development of novel treatments. While progress has been made, a number of key issues have emerged regarding diagnosis of the disorder and how we develop and test new therapies. Among these are the potential need to include new dimensions in the diagnostic criteria, the limited utility of clinical predictors of response, the moving away from traditional blinded trials in major depression, and whether preclinical models tell us much about novel drug development. These issues need to be addressed to avoid the field's embarking on trails of research and treatment development that could actually mislead or misdirect our efforts to develop better diagnostic tools and more effective treatments. Possible solutions to these problems are proposed.

AB  - Background Severe mental illness (SMI) is thought to be associated with lower diet quality and adverse eating behaviours contributing towards physical health disparities. A rigorous review of the studies looking at dietary intake in psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder is lacking. Aims To conduct a systematic, comprehensive evaluation of the published research on dietary intake in psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder. Method Six electronic databases were searched for studies reporting on dietary intakes in psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder. Dietary-assessment methods, and dietary intakes, were systematically reviewed. Where possible, data was pooled for meta-analysis and compared with healthy controls. Results In total, 58 eligible studies were identified. People with SMI were found to have significantly higher dietary energy (mean difference 1332 kJ, 95% CI 487-2178 kJ/day, P = 0.002, g = 0.463) and sodium (mean difference 322 mg, 95% CI 174-490 mg, P < 0.001, g = 0.414) intake compared with controls. Qualitative synthesis suggested that higher energy and sodium intakes were associated with poorer diet quality and eating patterns. Conclusions These dietary components should be key targets for preventative interventions to improve weight and other physical health outcomes in people with SMI. Declaration of interest S.B.T. and E.T. have clinical dietitian appointments within the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District and do not receive any further funding.

AB  - BackgroundProblem gambling (PG) is a serious public health concern that disproportionately affects people experiencing poverty, homelessness, and multimorbidity including mental health and substance use concerns. Little research has focused on self-help and self-management in gambling recovery, despite evidence that a substantial number of people do not seek formal treatment. This study explored the literature on PG self-management strategies. Self-management was defined as the capacity to manage symptoms, the intervention, health consequences and altered lifestyle that accompanies a chronic health concern.MethodsWe searched 10 databases to identity interdisciplinary articles from the social sciences, allied health professions, nursing and psychology, between 2000 and June 28, 2017. We reviewed records for eligibility and extracted data from relevant articles. Studies were included in the review if they examined PG self-management strategies used by adults (18+) in at least a subset of the sample, and in which PG was confirmed using a validated diagnostic or screening tool.ResultsWe conducted a scoping review of studies from 2000 to 2017, identifying 31 articles that met the criteria for full text review from a search strategy that yielded 2662 potential articles. The majority of studies examined self-exclusion (39%), followed by use of workbooks (35%), and money or time limiting strategies (17%). The remaining 8% focused on cognitive, behavioural and coping strategies, stress management, and mindfulness.ConclusionsGiven that a minority of people with gambling concerns seek treatment, that stigma is an enormous barrier to care, and that PG services are scarce and most do not address multimorbidity, it is important to examine the personal self-management of gambling as an alternative to formalized treatment.

AB  - There is a principle in science, known as Occam's razor, that says the correct solution is usually the one with the simplest explanation. The microbiota-gut-brain axis, an interdependent series of communication loops between the enteric nervous system (ENS), the microbiota, the gut, and the brain, offers important insight into how changes in our gut affect distant organs like our brains. The inherent complexity of this axis with the crosstalk between the immune system, inflammatory states, and the thousands of bacteria, viral, and fungal species that together make up the microbiota make studying the interactions that govern this axis difficult and far from parsimonious. It is becoming increasingly clear that the microbiota is integral to this axis. Disruption of the healthy flora, a phenomenon collectively referred to as dysbiosis, has been implicated as a driver for several diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, and neurological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and Parkinson's disease (PD). Teasing apart these complex interactions as they pertain to PD is critical for our understanding of this debilitating disease, but more importantly, for the development of future treatments. So far, treatments have been unable to stop this neurodegenerative disease, succeeding only in briefly dampening symptoms and buying patients time before the inevitable loss of function ensues. Given that the 10 years prognosis for death or life-limiting disability with someone diagnosed with PD is upwards of 80%, there is a desperate need for curative treatments that go beyond symptom management. If PD does begin in the periphery with bidirectional communication between the microbiota and the immune system, as recent literature suggests, there is an exciting possibility that progression could be stopped before it reaches the brain. This systematic review assesses the current literature surrounding the role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of alpha-synucleinopathies and explores the hypothesis that alpha-synuclein folding is modulated by the microbiota. Furthermore, we discuss how changes in the gut environment can lead to pathology and outline the implications that advances in understanding the interactions between host and microbiota will have on future research and the development of potential biomarkers.

AB  - The amygdala is a structure involved in emotions, fear, learning and memory and is highly interconnected with other brain regions, for example the motor cortex and the basal ganglia that are often targets of treatments involving electrical stimulation. Deep brain stimulation of the basal ganglia is successfully used to treat movement disorders, but can carry along non-motor side effects. The origin of these non-motor side effects is not fully understood yet, but might be altered oscillatory communication between specific motor areas and the amygdala. Oscillations in various frequency bands have been detected in the amygdala during cognitive and emotional tasks, which can couple with oscillations in cortical regions or the hippocampus. However, data on oscillatory coupling between the amygdala and motor areas are still lacking. This review provides a summary of oscillation frequencies measured in the amygdala and their possible functional relevance in different species, followed by evidence for connectivity between the amygdala and motor areas, such as the basal ganglia and the motor cortex. We hypothesize that the amygdala could communicate with motor areas through coherence of low frequency bands in the theta-alpha range. Furthermore, we discuss a potential role of the amygdala in therapeutic approaches based on electrical stimulation.

AB  - Panksepp, the father of Affective Neuroscience, dedicated his life to demonstrate that foundations of mental life and consciousness lay in the archaic layers of the brain. He had an evolutionary perspective emphasizing that the subcortical affective systems come prior to cortical cognitive systems. Based on his life-long work, the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) was constructed, and a new neurodevelopmental approach to personality was started. The new approach suggested that personality was formed based on the strengths and/or weaknesses found in the subcortical basic affective systems, which are initially regulated by the mother-infant attachment styles and later by early life experiences. ANPS measured six basic affects: CARE, PLAY, SEEK, SADNESS, FEAR, and ANGER; along with a Spirituality subscale. Up to date, it has been translated to several languages, and these studies confirmed that ANPS is a reliable and valid tool. Based on the observation that these ANPS studies have both universal and culturally specific findings, cross-cultural affective neuroscience (CAN) was initiated in 2012, with the approval of Panksepp. As a new research field, CAN aims to investigate the influence of culture on the regulation of basic affective systems. CAN claims that this influence can be studied by observing the cultural variations in (1) the level of emotional interdependency, (2) the types of reinforced or suppressed effects, and (3) the types of affects that accompany interdependent or independent self-construals. Cross-cultural comparisons of Turkish and American ANPS findings and the results of our first Euro-Asian CAN project among Japan, Turkey, and Germany support these claims. These cultures regulate the basic affective systems in unique ways, while maintaining certain similarities with each other. In a way, each culture has a unique affective personality profile and a specific function in the global affective network. The conclusion of this review shares guidelines, suggestions and ethical codes for future CAN researches.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, the main pathological hallmark of which is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and the formation of filamentous aggregates called Lewy bodies in the brainstem, limbic system, and cortical areas. Lipidomics is a newly emerging field which can provide fresh insights and new answers that will enhance our capacity for early diagnosis, tracking disease progression, predicting critical endpoints, and identifying risk in pre-symptomatic persons. In recent years, lipids have been implicated in many aspects of PD pathology. Biophysical and lipidomic studies have demonstrated that alpha-syn binds preferentially not only to specific lipid families but also to specific molecular species and that these lipid-protein complexes enhance its interaction with synaptic membranes, influence its oligomerization and aggregation, and interfere with the catalytic activity of cytoplasmic lipid enzymes and lysosomal lipases, thereby affecting lipid metabolism. The genetic link between aberrant lipid metabolism and PD is even more direct, with mutations in GBA and SMPD1 enhancing PD risk in humans and loss of GALC function increasing alpha-syn aggregation and accumulation in experimental murine models. Moreover, a number of lipidomic studies have reported PD-specific lipid alterations in both patient brains and plasma, including alterations in the lipid composition of lipid rafts in the frontal cortex. A further aspect of lipid dysregulation promoting PD pathogenesis is oxidative stress and inflammation, with proinflammatory lipid mediators such as platelet activating factors (PAFs) playing key roles in arbitrating the progressive neurodegeneration seen in PD linked to alpha-syn intracellular trafficking. Lastly, there are a number of genetic risk factors of PD which are involved in normal lipid metabolism and function. Genes such as PLA2G6 and SCARB2, which are involved in glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism either directly or indirectly are associated with risk of PD. This review seeks to describe these facets of metabolic lipid dysregulation as they relate to PD pathology and potential pathomechanisms involved in disease progression, while highlighting incongruous findings and gaps in knowledge that necessitate further research.

AB  - Background: Being diagnosed with cancer and undergoing its treatment are associated with substantial distress that can cause long-lasting negative psychological outcomes. Resilience is an individual's ability to maintain or restore relatively stable psychological and physical functioning when confronted with stressful life events and adversities. Posttraumatic growth (PTG) can be defined as positive life changes that result from major life crises or stressful events.
   Objectives: The aims of this study were to 1) investigate which factors can strengthen or weaken resilience and PTG in cancer patients and survivors; 2) explore the relationship between resilience and PTG, and mental health outcomes; and 3) discuss the impact and clinical implications of resilience and PTG on the process of recovery from cancer.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted, restricted to PubMed from inception until May 2018, utilizing the following key words: cancer, cancer patients, cancer survivors, resilience, posttraumatic growth, coping, social support, and distress.
   Results: Biological, personal, and most importantly social factors contribute to cancer patients' resilience and, consequently, to favorable psychological and treatment-related outcomes. PTG is an important phenomenon in the adjustment to cancer. From the literature included in this review, a model of resilience and PTG in cancer patients and survivors was developed.
   Conclusions: The cancer experience is associated with positive and negative life changes. Resilience and PTG are quantifiable and can be modified through psychological and pharmacological interventions. Promoting resilience and PTG should be a critical component of cancer care.

AB  - Background: Exposure to endocrine disruptors is on the rise, with new compounds regularly incriminated. In animals and humans, this exposure during critical developmental windows has been associated with various developmental abnormalities, including the emergence of psychiatric disorders. We aimed to review the association between perinatal endocrine disruptor exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, focusing on cognitive and psychiatric disorders. Methods: We performed a systematic review with key words referring to the fields of neurodevelopment and endocrine disruptors. We reviewed 896 titles, choosing studies on the basis of titles and abstracts. We searched through the methodology sections to find perinatal exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders, following the categories indicated in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (5(th) edition). References in some studies brought us to a total of 47 studies included here. Results: Convergent studies report an association between exposure to endocrine disruptors and autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, communication disorders and unspecified neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusion: Sufficient data exist to report that exposure to some endocrine disruptors is a risk factor for the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Studying endocrine disruptor exposure in humans is still associated with some limits that are difficult to overcome.

AB  - Background Although more than two thirds of the world's incarcerated individuals are based in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), the burden of psychiatric disorders in this population is not known. This review provides estimates for the prevalence of severe mental illness and substance use disorders in incarcerated individuals in LMICs.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 17 electronic databases to identify prevalence studies of psychiatric disorders in prison populations in LMICs, published between January, 1987, and May, 2018. We included representative studies from general prison samples, providing information about four major psychiatric diagnoses: psychosis, major depression, alcohol use disorders, and drug use disorders. We pooled data from studies using random-effects meta-analyses and assessed the sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression. We extracted general population estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases 2016 database to calculate comparative prevalence ratios. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015020905.
   Findings We identified 23 publications reporting prevalence estimates of severe mental illness and substance use disorders for 14 527 prisoners from 13 LMICs. In this population, the estimated pooled 1 year prevalence rates for psychosis were 6.2% (95% CI 4.0-8.6), 16.0% (11.7-20.8) for major depression, 3.8% (1.2-7.6) for alcohol use disorders, and 5.1% (2.94.8) for drug use disorders. We noted increased prevalence at prison intake and geographic variations for substance use disorders. For alcohol use disorders, prevalence was higher in the southeast Asian region than in the eastern Mediterranean region; and drug use disorders were more prevalent in the eastern Mediterranean region than in Europe. Prevalence ratios indicated substantially higher rates of severe mental illness and substance use disorders among prisoners than in the general population (the prevalence of non-affective psychosis was on average 16 times higher, major depression and illicit drug use disorder prevalence were both six times higher, and prevalence of alcohol use disorders was double that of the general population).
   Interpretation The prevalence of major psychiatric disorders is high in prisoners in LMIC compared with general populations. As these findings are likely to reflect unmet needs, the development of scalable interventions should be a public health priority in resource-poor settings. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Mindfulness in health care professionals (HCPs) is often discussed as a tool for improving patient care outcomes, yet there has not been a critical evaluation of the evidence, despite a growing body of research on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Numerous mechanisms exist by which mindfulness in HCPs may have an effect on patient care, and the field lacks an integrated model to guide future investigations into how MBIs may exert effects. The primary goals of this integrative review are to evaluate the evidence for the impact of MBIs in HCPs on patient care outcomes and to propose a causal model to guide future research. Databases were systematically searched for eligible studies investigating either an MBI or a measure of dispositional mindfulness in HCPs on patient care outcomes. Studies were critically evaluated using a previously developed tool. Twenty-six studies were identified (N = 1,277), which provide strong support for effects of mindfulness on HCP-reported patient care. Moderate support was found for patient safety, patient treatment outcomes, and patient-centered care. There was overall weak evidence to support a relationship between HCP-mindfulness on patient satisfaction. Mindfulness in HCPs may be related to several aspects of patient care.

AB  - AimIn some cases, detrimental consequences on health are generated by self-imposed dietary rules intended to promote health. The pursuit of an extreme dietary purity due to an exaggerated focus on food may lead to a disordered eating behavior called orthorexia nervosa (ON). ON raises a growing interest, but at present there is no universally shared definition of ON, the diagnostic criteria are under debate, and the psychometric instruments used in the literature revealed some flaws. This narrative review of the literature aims at assessing state of the art in ON definition, diagnostic criteria and related psychometric instruments and provides research propositions and framework for future analysis.MethodsThe authors collected articles through a search into Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, Embase and Google Scholar (last access on 07 August 2018), using orthorexia, orthorexia nervosa and obsessive healthy eating as search terms, and filled three tables including narrative articles (English), clinical trials (English), and articles in languages different from English. The data extrapolated from the revised studies were collected and compared. In particular, for each study, the diagnostic criteria considered, the specific psychometric instrument used, the results and the conclusions of the survey were analyzed.ResultsThe terms employed by the different authors to define ON were fixation, obsession and concern/preoccupation. Several adjectives emphasized these expressions (e.g. exaggerated/excessive, unhealthy, compulsive, pathological, rigid, extreme, maniacal). The suitable food and the diet were defined in different ways. Most of the papers did not set the diagnostic criteria. In some cases, an attempt to use DSM (edition IV or 5) criteria for anorexia nervosa, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, or body dysmorphic disorder, was done. Specific diagnostic criteria proposed by the authors were used in few studies. All these studies indicated as primary diagnostic criteria: (a) obsessional or pathological preoccupation with healthy nutrition; (b) emotional consequences (e.g. distress, anxieties) of non-adherence to self-imposed nutritional rules; (c) psychosocial impairments in relevant areas of life as well as malnutrition and weight loss. The ORTO-15 and the Orthorexia Self-Test developed by Bratman were the most used psychometric tools.ConclusionsThe present review synopsizes the literature on the definition of ON, proposed diagnostic criteria and psychometric instruments used to assess ON attitudes and behaviors. This work represents a necessary starting point to allow a further progression of the studies on the possible new syndrome and to overcome the criticisms that have affected both research and clinical activity until now.Level of EvidenceLevel V, narrative review.

AB  - Many modern occupations require confronting concurrent mental and physical demands (PWL xMWL). However, the electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), Heart rate variability (HRV), and electroencephalography (EEG) signals might be only discussed under physical fatiguing condition. The main objective of this literature review is to discuss the fatigue characteristic of EEG, HRV, and EMG parameters under physical and/or mental condition. The global famous databases were searched from origination to April 2018. The words "fatigue", "EEG", "HRV", "EMG", "physical demand", "mental demand" as well as "ECG", "exercise", "sports", "cognitive task" and "mental stress" were used as keywords for searching. 3,114 original documents were found, but only 67 articles were identified for deep read after two independent reviewers' assessment. Under fatiguing physical and/or mental task, the amplitude parameter of EMG increased with the frequency decreased. Imbalance in autonomic nerves system (ANS) branch was presented and HRV time domain parameters tended to decrease. The power spectrum of theta in EEG increased, but alpha and beta might be influenced by the type or the difficulty of the task. In conclusion, EEG, HRV, and EMG may be sensitive under physical and/or mental condition. If the intensity of the task was high enough to make other signals highly involved in this process, it may be essential to integrate apply EEG, HRV, and EMG for fatigue mechanism discussion in the future.

AB  - Objective: Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia in older age yet is often under-recognised and misdiagnosed. This review aims to provide an overview of the clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies, discussing the frequent challenges clinicians experience in diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies, and outlines a practical approach to the clinical management, particularly in the Australian setting. Methods: This paper is a narrative review and a semi-structured database (PubMed and MEDLINE) search strategy was implemented. Articles were screened and clinically relevant studies were selected for inclusion. Results: Dementia with Lewy bodies is clinically characterised by complex visual hallucinations, spontaneous motor parkinsonism, prominent cognitive fluctuations and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Neuropsychiatric features and autonomic dysfunction are also common. The new diagnostic criteria and specific diagnostic biomarkers help to improve detection rates and diagnostic accuracy, as well as guide appropriate management. Clinical management of dementia with Lewy bodies is challenging and requires an individualised multidisciplinary approach with specialist input. Conclusion: Dementia with Lewy bodies is a common form of dementia. It often presents as a diagnostic challenge to clinicians, particularly at early stages of disease, and in patients with mixed neuropathological changes, which occur in over 50% of people with dementia with Lewy bodies. Prompt diagnosis and comprehensive treatment strategies are important in improving patients' care.

AB  - Research on emotional learning and memory is traditionally approached from one of two directions: episodic memory and classical conditioning. These approaches differ substantially in methodology and intellectual tradition. Here, we offer a new approach to the study of emotional memory in humans that involves integrating theoretical knowledge and experimental techniques from these seemingly distinct fields. Specifically, we describe how subtle modifications to traditional Pavlovian conditioning procedures have provided new insight into how emotional experiences are selectively prioritized in long-term episodic memory. We also speculate on future directions and undeveloped lines of research where some of the knowledge and principles of classical conditioning might advance our understanding of how emotion modifies episodic memory, and vice versa.

AB  - Impulsivity is an important clinical and diagnostic feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Even though it has been reported that BPD individuals' inhibition performance is significantly reduced in the context of negative emotion or stress, this literature shows mixed results, raising questions about the possible role played by other factors. Winter (2016) proposed that negative emotion stimuli can be more disruptive for BPD individuals' attention control performance because they induce higher distractibility self-referential processes. This article aimed to systematically review the literature regarding the effect of stress and negative emotions on three main inhibition processesprepotent response inhibition, resistance to distractor interference, and resistance to proactive interferencein BPD and to verify the putative modulating role of self-referential stimuli and processes on these inhibition processes. All English and French experimental studies published until August 2018 were searched in PsychINFO and PubMED databases. The following keywords were used: borderline* AND inhibit* OR interference* OR forget* OR task* AND emotion* OR stress* OR affect*. A total of 1215 articles were included in the study. After full text revision, twenty-six papers were selected for review. The results of this review indicate that when stimuli or procedures involve self-reference stimuli or processes, BPD individuals' performance seems to be more disrupted in all three inhibition processes. A model based on Winter's and Kernberg's models is proposed with the aim of integrating the self-concept with inhibition processes in BPD.

AB  - Species reintroductions - the translocation of individuals to areas in which a species has been extirpated with the aim of re-establishing a self-sustaining population - have become a widespread practice in conservation biology. Reintroduction projects have tended to focus on terrestrial vertebrates and, to a lesser extent, fishes. Much less effort has been devoted to the reintroduction of invertebrates into restored freshwater habitats. Yet, reintroductions may improve restoration outcomes in regions where impoverished regional species pools limit the self-recolonisation of restored freshwaters. We review the available literature on macroinvertebrate reintroductions, focusing on identifying the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that determine their success or failure. Our study reveals that freshwater macroinvertebrate reintroductions remain rare, are often published in the grey literature and, of the attempts made, approximately one-third fail. We identify life-cycle complexity and remaining stressors as the two factors most likely to affect reintroduction success, illustrating the unique challenges of freshwater macroinvertebrate reintroductions. Consideration of these factors by managers during the planning process and proper documentation - even if a project fails - may increase the likelihood of successful outcomes in future reintroduction attempts of freshwater macroinvertebrates.

AB  - Background Government policies can strongly influence migrants' health. Using a Health in All Policies approach, we systematically reviewed evidence on the impact of public policies outside of the health-care system on migrant health.
   Methods We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 1, 2017, for quantitative studies comparing the health effects of non-health-targeted public policies on migrants with those on a relevant comparison population. We searched for articles written in English, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, French, Spanish, or Portuguese. Qualitative studies and grey literature were excluded. We evaluated policy effects by migration stage (entry, integration, and exit) and by health outcome using narrative synthesis (all included studies) and random-effects meta-analysis (all studies whose results were amenable to statistical pooling). We summarised meta-analysis outcomes as standardised mean difference (SMD, 95% CI) or odds ratio (OR, 95% CI). To assess certainty, we created tables containing a summary of the findings according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Our study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017076104.
   Findings We identified 43 243 potentially eligible records. 46 articles were narratively synthesised and 19 contributed to the meta-analysis. All studies were published in high-income countries and examined policies of entry (nine articles) and integration (37 articles). Restrictive entry policies (eg, temporary visa status, detention) were associated with poor mental health (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.13-0.75; I-2=92.1%). In the integration phase, restrictive policies in general, and specifically regarding welfare eligibility and documentation requirements, were found to increase odds of poor self rated health (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.35-1.98; I-2=82.0%) and mortality (1.38, 1.10-1.65; I-2=98.9%). Restricted eligibility for welfare support decreased the odds of general health-care service use (0.92, 0.85-0.98; I-2=0.0%), but did not reduce public health insurance coverage (0.89, 0. 71-1.07; I-2=99.4%), nor markedly affect proportions of people without health insurance (1.06, 0.90-1.21; I-2=54.9%).
   Interpretation Restrictive entry and integration policies are linked to poor migrant health outcomes in high-income countries. Efforts to improve the health of migrants would benefit from adopting a Health in All Policies perspective. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A growing number of studies have investigated technology-based interventions (computer, phone, tablet, robot, etc.) for supporting children and teenagers with ASD, notably in school settings. Past reviews stressed study design weaknesses of TBI researches. This systematic review has threefold purpose: 1) to update the previous ones with a focus on clinical-quality studies; 2) to examine reliability, consistency, durability and generalization of measurements; and 3) to compare the methodology of two cores of studies according to two dimensions: Therapeutic Effectiveness (TE) and Technology Usability (TU). From the 685 search results, 31 studies were selected (22 on TE, 6 on TU, and 3 on TE-TU). Overall, few studies reached the standards of evidence-based practices (reliability, consistency, durability, generalization). TE studies provided more evidence of their reliability than TU and TU-TE studies. Moreover, the examination of studies' results revealed that: 1) the more robust study designs, the less consistent TBI effect, 2) the more reliable the measure, the less large TBI-related effect size. Although less robust, TE-TU studies can be seen as an emerging interdisciplinary approach, combining expertise in human-computer interaction and clinical research.

AB  - Background: The high prevalence and burden to society of drug abuse and addiction is undisputed. However, its conceptualisation as a brain disease is controversial, and available interventions insufficient. Research on the role of stress in drug addiction may bridge positions and develop more effective interventions.
   Aim: The aim of this paper is to integrate the most influential literature to date on the role of stress in drug addiction.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted of the core collections of Web of Science and Semantic Scholar on the topic of stress and addiction from a neurobiological perspective in humans. The most frequently cited articles and related references published in the last decade were finally redrafted into a narrative review based on 130 full-text articles.
   Results and discussion: First, a brief overview of the neurobiology of stress and drug addiction is provided. Then, the role of stress in drug addiction is described. Stress is conceptualised as a major source of allostatic load, which result in progressive long-term changes in the brain, leading to a drug-prone state characterized by craving and increased risk of relapse. The effects of stress on drug addiction are mainly mediated by the action of corticotropin-releasing factor and other stress hormones, which weaken the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and strengthen the amygdala, leading to a negative emotional state, craving and lack of executive control, increasing the risk of relapse. Both, drugs and stress result in an allostatic overload responsible for neuroadaptations involved in most of the key features of addiction: reward anticipation/craving, negative affect, and impaired executive functions, involved in three stages of addiction and relapse.
   Conclusion: This review elucidates the crucial role of stress in drug addiction and highlights the need to incorporate the social context where brain-behaviour relationships unfold into the current model of addition.

AB  - Early life Stress is a worldwide concern linked with development of later life neurological disorders. Early developmental age is sensitive to many prominent environmental insults like malnourishment, immune inflammation, abuse, maternal separation, alcohol and drugs. Hence, an individual during an early age encounters more than one simultaneous stressor that leads to impairment of cognitive and behavioral abilities, a symptom common to most of the neurological disorders. Stressors like malnourishment and immune inflammation are common and encountered by a huge number of populations, contributing enormously to a damaged CNS and in most of the cases they act synergistically in dependency to each other, giving rise to the concept of multi-hit. Multi perinatal hit acts by mimicking the mechanism of ageing in CNS and increasing the risk for later life neurological disorders. Multi stress exposure is also responsible for disrupting the cellular homeostasis of the brain by inducing glial activation, neurotoxicity and oxidative stress, which is the major reason of cell death and circuitry damage in brain. Multi perinatal hit thus increases the risk of neurological disorders by many folds through interfering with ongoing developmental cascades and eventually modulating the fate of cellular components in brain. Thus, a stress induced architecturally and chemically altered CNS is vulnerable and prone to neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, ALS, Autism and Parkinson's disease. This review compiles the information available regarding the effects of early life stressors on different components of brain, primarily focusing on the connection between perinatally encountered multi hit and development of later life neurological disorders.

AB  - Background Health promotion in the workplace is intended to enhance employee health and well-being. Yoga programmes are easy to implement and have been effective in the management of various health conditions.
   Aims To assess the evidence regarding the effectiveness of yoga programmes at work.
   Methods A search of electronic databases of published studies up until the 1st of April 2017. Inclusion criteria for the systematic review were randomized controlled trials of adult employees and yoga in the workplace. Quality appraisal was carried out using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials.
   Results Of 1343 papers identified, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Nine out of 13 trials were classified as having an unclear risk of bias. The overall effects of yoga on mental health outcomes were beneficial, mainly on stress. Most of the cardiovascular endpoints showed no differences between yoga and controls. Other outcomes reported positive effects of yoga or no change.
   Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that yoga has a positive effect on health in the workplace, particularly in reducing stress, and no negative effects were reported in any of the randomized controlled trials. Further larger studies are required to confirm this.

AB  - Background: Active play and physical activity are important for preventing childhood obesity, building healthy bones and muscles, reducing anxiety and stress, and increasing self-esteem. Unfortunately, safe and accessible play places are often lacking in under-resourced communities. Play Streets (temporary closure of streets) are an understudied intervention that provide safe places for children, adolescents, and their families to actively play. This systematic review examines how Play Streets impact opportunities for children and adolescents to engage in safe active play and physical activity, and for communities and neighborhoods. Methods for evaluating Play Streets were also examined.
   Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in Academic Search Complete, CINHAL, PsycINFO, PubMED, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Peer-reviewed intervention studies published worldwide were included if they were published in English, through December 2017 and documented free-to-access Play Streets or other temporary spaces that incorporated a designated area for children and/or adolescents to engage in active play. Systematic data extraction documented sample, implementation, and measurement characteristics and outcomes.
   Results: Of 180 reviewed abstracts, 6 studies met inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in five different countries (n = 2 in U.S.), using mostly cross-sectional study designs (n = 4). Physical activity outcomes were measured in half of the studies; one used observational and self-report measures, and two used device-based and self-report measures. In general, Play Streets provided safe places for child play, increased sense of community, and when measured, data suggest increased physical activity overall and during Play Streets.
   Conclusions: Play Streets can create safe places for children to actively play, with promise of increasing physical activity and strengthening community. Given the popularity of Play Streets and the potential impact for active play, physical activity, and community level benefits, more rigorous evaluations and systematic reporting of Play Streets' evaluations are needed.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prominentmental health problemin veteran and community populations. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that aerobic exercise may serve as an effective treatment option for individuals with PTSD. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing literature exploring aerobic exercise and PTSD and briefly discuss potential mechanisms of PTSD symptom reduction. A search of electronic databases and reference sections of relevant articles published through October 1, 2018 revealed 19 relevant studies that examined aerobic exercise and PTSD symptomatology. A narrative review of extant studies provides encouraging evidence that aerobic exercise interventions alone or as an adjunct to standard treatmentmay positively impact PTSD symptoms. Potential mechanisms by which aerobic exercise could exert a positive impact in PTSD include exposure and desensitization to internal arousal cues, enhanced cognitive function, exercise-induced neuroplasticity, normalization of hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) function, and reductions in inflammatory markers. Randomized clinical trials and translational neuroscience approaches are required to clarify the efficacy of exercise intervention for PTSD and elucidate potential mechanisms of exercise-induced PTSD symptom reduction.

AB  - Background: The beneficial effects of exercise training on depressive symptoms are well-established. In the past years, more research attention has been drawn to the specific effects of exercise training on depressive symptoms in somatically ill patients. This reviews aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the current findings and evidence of exercise interventions in somatic disorders to improve depressive symptoms.
   Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Cochrane databases and extracted meta-analyses from somatically ill patients that underwent exercise interventions and provided information about the outcome of depressive symptoms.
   Results: Of the 4123 detected publications, 39 were selected for final analysis. Various diseases were included (breast-cancer, prostate cancer, mixed-cancer, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hemodialysis, fibromyalgia syndrome, acute leukemia, other hematologicalmalignancies, heart failure, HIV, multiple sclerosis, mixed neurological disorders, Parkinson's disease, stroke, ankylosing spondylitis, traumatic brain injury, lupus erythematodes). Mostmeta-analyses (33/39) found beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, but quality of the included studies as well as duration, intensity, frequency, and type of exercise varied widely.
   Conclusion: Exercise training has the potential to improve depressive symptoms in patients with somatic disorders. For specific training recommendations, more high quality studies with structured exercise programs and better comparability are needed.

AB  - Psychotherapy as a field tends toward conservativism, and the rate of innovation and development of new evidence-based effective treatments has been slow. The paper explores important barriers to innovation like the dodo bird verdict and the habit of starting the development of therapeutic methods from techniques. The paper looks at the opportunities for translating basic science in psychology into psychotherapeutic techniques. Metacognitive therapy stands out from other psychotherapies by its development from basic science. The paper describes the development of the techniques detached mindfulness and attention training, how they were derived from basic science and tested for their suitability in the therapy of patients with anxiety disorders. By this process, metacognitive therapy may be an important model for the innovation process in psychotherapy.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder that results from the progressive degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neurons. As a consequence of SNc degeneration, the striatum undergoes DA depletion causing the emergence of motor symptoms such as resting tremor, bradykinesia, postural instability and rigidity. The primary cell type in the striatum is the spiny projection neuron (SPN), which can be divided into two subpopulations, the direct and indirect pathway; the direct pathway innervates the substantia nigra pars reticulata and internal segment of the globus pallidus whereas the indirect pathway innervates the external segment of the globus pallidus. Proper control of movement requires a delicate balance between the two pathways; in PD dysfunction occurs in both cell types and impairments in synaptic plasticity are found in transgenic and toxin rodent models of PD. However, it is difficult to ascertain how the striatum adapts during different stages of PD, particularly during premotor stages. In the natural evolution of PD, patients experience years of degeneration before motor symptoms arise. To model premotor PD, partial lesion rodents and transgenic mice demonstrating progressive nigral degeneration have been and will continue to be assets to the field. Although, rodent models emulating premotor PD are not fully asymptomatic; modest reductions in striatal DA result in cognitive impairments. This mini review article gives a brief summary of SPN dynamics in animal models of PD.

Resilience is a unifying theoretical concept which incorporates many of the skills and resources linked with the transition to parenthood, but the uptake of resilience theory in this literature is unknown. Methods: We used a scoping review to examine the use of resilience theory in published transition to parenthood research. This included a systematic search of the literature, descriptive analysis of theories and methods used and an assessment of theoretical integration. Results: We identified 17 studies which met inclusion criteria. Explicit use of theory occurred in six studies and quality of theoretical integration was high for all of these. Resilience was seen as a desirable concept for mapping complex data, taking a holistic approach to psychological health and acknowledging environmental and systemic influences. We also identified 29 resilience supporting factors including positive self-concept, optimism, social support, family relationships, community services and social connectedness. Conclusion: Resilience is a useful concept for synthesising information about the transition to parenthood.

AB  - Ocean ecosystems are subject to a multitude of stressors, including changes in ocean physics and biogeochemistry, and direct anthropogenic influences. Implementation of protective and adaptive measures for ocean ecosystems requires a combination of ocean observations with analysis and prediction tools. These can guide assessments of the current state of ocean ecosystems, elucidate ongoing trends and shifts, and anticipate impacts of climate change and management policies. Analysis and prediction tools are defined here as ocean circulation models that are coupled to biogeochemical or ecological models. The range of potential applications for these systems is broad, ranging from reanalyses for the assessment of past and current states, and short-term and seasonal forecasts, to scenario simulations including climate change projections. The objectives of this article are to illustrate current capabilities with regard to the three types of applications, and to discuss the challenges and opportunities. Representative examples of global and regional systems are described with particular emphasis on those in operational or pre-operational use. With regard to the benefits and challenges, similar considerations apply to biogeochemical and ecological prediction systems as do to physical systems. However, at present there are at least two major differences: (1) biogeochemical observation streams are much sparser than physical streams presenting a significant hinderance, and (2) biogeochemical and ecological models are largely unconstrained because of insufficient observations. Expansion of biogeochemical and ecological observation systems will allow for significant advances in the development and application of analysis and prediction tools for ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystems, with multiple societal benefits.

AB  - Background: Recent systematic review andmeta-analyses have tried to identify an association between PM2.5 exposure and stroke, but few could find a conclusive and comprehensive evidence. Moreover, the associations between PM2.5, neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders have never been reviewed. We aimed to assess the effects of PM2.5 exposure on stroke, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Parkinson's disease, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Methods: We searched PubMed and CNKI databases for articles published until June 2018. Studies were eligible for analysis if they were human studies and provided risk estimates with 95% CI. We screened 1645 articles and identified 80 eligible studies covering 26 countries across all continents except Antarctica. Risks of incidence and mortality were extracted and stratified by types of neurological disorders, PM2.5 concentration and duration of PM2.5 exposure.
   Results: We found significant association between PM2.5 exposure and stroke, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, ASD, Parkinson's disease. The risks of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were higher than that of stroke in general, and that hemorrhagic stroke had by far the highest mortality. The risk of stroke for heavily polluted countries was significantly higher than that of lightly polluted countries. Short- and long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased risks of stroke (short-term odds ratio 1.01 [ per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentrations], 95% CI 1.01-1.02; long-term 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.21) and mortality (short-term 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04; long-term 1.15, 95% CI 1.07-1.24) of stroke. Long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased risks of dementia (1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.26), Alzheimer's disease (3.26, 95% 0.84-12.74), ASD (1.68, 95% CI 1.20-2.34), and Parkinson's disease (1.34, 95% CI 1.04-1.73).
   Conclusions: There is a strong association between PM2.5 exposure and neurological disorders. National governments should exert greater efforts to improve air quality given its health implications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic and lacks a range of successful interventions to reduce this public health burden. Many individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) consume drugs to relieve physical and/or emotional pain, a pattern that may increasingly result in death. The field of addiction research lacks a comprehensive understanding of physiological and neural mechanisms instantiating this cycle of Negative Reinforcement in OUD, resulting in limited interventions that successfully promote abstinence and recovery. Given the urgency of the opioid crisis, the present review highlights faulty brain circuitry and processes associated with OUD within the context of the Three-Stage Model of Addiction (1). This model underscores Negative Reinforcement processes as crucial to the maintenance and exacerbation of chronic substance use together with Binge/Intoxication and Preoccupation/Anticipation processes. This review focuses on cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies of relapse and treatment outcome that employ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs), brain stimulation methods, and/or electroencephalography (EEG) explored in frequency and time domains (the latter measured by event-related potentials, or ERPs). We discuss strengths and limitations of this neuroimaging work with respect to study design and individual differences that may influence interpretation of findings (e.g., opioid use chronicity/recency, comorbid symptoms, and biological sex). Lastly, we translate gaps in the OUD literature, particularly with respect to Negative Reinforcement processes, into future research directions involving operant and classical conditioning involving aversion/stress. Overall, opioid-related stimuli may lessen their hold on frontocingulate mechanisms implicated in Preoccupation/Anticipation as a function of prolonged abstinence and that degree of frontocingulate impairment may predict treatment outcome. In addition, longitudinal studies suggest that brain stimulation/drug treatments and prolonged abstinence can change brain responses during Negative Reinforcement and Preoccupation/Anticipation to reduce salience of drug cues, which may attenuate further craving and relapse. Incorporating this neuroscience-derived knowledge with the Three-Stage Model of Addiction may offer a useful plan for delineating specific neurobiological targets for OUD treatment.

AB  - Background: Emotional memory is an adaptive process that improves the memorization of emotional events or stimuli. In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), emotional memory may be altered, which in turn may affect symptoms. Having a clearer view of the processes of interaction between memory and emotional stimuli in PTSD may improve our knowledge of this disorder, and could create new therapeutic management tools. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the evidence of specific emotional memory in PTSD patients.
   Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and ScienceDirect was undertaken to identify controlled studies on emotional memory that used cognitive tasks on PTSD patients. The initial research was conducted from June 2017 to July 2017, and search terms included: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; PTSD; emotional memory; emotion; emotional; memory; and episodic memory.
   Results: Eighteen studies reporting on 387 PTSD patients met the eligibility criteria. Among the studies selected, 11 observed specific memory processing in PTSD patients, such as a greater memorization of negative information, or a trend to false recognition of negative information. In addition, attentional and inhibition processing seem to play an important role in emotional memory in PTSD sufferers. Furthermore, other studies that did not find behavioral differences between PTSD and control groups nevertheless showed differences in both specific cerebral activities and neurohormone levels during emotional memory tasks.
   Conclusion: This review has several limitations, including a limited number of controlled studies, small sample sizes, different tasks and methods. Nevertheless, the results of this systematic review provide interesting information on emotional memory for clinicians and researchers, as they seem to highlight facilitated memory processing for negative information in PTSD patients. This topic needs further controlled studies with sensitive behavioral tasks. Also, future studies may evaluate emotional memory after symptom amelioration.

AB  - Although up to 50% of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) meet criteria for an anxiety disorder, it is unclear how comorbid anxiety influences social functioning for this population, Understanding the factors associated with social functioning in ADHD is important given the limited efficacy of existing social skills interventions for this population. This systematic review aimed to determine the association between anxiety and social functioning (social problems, peer status, and social skills/ competence) in children and adolescents with ADHD. A standardised search protocol was used, identifying 4807 articles for screening with 31 included in the final review. Anxiety symptom severity was associated with lower levels of social skills and higher levels of social problems in young people with ADHD. However, few differences emerged when defining anxiety based on diagnostic measures. Although the results varied considerably amongst studies, a number of key variables emerged that influenced the associations between anxiety and social functioning including the type of reporter and sample characteristics such as age, sex, ADHD subtype and other mental health comorbidities. These findings have implications for social functioning interventions in ADHD given the role of anxiety symptoms in predicting poorer social functioning.

   Results
   Antipsychotics, particularly long-acting preparations such as paliperidone palmitate, might be beneficial in reducing mortality risk in schizophrenia.
   Conclusions
   Although data on the effect of antipsychotics on mortality are encouraging, the field of psychiatry is still far from achieving results in line with what observed in other areas of medicine (for instance in oncology and cardiology). Only the implementation of accurate clinical monitoring and a stronger engagement of the medical field in the care of people affected by mental disorders, will overcome the scandal of the underestimation of their physical health problems and the undeniable disparities they meet when specific treatments for physical disorders with an important impact on survival are needed.

AB  - How and where sensory stimuli, such as tones or lights, are linked to valence is an important unresolved question in the field of neuroscience. The auditory cortex is essential to analyse the identity and the behavioural importance of tones paired with emotional events. On the contrary, whether the auditory cortex may also encode information on the emotional-motivational valence of sounds is much more controversial. Here, we reviewed recent studies showing that the activity of cortical neurons reflects information about the content of emotional stimuli paired with tones. Critically, the blockade of these neuronal processes prevents animals from recognising sounds as aversive or pleasant. Based on these findings, we proposed a conceptual model in which the auditory cortex may incorporate ascending information from subcortical nuclei about the valence of sounds in sound representations and may consequently drive the activity of subcortical structures towards emotionally laden tones.
   This hypothesis may also have important implications in the characterisation of neural circuits engaged by maladaptive affective disorders, such as phobias.

AB  - The revolutionary discovery of the rapid antidepressant ketamine has been a milestone in psychiatry field in the last half century. Unlike conventional antidepressants that often take weeks to months to show efficacy, ketamine causes rapid antidepressant effects, emerging as early as within 1 h after administration. However, how ketamine improves mood symptoms so quickly has remained elusive. Here, we first introduce the historical background of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant. We then discuss current hypotheses underlying ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects, with a focus on our latest discovery that ketamine silences NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the 'anti-reward center', the lateral habenula. While ketamine may act on many brain regions, we argue that its rapid antidepressant effects are critically dependent on ketamine's action in the lateral habenula, with this brain region acting as a primary site of action (or one among a few primary nodes). This molecular-, cellular-, and circuit-based mechanism advances our understanding of the etiology of depression and suggests a new conceptual framework for the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine.

AB  - The medical community and the general public are aware of sudden deaths in apparently healthy infants (SIDS) and in cases of cardiac arrest (SCD). However, there is a third, less-well known, form of sudden death that occurs in persons with epilepsy (SUDEP). This paper provides a detailed overview what is known about SUDEP, including the current important, unresolved issues being considered in the field (research, education, informed consent). This paper also includes an overview of the grieving process common to all three conditions. Again, the current issues being considered in the field of grieving are presented (major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder). It is written for physicians, including psychiatrists, and for the health community beyond neurologists and serves as a provider resource for persons with epilepsy, their families, and for the general public. This information about SUDEP and grief becomes also additionally important as national health care moves toward an interdisciplinary primary care model of service delivery.

AB  - Poor sleep is associated with bad health outcomes, worse wellbeing and decreases in performance, productivity and safety at work. Police officers are exposed to several risk factors including extended work schedules, shift work, occupational stress, dangerous and traumatic events and can, as such, develop sleep problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the sleep quality among police officers. A systematic literature search, in PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, ISI/Web of Science (WoS) and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Original articles, published in English, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, the primary objective of which was the evaluation of the quality of sleep through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in Police Forces, were selected. From an initial sample of 1,149 studies, 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis (3,722 police officers). The pooled prevalence of bad sleep quality in police officers was 51% [95%CI 42-60%]. The pooled global score of the PSQI was 5.6 [95%CI 5.0-6.3], corresponding to a low average quality. At the meta-regressions, statistically significant associations could be found for work seniority (in terms of years of service) and being on shift. The poor quality of sleep in police officers could have negative consequences for workers' health and for the safety of third parts. The implementation of health and sleep hygiene promotion programs in police forces is strongly recommended.

AB  - This study examined Nordic research on psychosocial work environment and disability management, specifically employer strategies for preventing work disability in common mental disorders (CMDs). A scoping review was performed to identify strategies across several research databases, alongside contact with content experts, hand-searching of non-indexed journals, and internet searches. Identification and selection of relevant studies, charting of data, and collating and summarizing of results was done using a six-step framework for conducting scoping reviews. Several key elements and knowledge gaps were identified in current prevention approaches and workplace initiatives across the included studies. We propose a program theory for workplace prevention of CMD-related work disability. The program theory may help specify employer strategies, and bridge activities with stakeholders outside the workplace.

AB  - There is substantive evidence for the importance of physical activity (PA) for people with mental illness (MI). Health care providers play an integral role in helping individuals with MI engage in PA, yet there are numerous factors that impede the promotion of PA within clinical practice.
   Objective: The purpose of this review was to identify and theoretically analyze the barriers and facilitators for health care providers in promoting PA to individuals with MI.
   Methods: A scoping review with systematic searches was conducted. Eligible studies required sample populations of health care providers working with individuals with MI that reported empirical data on barriers and/or facilitators to PA promotion using quantitative and/or qualitative methods. Barriers and facilitators were extracted and classified into the fourteen domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF).
   Results: Thirty-three studies were included (15 quantitative, 12 qualitative, 6 mixed-methods), with a total of 231 factors extracted and coded to the TDF domains. Barriers and facilitators were most often classified under the domains of 'Beliefs about Consequences' and 'Environmental Context & Resources'. The most common barriers to PA promotion was a belief that clients could not overcome barriers to PA engagement, and a lack of training on how to promote PA to individuals with MI.
   Conclusions: Education and training that incorporates behaviour change techniques for health care providers are needed to address the identified barriers and to facilitate implementation of clinical guidelines into practice. Greater integration of PA promotion within mental health care will likely require broader systemic change.

AB  - Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS) is a common, heritable and evolutionarily conserved trait describing inter individual differences in sensitivity to both negative and positive environments. Despite societal interest in SPS, scientific knowledge is lagging behind. Here, we critically discuss how SPS relates to other theories, how to measure SPS, whether SPS is a continuous vs categorical trait, its relation to other temperament and personality traits, the underlying aetiology and neurobiological mechanisms, and relations to both typical and atypical development, including mental and sensory disorders. Drawing on the diverse expertise of the authors, we set an agenda for future research to stimulate the field. We conclude that SPS increases risk for stress-related problems in response to negative environments, but also provides greater benefit from positive and supportive experiences. The field requires more reliable and objective assessment of SPS, and deeper understanding of its mechanisms to differentiate it from other traits. Future research needs to target prevention of adverse effects associated with SPS, and exploitation of its positive potential to improve well-being and mental health.

AB  - Objective To summarize current evidence on the impacts of child labor on physical and mental health.
   Methods We searched PubMed and ScienceDirect for studies that included participants aged 18 years or less, conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and reported quantitative data. Two independent reviewers conducted data extraction and assessment of study quality.
   Results A total of 25 studies were identified, the majority of which were cross-sectional. Child labor was found to be associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, including but not limited to poor growth, malnutrition, higher incidence of infectious and system-specific diseases, behavioral and emotional disorders, and decreased coping efficacy. Quality of included studies was rated as fair to good.
   Conclusion and recommendations Child labor remains a major public health concern in LMICs, being associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Current efforts against child labor need to be revisited, at least in LMICs. Further studies following a longitudinal design, and using common methods to assess the health impact of child labor in different country contexts would inform policy making.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Measurement-based care (MBC) is the systematic evaluation of patient symptoms before or during an encounter to inform behavioral health treatment. Despite MBC's demonstrated ability to enhance usual care by expediting improvements and rapidly detecting patients whose health would otherwise deteriorate, it is underused, with typically less than 20% of behavioral health practitioners integrating it into their practice. This narrative review addresses definitional issues, offers a concrete and evaluable operationalization of MBC fidelity, and summarizes the evidence base and utility of MBC. It also synthesizes the extant literature's characterization of barriers to and strategies for supporting MBC implementation, sustainment, and scale-up.
   OBSERVATIONS Barriers to implementing MBC occur at multiple levels: patient (eg, concerns about confidentiality breach), practitioner (eg, beliefs that measures are no better than clinical judgment), organization (eg, no resources for training), and system (eg, competing requirements). Implementation science the study of methods to integrate evidence-based practices such as MBC into routine care offers strategies to address barriers. These strategies include using measurement feedback systems, leveraging local champions, forming learning collaboratives, training leadership, improving expert consultation with clinical staff, and generating incentives.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This narrative review, informed by implementation science, offers a 10-point research agenda to improve the integration of MBC into clinical practice: (1) harmonize terminology and specify MBC's core components; (2) develop criterion standard methods for monitoring fidelity and reporting quality of implementation; (3) develop algorithms for MBC to guide psychotherapy; (4) test putative mechanisms of change, particularly for psychotherapy; (5) develop brief and psychometrically strong measures for use in combination; (6) assess the critical timing of administration needed to optimize patient outcomes; (7) streamline measurement feedback systems to include only key ingredients and enhance electronic health record interoperability; (8) identify discrete strategies to support implementation; (9) make evidence-based policy decisions; and (10) align reimbursement structures.

AB  - Background Long-term use of opioids to treat chronic pain incurs serious risks for the individual-including misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death-as well as creating economic, social, and cultural impacts on society as a whole. Chronic pain and substance use disorders are often co-morbid with other medical problems and at the present time, primary care clinicians serve most of this population. Primary care clinicians would benefit from having alternatives to opioids to employ in treating such patients. Method We electronically searched different medical databases for studies evaluating the effect of nonpharmacological treatments for chronic pain. We describe alternative approaches for the treatment of chronic pain and cite studies that provide substantial evidence in favor of the use of these treatments. Results Cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness-based programs have well-documented effectiveness for the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain. Integration of such behavioral health therapies into primary care settings may optimize health resources and improve treatment outcomes. Conclusion Evidence-based psychotherapy for chronic pain has established efficacy and safety and improves quality of life and physical and emotional functioning. Such interventions may be used as an alternative or adjunct to pharmacological management. Chronic opioid use should be reserved for individuals undergoing active cancer treatment, palliative care, or end-of-life care.

AB  - Background: The use of light for its antidepressant action dates back to the beginnings of civilization. Three decades ago, the use of bright-light therapy (BLT) for treating Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) was officially proposed. Since then, a growing scientific literature reports its antidepressant efficacy in both unipolar and bipolar disorders (BD), with or without seasonal patterns. This review aims to examine the management of BLT as a personalized and precision treatment in SAD, unipolar, and BD.
   Methods: We conducted a narrative review using Medline and Google Scholar databases up to June 2018.
   Results: BLT has physiological effects by resynchronizing the biological clock (circadian system), enhancing alertness, increasing sleep pressure (homeostatic system), and acting on serotonin, and other monoaminergic pathways. Effects of BLT on mood depend on several factors such as light intensity, wavelength spectrum, illumination duration, time of the day, and individual circadian rhythms. A growing body of evidence has been generated over the last decade about BLT evolving as an effective depression treatment not only to be used in SAD, but also in non-seasonal depression, with efficiency comparable to fluoxetine, and possibly more robust in patients with BD. The antidepressant action of BLT is fast (within 1-week) and safe, with the need in BD to protect against manic switch with mood stabilizers. Side effects might be nausea, diarrhea, headache, and eye irritation, and are generally mild and rare. This good safety profile may be of particular interest, especially in women during the perinatal period or for the elderly. The management of BLT needs to be clarified across mood disorders and future studies are expected to compare different dose-titration protocols, to validate its use as a maintenance treatment, and also to identify predictive biomarkers of response and tolerability. We propose clinical guidelines for BLT use in SAD, non-seasonal depression, and BD.
   Conclusions : BLT is an efficient antidepressant strategy in mono-or adjunct-therapy, that should be personalized according the unipolar or bipolar subtype, the presence or absence of seasonal patterns, and also regarding its efficacy and tolerability.

AB  - The use of animals in neurosciences has a long history. It is considered indispensable in areas in which translational research is deemed invaluable, such as behavioral pharmacology and comparative psychology. Animal models are being used in pharmacology and genetics to screen for treatment targets, and in the field of experimental psychopathology to understand the neurobehavioral underpinnings of a disorder and of its putative treatment. The centrality of behavioral models betrays the complexity of the epistemic and semantic considerations which are needed to understand what a model is. In this review, such considerations are made, and the breadth of model building and evaluation approaches is extended to include theoretical considerations on the etiology of mental disorders. This expansion is expected to help improve the validity of behavioral models and to increase their translational value. Moreover, the role of theory in improving construct validity creates the need for behavioral scientists to fully engage this process.

AB  - Anxiety is common among people with autism and is associated with unique and additive challenges. Anxiety is thought to have neurobiological components, and measures of arousal in typical development have long been studied. Recently, neurobiological measures of anxiety in autism have begun to receive empirical evaluation, but results have not yet been examined together. This systematic review, therefore, summarizes the state of the research of the neurobiology of anxiety in autism. Studies published between 1999 and June 2017 were reviewed. Results across measures of arousal point to inconsistencies in results and a lack of synthesis in the literature. Considerations regarding these inconsistencies are discussed, recommendations for future studies are offered, and clinical implications for this work are presented. Autism Res 2019, 12: 346-369 (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
   Lay SummaryAnxiety is common among people with autism. Because anxiety has been linked with a variety of differences in physiological (bodily) and neurophysiological (brain) functioning in people without autism, research has begun to examine these processes in autism as well. This literature, however, has not yet been examined as a whole. Therefore, this paper begins to address that gap to provide the field with a better understanding of how anxiety affects people with autism and discusses implications for future research and clinical practice.

AB  - Currently, there are approximately 12.8 million Syrian refugees and displaced persons, many of whom are in perimigration, the phase between initial displacement and eventual resettlement, and half of all refugees are children ( United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], 2018a). The experiences associated with perimigration and their impact on caregivers and children have yet to be systematically reviewed from an ecological systems perspective. Three online databases, gray literature, and references of existing studies were searched for articles that (a) investigated caregivers or families, (b) distinguished the perimigration period, ( c) characterized resource deprivation or stress exposure, and (d) investigated war and conflict-exposed internally displaced persons or refugees. Our search produced 245 articles, 34 of which were extracted. Domains of stress exposure were summarized as: inadequate living conditions; decreased opportunities, resources, and services; trauma, victimization, and security concerns; ongoing migration and family separation; discrimination; and detention and asylum-seeking. The following were operationalized as outcomes: child and caregiver mental health; child physical health; child abuse, neglect or harsh parenting; and child exploitation. These findings are applied in consideration of the largest current displaced population, Syrians. Implications for future research and intervention are discussed.

Methods: A systematic review based on PRISMA guidelines. The literature was searched in PsycINFO and PubMed between June and September 2016. The Effective Public Health Practice Project tool was used to assess the quality of the included study. Results: In total 53 randomized controlled trial studies qualified for the systematic review. Across studies, three types of common conceptual themes emerged for interventions, including: 1) individual characteristics; 2) content and structure of the interventions; and 3) implementation of the interventions. Conclusions: No specific interventions could be recommended on the aforementioned basis. We conclude that a number of factors are of central importance for an intervention to have the desired effect. If these factors are considered, mental health can be successfully promoted among older adults.

This review systematically collates published research on neural response during simple avoidance of threat and approach-avoidance behaviour during goal-conflicting situations and presents an exploratory meta analysis of available whole-brain data. Scopus, Psychlnfo and Web of Science databases were searched for the period up to March 2018. 1348 simple avoidance and 1910 goal-conflict publications were initially identified; following review, 8 simple avoidance and 11 goal-conflict studies were included, with 5 datasets used in a preliminary meta-analysis. A move from forebrain-to-midbrain activation as threat becomes more pertinent was noted, indicating support for the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of behaviour and general compatibility with animal work. However, these findings were not reflected in the subsequent preliminary meta-analysis. This review highlights the considerable heterogeneity in currently available defensive behaviour paradigms and the lack of research in clinically relevant populations.

AB  - The frequent misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with detrimental consequences and inappropriate treatments. The 32-item Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) are widely used self-report screening instruments for BD. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the psychometric properties of the HCL-32 and the MDQ based on the same patient samples. Two reviewers systematically and independently searched PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies using the HCL-32 and MDQ concurrently and reporting their psychometric properties were included. Eleven studies that met the entry criteria were included in the systematic review, and 9 studies with relevant data were included in the meta-analysis. Using study-defined cutoffs, summary sensitivities were 82% (95% CI: 72%-89%) and 80% (95% CI: 71%-86%), while specificities were 57% (95% CI: 48%-66%) and 70% (95% CI: 59%-71%) for the HCL-32 and the MDQ respectively. Both the HCL-32 and the MDQ have acceptable psychometric properties to identify BD and appear to be useful screening tools for BD.

Because career indecision remains a central topic for counseling, it is important for the field to achieve an updated understanding of relevant models and measurement. Based on their review, the authors found that factors of career indecision can be reliably and validly measured by three instruments: the Career Decision Difficulties Questionnaire, the Emotional and Personality Career Difficulties scale, and the Career Indecision Profile. Drawing from these results, the authors developed an integrative model of career indecision consisting of five factors: neuroticism/negative affectivity, choice/commitment anxiety, need for information, lack of readiness, and interpersonal conflicts. Implications and recommendations for practice and research are discussed in a global context.

KW  - CARE
AB  - Introduction To inform the WHO Guideline on self-care interventions, we conducted a systematic review of the impact of ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) on time-to-pregnancy, pregnancy, live birth, stress/anxiety, social harms/adverse events and values/preferences.
   Methods Included studies had to compare women desiring pregnancy who managed their fertility with and without OPKs, measure an outcome of interest and be published in a peer-reviewed journal. We searched for studies on PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS and EMBASE through November 2018. We assessed risk of bias assessed using the Cochrane tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and the Evidence Project tool for observational studies, and conducted meta-analysis using random effects models to generate pooled estimates of relative risk (RR).
   Results Four studies (three RCTs and one observational study) including 1487 participants, all in high-income countries, were included. Quality of evidence was low. Two RCTs found no difference in time-to-pregnancy. All studies reported pregnancy rate, with mixed results: one RCT from the 1990s among couples with unexplained or male-factor infertility found no difference in clinical pregnancy rate (RR: 1.09, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.32); two more recent RCTs found higher self-reported pregnancy rates among OPK users (pooled RR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.80). A small observational study found higher rates of pregnancy with lab testing versus OPKs among women using donor insemination services. One RCT found no increase in stress/anxiety after two menstrual cycles using OPKs, besides a decline in positive affect. No studies measured live birth or social harms/adverse events. Six studies presented end-users' values/preferences, with almost all women reporting feeling satisfied, comfortable and confident using OPKs.
   Conclusion A small evidence base, from high-income countries and with high risk of bias, suggests that homebased use of OPKs may improve fertility management when attempting to become pregnant with no meaningful increase in stress/anxiety and with high user acceptability.

AB  - Background and aims: Antisocial personality disorder is an enduring mental disorder associated with significant disease burden and treatment difficulties. This is apparent within forensic populations. There is growing evidence to suggest that treatment with oxytocin could have some benefit in treating a range of psychiatric disorders. There are no reviews studying the use of oxytocin for patients with ASPD. We aim to present the first literature review on the use of oxytocin in patients with ASPD.
   Method: We searched relevant databases for original research on effect of oxytocin upon persons with a diagnosis of ASPD or healthy participants with symptoms seen in ASPD. Studies were included if they included healthy participants that evaluated the effect of oxytocin on symptoms relevant to ASPD, including empathy, inhibitory control, compliance, conformity, aggression, violence, and moral responsibility.
   Results: Thirty-six studies were included. There were a range of study designs, including randomized controlled trials, double blinded, single blinded, and unblinded controlled trials. The sample sizes in studies ranged from 20 to 259 participants. Studies looked at participants with a diagnosis of ASPD and participants with symptoms relevant to ASPD, including empathy, inhibitory control, compliance, conformity, aggression, violence, and moral responsibility. Oxytocin was found to demonstrate diversified effects, inmost cases being associated with socially positive or non-criminogenic behaviors. However, some studies found opposite, and non-desirable, effects, e.g., an increase in violent inclinations to partners. The two studies looking at participants with ASPD had a number of limitations and had conflicting results on the impact that OT has on aggression in ASPD.
   Conclusions: This is the first systematic literature review exploring the potential use of oxytocin in managing ASPD and the symptoms of ASPD. It is apparent that there is a body of evidence addressing related symptoms in healthy individuals. There were diversified effects with oxytocin showing some benefits in promoting positive effects on symptoms of ASPD, but there were also studies showing non-desirable effects. It is difficult to draw any direct inferences from healthy control studies. Further high quality large sample studies are required to explore the effects of oxytocin in those with ASPD

AB  - Board games are played by moving game pieces in particular ways on special boards marked with patterns. To clarify the possible roles of board game use in psychosomatic medicine, the present review evaluated studies that investigated the effects of this activity on health education and treatment. A literature search conducted between January 2012 and August 2018 identified 83 relevant articles; 56 (67%) targeted education or training for health-related problems, six (7%) examined basic brain mechanisms, five (6%) evaluated preventative measures for dementia or contributions to healthy aging, and three (4%) assessed social communication or public health policies. The results of several randomized controlled trials indicated that the playing of traditional board games (e.g., chess, Go, and Shogi) helps to improve cognitive impairment and depression, and that the playing of newly developed board games is beneficial for behavioral modifications, such as the promotion of healthy eating, smoking cessation, and safe sex. Although the number of studies that have evaluated board game use in terms of mental health remains limited, many studies have provided interesting findings regarding brain function, cognitive effects, and the modification of health-related lifestyle factors.

AB  - Background: Recently discovered relationships between the gastrointestinal microbiome and the brain have implications for psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Bacterial transplantation from MDD patients to rodents produces depression-like behaviors. In humans, case-control studies have examined the gut microbiome in healthy and affected individuals. We systematically reviewed existing studies comparing gut microbial composition in MDD and healthy volunteers.
   Methods: A PubMed literature search combined the terms "depression," "depressive disorder," "stool," "fecal," "gut," and "microbiome" to identify human case-control studies that investigated relationships between MDD and microbiota quantified from stool. We evaluated the resulting studies, focusing on bacterial taxa that were different between MDD and healthy controls.
   Results: Six eligible studies were found in which 50 taxa exhibited differences (p < 0.05) between patients with MDD and controls. Patient characteristics and methodologies varied widely between studies. Five phyla-Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Protobacteria-were represented; however, divergent results occurred across studies for all phyla. The largest number of differentiating taxa were within phylum Firmicutes, in which nine families and 12 genera differentiated the diagnostic groups. The majority of these families and genera were found to be statistically different between the two groups in two identified studies. Family Lachnospiraceae differentiated the diagnostic groups in four studies (with an even split in directionality). Across all five phyla, nine genera were higher in MDD (Anaerostipes, Blautia, Clostridium, Klebsiella, Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, Parabacteroides, Parasutterella, Phascolarctobacterium, and Streptococcus), six were lower (Bifidobacterium, Dialister, Escherichia/Shigella, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus), and six were divergent (Alistipes, Bacteroides, Megamonas, Oscillibacter, Prevotella, and Roseburia). We highlight mechanisms and products of bacterial metabolism as they may relate to the etiology of depression.
   Conclusions: No consensus has emerged from existing human studies of depression and gut microbiome concerning which bacterial taxa are most relevant to depression.
   This may in part be due to differences in study design. Given that bacterial functions are conserved across taxonomic groups, we propose that studying microbial functioning may be more productive than a purely taxonomic approach to understanding the gut microbiome in depression.

AB  - Objectives: Understanding whether cannabidiol (CBD) is useful and safe for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is essential to empower psychiatrists and patients to take good clinical decisions. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review regarding the benefits and adverse events (AEs) of CBD in the treatment of schizophrenia, psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder and substance-use disorders. Methods: We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Scielo, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases. Evidence was classified according to the WFSBP task forces standards. Results: Bibliographic research yielded 692 records. After analysis, we included six case reports and seven trials, comprising 201 subjects. Most the studies published presented several drawbacks and did not reach statistical significance. We have not found evidence regarding major depressive and bipolar disorders. The level of evidence for cannabis withdrawal is B; cannabis addiction is C2; treatment of positive symptoms in schizophrenia and anxiety in social anxiety disorder is C1. Discrete or no AEs were reported. The most frequently reported AEs are sedation and dizziness. Conclusions: The evidence regarding efficacy and safety of CBD in psychiatry is still scarce. Further larger well-designed randomised controlled trials are required to assess the effects of CBD in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: This meta-analytic review is the first to synthesise findings from prospective research on the long-term course of borderline personality disorder in adult clinical populations.
   Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in Medline, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, PubMed and Scopus within the period 1990-2017. Inclusion criteria were: (1) adult BPD sample diagnosed by a validated, semi-structured interview; (2) at least two prospective assessments of outcomes; and (3) follow-up period similar to 5 years. Quality of evidence was rated with the Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR). Four outcomes were meta-analysed using mixed-effect methods: remission from BPD diagnosis, completed suicide, depressive symptoms, and functioning. Potential moderators regarding the natural course and the initial treatment received were studied.
   Results: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria, with 837 participants from nine countries being followed. Between 50% and 70% of the BPD patients achieved remission in the long-term. Significant reductions in depression and functional impairment were also found. Mean suicide rate ranged from 2% to 5%. Younger age was associated with higher likelihood for remission. Being female was correlated with lower functional improvement. Despite some positive trends, there were no significant associations between treatment moderators and the long-term outcome.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that the course of BPD is characterised by symptomatic amelioration and a slight functional improvement in the long-term. Age and gender modulate the long-term prognosis and should be considered to adapt treatment resources. Further research is required to draw robust conclusions on the long-term effects of psychotherapeutic interventions. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sociodemographic group-specific strategies for stress management may contribute to racial and gender disparities in health outcomes in the USA. We aimed to systematically review theoretical and empirical investigations of factors influencing variation in response to and management of identity-related stress among black and white Americans. OvidPsychInfo and PubMed databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Criteria were participant age of 18years, conducted in the US sampling black or white participants, and published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. The final sample included 167 articles. Theories suggesting social status inequities as the primary contributor to disparate strategies employed by black and white women and men to manage social identity-related stress were most frequently tested and supported. Studies disproportionally focused on how women and black persons cope as targets of prejudice and discrimination rather than on how management strategies of men or white persons are affected as perpetrators. Finally, there was theoretical support for an interactive effect of race and gender on stress management, but empirical evidence was lacking, particularly among black men, white women, and white men. The literature could be strengthened through the use of prospective cohorts and nationally representative samples, as well as study designs accounting for potential within-race and within-gender variation in the effects of social identity-related stressors on coping. With greater consistency in methodology, future empirical studies may yield additional information regarding group differences in stress management pertinent to clarifying mechanisms for the health consequences of exposure to social inequity among black and white women and men.

AB  - Cannabinoid signalling modulates several aspects of brain function, including the generation and survival of neurons during embryonic and adult periods. The present review intended to summarise evidence supporting a role for the endocannabinoid system on the control of neurogenesis and neurogenesis-dependent functions. Studies reporting participation of cannabinoids on the regulation of any step of neurogenesis and the effects of cannabinoid compounds on animal models possessing neurogenesis-dependent features were selected from Medline. Qualitative evaluation of the selected studies indicated that activation of cannabinoid receptors may change neurogenesis in embryonic or adult nervous systems alongside rescue of phenotypes in animal models of different psychiatric and neurological disorders. The text offers an overview on the effects of cannabinoids on central nervous system development and the possible links with psychiatric and neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, brain ischaemia/stroke and Alzheimer's disease. An understanding of the mechanisms by which cannabinoid signalling influences developmental and adult neurogenesis will help foster the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurological disorders.

AB  - Background Poor social cognition is prevalent in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Some authors argue that these effects are symptom-specific and that socio-cognitive difficulties (e.g. theory of mind) are strongly associated with thought disorder and symptoms of disorganisation. Aims The current review tests the strength of this association. Method We meta-analysed studies published between 1980 and 2016 that tested the association between social cognition and these symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Results Our search (PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Web of Science) identified 123 studies (N = 9107). Overall effect size as r = -0.313, indicating a moderate association between symptoms and social cognition. Subanalyses yielded a moderate association between symptoms and theory of mind (r = -0.349) and emotion recognition (r = -0.334), but smaller effect sizes for social perception (r = -0.188), emotion regulation (r = -0.169) and attributional biases (r = -0.143). Conclusions The association is interpreted within models of communication that highlight the importance of mentalisation and processing of partner-specific cues in conversational alignment and grounding.

AB  - Secondary school teachers are one of the occupational groups presenting the highest levels of sick leave due to stress in the workplace. This form of stress can cause burnout syndrome, which is characterised by emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and low levels of personal accomplishment. Secondary education teachers have received relatively little research attention in this respect. This study addresses the prevalence among secondary school teachers of burnout syndrome, in its three dimensions, and investigates possible differences in the prevalence determined by different measuring instruments. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of the scientific literature in this field. Using the Proquest and Eric electronic databases, 45 articles and 49 independent samples (N=14,410) were obtained. Results show that secondary school teachers are at high risk of burnout syndrome. Moreover, there are statistically significant differences between the different measuring instruments used. Pedagogical programmes should be developed to reduce/prevent its impact.

AB  - Question This review compares mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in its ability to improve physical functioning and reduce pain intensity and distress in patients with chronic pain (CP), when evaluated against control conditions.
   Study selection and analysis Ovid MEDLINE, EmbaseClassic+ Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify randomised controlled trials. The primary outcome measure was physical functioning. Secondary outcomes were pain intensity and depression symptoms. We used random and fixed effects (RE and FE) network meta-analyses (NMA) to compare MBSR, CBT and control interventions on the standardised mean difference scale.
   Findings Twenty-one studies were included: 13 CBT vs control (n=1095), 7 MBSR vs control (n=545) and 1 MBSR vs CBT vs control (n=341). Of the 21 articles, 12 were determined to be of fair or good quality. Findings from RE NMA for change in physical functioning, pain intensity and depression revealed clinically important advantages relative to control for MBSR and CBT, but no evidence of an important difference between MBSR and CBT was found.
   Conclusions This review suggests that MBSR offers another potentially helpful intervention for CP management. Additional research using consistent measures is required to guide decisions about providing CBT or MBSR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizoaffective disorder (SAD) is a chronic, potentially disabling psychotic disorder common in clinical settings. SAD often has been used as a diagnosis for individuals having an admixture of mood and psychotic symptoms whose diagnosis is uncertain. Its hallmark is the presence of symptoms of a major mood episode (either a depressive or manic episode) concurrent with symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech.
   METHODS: A literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted to identify articles on SAD. We also reviewed major textbooks and DSM-5 to identify pertinent information.
   RESULTS: This review begins with the history and classification of SAD. Debate continues to swirl around the concept, as some experts view SAD as an independent disorder, while others see SAD as either a form of schizophrenia or a mood disorder. The disorder is more common in women and its course follows the middle ground between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. SAD appears to have high heritability. Most patients appear to benefit from antipsychotics plus antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers, depending on whether the patient has the depressive or bipolar subtype. Electroconvulsive therapy can also be effective.
   CONCLUSIONS: SAD is a chronic psychotic disorder that continues to be controversial. There has been inadequate research regarding its epidemiology, course, etiologic factors, and treatment.

AB  - Aims. People with psychotic disorders face impairments in their global functioning and their quality of life (QoL). The relationship between the two outcomes has not been systematically investigated. Through a systematic review, we aim to explore the presence and extent of associations between global functioning and QoL and establish whether associations depend on the instruments employed.
   Methods. In May 2016, ten electronic databases were searched using a two-phase process to identify articles in which associations between global functioning and QoL were assessed. Basic descriptive data and correlation coefficients between global functioning and QoL instruments were extracted, with the strength of the correlation assessed according to the specifications of Cohen 1988. Results were reported with reference to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines and PRISMA standards. A narrative synthesis was performed due to heterogeneity in methodological approaches.
   Results. Of an initial 15 183 non-duplicate articles identified, 756 were deemed potentially relevant, with 40 studies encompassing 42 articles included. Fourteen instruments for measuring global functioning and 22 instruments for measuring QoL were used. Twenty-nine articles reported linear associations while 19 assessed QoL predictors. Correlations between overall scores varied in strength, primarily dependent on the QoL instrument employed, and whether QoL was objectively or subjectively assessed. Correlations observed for objective QoL measures were consistently larger than those observed for subjective measures, as were correlations for an interviewer than self-assessed QoL. When correlations were assessed by domains of QoL, the highest correlations were found for social domains of QoL, for which most correlations were moderate or higher. Global functioning consistently predicted overall QoL as did depressive and negative symptoms.
   Conclusions. This review is the first to explore the extent of associations between global functioning and QoL in people with psychotic disorders. We consistently found a positive association between global functioning and QoL. The strength of the association was dependent on the QoL instrument employed. QoL domains strongly associated with global functioning were highlighted. The review illustrates the extensive array of instruments used for the assessment of QoL and to a lesser extent global functioning in people with psychotic disorders and provides a framework to understand the different findings reported in the literature. The findings can also inform the future choice of instruments by researchers and/or clinicians. The observed associations reassure that interventions for improving global functioning will have a positive impact on the QoL of people living with a psychotic disorder.

AB  - Background: We aimed to review published studies to obtain the best estimate of the risk of depression and anxiety among colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Methods: We searched the PubMed/Medline database, Web of Science, and Google Scholar on the prevalence of depression or anxiety in CRC patients. A review of 15 studies published between June 1967 and June 2018 were conducted, and 93,805 CRC patients were included. Results: The prevalence of depression among patients diagnosed with CRC ranged from 1.6%-57%, and those of anxiety ranged from 1.0%-47.2%. Studies in which an expert (psychiatrist) administered the interviews reported lower prevalence of both depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The findings of this review suggest that patients with CRC exhibited a significantly high prevalence of both depression and anxiety, and these symptoms can persist even after cancer treatment is completed. However, the correlation of age and the emergence of depression or anxiety in CRC patients still remain controversial.

AB  - We summarized and compared meta-analyses of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions targeting physical health outcomes among people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Major databases were searched until June 1, 2018. Of 3,709 search engine hits, 27 meta-analyses were included, representing 128 meta-analyzed trials and 47,231 study participants. While meta-analyses were generally of adequate or high quality, meta-analyzed studies were less so. The most effective weight reduction interventions were individual lifestyle counseling (standardized mean difference, SMD=-0.98) and exercise interventions (SMD=-0.96), followed by psychoeducation (SMD=-0.77), aripiprazole augmentation (SMD=-0.73), topiramate (SMD=-0.72), d-fenfluramine (SMD=-0.54) and metformin (SMD=-0.53). Regarding waist circumference reduction, aripiprazole augmentation (SMD=-1.10) and topiramate (SMD=-0.69) demonstrated the best evidence, followed by dietary interventions (SMD=-0.39). Dietary interventions were the only to significantly improve (diastolic) blood pressure (SMD=-0.39). Switching from olanzapine to quetiapine or aripiprazole (SMD=-0.71) and metformin (SMD=-0.65) demonstrated best efficacy for reducing glucose levels, followed by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (SMD=-0.39), dietary interventions (SMD=-0.37) and aripiprazole augmentation (SMD=-0.34), whereas insulin resistance improved the most with metformin (SMD=-0.75) and rosiglitazone (SMD=-0.44). Topiramate had the greatest efficacy for triglycerides (SMD=-0.68) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (SMD=-0.80), whereas metformin had the greatest beneficial effects on total cholesterol (SMD=-0.51) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (SMD=0.45). Lifestyle interventions yielded small effects for triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (SMD=-0.35 to -0.37). Only exercise interventions increased exercise capacity (SMD=1.81). Despite frequent physical comorbidities and premature mortality mainly due to these increased physical health risks, the current evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in people with schizophrenia to prevent and treat these conditions is still limited and more larger trials are urgently needed.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Many studies have investigated impairments in cognitive domains in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, to date, a comprehensive overview on the patterns of cognitive functioning is lacking.
   OBJECTIVE To provide an overview of nonsocial and social cognitive functioning in various domains in adults with ASD, allowing for comparison of the severity of deficits between different domains.
   DATA SOURCES A literature search performed in an academic medical setting was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Medline databases with the combination of the following free-text and Medical Subject Headings where applicable: [cogniti* OR neurocogniti* OR neuropsycholog* OR executive function* OR IQ OR intelligence quotient OR social cognition OR emotion perception OR affect perception OR emotion recognition OR attribution OR ToM OR mentalising OR mentalizing OR prosody OR social knowledge OR mind reading OR social cue OR social judgment] AND [autis* OR ASD OR Asperger OR Asperger's OR PDD OR pervasive developmental disorder]. The search was further limited to studies published between 1980 (first inclusion of autism diagnosis in the DSM-III) and July 2018.
   STUDY SELECTION Studies included were published as a primary peer-reviewed research article in English, included individuals with ASD 16 years or older, and assessed at least 1 domain of neurocognitive functioning or social cognition using standard measures.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Of 9892 articles identified and screened, 75 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hedges g effect sizes were computed, and random-effects models were used for all analyses. Moderators of between-study variability in effect sizes were assessed using meta-regressions.
   RESULTS The systematic review and meta-analysis included 75 studies, with a combined sample of 3361 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 32.0 [9.3] years; 75.9% male) and 5344 neurotypical adults (mean [SD] age, 32.3 [9.1] years; 70.1% male). Adults with ASD showed large impairments in theory of mind (g = -1.09; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.92; number of studies = 39) and emotion perception and processing (g = -0.80; 95% CI, -1.04 to -0.55; n = 18), followed by medium impairments in processing speed (g = -0.61; 95% CI, -0.83 to -0.38; n = 21) and verbal learning and memory (g = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.86 to -0.25; n = 12). The least altered cognitive domains were attention and vigilance (g = -0.30; 95% CI, -0.81 to 0.21; n = 5) and working memory (g = -0.23; 95% CI, -0.47 to 0.01; n = 19). Meta-regressions confirmed robustness of the results.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that adults with ASD show impairments in social cognitive domains and in specific nonsocial cognitive domains. These findings contribute to the understanding of the patterns of cognitive functioning in adults with ASD and may assist in the identification of targets for cognitive interventions.

KW  - THERAPY
AB  - Background: Depression is a common mental disorder worldwide. Psychological treatments and antidepressant medication are the usual treatments for depression. However, a large proportion of patients with depression do not respond to the treatments. In 2005, Vagus nerve stimulation was approved for the adjunctive long-term treatment of chronic or recurrent depression in adult patients experiencing a major depressive episode who had failed to respond to four or more adequate antidepressant treatments. However, the efficacy of VNS for treating depression remains unclear. Accordingly, we performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VNS.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Systematic search was performed in the database of Pubmed, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of science for identifying the suitable trials. Suicidal rate was considered as the primary outcome in this review.
   Result: Only two randomized sham controlled add-on studies including 255 cases (134 with VNS treatment and 121 control cases) were included in this review. None of the studies reported suicidal rate. We performed a qualitative analysis and it is suggested that there was no significant statistic difference between VNS and sham VNS on the score of 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD(24)) (MD: -2.40, 95% CI: -7.90 to 3.10). Similar findings were also reported on improvement percentage of HAMD24 (MD: 1.00, 95% CI: -6.06 to 8.06), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (MD: 4.70, 95% CI: -2.98 to 12.38) and 30 item Inventory of Depressive Symptomalogy-Self-Report (IDS-SR30) (MD: 4.9, 95% CI: -1.89 to 11.69). However, a marginal difference of Beck Depression Inventory self-rating score was detected between the real and sham treatment (MD: 7.80, 95% CI: 0.34 to 15.26). Aminor effect of IDS-SR30was also found in real VNS group (RR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.07 to 5.10).
   Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of VNS for depression is still unclear. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of VNS.

AB  - BackgroundSuicide bereavement is a risk factor for adverse outcomes related to grief, social functioning, mental health and suicidal behaviour. Consequently, suicide bereavement support (i.e., postvention) has been identified as an important suicide prevention strategy. However, little is known about its effectiveness. To redress this gap, this review aimed to assess the evidence of effectiveness of interventions for people bereaved by suicide, and appraise the quality of the research in this field.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. Searches of peer-reviewed literature in Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and EBM Reviews identified 12 papers reporting on 11 relevant studies conducted between 1984 and 2018.ResultsAcross studies, there was a wide variety of intervention modalities, study populations, control groups, and grief, psychosocial and suicide-related outcome measures. Overall, the quality of studies was weak. While there was some evidence of the effectiveness of interventions for uncomplicated grief, evidence of the effectiveness of complicated grief interventions was lacking. Based on this scant evidence, interventions which seem to show promise include supportive, therapeutic and educational approaches, involve the social environment of the bereaved, and comprise a series of sessions led by trained facilitators.ConclusionsThere is a clear need for additional methodologically sound studies in this area. Specifically, selection procedures, sample sizes, randomization, and the use of appropriate measures are crucial. As people bereaved by suicide are at-risk of adverse grief, mental ill-health and suicidal behaviour, further research across the life-span is essential to prevent grief and mental health ramifications.

AB  - Background: A growing body of evidence has demonstrated significant social and emotional benefits of music-making amongst senior citizens. However, several as-yet unresolved age-related barriers to "musicking" have been identified. Positioned within the emergent field of gerontechnology, concerned with the interface between aging and technology research, this review of literature thus explores the potential for music technologies to function as a vehicle for creative musical opportunities in later-life.
   Methods: ERIC, PsychInfo, and Web of Science databases were searched, focusing on the intersection between music, technology, and aging. The criteria for inclusion were that the paper should: (1) be in English; (2) report empirical research involving the use of music technologies intended to support receptive (listening, interpreting, reflecting) or active (playing, creating, performing) engagement with music amongst older persons, defined as being aged 60 years or above (United Nations, 2017); (3) be published as a peer reviewed journal article.
   Results: Of 144 papers screened, 18 papers were retained. 10 studies focused on using technology to support musicking in the form of listening, reflecting, and interpreting. Just five studies explored the utility of technology in promoting singing or playing instruments, while a further three were focused on music and movement.
   Conclusions: Overall, the literature reviewed suggests that older people, even those with complex needs, are capable of, and interested in using music technologies to access and create personally meaningful music. The limited research that does exist points to multiple and significant benefits that may be derived from receptive or active musicking supported by a range of music technologies.

AB  - In the early nineties of the twentieth century Jaak Panksepp coined the term "Affective Neuroscience" (AN) today being accepted as a unique research area in cross-species brain science. By means of (i) electrical stimulation, (ii) pharmacological challenges, and (iii) brain lesions of vertebrate brains (mostly mammalian), Panksepp carved out seven primary emotional systems called SEEKING, CARE, PLAY, and LUST on the positive side, whereas FEAR, SADNESS, and ANGER belong to the negative affects. Abundant research into human clinical applications has supported the hypothesis that imbalances in these ancient primary emotional systems are strongly linked to psychiatric disorders such as depression. The present paper gives a concise overview of Panksepp's main ideas. It gives an historical overview of the development of Panksepp's AN thinking. It touches not only areas of neuroscience, but also shows how AN has been applied to other research fields such as personality psychology. Finally, the present work gives a brief overview of the main ideas of AN.

AB  - Maternal nutrition is critically important for fetal development. Recent human studies demonstrate a strong connection between diet during pregnancy and offspring risk for neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Animal models have emerged as a crucial tool for understanding maternal nutrition's contribution to prenatal programming and the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review highlights preclinical studies examining how maternal consumption of the three macronutrients (protein, fats, and carbohydrates) influence offspring negative-valence behaviors relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. We highlight the translational aspects of animal models and so examine exposure periods that mirror the neurodevelopmental stages of human gestation. Because of our emphasis on programmed changes in neurobehavioral development, studies that continue diet exposure until assessment in adulthood are not discussed. The presented research provides a strong foundation of preclinical evidence of nutritional programming of neurobehavioral impairments. Alterations in risk assessment and response were observed alongside neurodevelopmental impairments related to neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. To date, the large majority of studies utilized rodent models, and the field could benefit from additional study of large-animal models. Additional future directions are discussed, including the need for further studies examining how sex as a biological variable affects the contribution of maternal nutrition to prenatal programming.

AB  - Background: The alleged procognitive effects of nicotine and its metabolites in brain are controversial.
   Objective: Here, we review the pharmacologically active metabolites of nicotine in brain and their effects on neuronal mechanisms involving two main cognitive domains, i.e., learning and memory.
   Methods: We searched Embase, Medline via PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for entries no later than May 2018, and restricted the search to articles about nicotine metabolites and cognitive behavior or cognitive mechanisms.
   Results: The initial search yielded 425 articles, of which 17 were eligible for inclusion after application of exclusion criteria. Of these, 13 were experimental, two were clinical, and two were conference papers.
   Conclusions: The results revealed three pharmacologically active biotransformations of nicotine in the brain, including cotinine, norcotinine, and nornicotine, among which cotinine and nornicotine both had a procognitive impact without adverse effects. The observed effect was significant only for cotinine.

AB  - Biological monitoring programmes have gained popularity around the world particularly in southern Africa as they are fast, integrative and cost-effective approaches for assessing the effects of environmental stressors on aquatic ecosystems. This article reviews current efforts that have been made to use bioindicators (i.e. macroinvertebrates, diatoms and fish) in monitoring water resources and to summarise the challenges in employing these biological monitoring tools in southern Africa. In South Africa, macroinvertebrate (South African Scoring System (SASS)) and diatom based indices (e.g. South African diatom index (SADI)) have demonstrated their utility in identifying sources of impairment and determining the extent of impacts thus giving natural resource managers a scientifically defensible rationale for developing guidelines for conservation and management. Despite this advancement in South Africa, however, developing regionally appropriate quantitative tools for diagnosing ecosystem health is a pressing need for several other southern African countries. Together with sound scientific research, it is imperative for southern African countries to develop specific legislation and have mandated agencies, with proper training and funding to implement biomonitoring and bioassessments. We recommend for the advancement and adoption of biological criteria as an integrated approach to assessing the impact of human activities in riverine ecosystems of the southern African region.

AB  - BackgroundMost of patients with dementia are cared for by family members. Caring for people with dementia is challenging; approximately 30-55% of caregivers suffered from anxiety or depressive symptoms. A range of studies have shown that psychosocial interventions are effective and can improve caregivers' quality of life, reduce their care burden, and ease their anxiety or depressive symptoms. However, information on the acceptability of these interventions, despite being crucial, is under-reported.MethodsSystematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on EMBASE, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycARTICLES until August 2017 and the searches were updated on June 2018. The selection criteria included primary studies with data about the acceptability of psychosocial interventions for informal caregivers and publications written in English. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted study characteristics and data, assessed the methodological quality of the included studies by using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Research Checklist, and conducted a narrative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data.ResultsA total of 10,610 abstracts were identified through systematic searches. Based on screening titles and abstracts, 207 papers were identified that met the criteria for full paper review, with 42 papers from 13 different countries meeting the inclusion criteria. We found high- and moderate-quality evidence showing psychosocial interventions were acceptable, with important benefits for caregivers. Facilitators of acceptability included caregivers' need for intervention, appropriate content and organization of the intervention, and knowledge and professionalism of the staff. Barriers to acceptability included participants' poor health status and low education levels, caregiving burden, change of intervention implementers, and poor system performance of interventions.ConclusionThere is preliminary evidence to support the acceptability of psychosocial interventions for dementia caregivers. However, the available supporting evidence is limited, and there is currently no adequate information from these studies indicating that the acceptability has received enough attention from researchers. More well-designed studies assessing psychosocial interventions are needed to give specific statements about acceptability, and the measure of acceptability with psychosocial interventions should be more comprehensive.

AB  - BackgroundViolence against intimate partners is a worldwide public health problem. Cognitive behavioural therapy delivered in a group format is widely used for the treatment of men's violent behaviour towards their female partners. A Cochrane review about the effectiveness of this therapy from 2011 revealed a lack of controlled studies. Our aim is to update the current evidence on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural group therapy on men's violent behaviour towards their female partner.MethodsThe Cochrane Library, the Campbell Collaboration Social, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Embase, Open Grey, Grey Literature Report, and Sociological Abstracts were searched for studies investigating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural group therapy on intimate partner violence published in the period of January 1, 2010, to February 12, 2018. Manual searches were also performed to identify randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. Data extraction was done in duplicate. The primary outcome was the reduction in violent behaviour, and secondary outcomes were physical health, mental health, quality of life, emotion regulation, and substance use. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool and the Risk of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool. A narrative summary was used to describe the review findings.ResultsWe identified six new studies that met the inclusion criteria: four randomized controlled trials and two non-randomized trials. Three of the randomized controlled trials found a reduction in intimate partner violence after treatment. The fourth randomized trial found that a subsample of responding partners reported a reduction in violence but no changes in the men's self-reported violence after treatment. No effect could be detected in the two non-randomized studies. Analysis of risk of bias revealed mixed results, indicating both strengths and weaknesses.LimitationsOnly a limited amount of studies which scored as low quality were available.ConclusionsThere is still insufficient evidence to confirm that cognitive behavioural group therapy for perpetrators of intimate partner violence has a positive effect. Future research should focus on randomized controlled studies distinguishing between convicted and non-convicted populations where violent behaviour is the primary outcome.Trial registrationCRD42016041493.

AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have improved psychological outcomes for multiple chronic health conditions, including diabetes. A meta-analytic review of the literature was conducted on all located studies (n = 14) investigating MBIs that targeted diabetes-related distress (DRD) and diabetes-related outcomes among people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. PsychInfo, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science were searched for MBIs that were designed to improve DRD and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life and measures of metabolic control. A meta-analysis of these outcomes uncovered small-to-moderate effect sizes for intervention studies measuring pretreatment to posttreatment changes in DRD and metabolic control among treatment group participants. However, the pretreatment to follow-up comparisons for DRD and metabolic control were small and unreliable. For control groups, all pre-treatment to post-treatment and pre-treatment to follow-up comparisons were unreliable for all outcomes. A moderate effect size for treatment-control comparisons was found for intervention studies measuring quality of life outcomes at posttreatment, but not at follow-up comparisons. All other effect sizes for treatment-control comparisons were unreliable. Limitations and implications for MBIs among individuals with diabetes are discussed.

AB  - Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second common progressive neurodegenerative disease, distressing older men and is prevalent Worldwide. Objectives: This article is aimed to review the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, diagnosis and management of PD. Methods: A google search was performed to recognise studies that review the characteristics of PD. Search terms included 'Parkinson's disease', 'epidemiology', 'etiology', 'pathogenesis', 'clinical manifestations', 'diagnosis' and 'management of Parkinson disease'. Results: PD is linked to factors such as environmental chemicals, aging, family history and pesticide exposure such as the use of synthetic heroin. PD is characterised clinically by tremors at rest, postural instability, expressionless countenance, lead pipe rigidity and less commonly cognitive impairment. After 60 years of age, PD is commonly prevalent in 1-% of the population, no racial differences are apparent, but the prevalence of PD is more common in men than women. There has also been a better understanding that the disorder may be linked with major non-motor trouble in addition to the additional generally recognised motor complications. There are various management options for the timely management of PD. As the ailment advances, further management strategies are existing; however, the management of non-motor manifestations and late stage motor complications remains mainly testing and will advantage from additional clinical studies. Conclusions: In this article, we have discussed current progress in the understanding of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis and management strategies of the disease.

KW  - OLDER-ADULTS
AB  - Background: In the past century, elder abuse has become an important health issue and a stressful event that negatively affects the physical and mental health of the elders.
   Aims: Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of elder abuse in Iran through systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: All articles about elderly abuse in Iran since 2005-2017 were searched using the Google Scholar search engine, four Iranian databases (Magiran, IranMedex, SID) and six international English language databases(Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Pubmed, Science Direct-Embase) with keywords of Elder Abuse, Elder Mistreatment, Elder Neglect, Abuse and a combination of these keywords. After examining the entry and exit criteria and qualitative evaluation of the articles, Data was analyzed by comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software.
   Findings: In a systematic review, 15 articles on elders in Iran were included in the study. The overall prevalence of elder abuse was 48.3% (with 95% confidence interval: 28.6-68.6) and the highest prevalence of elder abuse was related to the care neglect dimensionat the prevalence rate of 38.4% (with 95% confidence interval: 21.7-51.6) and the lowest prevalence rate of elder abuse was related to the rejection atthe prevalence rate of 11% (with 95% confidence interval: 6.9-17.1).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of elder abuse among elders was high in Iran. Considering the growing elderly population in Iran, preventive measures should be considered in this regard. For this reason, community health nurses are required to provide the elderly, family and community with necessary preventive interventions in this regard.

AB  - Objectives Psychological and educational interventions for the prevention of depression have a small-to-moderate effect. However, little is known about their effectiveness in the workplace. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT).
   Methods We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBA SE, CENTRAL CIS-DOC and Open Grey for RCT. Search was supplemented with manual searches of reference lists of relevant meta-analyses and trials. We included RCT that assessed either the incidence of depression or the reduction of depressive symptoms, which excluded participants with baseline depression. Measurements were required to have been made using validated instruments and participants recruited in the workplace. Independent evaluators selected studies, evaluated risk bias (Cochrane Collaboration's tool) and extracted from RCT. The combined OR was estimated using the fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity was measured by I-2 and Cochrane's Q.
   Results Of the 1963 abstracts reviewed, 69 were selected for review in fulltext. Only three RCT met our inclusion criteria, representing 1246 workers from three different countries and continents. The combined odds ratio was 0.25 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11-0.60, P=0.002];I-2 =0% and Q=0.389 (P=0.823). The risk of bias was low in one RCT and moderate and high in the other two, respectively.
   Conclusion Psychological or educational interventions in the workplace may prevent depression, although the quality of evidence was low.

AB  - Background Internet-delivered psychological treatments have been suggested as a chance to expand the access to professional help. However, little is known about the usefulness of different support formats and approaches of digital treatments for panic disorder among clinicians.
   Objective This narrative review aimed to explore the recent evidence base on the efficacy and acceptability of different internet-delivered treatments for adults with panic disorder.
   Methods A systematic search in electronic databases (Pubmed/Medline, PSYNDEX) and a hand search were performed to identify articles on randomized controlled trials published within the past five years (2012/12/10-2017/12/12) in English peer-reviewed journals.
   Results Eight studies (1,013 participants) involving 10 interventions met the inclusion criteria. Nine interventions were primarly based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy principles. Most interventions were effective, when compared to a control condition (6 of 8 comparisons). Minimal guidance was associated with improved outcomes in one study and adherence in two studies (3 comparisons). Furthermore, no differences were found based on treatment approach (2 comparisons). Regarding acceptability, the attrition rates were moderate to high, ranging from 9.8% to 42.1% of randomized participants. Adherence rates also varied largely (7.8-75%), whereas participant satisfaction of program completers was assessed overall high (5 studies).
   Conclusion Diverse effective internet-delivered treatments are available for the self-management of panic symptoms. Especially self-guided and transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches appear being efficient options for the dissemination in routine care. However, due to the limited evidence base, further efforts are required to improve the actual uptake of internet-delivered treatments and identify moderators of outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To synthesize data about the prevalence of sexual violence (SV) among refugees around the world.
   METHODS: A systematic review was conducted from the search in seven bibliographic databases. Studies on the prevalence of SV among refugees and asylum seekers of any country, sex or age, whether in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, were eligible.
   RESULTS: Of the 2,906 titles found, 60 articles were selected. The reported prevalence of SV was largely variable (0% to 99.8%). Reports of SV were collected in all continents, with 42% of the articles mentioning it in refugees from Africa (prevalence from 1.3% to 100%). The rape was the most reported SV in 65% of the studies (prevalence from 0% to 90.9%). The main victims were women in 89% of the studies, all the way, especially when still in the countries of origin. The SV was perpetrated particularly by intimate partners, but also by agents of supposed protection. Few studies have reported SV in men and children; the prevalence reached up to 39.3% and 90.9%, respectively. Approximately one-third of the studies (32%) were carried out in refugee camps and more than half (52%) in health services using mental health assessment tools. No study has addressed the most recent migratory crisis. Meta-analysis was not performed due to the methodological heterogeneity of the studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: SV is a prevalent problem affecting refugees of both sexes, of all ages, throughout the migratory journey, particularly those from Africa. Protection measures are urgently needed, and further studies, with more appropriate tools, may better measure the current magnitude of the problem.

AB  - Objective: APOE status has been associated to affective symptoms in cognitively impaired subjects, with conflicting results.
   Methods: Databases CINAHL, Embase, PsychINFO and PubMed were searched for studies evaluating APOE genotype with affective symptoms in MCI and AD dementia. Symptoms were meta-analyzed separately and possible sources of heterogeneity were examined.
   Results: Fifty-three abstracts fulfilled the eligibility criteria. No association was found between the individual symptoms and APOE epsilon 4 carriership or zygosity. For depression and anxiety, only pooled unadjusted estimates showed positive associations with between-study heterogeneity, which could be explained by variation in study design, setting and way of symptom assessment.
   Conclusions: There is no evidence that APOE epsilon 4 carriership or zygosity is associated with the presence of depression, anxiety, apathy, agitation, irritability or sleep disturbances in cognitively impaired subjects. Future research should shift its focus from this single polymorphism to a more integrated view of other biological factors.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic pain (CP) is highly prevalent and generally undertreated health condition. Noninvasive brain stimulation may contribute to decrease pain intensity and influence other aspects related to CP. Objective: To provide consensus-based recommendations for the use of noninvasive brain stimulation in clinical practice. Methods: Systematic review of the literature searching for randomized clinical trials followed by consensus panel. Recommendations also involved a cost-estimation study. Results: The systematic review wielded 24 transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and 22 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies. The following recommendations were provided: (1) Level A for anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) in fibromyalgia, and level B for peripheral neuropathic pain, abdominal pain, and migraine; bifrontal (F3/F4) tDCS and M1 high-definition (HD)-tDCS for fibromyalgia; Oz/Cz tDCS for migraine and for secondary benefits such as improvement in quality of life, decrease in anxiety, and increase in pressure pain threshold; (2) level A recommendation for high-frequency (HF) rTMS over M1 for fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, and level B for myofascial or musculoskeletal pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and migraine; (3) level A recommendation against the use of anodal M1 tDCS for low back pain; and (4) level B recommendation against the use of HF rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the control of pain. Conclusion: Transcranial DCS and rTMS are recommended techniques to be used in the control of CP conditions, with low to moderate analgesic effects, and no severe adverse events. These recommendations are based on a systematic review of the literature and a consensus made by experts in the field. Readers should use it as part of the resources available to decision-making.

AB  - Sepsis is systemic inflammatory response syndrome with a life-threatening organ dysfunction that is caused by an unbalanced host immune response in an attempt to eliminate invasive microorganisms. We posed questions, Does sepsis survivor patients have increased risk of neuropsychiatric manifestations? and What is the mechanism by which sepsis induces long-term neurological sequelae, particularly substantial cognitive function decline in survivor patients and in pre-clinical sepsis models? The studies were identified by searching PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), PsycINFO, EMBASE (Ovid), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), IBECS (Bibliographical Index in Spanish in Health Sciences), and Web of Science databases for peer-reviewed journals that were published until January 2018. A total of 3555 papers were included in the primary screening. After that, 130 articles were selected for the study. A number of pre-clinical studies have shown an auto amplification of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 in the first few hours after sepsis induction, also increased blood-brain barrier permeability, elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases, increased levels of damage-associated molecular patterns were demonstrated. In addition, the rodents presented long-term cognitive impairment in different behavioral tasks that were prevented by blocking the mechanism of action of these inflammatory mediators. Clinical studies have showed that sepsis survivors presented increased bodily symptoms such as fatigue, pain, visual disturbances, gastrointestinal problems, and neuropsychiatric problems compared to before sepsis. Sepsis leaves the survivors with an aftermath of physiological, neuropsychiatric, and functional impairment. Systematic review registration: CRD42017071755.

AB  - Purpose: We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the health consequences of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), with a particular focus on the psychosexual implications of this practice and the overall impact of reconstructive plastic surgery. Methods: A MEDLINE search through PubMed was performed to identify the best quality evidence published studies in English language on long-term health consequences of FGM/C. Results: Women with FGM/C are more likely to develop psychological disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, somatization, phobia, and low self-esteem, than those without FGM/C. Most studies showed impaired sexual function in women with FGM/C. In particular, women with FGM/C may be physiologically less capable of becoming sexually stimulated than uncut women. Reconstructive surgery could be beneficial, in terms of both enhanced sexual function and body image. However, prospective studies on the impact of reconstructive surgery are limited, and safety issues should be addressed. Conclusion: Although it is clear that FGM/C can cause devastating immediate and long-term health consequences for girls and women, high-quality data on these issues are limited. Psychosexual complications need to be further analyzed to provide evidence-based guidelines and to improve the health care of women and girls with FGM/C. The best treatment approach involves a multidisciplinary team to deal with the multifaceted FGM/C repercussions.

AB  - Background: Over the course of the 20th century, neurology and psychiatry diverged and became two separate disciplines. Subsequently, the continuous progress of neurosciences confused their boundaries. However, with 'the splitting' and 'the lumping' approaches, relevant difficulties remain in targeting clinical and therapeutic goals, when psychiatric signs and symptoms co-occur with neurological diseases.
   Objective: The study summarize current evidence on psychiatric signs and symptoms comorbid with neurological diseases, with the aim to provide information on diagnostic problems and available therapeutic options.
   Methods: Finding from searches of publications on 'PsycInfo', Medline', and 'Science Direct', from January 1993 to December 2018 (25 years) is summarized in a narrative manner on six main neurological areas: congenital neurological illnesses (n=16), dementias (n=15), basal ganglia diseases (n=30), epilepsy (n=22), strokes/focal brain injuries (n=29), and neurological neoplastic/paraneoplastic diseases (n=15).
   Results: Clinical phenotypes of psychiatric syndromes are frequently described in neurological studies. Little evidence is provided on the most adequate therapeutic approaches.
   Conclusion: Psychiatric syndromes in comorbidity with neurological diseases are heterogeneous and severe; evidence-based treatments are scarce. Despite a model supporting an equal approach between psychiatric and neurological syndromes, psychiatric syndromes in neurological diseases have been described, to a relevant degree, as less important, leading to a hierarchical primate of the neurological manifestations, and thus, in our opinion, limiting the systematic studies on psychopharmacological treatments in this area.

The easy to learn and safe format of health Qigong allows the promotion and employment by health care professionals to improve the physical and psychosocial wellness of older adults. The cultural relevance of Qigong practice enhances its popularity as a health maintenance practice in Chinese community. In general, the antidepressive effects of Qigong are put forward through psychosocial, physiological, and neurobiological mechanisms. More specific, the beneficial effects of Qigong can be further substantiated by findings of several research studies.

AB  - Objective: Much research has been published on the role of sexual revictimization in the emergence of mental disorders in adulthood, but findings have sometimes been contradictory. The present systematic review sought to assess the state of the evidence on revictimization as a potential factor for the emergence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Methods: Electronic searches were conducted in five databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Campbell Library, PsycINFO, and LILACS), using the terms PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder, child abuse, and rape.
   Results: We identified nine articles that established a connection among childhood sexual abuse (CSA), sexual revictimization in adulthood, and development of PTSD. Eight of the nine papers included were classified as having strong methodological quality (grade VI). One was classified as IV, with an average quality-of-evidence rating. The mean methodological quality score of the articles was 5.5, and the quality of evidence was deemed strong.
   Conclusion: In the included studies, PTSD symptoms were most prevalent in the CSA+adult sexual assault groups, providing further evidence for the revictimization hypothesis.

AB  - Background and Objective: Methods and justifications for discontinuing psychotropic drugs in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and RCTs' acknowledgement of possible withdrawal symptoms following discontinuation, have not been examined systematically, which this review aims to do. Study Eligibility, Data Extraction, and Synthesis: Publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO (2000-2017) randomly assigning participants diagnosed with mental disorders to discontinue antipsychotic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antimanic, mood-stabilizing, benzodiazepine, or stimulant drugs. Authors independently extracted data, devised a typology of trials, and assessed trials' recognition of withdrawal symptoms. Results: Eighty RCTs (70% with industry participation) discontinued drugs from 5,757 participants to investigate relapse prevention (44%), successful discontinuation (26%), architecture of withdrawal (14%), and practicality of discontinuation (10%). RCTs of stimulants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics mostly aimed to reach conclusions about relapse prevention by testing abrupt or rapid discontinuations; RCTs of benzodiazepines mostly aimed to reduce drug use by testing longer-lasting, supportive discontinuations. In 67% of RCTs, no justification was given for the specific discontinuation strategy, which lasted under 2 weeks in 60% of RCTs. Possible withdrawal confounding of trial outcomes was addressed in 14% of eligible RCTs. Limitations: Only the published literature was searched. Conclusions and Implications: RCTs use drug discontinuation to study several key issues in psychopharmacology but infrequently justify how they implement it or acknowledge that possible withdrawal symptoms may threaten internal validity. Reappraising the use of drug discontinuation and the recognition of withdrawal symptoms in RCTs is required. (C) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Social and environmental factors are known risk factors and modulators of mental health disorders. We here conducted a nonsystematic review of the neuroimaging literature studying the effects of poverty, urbanicity, and community violence, highlighting the opportunities of studying non-Western developing societies such as those in Latin America. Social and environmental factors in these communities are widespread and have a large magnitude, as well as an unequal distribution, providing a good opportunity for their characterization. Studying the effect of poverty in these settings could help to explore the brain effect of economic improvements, disentangle the effect of absolute and relative poverty, and characterize the modulating impact of poverty on the underlying biology of mental health disorders. Exploring urbanicity effects in highly unequal cities could help identify the specific factors that modulate this effect as well as examine a possible dose-response effect by studying megacities. Studying brain changes in those living among violence, which is particularly high in places such as Latin America, could help to characterize the interplay between brain predisposition and exposure to violence. Furthermore, exploring the brain in an adverse environment should shed light on the mechanisms underlying resilience. We finally provide examples of two methodological approaches that could contribute to this field, namely a big cohort study in the developing world and a consortium-based meta-analytic approach, and argue about the potential translational value of this research on the development of effective social policies and successful personalized medicine in disadvantaged societies.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative motor disease. People with Parkinson's have different motor symptoms related to movement, the most common of which are tremor, muscle rigidity and slowness of movement. In addition, there are other problems that are unrelated to motor symptoms, such as sleep behavior disorders, personality changes, pain and depression. Numerous apps designed for people with this disease have been developed in recent years. Due to the diversity of symptoms, there are very many different apps.
   Our goal is to carry out a systematic review of available apps related to PD for the operating systems iOS and Android and to assess their features. In addition, we are interested in the usability of the apps. A search for the representative terms "Parkinson" and "Parkinson's Disease", together with the descriptors of the symptoms, was conducted in the Google Play and Apple App stores. Next, we screened the PD-related apps. Finally, we assessed the apps with respect to symptoms, users, purpose and features. In addition, a usability evaluation was carried out.

It is well known and characterized by motor symptoms that are secondary to the loss of dopamine innervation, but it is also accompanied by a range of various non-motor symptoms, including pain and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. These non-motor symptoms usually appear at early stages of the disease, sometimes even before the first motor symptoms, and have a dramatic impact on the quality of life of the patients. We review here the present state-of-the-art concerning pain, anxiety and depression-like parameters in animal models of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Background: Burnout is usually defined as a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors, characterrized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and lack of social accomplishment. Coping mechanisms and job satisfaction are associated with the incidence of burnout symptoms in a work context.
   Subjects and methods: The aim of this paper was to make a systematic analysis of the literature related to nurses' stress and the incidence of burnout syndrome in intensive care nurses, and also to determine the research into associations between coping mechanisms and job satisfaction on one side, and burnout on the other side. Appropriate databases (Scopus, PubMed) were searched with the aim of finding relevant studies and articles published in the last 15 years. The keywords were burnout, coping mechanisms, job satisfaction, nurses, and intensive care. Two independent reviewers carried out a selection of the studies.
   Results: The literature review found 786 studies about burnout and its association with different variables. Twenty-nine original research papers were discovered in this review process. Open questions still remain concerning burnout and the associations between the considered variables. We also found that studies using a qualitative approach, which could provide better insight into the investigation of burnout, was insufficient in this area.
   Conclusion: Burnout syndrome is serious problem for healthcare systems and affects almost all profiles of healthcare workers. Although burnout is an evidence-based public health problem, there is still no systematic approach to prevention. Prevention activities to reduce stress and the incidence of burnout should be provided for nurses, especially those in very demanding posts.

After full-text review, articles were included based on pre-determined criteria. The authors identified 32 relevant articles. Occupational exposure to wildland fires affects lung function in the short term and may increase the risk of hypertension in the long term. Exposure to wildland fires is also associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. There was insufficient evidence to comment on most longer-term risks, and in particular on respiratory disease or cancer risks. Further research is required to understand whether occupational exposure to wildland fires results in clinically significant impacts on respiratory function, and to further clarify the relationship between occupational exposure and blood pressure, mental health, and cancer outcomes.

AB  - The aim of this chapter is to review recent literature describing how developments in cognition may contribute to age-related changes in emotional processes, specifically emotion regulation and emotion perception. In general, older adults are more likely than young adults to report feeling positive. Prominent conceptual models of cognitive and emotional development in aging attempt to explain why the affective lives of older adults might not undergo similar age-related declines as other cognitive and physical systems. In this chapter, we will discuss predictions of cognitive and emotional development from several leading conceptual models of aging. We will then examine how closely the evidence from the fields of emotion regulation and emotion perception coincides with conceptual predictions. Finally, we will attempt to negotiate findings of age differences and age similarities in emotional processes as well as provide suggestions for future studies of emotion and cognition in aging.

AB  - Background Burnout is a pervasive health condition affecting many doctors at various stages in their careers. Characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment it can result in significant personal and professional consequences putting patient care at risk. Emotion regulation describes a capacity to self-modulate emotions to achieve desirable emotional outcomes. Emotional intelligence theory suggests that emotion regulation skills facilitate the maintenance of appropriate emotions, reducing or adapting undesirable emotions in oneself and others. Emotion regulation is usually automatic but can be controlled through learnt strategies. There is evidence that occupationally stressed individuals are less capable of down-regulating negative emotions. This paper systematically reviews studies of the role of emotion regulation in burnout in doctors.
   Aims To examine the relationship between emotion regulation and burnout among doctors.
   Method Four online databases (Psych Info 1833-2017, Medline 1928-2017, Scopus 1960-2017 and Embase 1974-2017) were searched in August 2017. Searches returned 15539 citations, which after de-duplication yielded 12295 citations. After title and abstracts screening 12273 citations were excluded. Twenty-two full text articles were read and eight excluded for ineligibility. Following data extraction, bias and methodological quality assessment, findings were synthesized using descriptive analysis and presented according to relevant themes.
   Results A correlative relationship was observed between emotion regulation and burnout in doctors. Findings also indicated thatusing self-regulatory or taught emotion regulation skills or interventions such as mindfulness were associated with a reduction in burnout.
   Conclusion Emotion regulation is an important psychological variable associated with burnout.

AB  - Background: There has been an increasing interest in the past several decades to study the relationship between spirituality and religion with physical and mental health as well as the various quality of life measures. This trend has led to the creation of an area of study called epidemiology of religion and spirituality. The policy shifts at various levels, in the mental health field, has occurred as well to educate healthcare providers, and address patients' spiritual /religious needs in clinical settings. Despite these advances in research and policy shift, there is still some resistance in the health care community to assess and address the spiritual needs of patients in clinical settings.
   Objective: The objective is to review the published articles on spirituality/religion and its relationship with mental and physical wellbeing and discuss limitations of such research. The review articles on assessment and interventions to address spiritual or religious needs in clinical settings were also included.
   Methods: Author conducted a literature search using books@Ovid, Joumals@Ovid Full Text, Your Journals@Ovid, Ovid MEDLINE (R) 1946 to January week 4 2019, Ovid Medline (R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process& Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily without Revisions 2015-January 28, 2019; Ovid MD and Psychiatry Online.
   Results: A total of 1,040 articles were identified using keywords spirituality, religion, mental health, physical health, psychological well-being, healthy beliefs, psychopathological beliefs and quality of life. The search result included original research papers, review articles and commentaries.
   Conclusion: The review articles were narrowed to 100 articles based on relevance to the objectives outlined above. Seventy-five articles were referenced at the end.

AB  - Background: S100B is a calcium-binding protein located in glial cells; it is regarded as a potential biomarker in affective disorders.Aim: To review the literature investigating the role of S100B in patients with affective disorders.Method: A systematic review of original English language studies investigating S100B in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and lymphocytes, in patients with affective disorders, was conducted. The literature search was conducted within the PubMed database. Effect sizes were calculated to adjust for systematic measurement effects.Results: Twenty studies were included, with a total of 1292 participants. Of these, 398 patients had or have had depressive disorder, 301 patients had bipolar disorder and 593 were healthy controls. S100B levels in serum were consistently elevated in studies with statistically significant results which investigated acute affective episodes (comprising major depressive episode in major depressive disorder, and both manic and depressive episodes in patients with bipolar disorder), in comparison to healthy controls. There were few studies assessing S100B levels in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma or lymphocytes, and these had inconsistent results.Conclusion: The results indicated that elevated S100B levels might be associated with mood episodes in affective disorders. However, the role of S100B, and its possible impact in affective disorders, requires further investigation and at the present S100B does not have a role as clinically biomarker in affective disorder. Future longitudinal multicentre studies with larger transdiagnostic real life patient cohorts are warranted.

AB  - The aim of is to explore whether by observing the fetus by 4D US it is possible to enter fetal behavior, emotions, mental status, consciousness, awareness and other states connected with fetal mind and ability of self-regulation.
   It is well known that fetal motoric activity is enabling the development of central and peripheral nervous system and the muscles. It is 4D US which enabled to investigate fetal movement patterns from the first trimester of pregnancy throughout the whole pregnancy. Based on the evaluation of fetal spontaneous motor activity by 4D US, a prenatal neurologic scoring test named Kurjak Antenatal Neurodevelopmental Test (KANET) was created. This test has been used to assess almost 2000 fetuses and our results have indicated that KANET has an ability to recognize normal, borderline, and abnormal behavior in fetuses from normal and abnormal pregnancies.
   The fetus is able to process tactile, vestibular, taste, olfactory, auditory and visual sensations. The fetus responds to painful stimuli with a wide spectrum of reactions. Important external signs of emotion are facial expressions. The existence of a wide range of facial expressions, including grimacing, smiling, crying, similar to emotional expressions in adults, has been revealed by 4D sonography in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.
   It is questionable if mental, emotional and behavioral conditions of the fetus were covered in this paper and whether we are able to perceive the fetus as the patient who may develop communication or some other psychiatric disorders which we will be hopefully able to recognize prenatally. Although it seems as the speculation from the point of view of our recent diagnostic possibilities, it is apparent that the day when this will be a reality is rapidly approaching.

AB  - Background: Apathy is defined as diminished motivation free from altered consciousness, cognitive impairment or emotional distress. It is a prevalent syndrome in different disorders, which share brain system alterations despite very different underlying pathologies. However, to date, little research has be en devoted to the subject.
   Aims: To review the concept of apathy and clarify its aetiology, structural and functional neural bases and treatment options.
   Methods: Literature search and review, with "apathy" as a term, using all main databases (Medline, Psychinfo, Cochrane) included in our organization's (RSMB; Osalcidetza/Basque Health Service) Ovid search engine, together with a manual search of relevant papers.
   Results: The literature reviewed shows that apathy is a multi-dimensional clinical construct with a current definition and validated diagnostic criteria. It is a prevalent condition across an array of different brain disorders, which share a common pathology, namely dysfunction of the fronto-striatal circuitry, specially affecting the 1) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), 2) ventral striatum (VS) and 3) nucleus accumbens (N. Acc.). Different theories have emerged regarding the role of the ACC in the genesis of apathy. The neuromodulator dopamine is heavily implicated in 1- ACC, 2- VS, 3- in particulat the N. Acc., and 4- the genesis of apathy, although other neurotransmitters could also be involved to a lesser degree. There is a patent lack of RCTs on the efficiency of current therapeutic options.
   Conclusion: Further research is needed to help understand the functional neuroanatomy, neuromodulators involved and possible treatment options of this clinical construct.

AB  - Delusional misidentification syndrome (DMS) is an umbrella term for syndromes of intermetamorphosis, Fregoli, and Capgras. DMS) is thought to be related to dissociation between recognition and identification processes. DMS was described for the first time in 1932 as a variant of the Capgras syndrome and is currently on the DSM-V list of diseases as an independent disease entity. Patients affected by DMS believed that people around them, most often family, have changed physically (appearance) and mentally (character). Other symptoms include confabulation, derealization or depersonalization. In patients, aggressive behavior is often observed, aimed at alleged doppelgangers resulting from the sense of being cheated and manipulated. With the intermetamorphosis syndrome, for example, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder or other misidentification syndromes (Fregoli's, Capgras) may coexist. There is also a reverse intermetamorphosis, where the object of the changed appearance or character becomes the patient himself. One of its forms may be lycanthropy. The etiology of the intermetamorphosis has not been fully understood, one of the reasons may be brain damage and changes in the parietal and/or temporal lobes of the right hemisphere. It may then damage long neuronal connections to the frontal areas of the brain, disturbances of working memory (WM) accountable for the keep and online management of data, so that it is available for further processing, and the patient's will be uncritical. The basic method of diagnosis of this delusion is a medical interview with the patient. Other diagnostic methods include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, EEG and ERPs. Experimental methods include searching for the neuromarker of DMS. Currently, there are no treatment guidelines of this delusional disorder, and pharmacotherapy experimental, but the drugs from the group of neuroleptics and lithium seem effective. Some hope for the treatment is created by neurotherapy, but it is also experimental.

AB  - To improve our understanding of the carbon cycling response to imminent sea-level rise and saltwater intrusions, we review the existing literature on the likely effects of the increasing salinity and inundation on organic carbon mineralization in tidal wetlands. Enhanced salinity and inundation will reduce the pool of the organic carbon substrate, but may expand that of microbes with strong capacities for carbon metabolism. Sulfate availability increases with the increasing salinity, while availability of other electron acceptors, e.g., oxygen, nitrate, ferric oxides, and carbon dioxide, could transiently increase but would ultimately fall with the increasing salinity and inundation. The changing electron acceptor pattern may result in microbial sulfate reduction predominating over other carbon mineralization pathways. Data derived from natural salinity and inundation gradients suggest clear negative effects of salinity and inundation on production rates or emission fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane. However, results for brackish wetlands are conflicting, probably due to their unique geographic location. Salinity and inundation exert their influence on organic carbon mineralization through sulfate enrichment, elevating ionic and osmotic stress and decreasing oxygen concentrations and redox conditions, among other biogeochemical changes. Future studies should address the combined effects of salinity and inundation on carbon biogeochemistry in low-level salinity tidal wetlands.

TI  - Biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, dementia Lewy body, frontotemporal dementia and vascular dementia
KW  - BRAIN
KW  - TAU
AB  - Background Dementia is a chronic brain disorder classified by four distinct diseases that impact cognition and mental degeneration. Each subgroup exhibits similar brain deficiencies and mutations. This review will focus on four dementia subgroups: Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and dementia Lewy body.
   Aim The aim of this systematic review is to create a concise overview of unique similarities within dementia used to locate and identify new biomarker methods in diagnosing dementia.
   Methods 123 300 articles published after 2010 were identified from PubMed, JSTOR, WorldCat Online Computer Library and PALNI (Private Academic Library Network of Indiana) using the following search items (in title or abstract): 'Neurodegenerative Diseases' OR 'Biomarkers' OR 'Alzheimer's Disease' OR 'Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia' OR 'Vascular Dementia' OR 'Dementia Lewy Body' OR 'Cerebral Spinal Fluid' OR 'Mental Cognitive Impairment'. 47 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis.
   Results Evidence suggested neuroimaging with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and newly found PET tracers to be more effective in diagnosing Alzheimer's and amnesiac mental cognitive impairment than carbon-11 Pittsburgh compound-B radioisotope tracer. Newly created methods to make PET scans more accurate and practical in clinical settings signify a major shift in diagnosing dementia and neurodegenerative diseases.
   Conclusion Vast improvements in neuroimaging techniques have led to newly discovered biomarkers and diagnostics. Neuroimaging with amyloid PET scanning surpasses what had been considered the dominant method of neuroimaging and MRI. Newly created methods to make PET scans more accurate and practical in clinical settings signify a major shift in diagnosing dementia pathology. Continued research and studies must be conducted to improve current findings and streamline methods to further subcategorise neurodegenerative disorders and diagnosis.

AB  - Background. Mental health issues, often manifested as behavioural difficulties, in children are estimated to be high in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) settings. There is a paucity of definitive data due to a lack of well-validated tools to use across settings. This review aims to provide evidence on what tools are used and which have been adapted and validated in LMIC settings. Methods. We performed a systematic review to identify tools used to assess or screen externalising behaviour problems in children and adolescents in LMIC and assess their cultural adaptations. We searched for studies measuring externalising behaviour in children from 0 to 19 years published up to September 2018. Articles were assessed to identify tools used and analysed using the Ecological Validity Framework. Results. We identified 82 articles from over 50 LMICs who had studied externalising behaviour in children. Twenty-seven tools were identified, with a predominance of studies using tools from the USA and Europe. Most studies did not describe an adaptation and evaluation process, with only one study following recommended criteria. New tools were identified which both screen and assess externalising behaviour which have not yet been utilised across settings. Conclusions. Although tools from the USA and Europe are often utilised to screen and assess for externalising behaviour problems in children in LMICs, the conceptual frameworks behind the use of these tools in other cultural contexts are not always carefully examined. In order to have valid data across cultures, we should aim to adapt and validate tools before use. Provision of processes to validate tools across LMIC settings would be beneficial.

AB  - Introduction: Music therapy is widely used for treatment and care in various diseases including disorders of consciousness, dementia, stroke, psychiatric disorders, Parkinson's disease, pain of several origins among others. It is known that listening to music influences mood and arousal, which can improve performance on a variety of cognitive tasks. Objective: To analyze the information available in the literature about scientific evidences of the use of music as a therapeutic resource. Method: This is an integrative review with search of articles published in national and international journals indexed in databases and journal banks: Pubmed, Cinahl, Web of Science and SciELO, between December/2017 and January/2018. We used the descriptors "music" and "disorders of consciousness" in Portuguese, English and Spanish. Results: We selected 14 heterogeneous studies with good methodological quality, among which we highlight interventional and observational studies with a degree of recommendation A. Conclusion: The study concludes to exist some evidence in the scientific literature about the effectiveness and efficacy of music therapy in the treatment and evaluation of people in coma, minimally conscious states and persistent vegetative state.

AB  - Objective: Review primary research regarding PTSD Post-Childbirth (PTSD-PC) that focussed on Quality of Provider Interaction (QPI) from the perspective of women who developed PTSD-PC, or midwives. Background: Up to 45% of women find childbirth traumatic. PTSD-PC develops in 4% of women (18% in high-risk groups). Women's subjective experiences of childbirth are the most important risk factor in the development of PTSD-PC, with perceived QPI being key. Methods: A systematic search was performed for PTSD-PC literature. Reviewed papers focussed on either women's subjective childbirth experiences, particularly QPI, or midwives' perspectives on QPI. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tools, and a narrative synthesis of findings produced. Results: Fourteen studies were included. Three features of QPI contribute towards developing PTSD-PC: interpersonal factors; midwifery care factors; and lack of support. Conclusion: QPI is a significant factor in the development of PTSD-PC and the identified key features of QPI have potential to be modified by midwives. The development of guidelines for midwives should be grounded on evidence highlighted in this review, along with further high-quality qualitative research exploring QPI from the perspective of women with PTSD-PC, but also midwives' knowledge and needs regarding their role within QPI.

This review reflects on why the study of PA is an essential component of our understanding of physical health and expands on pathways that connect these two variables. To encourage forward movement in this burgeoning research area, measurement and design issues in the study of PA and health are discussed, as are the connections between PA and a range of different health outcomes. Plausible biological, social, and behavioral pathways that allow for positive feelings to get under the skin and influence physical wellness are detailed and framed in the context of several theoretical models. Finally, new directions for the field and important methodological and interpretative considerations that are essential to moving this important research area forward are explored.

AB  - Emotional processes and social interactions are relevant units in the study of the actors involved in contexts of political violence, since they have been exposed to constant conflict and they can develop inappropriate behaviors in daily life. Despite the fact that works on the subject are outlined, very few approach the phenomenon from a perspective of behavioral analysis, specially because of the advances that are denoted in related topics. That is why this review seeks to analyze the conceptual and methodological trends in written production on this subject from this theoretical perspective. The review was completed using the PRISMA guidelines with a search of six electronic databases that resulted in 297 articles for the initial review and 31 articles included in the final analysis. The results show that the most frequent studies are the quantitative empirical ones, showing there is a difference between the concepts of analysis by population, since the results throw an emphasis on the analysis of personnel of military forces that seem affected by hostility and aggression, with emphasis on war veterans and an approach based on in diagnostic categories from psychopathology. There are no approaches from other theoretical perspectives, such as those proposed by the analysis of behavior that could help to understand a personal, contextual and historical reality. Emphasis is placed on the need for an empirical specification regarding the results and the importance of the role of the environment for the maintenance and construction of repertoires of social interaction and identification, expression and emotional regulation.

AB  - Background: Expressed emotion (EE) is detrimental to patients with schizophrenia, mood disorders, eating disorders and many other psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, majority of the EE literature is generated from the west, and the results of those studies may have limited application in Indian setting. Hence, we conducted this review with the main aim of understanding EE research in India and its potential role in the course and outcome of psychiatric disorders and other chronic illnesses. Methods: Using keywords, we performed searches of electronic databases (PubMed, IndMed, PsychInfo, Science-Direct and Google Scholar) and internet sources and a manual search in the bibliography of the retrieved articles to identify potential original research articles on EE in India. Results: As per the selection criteria, 19 reports of 16 studies were included and reviewed. The sample size of the EE studies ranged from 20 to 200, and majority of the studies were conducted in psychosis/schizophrenia, followed by obsessive compulsive disorder and epilepsy. Although high EE was found in most of the studies, the impact of EE on illness outcome is not well explored and only two studies examined the relationship between EE and relapse. Discussion and Conclusion: There is a dearth of studies on EE, especially its relationship with relapse or clinical outcomes in the Indian context. We recommend more studies in these areas which may be helpful for clinical decisions and advancement of context knowledge in EE.

AB  - Background: Although the relationship between the occurrence of suicide and the presence of psychosocial suffering in bereaved relatives is clear, there are still few studies that deal with the detail of these repercussions and the therapeutic conduction given to them for the suicide.
   Objective: to carry out an integrative review on the psychopathological and psychosocial repercussions of suicide in the family, with emphasis on the detail of the main psychopathological characteristics presented by the individuals and the psychosocial impacts of mourning.
   Method: An integrative review was performed. The guiding question considered Population Intervention Comparator Outcome Setting and the revision protocol is in agreement with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes. The search occurred in the bases: Periodicals CAPES, PsycINFO and PubMed. Original articles were included, without language restriction that emphasized psychopathological and psychosocial aspects of the mourners after suicide. We excluded review studies, clinical cases, editorials and retrospectives.
   Results: The process of suicide mourning for family members is a complex event, marked by stigma and can predispose patients to mental illness and suicidal behavior, especially in the early years of mourning. In addition, it is necessary to expand the scope of evidence on the effectiveness of support and intervention with this population.
   Conclusion: Bereaved families need specialized preventive support insofar as the complexity of bereavement becomes a vulnerability factor for mental illness.

   Anxiety disorders and self-reported symptoms are highly prevalent in pregnancy. Despite their negative impact on maternal and child outcomes, uncertainty remains regarding which symptoms can be considered accurate indicators of antenatal anxiety.
   Aims
   To examine and synthesise the evidence in relation to the psychometric properties and content of self-report scales used to detect anxiety symptoms in pregnant women.
   Method
   A systematic search was carried out and the methodological quality of all included studies was assessed. Only those achieving a rating of good or excellent were considered in a synthesis of the best available evidence.
   Results
   Several anxiety symptoms and domains were identified as promising for screening for general antenatal anxiety and pregnancy-related anxiety, including elevated levels of worry, symptoms of panic, fear of childbirth and excessive worries about the baby's health.
   Conclusions
   This review contributes to the existing knowledge by identifying a number of anxiety symptoms that can be considered psychometrically robust indicators of antenatal anxiety.

Objectives: The current work aspires to comprehensively identify critical factors linked to the applicability of online CBT, in order to inform clinical practices and future research targeting depressive behaviors in early and middle adulthood.
   Methods: To serve these goals: a) the PRISMA systematic literature perspective is followed; b) a systematic search of online databases between 2008-2018 was undertaken and; c) a composite-hybrid model, resulting from the integration of broadly adopted conceptualizations from the areas of psychological treatment and internet use behaviors, was combined with an interpretative phenomenological analysis perspective to organize the findings.
   Results: In total, 28 studies were included in the present review. Factors defining the efficacy, adherence and acceptability of online CBT targeting depression (during early and middle adulthood) were classified into parameters related to the individual receiver, the context and the CBT activities involved.
   Conclusion: Despite the cautiousness warranted by the limitations, as well as the diverge methodology of the reviewed studies, findings appear to favour the provision of brief, therapist supported, online CBT interventions, especially in addressing moderate depression during early and middle adulthood.

AB  - Background: Several epidemiological studies have determined the relationship between diabetes and the incidence and/or prevalence of recently identified comorbid conditions (cancer, periodontal disease, fracture, cognitive impairment, and depression). These relationships may vary by country or race/ethnicity. We aimed to systematically review studies in this field conducted with the Japanese population because such a review in the Japanese population has never been undertaken.
   Methods: We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed and Ichushi-Web databases for studies published until December 2016. Studies comparing the incidence and/or prevalence of the comorbidities among the Japanese population were included. The studies were classified as integrated analyses, cohort studies, case-control studies, or cross-sectional studies.
   Results: We identified 33 studies (cancer: 17, periodontal disease: 5, fracture: 5, cognitive impairment: 4, and depression: 2). Although several cohort studies and meta-analyses had assessed the development of cancer in diabetes, there was scant epidemiological evidence for the other conditions. Indeed, only one cohort study each had been conducted for periodontal disease, fracture, and cognitive impairment, whereas other evidence was cross-sectional, some of which was induced from baseline characteristic tables of studies designed for other purposes.
   Conclusion: In Japan, there is insufficient evidence about the relationship between diabetes and the incidence/prevalence of periodontal disease, fracture, cognitive impairment, and depression. By contrast, several cohort studies and integrated analyses have been conducted for the relationship with cancer. Further studies should be undertaken to estimate the contribution of diabetes on the incidence/prevalence of comorbidities that may be specific to the Japanese population.

AB  - Objectives: Herbs are frequently and concurrently used with prescribed drugs by patients worldwide. While clinical trials have found some herbs to be as useful as standard psychiatric drugs, most clinicians are unaware of their pharmacological mechanisms.
   Methods: We searched English language and other language literature with English abstracts listed in PubMed website, supplemented by additional through Google Scholar's free academic paper abstract website for publications on herbs, focussing on their clinical use in mental disorders, their neurobiology and their pharmacology.
   Results: A major reason for herbs remaining outside of mainstream psychiatry is that the terminology and concepts in herbal medicine are not familiar to psychiatrists in general. Many publications regarding the use of herbal medicine for psychiatric disorders are deficient in details regarding diagnosis, criteria for response and the neurobiology details compared with publications on standard psychotropic drugs. Nomenclature for herbal medicine is usually confusing and is not conducive to an easy understanding of their mode of action in psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusions: The recent neuroscience-based nomenclature (NbN) for psychotropics methodology would be a logical application to herbal medicine in facilitating a better understanding of the use of herbal medicine in psychiatry.

AB  - Background: Overdiagnosis is thought to be common in some mental disorders, but it has not been defined or examined systematically. Assessing overdiagnosis in mental health requires a consistently applied definition that differentiates overdiagnosis from other problems (e.g., misdiagnosis), as well as methods for quantification. Objectives: Our objectives were to (1) describe how the term overdiagnosis has been defined explicitly or implicitly in published articles on mental disorders, including usages consistent (overdefinition, overdetection) and inconsistent (misdiagnosis, false-positive test results, overtreatment, overtesting) with accepted definitions of overdiagnosis; and (2) identify examples of attempts to quantify overdiagnosis. Method: We searchedPubMed through January 5, 2019. Articles on mental disorders, excluding neurocognitive disorders, were eligible if they usedthe term overdiagnosis in the title, abstract, or text. Results: We identified 164 eligible articles with 193 total explicit or implicit uses of the term overdiagnosis. Of 9 articles with an explicit definition, only one provided a definition that was partially consistent with accepted definitions. Of all uses, 11.4% were consistent, and 76.7% were related to misdiagnosis and thus inconsistent. No attempts to quantify the proportion of patients who were overdiagnosed based on overdetection or overdefinition were identified. Conclusions: There are few examples of mental health articles that describe overdiagnosis consistent with accepted definitions and no examples of quantifying overdiagnosis based on these definitions. A definition of overdiagnosis based on diagnostic criteria that include people with transient or mild symptoms not amenable to treatment (overdefinition) could be used to quantify the extent of overdiagnosis in mental disorders.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Countering depressive disorders is a public health priority. Currently, antidepressants are the first-line treatment, although they show modest effects. In men, testosterone treatment is a controversial alternative or adjunct treatment option.
   OBJECTIVES To examine the association of testosterone treatment with alleviation of depressive symptoms in men and to clarify moderating effects of testosterone status, depression status, age, treatment duration, and dosage.
   DATA SOURCES English-language studies published in peer-reviewed journals identified from PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from database inception to March 5, 2018, using the search terms testosterone, mood, administration, dosage, adverse effects, deficiency, standards, therapeutic use, therapy, treatment, and supplementation.
   STUDY SELECTION Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of testosterone treatment that together cover a broad age range and hypogonadal or eugonadal men reporting depressive symptoms on psychometrically validated depression scales.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Of 7690 identified records, 469 were evaluated against full study inclusion criteria after removing duplicates, reviews, and studies that did not examine male patients or testosterone. Quality assessment and data extraction from the remaining 27 RCTs were performed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were testosterone treatment effectiveness (standardized score difference after treatment), efficacy (proportion of patients who responded to testosterone treatment with a score reduction of 50% or greater), and acceptability (proportion of patients who withdrew for any reason).
   RESULTS Random-effects meta-analysis of 27 RCTs including 1890 men suggested that testosterone treatment is associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms compared with placebo (Hedges g, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.10-0.32), showing an efficacy of odds ratio (OR), 2.30 (95% CI, 1.30-4.06). There was no significant difference between acceptability of testosterone treatment and placebo (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.01). Meta-regression models suggested significant interactions for testosterone treatment with dosage and symptom variability at baseline. In the most conservative bias scenario, testosterone treatment remained significant whenever dosages greater than 0.5 g/wk were administered and symptom variability was kept low.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Testosterone treatment appears to be effective and efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms in men, particularly when higher-dosage regimens were applied in carefully selected samples. However, given the heterogeneity of the included RCTs, more preregistered trials are needed that explicitly examine depression as the primary end point and consider relevant moderators.

AB  - Background Evidence from clinical and preclinical studies has demonstrated that stress can cause depressive-like symptoms including anhedonia and psychomotor retardation, namely, the manifestation of motivational deficits in depression. The proximate mediator of linking social-environmental stress with internal motivational deficits remains elusive, although substantial studies proposed neural endocrine mechanisms. As an endogenous danger-associated molecule, high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is necessary and sufficient for stress-induced sensitization of innate immune cells and subsequent (neuro)inflammation. Aim This review aims to provide evidence to unveil the potential mechanism of the relationship between motivational deficits and stress in depression. Methods We reviewed original case-control studies investigating the association between HMGB1-mediated inflammation and stress-induced depression. The literature search of Pubmed and Web of Science electronic database from inception up to March 28th, 2019 were conducted by two independent authors. We performed a qualitative systematic review approach to explore the correlation between HMGB1-mediated inflammation and anhedonia/psychomotor retardation in depression. Results A total of 69 studies based on search strategy were retrieved and seven eligible studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies showed that HMGB1 was implicated with depressive-like behaviors, which are similar with motivational deficits. Furthermore, HMGB1-mediated inflammation in depressive-like behaviors may be involved in Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing three (NLRP3) inflammasome and proinflammatory cytokines, abnormal kynurenine pathway and imbalance between neuroprotective and neurotoxic factors. Conclusions We found that stress-induced inflammation mediated by HMGB1 may affect motivational deficits through regulating dopamine pathway in corticostriatal neurocircuitry. The systematic review may shed light on the novel neurobiological underpinning for treatment of motivation deficits in depression.

AB  - Given the high prevalence of stress-related mental disorders, their impact on person, family, and society and the paucity of treatment options for most of these disorders, there is currently a pressing need for innovative approaches to deal with these issues and enhance well-being. One approach which has received increasing attention over the last decade is to shift our scientific and clinical focus from risk factors for psychopathology to factors promoting resilience and mental well-being. In order to summarize and evaluate the current state of scientific affairs on the biological basis of resilience, we provide an overview of the literature on animal and human studies of resilience. Because resilience can only truly be operationalized through longitudinal data collection and analyses, we focus primarily on longitudinal studies. This review shows that the concept of resilience is currently being operationalized, measured and even defined in widely variable manners, both within animal and human studies. We further provide an overview of existing and new strategies that could help promote resilience and which are proposed to be implemented more often in clinical situations. Finally, we summarize the challenges the field is facing and provide recommendations for future research.

AB  - BackgroundThe literature suggests that many people in the general population tend to distance themselves from those with mental illness. However, there are volunteers that behave differently, spending their free time with people with mental illness and providing direct input in the form of befriending. Whilst there are a range of befriending programmes, little is known about who these volunteer befrienders are, and a previous review of different forms of volunteering in mental health care found data on only 63 befrienders.MethodsWe conducted a systematic electronic search of databases (BNI, CNIL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Registers, Web of Science) to detect all papers reporting characteristics of befriending volunteers in mental health care published between 2011 and April 2018. The articles retrieved were combined with previous papers identified in an earlier review and with relevant papers identified by experts in the field. The articles that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and narratively synthesised.ResultsNine studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, reporting characteristics of a total of 577 volunteer befrienders. The most often reported characteristics were age and gender, motivations to volunteer and experience of the role. Whilst characteristics vary greatly, most volunteers are female, and the average age is 50years. Motivations generally fit into the categories of giving and getting and experiences are mixed.ConclusionPublished research on volunteer befrienders has increased in the last eight years, but is still limited. The range of characteristics suggests that there is a potential for encouraging a variety of people to volunteer as befrienders for people with mental illness. Understanding the characteristics and motivations of volunteers may help refine programmes and improve the experience of the volunteer befrienders.

AB  - Despite the growing interest in the prodromes of psychosis, the proper identification of those Ultra High Risk (UHR) subjects who will convert to psychosis remains an unresolved issue. It remains to be fully understood whether the risk of transition to psychosis is incremented by the concomitant presence of non-psychotic symptoms. We performed a systematic review in order to estimate: prevalence rates of non-psychotic disorders in UHR individuals and whether any comorbid disorder impacts on the risk of transition to frank psychosis. The review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines by searching PubMed until August 2017. The inclusion criteria were: studies with appropriate definition of UHR/ ARMS (At Risk Mental States for psychosis); cross-sectional design (for prevalence rates) or longitudinal design (for transition rates to psychosis); adolescents and/ or adults; specified instrument/interview for the diagnosis of mental disorder/symptoms. We included 46 English-language articles. We found that non-psychotic symptoms are a prevalent concern in UHR individuals, and this is true for all comorbid disorders examined. None of the mental disorder examined appear to be a marker for transition to psychosis. Our systematic review found that the great majority of UHR individuals actually has a highly prevalent clearly defined, above-the-threshold mental disorder that should constitute the primary focus of intervention.

AB  - Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) (schizophrenia-spectrum, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder) die 10-20 years prematurely due to physical disorders such as cardiovascular disease. Physical activity (PA) is effective in preventing and managing these conditions in the general population, however individuals with SMI engage in substantially less PA and more sedentary behaviour (SB) compared to healthy counterparts. Furthermore, the effectiveness of intervening to increase PA or reduce SB in SMI populations is unknown. Therefore, we systematically reviewed studies measuring changes in PA or SB following behavioural interventions in people with SMI. A systematic search of major databases was conducted from inception until 1/3/2018 for behavioural interventions reporting changes in PA or SB in people with SMI. From 3018 initial hits, 32 articles were eligible, including 16 controlled trials (CT's; Treatment n = 1025, Control n = 1162) and 16 uncontrolled trials (n = 655). Of 16 CTs, seven (47%) reported significant improvements in PA, although only one found changes with an objective measure. Of 16 uncontrolled trials, 3 (20%) found improvements in PA (one with objective measurement). No intervention study had a primary aim of changing SB, nor did any note changes in SB using an objective measure. In conclusion, there is inconsistent and low quality evidence to show that interventions can be effective in changing PA or SB in this population. Future robust randomized controlled trials, using objectively-measured PA/SB as the primary outcome, are required to determine which behavioural interventions are effective in improving the sedentary lifestyles associated with SMI.

AB  - What makes people successful at influencing others? In this review, we focus on the role of the persuader (i.e., person who attempts to influence a recipient), drawing from findings in neuroscience to highlight key drivers that contribute to persuaders' decisions to share information, and variables that distinguish successful persuaders from those who are less successful. We review evidence that people's motivations to share are guided in the brain by value-based decision making, with self-relevance and social-relevance as two key motivational inputs to the value computation. We then argue that persuaders who exhibit higher awareness of social considerations and increased recruitment of the brain's mentalizing system are more successful. We conclude by suggesting that approaches integrating social and neural networks can productively advance knowledge in this field.

AB  - Objective: Children and adolescents are among the most vulnerable road users, and road traffic accidents (RTAs) can lead to not only physical injuries but also adverse psychological outcomes, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, estimates of the prevalence of PTSD among children and adolescents following RTAs varied considerably across studies. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of PTSD among this population. Methods: A systematic search for literature was performed in the electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Embase. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran's chi-square test and quantified by the I-2 value. Meta-regression analyses were carried out to identify the effects of some potential moderators on the overall heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were performed to estimate the pooled prevalence of PTSD according to some sample characteristics. Results: Eleven eligible studies with a total of 1532 children and adolescents who were involved in RTAs were included. The overall heterogeneity (I-2 = 89.7, P < 0.001) was high across the eligible studies, and the pooled prevalence of PTSD was 19.95% (95% confidence interval, 13.63% to 27.09%) by a random-effects model. No significant moderators of the overall heterogeneity were identified using meta-regression analyses. Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled prevalence of PTSD differed significantly according to the study location and gender (P < 0.05). Conclusions: One-fifth of children and adolescents developed PTSD in the aftermath of RTAs, indicating the need for regular assessment of PTSD and timely and effective psychological interventions among this population. Furthermore, more population-based studies with a large sample size are warranted. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (No. CRD42018087941).

AB  - Social cognition is an important research field in psychiatry due to its relevance in the functioning and quality of life of patients. The objective of this work is to conduct a systematic mapping review of pharmacological strategies for improving social cognition deficits. Publications from 2006 to 2016 were reviewed in Scopus, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase. From the initial 1059 publications obtained, a final number of 110 were selected. The results show an increasing interest in pharmacological approaches in different medical fields (especially psychiatry, pharmacology, and endocrinology, with schizophrenia and autism as the most studied disorders), as can be observed in the progressive increase in the number of publications, the high degree of scientific evidence, and the high impact factor of publications. However, it is also observed that most studies were conducted with oxytocin, psychostimulants, and antipsychotics (mainly risperidone and olanzapine), with few studies using other drugs. In the different social cognition domains, the majority of publications were focused on emotional processing or theory of mind, with few studies in other domains. Thus, this systematic mapping review shows that, even though there are increasing research activities, there are some important gaps to cover in future investigation.

AB  - In last years, neurocognitive enhancement represents a field of great interest and a debated topic in literature. The neuroenhancement concerns the use of different neuroscientific methods that increase individuals' cognitive performance operating on the brain and the nervous system. Recent studies have indeed highlighted how neuroscientific techniques could improve specific functions such as attention, perception, and memory in clinical and experimental contexts. The development of new and different techniques of neurocognitive enhancement leads to the necessity to investigate the ethical and legal implications related to the use of these tools for the enhancement of mental and physical functions. In particular, this work highlights the ethical and moral implications of the use of neurocognitive tools and techniques based on awareness practices and supported by the use of a wearable device. This paper, therefore, offers an overview of the criticalities and benefits of the use of neurocognitive enhancement techniques on individuals and society, highlighting particularly the use of neurocognitive enhancement within professional contexts in the improvement of organizations effectiveness, coordination, and productivity.

In spite of sufficient evidence indicating the extent of mental health challenges, the Governmental response in India has been completely missing. Some of the challenges in the path of Indian health providers are poor diagnostic facilities, lack of psychiatric epidemiological data for tribal populations, and culturally inappropriate instruments. Scientists and practitioners can play an important role in bridging the knowledge gap in the field.ConclusionIt is necessary to perceive the mental health status of displaced tribal populations within the larger framework of social justice. A strictly biomedical approach is insufficient when the individuals seeking help are under constant stress. Thus, a mental health program is needed for tribal people that offers a perspective broad enough to address the needs of individuals and the local worlds in which they live.

AB  - Background Military service can be a traumatic experience and cause mental health problems in a minority of personnel, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is linked to negative long-term outcomes. As a result, PTSD has received significant research attention. However, post-traumatic growth (PTG) is a newer construct, with comparatively little known about its presentation and development.
   Aims To qualitatively examine the experience of (PTG) in military and ex-military personnel.
   Methods A qualitative systematic search of electronic databases was conducted, with studies assessed for methodological quality and data analysed using thematic analysis. Nine qualitative studies, carried out between 2011 and 2016, met the inclusion criteria with 195 participants in total, including both military and ex-military personnel.
   Results Six themes were identified: appreciation for life, re-evaluating sense of purpose, improvement of personal human traits, bonding and connecting with others, integrating into society, and being proud of heritage and feeling valuable to society.
   Conclusions The results of this review illustrate that military personnel may experience PTG due to deployment-related trauma exposure, and the presentation of PTG in this population is not dissimilar to that of civilians. This study highlights the need for additional research to quantify the long-term psychological impact of PTG and whether a focus on PTG may be helpful in psychological treatment for (ex-) military personnel.

KW  - important metalinguistic function
AB  - This paper describes the concept of didactic communication and verifies the course of teaching selected disciplines of water based recreation, i.e. swimming (at the standard technique level), handling a sailing boat whilst undertaking simple manoeuvres, and the basics of diving. At the same time, research in the area of experiments conducted in the field of teaching methods of these disciplines was reviewed in terms of teaching effectiveness, as well as the health and safety of the participants, and ways of communicating while in, on and under the water. Communication between an instructor and a student in any environment which is different from the norm, is difficult owing to its specificity. Additionally, teaching skills on, in or under water requires strict observance of safety rules. Lack of student's readiness to act in a different water environment, be that based on anxiety or fear, may interfere with or, even prevent didactic communication. Consequently, the effectiveness of teaching decreases. The aim of this work is to search for innovative forms of information transfer that will enable a permanent change in the student's behaviour, especially when acting in a difficult environment - on the water, in the water and under the water. There are premises to believe that immediate verbal instruction and emphasising the metalinguistic function in it should improve the quality and effectiveness of the process of teaching activities in various water based environments.

AB  - Background Post-traumatic growth is defined as positive psychological, social or spiritual growth after a trauma.
   Objectives This systematic review aimed to identify studies that quantitatively measured post-traumatic growth among (ex-) military personnel, to determine whether there is evidence of growth in this context and whether such growth is associated with any sociodemographic, military, trauma or mental health factors.
   Data sources The electronic databases PsycInfo, OVIDmedline and Embase were searched for studies published between 2001 and 2017.
   Study eligibility criteria and participants Papers were retained if they involved military or ex-military personnel, where some had been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. Study appraisal Quality assessment was conducted on all studies.
   Results 21 studies were retained. The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory was employed by 14 studies: means ranged from 32.60 (standard deviation = 14.88) to 59.07 (23.48). The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory Short Form was used by five studies: means ranged from 17.11 (14.88) to 20.40 (11.88). These values suggest moderate growth. Higher levels of social support, spirituality and rumination and minority ethnicity were most frequently associated with more post-traumatic growth.
   Limitations The involved studies may lack generalisability and methodological quality.
   Conclusions Overall, this paper confirms that negative reactions to trauma, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder, are not the only possible outcomes for service personnel, as moderate post-traumatic growth can also be observed.
   Implications of key findings Interventions aimed at helping current and former armed forces personnel to identify and promote post-traumatic growth post-conflict may be beneficial for their well-being.

AB  - Depression has long been a clinical concern in youth with autism, yet systematic research examining its prevalence, presentation, and treatment has only begun to emerge more recently. Using the search terms autism, asd, or autistic and depression, depressive, dysthymia, or dysthymic, this systematic review identified 43 articles focused on symptoms of depression in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders published between 2012 and 2016. The results of the review indicate that depression is more common in youth with autism spectrum disorders than in typically developing youth and is associated with a multitude of other medical and psychiatric conditions. Unfortunately, few intervention studies have been conducted despite evidence of need and preliminary efficacy for some psychosocial and pharmacological treatments.

AB  - The natural world presents a myriad of dangers that can threaten an organism's survival. This diversity of threats is matched by a set of universal and species specific defensive behaviors which are often subsumed under the emotions of fear and anxiety. A major issue in the field of affective science, however, is that these emotions are often conflated and scientists fail to reflect the ecological conditions that gave rise to them. I attempt to clarify these semantic issues by describing the link between ethologically defined defensive strategies and fear. This in turn, provides a clearer differentiation between fears, the contexts that evoke them and how they are organized within defensive survival circuits.

AB  - Suicide is now the second leading cause of death among persons between the ages of adolescents and emerging adults and rates have increased despite more funding and broader implementation of youth suicide-prevention programs. A systematic review was conducted focusing on identifying youth suicide-prevention studies within the United States. This paper reports on the methods utilized for understanding possible moderators of suicide-prevention program outcomes.
   We searched six databases from 1990 through August 2017 to identify studies of suicide-preventive interventions among those under age 26 years. Two independent team members screened search results and sequentially extracted information related to statistical methods of moderation analyses.
   69 articles were included in the systematic review of which only 17 (24.6%) explored treatment effect heterogeneity using moderation analysis. The most commonly used analytic tool was regression with an interaction term. The moderators studied included demographic characteristics such as gender and ethnicity as well as individual characteristics such as traumatic stress exposure and multiple prior suicide attempts.
   With a greater emphasis from the federal government and funding agencies on precision prevention, understanding which prevention programs work for specific subgroups is essential. Only a small percentage of the reviewed articles assessed moderation effects. This is a substantial research gap driven by sample size or other limitations which have impeded the identification of intervention effect heterogeneity.

AB  - Behavioral adaptations occur through remodeling of brain circuits, as arising, for instance, from experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Drugs of abuse and aversive stimuli, such as stress, act on the mesocorticolimbic system, dysregulating adaptive mechanisms and leading to a variety of aberrant behaviors associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Until recently, research in the field has commonly focused on experience-dependent synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. However, there is growing evidence that synaptic plasticity within inhibitory circuits is an important contributor to maladaptive behaviors. We speculate that restoring normal inhibitory synaptic transmission is a promising therapeutic target for correcting some of the circuit abnormalities underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Depressive disorder accounts for a substantial proportion of psychiatric problems across the globe and has a devastating impact on quality of life and occupational function. Psychological models of depression emphasize the causal role of cognitive distortions in this disease, and cognitive problems have been included in the diagnostic criteria for depressive episodes. Here, we focus on recent progress in preclinical modelling of aberrations in one of the most important neurocognitive mechanisms involved in the manifestation of depression - abnormal sensitivity to positive and negative feedback. First, we summarize the recent advances in understanding neurocognitive mechanisms of aberrant feedback sensitivity in depression and underlying neurobiological substrates. Second, by combining behavioural, neurochemical, neuroanatomical and pharmacological approaches, we evaluate the translational value of the probabilistic reversal-learning (PRL) task, a behavioural paradigm that enables investigation of correlates of feedback sensitivity in humans and animals. Finally, we identify and discuss directions for future investigation, including cognitive biomarkers of depression and resilience to stress based on feedback sensitivity and personalized treatment targets.

AB  - During the last decades, there have been major advances in mapping the brain regions that underlie our ability to perceive, experience, and produce music and how musical training can shape the structure and function of the brain. This progress has fueled and renewed clinical interest towards uncovering the neural basis for the impaired or preserved processing of music in different neurological disorders and how music-based interventions can be used in their rehabilitation and care. This article reviews our contribution to and the state-of-the-art of this field. We will provide a short overview outlining the key brain networks that participate in the processing of music and singing in the healthy brain and then present recent findings on the following key music-related research topics in neurological disorders: (i) the neural architecture underlying deficient processing of music (amusia), (ii) the preservation of singing in aphasia and music-evoked emotions and memories in Alzheimer's disease, (iii) the mnemonic impact of songs as a verbal learning tool, and (iv) the cognitive, emotional, and neural efficacy of music-based interventions and activities in the rehabilitation and care of major ageing-related neurological illnesses (stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease).

AB  - Introduction Participatory postnatal women's groups have been shown to have a significant impact on maternal and neonatal mortality in low-income countries. However, it is not clear whether this approach can be translated to high-income countries (HICs). We conducted a systematic review to answer the question: "Can postnatal women's groups improve health outcomes for mothers and children in high-income countries?" Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for randomised controlled trials testing any group-based intervention during the postnatal period, in HICs. No limitations were applied to stated outcomes. Results Nine trials, including 3029 women, fulfilled the criteria. Group-based interventions, facilitated by health professionals, ranged from didactic to participant-led. Three trials addressed postnatal depression, one addressed physical activity, whilst the remainder looked at multiple health or social outcomes. Three trials reported a significant association between their intervention and at least one outcome measure. Study limitations included poor and inequitable intervention uptake, low participant retention, small sample size and incomplete intervention description. Discussion This review found limited and incompletely described evidence testing the use of postnatal group-based interventions to improve health outcomes in HICs. Promising results were reported when the obstacles of sample size and group attendance were overcome. Studies reporting positive impacts on primary outcomes reported higher attendance rates and involved a psychoeducational or cognitive behavioural component in their group approaches. Further research should design and evaluate implementation strategies, assess the use of lay support workers in community settings to improve attendance and retention, and examine the effect of the group environment on outcomes.

AB  - Protein aggregation and accumulation are common pathological hallmarks in neurodegenerative diseases. To efficiently clear and eliminate such aggregation becomes an important cellular strategy for cell survival. Lewy bodies inclusion and aggregation of alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) during the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) serve as a good example and are potentially linked to other pathological PD features such as progressive dopaminergic neuron cell death, behavioral defects, and nonmotor symptoms like anosmia, cognitive impairment, and depression. Years of research have revealed a variety of mechanisms underlying alpha-Syn aggregation, clearance, and spread. Particularly, vesicular routes associated with the trafficking of alpha-Syn, leading to its aggregation and accumulation, have been shown to play vital roles in PD pathogenesis. How alpha-Syn proteins propagate among cells in a prion-like manner, either from or to neurons and glia, via means of uptake or secretion, are questions under active investigation and have been of central interest in the field of PD study. This review covers components and pathways of possible vesicular routes involved in alpha-Syn trafficking. Events including but not limited to exocytosis and endocytosis will be discussed within the context of an overall cellular trafficking theme. Recent advances on alpha-Syn trafficking mechanisms and their significance in mediating PD pathogenesis will be thoroughly reviewed, ending with a discussion on the advantages and limitations of different animal PD models.

AB  - Background: Approximately 3% of women in community samples develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childbirth. Higher prevalence rates are reported for high risk samples. Postpartum PTSD can adversely affect women's wellbeing, mother-infant relationships and child development. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of trauma-focused psychological interventions (TFPT), for postnatal women.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis including all clinical trials which reported post-traumatic stress symptoms for both the intervention and control groups or at least two time-points, pre- and post-intervention. We searched four databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and OpenGrey. Screening of search results, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were undertaken independently by two reviewers.
   Results: Eleven studies, reported in 12 papers, involving 2,677 postnatal women were included. All were RCTs, bar one case series. Interventions varied in modality, duration and intensity, and included exposure therapy, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and other psychological approaches. Participants had experienced uncomplicated births, emergency cesarean sections and/or preterm births. Results suggest that TFPT are effective for reducing PTSD symptoms in the short term (up to 3 months postpartum [4 RCTs, n = 301, SMD = -0.50, 95% CI = -0.73 to -0.27]), and medium term (i.e., 3-6 months postpartum [2 RCTs, n = 174, SMD = -1.87, 95% CI = -2.60 to -1.13]). However, there is no robust evidence to suggest whether TFPT can also improve women's recovery from clinically significant PTSD symptoms.
   Conclusion: Further larger studies, distinguishing between low and high risk groups, and with adequate follow-up, are needed to establish which TFPT are most effective and acceptable for treating postnatal PTSD.

AB  - The Curonian Lagoon is Europe's largest lagoon and one of the most seriously impacted by harmful blooms of cyanobacteria. Intensive studies over the past 20 years have allowed us to identify the major drivers determining the composition and spatial extent of hyperblooms in this system. We summarize and discuss the main outcomes of these studies and provide an updated, conceptual scheme of the multiple interactions between climatic and hydrologic factors, and their influence on internal and external processes that promote cyanobacterial blooms. Retrospective analysis of remote sensed images demonstrated the variability of blooms in terms of timing, extension and intensity, suggesting that they occur only under specific circumstances. Monthly analysis of nutrient loads and stoichiometry from the principal tributary (Nemunas River) revealed large interannual differences in the delivery of key elements, but summer months were always characterized by a strong dissolved inorganic N (and Si) limitation, that depresses diatoms and favors the dominance of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria blooms occurred during high water temperatures, long water residence time and low-wind conditions. The blooms induce transient (night-time) hypoxia, which stimulates the release of iron-bound P, producing a positive feedback for blooms of N-fixing cyanobacteria. Consumermediated nutrient recycling by dreissenid mussels, chironomid larvae, cyprinids and large bird colonies, may also affect P availability, but their role as drivers of cyanobacteria blooms is understudied.

AB  - Background: Although several excellent reviews and meta-analyses have investigated the effect of video game trainings as tools to enhance well-being, most of them specifically focused on the effects of digital games on brain plasticity or cognitive decline in children and seniors. On the contrary, only one meta-analysis results to be focused on the adult population, and it is restricted to examining the effects of training with a particular genre of games (action video games) on cognitive skills of healthy adults.
   Objectives: This systematic review was aimed to identify research evidences about the impact on cognitive [i.e., processing and reaction times (RTs), memory, task-switching/multitasking, and mental spatial rotation] and emotional skills of video games training in the healthy adult population.
   Methods: Amulti-component analysis of variables related to the study, the video games, and the outcomes of the training was made on the basis of important previous works. Databases used in the search were PsycINFO, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), PubMed, and Scopus. The search string was: [("Video Games" OR "Computer Games" OR "Interactive Gaming")] AND [("Cognition") OR ("Cognitive") OR ("Emotion") OR ("Emotion Regulation")] AND ["Training"].
   Results: Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and were further classified into the different analysis' variables. The majority of the retrieved studies used commercial video games, and action games in particular, which resulted to be the most commonly used, closely followed by puzzle games. Effect sizes for training with video games on cognitive skills in general ranged from 0.06 to 3.43: from 0.141 to 3.43 for processing and RTs, 0.06 to 1.82 for memory, 0.54 to 1.91 for task switching/multitasking, and 0.3 to 3.2 for mental spatial rotation; regarding video games for the training of emotional skills, effect sizes ranged from 0.201 to 3.01.
   Conclusion: Overall, findings give evidences of benefits of video games training on cognitive and emotional skills in relation to the healthy adult population, especially on young adults. Efficacy has been demonstrated not only for non-commercial video games or commercial brain-training programs, but for commercial video games as well.

AB  - Background: People living with schizophrenia are less likely to quit smoking compared with the general population and people living with other psychiatric disorders. Understanding the schizophrenia-specific psychosocial barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation is important for designing effective smoking cessation interventions. We aimed to systematically review research examining psychosocial barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation in people living with schizophrenia.
   Methods: We followed the PRISMA statement to conduct a systematic literature review examining psychosocial barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation in people living with schizophrenia. We searched EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases from inception to 14 June 2018 to identify relevant articles. We included peer-reviewed original research articles that examined psychosocial barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation, as well as factors associated with maintenance of smoking habits in people living with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods study designs were included. Three authors screened titles, abstracts, and full-texts using the eligibility criteria. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the data to account for the heterogeneity of study designs. We analyzed qualitative and quantitative studies separately.
   Results: We identified 685 studies from our systematic search and screened the full-text of 134 articles. The final set of 23 articles included 20 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies. The most commonly cited barrier to smoking cessation in people living with schizophrenia was cravings and addiction, followed by a perceived increased risk of negative affect associated with quitting smoking. People living with schizophrenia reported smoking to manage stress and to maintain social relationships. People living with schizophrenia were found to be less likely to receive cessation support from health professionals than smokers without schizophrenia. Health concerns were the most commonly mentioned facilitator to quit smoking.
   Conclusions: People living with schizophrenia experience a wide range of barriers to smoking cessation. The influence of these barriers on smoking cessation likelihood may be greater among people living with schizophrenia than people without psychiatric disorders. Health professionals play an important role in smoking cessation for people living with schizophrenia and should consider barriers and facilitators identified in this review to support quitting in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Efforts to address global mental health disparities have given new urgency to longstanding debates on the relevance of cultural variations in the experience and expression of distress for the design and delivery of effective services. This scoping review examines available information on culture and mental health in Nepal, a low-income country with a four-decade history of humanitarian mental health intervention. Structured searches were performed using PsycINFO, Web of Science, Medline, and Proquest Dissertation for relevant book chapters, doctoral theses, and journal articles published up to May 2017. A total of 38 publications met inclusion criteria (nine published since 2015). Publications represented a range of disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, cultural psychiatry, and psychology and explored culture in relation to mental health in four broad areas: (1) cultural determinants of mental illness; (2) beliefs and values that shape illness experience, including symptom experience and expression and help-seeking; (3) cultural knowledge of mental health and healing practices; and (4) culturally informed mental health research and service design. The review identified divergent approaches to understanding and addressing mental health problems. Results can inform the development of mental health systems and services in Nepal as well as international efforts to integrate attention to culture in global mental health.

AB  - Recent decades have seen increased interest in the integration of mental and physical healthcare. Healthcare reform in the US has provided an opportunity for integration of evidence-based mental health programmes. Three quarters of patients with behavioural health disorders are seen in medical settings, where behavioural problems are largely unaddressed. The human and economic toll of unaddressed mental and behavioural health needs is enormous and often hidden from view, since the behavioural or mental health implications of medical conditions like heart disease and diabetes have only recently begun to be appreciated. This paper has three goals: (1) to review models of integrated services delivery, providing a framework for making sense of strategies for integration; (2) to consider some evidence for clinical outcomes when care is integrated; and (3) to highlight some factors that enhance or impede integration in practice. The review concludes with comments on where the field is going.

We summarize current studies related to changes in the conceptualization of social determinants, how social determinants impact mental health, what we have learned from social determinant interventions, and new methods to collect, use, and analyze social determinant data.Recent FindingsRecent research has increasingly focused on interactions between multiple social determinants, interventions to address upstream causes of mental health challenges, and use of simulation models to represent complex systems. However, methodological challenges and inconsistent findings prevent a definitive understanding of which social determinants should be addressed to improve mental health, and within what populations these interventions may be most effective.SummaryRecent advances in strategies to collect, evaluate, and analyze social determinants suggest the potential to better appraise their impact and to implement relevant interventions.

AB  - ObjectiveMethodEvidence-based guidance of clinical decision-making for the management of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is lacking, particularly for co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. This review evaluates treatment evidence for six common symptom targets in children/adolescents with ASD and provides a resource to facilitate application of the evidence to clinical practice.
   A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and high-quality systematic reviews published between 2007 and 2016, focused on: social interaction/communication impairment, stereotypic/repetitive behaviours, irritability/agitation, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, mood or anxiety symptoms, and sleep difficulties. We then completed qualitative evaluation of high-quality systematic reviews/meta-analyses and quantitative evaluation of recently published RCTs not covered by prior comprehensive systematic reviews.
   ResultsConclusionRecently published RCTs focused on social interaction and communication impairment (trials=32) using psychosocial interventions. Interventions for irritability/agitation (trials=16) were mainly pharmacological. Few RCTs focused on other symptom targets (trials=2-5/target). Integration of these results with our qualitative review indicated that few established treatment modalities exist, and available evidence is limited by small studies with high risk of bias.
   Given the current evidence-base, treatment targets must be clearly defined, and a systematic approach to intervention trials in children/adolescents with ASD must be undertaken with careful consideration of the limitations of safety/efficacy data.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a potentially lifelong condition characterised by extreme changes in mood that may begin in childhood and cause substantial impairment. Over the past decades, BPD has been the focus of increased attention mainly due to controversies surrounding its prevalence, diagnosis and treatment in children and adolescents. This report addresses these controversies by reviewing the extant evidence base, providing clinicians with a summary of the literature on diagnosis, phenomenology and treatment of paediatric BPD. The debate regarding diagnosing children with BPD based on severe irritability and aggression is mostly resolved. The current data support utilising the diagnostic criteria based on episodic changes of mood polarity. Therefore, longitudinal course of illness should be explored in detail when diagnosing BPD. Given high rates of genetic predisposition for BPD, assessment of youth should focus on obtaining accurate family history of this condition. Additionally, there has been a substantial increase in randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating pharmacological agents for mood stabilisation in children and adolescents, which we summarise in this review. Despite significant progress being made in the field of paediatric BPD, more research is needed in the areas of phenomenology, pathophysiology, course and treatment of this condition in youth.

AB  - The prediction of acute and maintenance lithium treatment response carries major clinical and neurobiological implications, warranting systematic review. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) compliant review searched major electronic databases from inception until December 2017 for studies documenting a clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) made according to the mainstream diagnostic manuals and confirmed by a structured interview. Eligible studies allowed a quantitative comparison of endpoint vs baseline mean values of a given biomarker, regardless of the mood phase of patients with BD, and the disorder was assessed for severity using validated rating tool(s). Owing to the purposely applied stringent selection criteria, 16 acute and 12 maintenance studies could be included. The anticipated publication bias limited the chances of reportable generalizable findings, hindering a side-by-side comparison of different records across varying biomarkers and subsequent meta-analyses. The PRISMA approach was nonetheless preferred; it aimed at enhancing the homogeneity of the included results and minimizing the chances of "apples and oranges" with respect to the present research theme. The present critical review confirms the need for future research to specifically assess either pretreatment and/or posttreatment putative biomarkers of patients with BD and treated with lithium.

AB  - Face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are time-limited, structured psychotherapies recommended for the management of adult major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the reporting and methodological quality, and cost-effectiveness of economic evaluations that examined these two thoroughly researched psychotherapies. Economic studies were retrieved through systematic searches of bibliographic databases (e.g., Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO: January 2000 to February 2018) and grey literature. The reporting and methodological quality of the studies was independently evaluated by two reviewers using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist and Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) tool. The cost-effectiveness results were qualitatively synthesized. Fifteen out of 161 identified economic evaluations were included: 14 examined CBT and one IPT. None was conducted in Canada. Based on the CHEERS criteria, overall reporting quality of the included studies was good. Eighty-seven percent of the included studies were of high quality based on the QHES criteria. Most of these studies examined the cost-effectiveness of individually delivered CBT (alone or with pharmacotherapy) over a short time horizon. CBT represented good value for money at different country-specific willingness-to-pay thresholds. The cost-effectiveness of IPT was uncertain. In conclusion, the quality of economic analyses examining structured psychotherapies is good. Face-to-face CBT represents good value for money in the management of adult MDD and GAD though no study was done in Canada. The long-term cost-effectiveness of the group versus individual format remains unclear and warrants further research.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the relationship between comorbid serious mental illness (SMI) diagnosis and 30-day medical-surgical readmissions.
   Methods: In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) we searched five databases (2012 to 2017) to identify relevant articles on the relationship between SMI diagnosis and readmissions. We used the National Institute of Health's Quality Appraisal Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies guidelines to appraise studies and assess risk of bias. Data were narratively synthesized and a pooled random effects unadjusted odds ratio was estimated using meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was investigated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression.
   Results: Our search yielded 424 articles after removing duplicates. Nine met inclusion criteria. All studies were retrospective observational cohort studies. The meta-analysis showed that people with SMI have greater odds of readmission than people without SMI (pooled OR 1.38, CI 1.23-1.56, I-2= 98.6%). There was heterogeneity in patient cohorts, study methodology, and definition of SMI. No significant possibility of publication bias was detected (Classic fail-safe N = 3480).
   Conclusion: There is a meaningful relationship between SMI diagnosis and medical-surgical readmissions. Given the prevalence of SMI in patients hospitalized for medical-surgical problems and the heterogeneity of evidence, further research on sources of variation in outcomes is critically needed.

AB  - Attachment Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC; Dozier et al., 2006) is a 10-week, in-home intervention primarily for early childhood aged children (ages 6 months-2 years). The ABC intervention seeks to teach parents how to provide nurturing care and engage in appropriate interactions with their children. ABC has been identified as a Level 1 evidence-based practice by the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare. However, to date, there has been no systematic review presenting the overall evidence behind ABC available in a peer-reviewed journal. The objective of this review is to address this gap by synthesizing prior literature and evidence, specifically evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs), regarding the effectiveness of the ABC intervention and to determine the contexts in which the intervention has been implemented. To complete this review, literature was searched across three bibliographic databases and relevant Web sites. Only RCTs examining child outcomes were included in the review. Using identified search procedures, 10 articles discussing RCTs which tested the efficacy of ABC were identified. Findings indicate that ABC is effective, when implemented with child-welfare-involved children, at improving emotion regulation, improving externalizing and internalizing behaviors, increasing normative developmental functioning, and attachment quality. Sample information from the 10 RCTs identified is presented as well as additional study characteristics.

AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been related with improved job satisfaction, wellbeing, health, and reduced workplace stress with employees. However, until now, synthesis of the evidence of the effect of MBIs on physiological indices associated with stress and ill-health has been lacking. Therefore the current systematic review aimed to synthesise the literature from employee samples to provide guidance for future investigations in terms of which physiological indicators and biological systems may be most impacted by MBIs.
   Methods: Electronic databases were searched. Studies that conducted a mindfulness-based program with an employee sample, which targeted workplace stress or work engagement, and measured a physiological outcome were selected for inclusion. Studies using either a between-group or within-group design were included. Nine papers were found to meet the inclusion criteria for our systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.
   Results: MBIs were found to be effective in reducing cortisol production, as indicated by lowered high and low diurnal cortisol slopes. However, no changes were found for cortisol awakening response or concentrations for single a.m. and p.m. time-points. MBIs also improved autonomic balance, assessed by heart rate variability coherence measures, but not blood pressure. Sympathetic nervous system reactivity as measured by salivary alpha amylase was also reduced following MBI. While aspects of immune function were also improved following MBIs, specifically, increased antibody response to a viral vaccine and reduced C-reactive protein concentrations, each of these outcomes were only assessed in a single study.
   Conclusion: Taken together, the findings suggest that MBIs are a promising avenue for intervention for improving physiological indices of stress. Our findings suggest that changes in daytime cortisol secretion and HRV coherence may be particularly influenced by MBIs. Future studies should aim to assess multiple physiological indices to confirm the current findings and further improve current understanding of which biological systems (and indices within these systems) show responses indicative of reduced stress due to MBI.

AB  - The analysis of extracellular vesicles has been accelerated because of the technological advancements in omics methods in recent decades. Extracellular vesicles provide multifaceted information regarding the functional status of the cells. This information would be critical in case of central nervous system cells, which are confined in a relatively sealed biological compartment. This obstacle is more dramatic in psychiatric disorders since their diagnosis primarily depend on the symptoms and signs of the patients. In this paper, we reviewed this rapidly advancing field by discussing definition of extracellular vesicles, their biogenesis and potential use as clinical biomarkers. Then we focused on their potential use in psychiatric disorders in the context of diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. Finally, we tried to combine the RDoC (Research Domain Criteria) with the use of extracellular vesicles in psychiatry research and practice. This review may offer new insights in both basic and translational research focusing on psychiatric

AB  - Background: Pain comorbid with depression is frequently encountered in clinical settings and often leads to significant impaired functioning. Given the complexity of comorbidities, it is important to address both pain and depressive symptoms when evaluating treatment options.
   Aim: To review studies addressing pain comorbid with depression, and to report the impact of current treatments.
   Method: A systematic search of the literature databases was conducted according to predefined criteria. Two authors independently conducted a focused analysis of the full-text articles and reached a consensus on 28 articles to be included in this review.
   Results: Overall, studies suggested that pain and depression are highly intertwined and may co-exacerbate physical and psychological symptoms. These symptoms could lead to poor physical functional outcomes and longer duration of symptoms. An important biochemical basis for pain and depression focuses on serotonergic and norepinephrine systems, which is evident in the pain-ameliorating properties of serotonergic and norepinephrine antidepressants. Alternative pharmacotherapies such as ketamine and cannabinoids appear to be safe and effective options for improving depressive symptoms and ameliorating pain. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy may be a promising tool in the management of chronic pain and depression.
   Conclusion: The majority of the literature indicates that patients with pain and depression experience reduced physical, mental, and social functioning as opposed to patients with only depression or only pain. In addition, ketamine, psychotropic, and cognitive-behavioral therapies present promising options for treating both pain and depression.

AB  - Objective: Current nosology conceptualises body dysmorphic disorder as being related to obsessive-compulsive disorder, but the direct evidence to support this conceptualisation is mixed. In this systematic review, we aimed to provide an integrated overview of research that has directly compared body dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Method: The PubMed database was searched for empirical studies which had directly compared body dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder groups across any subject matter. Of 379 records, 31 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Results: Evidence of similarities between body dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder was identified for broad illness features, including age of onset, illness course, symptom severity and level of functional impairment, as well as high perfectionism and high fear of negative evaluation. However, insight was clearly worse in body dysmorphic disorder than obsessive-compulsive disorder, and preliminary data also suggested unique visual processing features, impaired facial affect recognition, increased social anxiety severity and overall greater social-affective dysregulation in body dysmorphic disorder relative to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Conclusion: Limitations included a restricted number of studies overall, an absence of studies comparing biological parameters (e.g. neuroimaging), and the frequent inclusion of participants with comorbid body dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Risks of interpreting common features as indications of shared underlying mechanisms are explored, and evidence of differences between the disorders are placed in the context of broader research findings. Overall, this review suggests that the current nosological status of body dysmorphic disorder is somewhat tenuous and requires further investigation, with particular focus on dimensional, biological and aetiological elements.

AB  - Background An influential psychological model of persecutory delusions proposed that they are caused by a bias towards holding others responsible for negative events (an externalising attributional bias), preventing the individual from becoming aware of underlying low self-esteem. An early version of the model predicted self-esteem would, therefore, be preserved in people with these delusions, but a later version suggested it would be unstable, and that there would be a discrepancy between explicit and implicit self-esteem, with the latter being lower. We did a comprehensive meta-analytical test of the key predictions of this model and assessed the quality of evidence.
   Methods We searched PubMed from Jan 1, 1994, to July 31, 2018, and collated systematic reviews of the defensive model's predictions in relation to persecutory delusions. We also searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science for articles published from Jan 1, 2012, to Sept 10, 2016. Cross-sectional data from case-control, longitudinal, or experimental studies that examined self-esteem or the externalising attributional bias in individuals diagnosed as having schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were eligible for meta-analyses of group differences if at least 50% of participants with psychosis also had current persecutory delusions. Uncontrolled and longitudinal studies were included in meta-analyses of correlations and self-esteem instability, respectively. Study and outcome quality were assessed with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality assessment tool, and a modified version of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, respectively. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016032782.
   Findings We screened 3053 records, examined 104 full-text reports, and included 64 eligible studies. Consistent with the predictions of both versions of the model, paranoia severity in psychosis was positively correlated with the degree of externalising attributional bias (21 studies involving 1128 individuals; r=0 center dot 18, 95% CI 0 center dot 08 to 0 center dot 27, with moderate quality evidence). People with persecutory delusions also had a greater externalising attributional bias than non-clinical individuals (27 studies involving 1442 individuals; g=0 center dot 48, 95% CI 0 center dot 23 to 0 center dot 73) and depressed individuals (ten studies involving 421 individuals; g=1 center dot 06, 0 center dot 48 to 1 center dot 63), and people with psychosis without persecutory delusions (11 studies involving 480 individuals; g=0 center dot 40, 0 center dot 12 to 0 center dot 68), all based on moderate quality evidence. Contrary to the predictions in the early version of the model, paranoia severity in psychosis was negatively correlated with explicit self-esteem (23 studies involving 1866 individuals; r=-0 center dot 26, 95% CI -0 center dot 34 to -0 center dot 17, with high quality evidence). People with persecutory delusions also had lower explicit self-esteem than non-clinical individuals (22 studies involving 1256 individuals; g=-0 center dot 88, 95% CI -1 center dot 10 to -0 center dot 66, with high quality evidence) and explicit self-esteem similarly low to that in people with psychosis without persecutory delusions (11 studies involving 644 individuals; g=-0 center dot 26, -0 center dot 54 to 0 center dot 02, with moderate quality evidence). Consistent with the predictions in the later version of the model, self-esteem instability was positively correlated with paranoia severity in psychosis (four studies involving 508 individuals; r=0 center dot 23, 95% CI 0 center dot 11-0 center dot 34, with high quality evidence), and people with persecutory delusions had a greater discrepancy between their implicit and explicit selfesteem than depressed individuals (seven studies involving 398 individuals; g=0 center dot 61, 95% CI 0 center dot 37 to 0 center dot 85, with moderate quality evidence). They had higher explicit self-esteem than depressed individuals (13 studies involving 647 individuals; g=0 center dot 89, 95% CI 0 center dot 51 to 1 center dot 28, with moderate quality evidence), but similarly low implicit self-esteem (seven studies involving 398 individuals; g=-0 center dot 19, -0 center dot 45 to 0 center dot 07, with low quality evidence). In contrast to the later predictions, people with persecutory delusions did not have a greater self-esteem discrepancy than non-clinical individuals (ten studies involving 592 individuals; g=-0 center dot 17, 95% CI -0 center dot 45 to 0 center dot 12), although the evidence was very low quality. People with psychosis with or without persecutory delusions did not differ for implicit self-esteem (four studies involving 167 individuals; g=-0 center dot 24, 95% CI -0 center dot 77 to 0 center dot 30, with low quality evidence) or self-esteem discrepancies (four studies involving 165 individuals; g=0 center dot 17, -0 center dot 19 to 0 center dot 53, with moderate quality evidence).
   Interpretation The predictions that self-esteem would be preserved in people with persecutory delusions in the early version of the paranoia as defence model and that implicit-explicit self-esteem discrepancy would be greater in people with persecutory delusions than in non-clinical individuals and people with psychosis without persecutory delusions in the later version of the model were not supported. By contrast, the later version correctly predicted that people with persecutory delusions have a greater self-esteem discrepancy than people with depression and a greater externalising attributional bias than all control groups, and that both this bias and self-esteem instability are associated with increased paranoia severity. Nevertheless, the reviewed data had limitations. Experimental studies, which might include interventionist-causal trials, are needed.Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Lifetime prevalence of social anxiety disorder (SAD) among patients with alcohol dependence is around 11%. However, no systematic review has assessed the effect of comorbid SAD on the clinical outcomes of patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD).
   Objectives: We aimed to compare clinical outcomes, such as alcohol relapse, suicide attempts, treatment response, readmissions, psychiatric comorbidities, and treatment compliance between patients with AUD and comorbid SAD versus patients with AUD without SAD.
   Methods: We carried out a systematic review by searching PubMed for articles published between January 1, 1960 and May 6, 2018. Inclusion criteria were met if a study reported a dichotomous sample of adult patients with AUD and SAD compared to patients with AUD without SAD. Review articles and preclinical studies were excluded. From the eligible studies, we extracted outcomes of interest, such as alcohol relapse, suicidal thoughts, suicide plan and attempts, treatment response, readmissions, psychiatric comorbidities, and treatment compliance.
   Results: Patients with both AUD and SAD have a higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, mainly major depressive disorder (MDD), and depressive symptoms. In addition, they have poor treatment compliance. Conversely, the impact of comorbid SAD on alcohol relapse is controversial and current studies have yielded mixed results. Only one study assessed the impact of comorbid SAD on treatment response and showed no association. Furthermore, one study assessed suicidality and found higher rates of suicidal thoughts, suicide plans and attempts in patients with AUD and SAD.
   Conclusion: The present systematic review shows that it is important to screen for other psychiatric comorbidities (especially MDD), suicidality, and improve treatment adherence in patients with AUD and comorbid SAD. Future prospective studies should clarify the impact of comorbid SAD.

In particular, we investigated the relationship of PTG with sociodemographic, HIV-related clinical variables, positive and negative psychological correlates as well as HIV-related social issues among PLWH.
   Method: A literature search was performed on Web of Science, PsyARTICLES, MedLine, Proquest and Scopus databases using appropriate descriptors for positive changes among PLWH. Articles were analysed by title, abstract, and full text.
   Results: We accepted a set of 24 articles for systematic review and analysis. Consistent findings were obtained with respect to the positive association between psychological and social correlates (optimism, resilience, positive reappraisal coping, positive affect, self-efficacy and social support) and PTG among PLWH. PTG was also negatively related to various aspects of HIV-related distress (depression, substance use, PTSD symptoms, HIV stigma). On the contrary, sociodemographic and especially HIV-related clinical variables were mostly unrelated to PTG among PLWH.
   Conclusions: The self-reported PTG among PLWH may be related to psychological variables rather than to objective characteristics of HIV infection itself. Nevertheless, several aspects of research on PTG among PLWH require modification, both theoretically and methodologically.

AB  - Background: Brain connectome research based on graph theoretical analysis shows that small-world topological properties play an important role in the structural and functional alterations observed in patients with psychiatric disorders. However, the reported global topological alterations in small-world properties are controversial, are not consistently conceptualized according to agreed-upon criteria, and are not critically examined for consistent alterations in patients with each major psychiatric disorder. Methods: Based on a comprehensive PubMed search, we systematically reviewed studies using noninvasive neuroimaging data and graph theoretical approaches for 6 major psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, we describe the main patterns of altered small-world properties and then systematically review the evidence for these alterations in the structural and functional connectome in patients with these disorders. Results: We selected 40 studies of schizophrenia, 33 studies of MDD, 5 studies of ADHD, 5 studies of BD, 7 studies of OCD and 5 studies of PTSD. The following 4 patterns of altered small-world properties are defined from the perspectives of segregation and integration: "regularization," "randomization," "stronger small-worldization" and "weaker small-worldization." Although more differences than similarities are noted in patients with these disorders, a prominent trend is the structural regularization versus functional randomization in patients with schizophrenia. Limitations: Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, preprocessing steps and analytical methods can produce contradictory results, increasing the difficulty of integrating results across different studies. Conclusion: Four psychoradiological patterns of altered small-world properties are proposed. The analysis of altered small-world properties may provide novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders from a connectomic perspective. In future connectome studies, the global network measures of both segregation and integration should be calculated to fully evaluate altered small-world properties in patients with a particular disease.

AB  - Introduction Therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on motor recovery of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported; however, the protocols of these studies varied greatly. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the optimal rTMS parameters for motor recovery of PD. Methods Results Electronic databases were searched for studies investigating the therapeutic effects of rTMS on motor function in patients with PD. The section III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was extracted as the primary outcome, and the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Twenty-three studies with a total of 646 participants were included. The pooled estimates of rTMS revealed significant short-term (SMD, 0.37; p < 0.00001) and long-term (SMD, 0.39; p = 0.005) effects on motor function improvement of PD. Subgroup analysis observed that high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) was significant in improving motor function (SMD, 0.48; p < 0.00001), but low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) was not. In particular, when HF-rTMS targeted over the primary motor cortex (M1), in which the bilateral M1 revealed a larger effect size than unilateral M1. Compared to single-session, multi-session of HF-rTMS over the M1 showed significant effect size. In addition, HF-rTMS over the M1 with a total of 18,000-20,000 stimulation pulses yielded more significant effects (SMD, 0.97; p = 0.01) than other dosages. Conclusions In conclusion, multi-session of HF-rTMS over the M1 (especially bilateral M1) with a total of 18,000-20,000 pulses appears to be the optimal parameters for motor improvement of PD.

AB  - The function of guanine-based purines (GBPs) is mostly attributed to the intracellular modulation of heteromeric and monomeric G proteins. However, extracellular effects of guanine derivatives have also been recognized. Thus, in the central nervous system (CNS), a guanine-based purinergic system that exerts neuromodulator effects, has been postulated. The thesis that GBPs are neuromodulators emerged from in vivo and in vitro studies, in which neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of these kinds of molecules (i.e., guanosine) were demonstrated. GBPs induce several important biological effects in rodent models and have been shown to reduce seizures and pain, stabilize mood disorder behavior and protect against gliomas and diseases related with aging, such as ischemia or Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases. In vitro studies to evaluate the protective and trophic effects of guanosine, and of the nitrogenous base guanine, have been fundamental for understanding the mechanisms of action of GBPs, as well as the signaling pathways involved in their biological roles. Conversely, although selective binding sites for guanosine have been identified in the rat brain, GBP receptors have not been still described. In addition, GBP neuromodulation may depend on the capacity of GBPs to interact with well-known membrane proteins in glutamatergic and adenosinergic systems. Overall, in this review article, we present up-to-date GBP biology, focusing mainly on the mechanisms of action that may lead to the neuromodulator role of GBPs observed in neurological disorders.

AB  - Measurement of anxiety is desirable for the benefit of drug development and understanding the brain function and mental well-being. Animal models offer the advantages of detailed neurobiological analysis, experimental manipulation of specific components in the brain circuits that underlie psychopathology, and the possibility of screening novel drugs with clinical potential. A large variety of animal models of anxiety and screening tests of anxiolytics is currently in use. While their value in advancing the knowledge and predicting therapeutic success of drugs is unquestionable, the expectations have grown much higher, and the frustration over absence of novel successful drug concepts is rising. It is argued that the multitude of factors that can interfere with animal behaviour in anxiety tests, and the complexity of neurobiology of the various anxiety disorders, present high demands on validation of each anxiety test within each specific laboratory condition. Anxiety models should be explicitly related to a theoretical paradigm on underlying neurobiology, because there is a diversity in concepts, and validation of the model and the selection of behavioural readouts is critically dependent on the neurobiological model. Environmental conditions during the model production and anxiety testing need more attention, including the less considered factors such as ultrasounds. More attention is required to the differences in anxiety neurobiology between males and females, and inter-individual differences in coping strategies.

AB  - The earliest stages of development are critically sensitive to environmental insults. An unfortunately timed stress on the developing brain can have dramatic consequences for the neurodevelopment and future mental health of the individual. In particular, infection of the mother during pregnancy has been correlated with increased risk of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Evidence suggests that maternal immune activation, independently from the infection itself, can be responsible for the outcome in the offspring. This recognition has resulted in expanding study designs from epidemiologic correlations to the search for a causal relationship between activation of the maternal immune system and cognitive consequences for the offspring. However, this causality analysis remained limited in humans until recent work that longitudinally linked specific markers of maternal inflammation during pregnancy with alterations of the newborn brain and cognitive development of toddlers. This focused narrative review compares and discusses the results of these recent studies and places them into the broader landscape of maternal immune activation literature. New data point, in particular, to the association between the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and modifications of the offspring's salience network and subsequent cognitive impairments. This article further emphasizes the need to carefully control for potential confounders in studying the effects of maternal immune activation on the neonatal brain as well as the under-investigated consequences of intra-partum fever on offspring neurodevelopment.

AB  - Emotions have traditionally been considered crucial in the development of functional neurological disorder, but the evidence underpinning this association is not clear. We aimed to summarize evidence for association between functional neurological disorder and emotions as formulated by Breuer and Freud in their conception of hysterical conversion. Based on a systematic literature search, we identified 34 controlled studies and categorized them into four groups: (i) autonomic arousal, (ii) emotion-motion interactions, (iii) social modulation of symptoms, and (iv) bodily awareness in FND. We found evidence for autonomic dysregulation in FND; convergent neuroimaging findings implicate abnormal limbic-motor interactions in response to emotional stimuli in FND. Our results do not provide enough empirical evidence for social modulation of the symptoms, but there is a clinical support for the role of suggestion and placebo in FND. Our results provide evidence for abnormal bodily awareness in FND. Based on these findings, we propose that functional neurological symptoms are forms of emotional reactions shaped into symptoms by previous experience with illness and possibly reinforced by actual social contexts. Additional research should investigate the effect of social context on the intensity of functional neurological symptoms and associated brain regions.

This review systematically evaluates existing literature targeting the relationship between attachment and all aspects of treatment utilization, such as engagement, participation, and completion, in adults with mental health problems.
   Method: A computerized search of PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Healthstar and a manual search were employed. Of 5733 titles, 105 abstracts were selected. Of these, 18 studies met full inclusion criteria. The quality of studies was evaluated and scored according to 9 characteristics.
   Results: Most studies supported an association between attachment and treatment engagement and participation. In general, attachment anxiety was associated with higher engagement and participation in services while attachment avoidance was associated with less. Data regarding attachment dimensions and treatment completion were less conclusive.
   Conclusions: The review suggests a clear relationship between attachment and stages of treatment engagement and participation in a variety of psychiatric populations and treatments. The 2 attachment dimensions appear to have opposite effects, with possible risks for either treatment over- or underutilization. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Many clinicians are reluctant to use traditional mood-stabilizing agents, especially lithium, in children and adolescents. This review examined the evidence for lithium's safety and efficacy in this population.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted on the use of lithium in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD). Relevant papers published through June 30th 2018 were identified searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library.
   Results: 30 articles met inclusion criteria, including 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Findings from RCTs demonstrate efficacy for acute mania in up to 50% of patients, and evidence of long-term maintenance efficacy. Lithium was generally safe, at least in the short term, with most common side effects being gastrointestinal, polyuria, or headache. Only a minority of patients experienced hypothyroidism. No cases of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease were reported.
   Conclusions: Though the available literature is mostly short-term, there is evidence that lithium monotherapy is reasonably safe and effective in children and adolescents, specifically for acute mania and for prevention of mood episodes. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Adolescents, relative to adults, show impairments in learning to reduce or extinguish fear. Furthermore, they may struggle with the use of reappraisal techniques to regulate affect. Both learning and reappraisals are critical to cognitive-behavioural treatments (CBT) for anxiety disorders leading to the hypothesis that adolescents may respond more poorly to CBT than adults.
   Methods: We use meta-regression to explore whether variability in the mean age of participants in trials of CBT for anxiety predicted variability between studies in symptom change effect sizes. PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched with the terms exposure and each of anxiety, phobia, or panic disorder diagnostic terms and cognitive behav* therapy with each of the diagnostic terms. Data were pooled from CBT trials for anxiety disorders (excluding anxiety-related disorders obsessive compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder) where participants' mean age was 11 years or older.
   149 studies were selected and data on change in symptoms from pre-treatment to posttreatment (k = 195), pre-treatment to follow-up (k = 108) and post-treatment to follow-up = 107) were extracted.
   Results: Several possible confounding variables were also accounted for(e.g., proportion of females, number of sessions). Younger age was associated with smaller improvement in anxious symptoms from pre-to post-treatment. However, younger age was also associated with greater improvement in symptoms from post-treatment to follow-up.
   Conclusions: CBT is effective at reducing anxious symptoms, however, younger people may respond more slowly to treatment than older people.

AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common psychotherapy characterized as treating mental diseases, such as depression. Though multiple studies have reported its effect in treatment-resistant depression, no qualified meta-analysis has ever assessed this effect before. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of CBT for treatment resistant depression patients and its continuous effect. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to February 2018 for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A total of six RCTs involving 847 participants were included. Pooled analysis indicated that CBT was an efficient invention in reducing depression symptoms. Besides, CBT was also superior to control group in increasing response and remission rates. These effects could take effect at post-treatment, and last for 6 months, or even 1 year long. No publication bias was detected. These findings suggested that compared with routine antidepressant treatment, CBT has greater potential in taking immediate effect and has better mid-term and long-term prognosis.

AB  - Social media use by minors has significantly increased and has been linked to depression and suicidality. Simultaneously, age- adjusted suicide rates have steadily increased over the past decade in the United States with suicide being the second most common cause of death in youth. Hence, the increase in suicide rate parallels the simultaneous increase in social media use. In addition, the rate of nonsuicidal self- injury ranges between 14% and 21o% among young people. Evidence suggests that self- harming youth is more active on online social networks than youth who do not engage in self- harm behavior. The role of online social networking on deliberates self- harm and suicidality in adolescents with a focus on negative influence was assessed by conducting a systematized literature review. A literature search on " PubMed" and " Ovid Medline" using a combination of MeSH terms yielded nine articles for data extraction satisfying predefined inclusion/ exclusion criteria. It was found that social networking websites are utilized by suicidal and self- harming youth as a medium to communicate with and to seek social support from other users. Online social networking also leads to increased exposure to and engagement in self- harm behavior due to users receiving negative messages promoting self- harm, emulating self- injurious behavior of others, and adopting self- harm practices from shared videos. Greater time spent on social networking websites led to higher psychological distress, an unmet need for mental health support, poor self- rated mental health, and increased suicidal ideation. In conclusion, greater time spent on online social networking promotes self- harm behavior and suicidal ideation in vulnerable adolescents.

AB  - Introduction: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent medical illness that is associated with chronic stress. Patients with MDD can show an imbalance in cortisol levels, which can be restored with the remission of symptoms. Physical exercise training has been used as a tool to promote changes in cortisol levels in healthy individuals. However, it is unknown if exercise can produce the same results in individuals with MDD.
   Objective: To review evidence of cortisol changes after exercise training in individuals with MDD.
   Methods: We conducted a search on PubMed, SciELO, LILACS, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases. Random effects meta-analysis was performed and standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size was calculated. Analyses of forest and funnel plots was conducted using Stata v.11.0 software.
   Results: At first, 463 studies were obtained in the search. After completion of the selection procedure, five articles with seven analyses were included. Type of exercise, frequency of training, cortisol measurement, and type of control group were analyzed. There was a reduction of cortisol levels in the exercise group (SMD = -0.65, 95%CI 1.30-0.01). Moreover, sensitivity analysis and subgroup analyses revealed an effect of type (aerobic exercise) and frequency (five times per week) of exercise on reduction of cortisol levels. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of studies and a substantial heterogeneity among them.
   Conclusion: Physical exercise promotes a reduction in cortisol levels in individuals with MDD. However, this finding can be influenced by type of exercise, weekly frequency, and type of cortisol measurement.

Advances in our understanding of sex differences in the neuroimmune response have important implications for understanding how neural circuits are shaped during early brain development, how activation of the immune system may impact cognitive function and behavior, and how inflammation may be associated with the risk of mental health disorders that have strong sex-biases. The goal of this mini review is to highlight recent work in the field of sex differences in neuroimmune function, with a particular focus on how microglia function is influenced by age and sex hormone exposure.

AB  - Objective: Borderline personality disorder affects up to 2% of the population and is associated with poor functioning, low quality of life and increased mortality. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice, but it is unclear whether specialized psychotherapies (dialectical behavior therapy, mentalization-based treatment, transference-focused therapy and schema therapy) are more effective than non-specialized approaches (e.g. protocolized psychological treatment, general psychiatric management). The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effectiveness of these psychotherapies.
   Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched from inception to November 2017. Included randomized controlled trials were assessed on risk of bias and outcomes were meta-analyzed. Confidence in the results was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. The review has been reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
   Results: A total of 20 studies with 1375 participants were included. Specialized psychotherapies, when compared to treatment as usual or community treatment by experts, were associated with a medium effect based on moderate quality evidence on overall borderline personality disorder severity (standardized mean difference=-0.59 [95% confidence interval: -0.90, -0.28]), and dialectical behavior therapy, when compared to treatment as usual, with a small to medium effect on self-injury (standardized mean difference=-0.40 [95% confidence interval: -0.66, -0.13]). Other effect estimates were often inconclusive, mostly due to imprecision.
   Conclusion: There is moderate quality evidence that specialized psychotherapies are effective in reducing overall borderline personality disorder severity. However, further research should identify which patient groups profit most of the specialized therapies.

AB  - The Republic of Kazakhstan, located in Central Asia, has experienced many years of environmental degradation, largely as a result of the poor management of its significant natural resources. In this survey, data relating to different environmental factors are critically analysed in order to understand the state of the environment. It was found that: warming trends are seen in sensitive areas (e.g. the steppe and near glaciers); drying trends are seen where there is already water stress (e.g. the Aral Sea); air quality has been declining recently (following improvements on the decadal timescale) in major urban centres, particularly Almaty; water quality appears to be improving in some areas (e.g. important lakes in the Aktobe and Zhambyl regions); and levels of exposure to radioactivity are below internationally recommended levels (where data have been found). More generally, there is an issue with data availability and quality, which requires attention if Kazakhstan is going to make the best use of its increasing investment in environmental actions. Current policies are reviewed and recommendations are made for future interventions.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) may be therapeutic for people with severe mental illness (SMI) who generally have low PA and experience numerous life style-related medical complications. We conducted a meta-review of PA interventions and their impact on health outcomes for people with SMI, including schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder. We searched major electronic databases until January 2018 for systematic reviews with/without meta-analysis that investigated PA for any SMI. We rated the quality of studies with the AMSTAR tool, grading the quality of evidence, and identifying gaps, future research needs and clinical practice recommendations. For MDD, consistent evidence indicated that PA can improve depressive symptoms versus control conditions, with effects comparable to those of antidepressants and psychotherapy. PA can also improve cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life in people with MDD, although the impact on physical health outcomes was limited. There were no differences in adverse events versus control conditions. For MDD, larger effect sizes were seen when PA was delivered at moderate-vigorous intensity and supervised by an exercise specialist. For schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, evidence indicates that aerobic PA can reduce psychiatric symptoms, improves cognition and various subdomains, cardiorespiratory fitness, whilst evidence for the impact on anthropometric measures was inconsistent. There was a paucity of studies investigating PA in bipolar disorder, precluding any definitive recommendations. No cost effectiveness analyses in any SMI condition were identified. We make multiple recommendations to fill existing research gaps and increase the use of PA in routine clinical care aimed at improving psychiatric and medical outcomes. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Aims. Stigma of mental illness is a significant barrier to receiving mental health care. However, measurement tools evaluating stigma of mental illness have not been systematically assessed for their quality. We conducted a systematic review to critically appraise the methodological quality of studies assessing psychometrics of stigma measurement tools and determined the level of evidence of overall quality of psychometric properties of included tools.
   Methods. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and ERIC databases for eligible studies. We conducted risk-of-bias analysis with the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments checklist, rating studies as excellent, good, fair or poor. We further rated the level of evidence of the overall quality of psychometric properties, combining the study quality and quality of each psychometric property, as: strong, moderate, limited, conflicting or unknown.
   Results. We identified 117 studies evaluating psychometric properties of 101 tools. The quality of specific studies varied, with ratings of: excellent (n = 5); good (mostly on internal consistency (n = 67)); fair (mostly on structural validity, n = 89 and construct validity, n = 85); and poor (mostly on internal consistency, n = 36). The overall quality of psychometric properties also varied from: strong (mostly content validity, n = 3), moderate (mostly internal consistency, n = 55), limited (mostly structural validity, n = 55 and construct validity, n = 46), conflicting (mostly test-retest reliability, n = 9) and unknown (mostly internal consistency, n = 36).
   Conclusions. We identified 12 tools demonstrating limited evidence or above for (+, ++, +++) all their properties, 69 tools reaching these levels of evidence for some of their properties, and 20 tools that did not meet the minimum level of evidence for all of their properties. We note that further research on stigma tool development is needed to ensure appropriate application.

AB  - Parents' stressful experiences can influence an offspring's vulnerability to many pathological conditions, including psychopathologies, and their effects may even endure for several generations. Nevertheless, the cause of this phenomenon has not been determined, and only recently have scientists turned to epigenetics to answer this question. There is extensive literature on epigenetics, but no consensus exists with regard to how and what can (and must) be considered to study and define epigenetics processes and their inheritance. In this work, we aimed to clarify and systematize these concepts. To this end, we analyzed the dynamics of epigenetic changes over time in detail and defined three types of epigenetics: a direct form of epigenetics (DE) and two indirect epigenetic processes-within (WIE) and across (AIE). DE refers to changes that occur in the lifespan of an individual, due to direct experiences with his environment. WIE concerns changes that occur inside of the womb, due to events during gestation. Finally, AIE defines changes that affect the individual's predecessors (parents, grandparents, etc.), due to events that occur even long before conception and that are somehow (e.g., through gametes, the intrauterine environment setting) transmitted across generations. This distinction allows us to organize the main body of epigenetic evidence according to these categories and then focus on the latter (AIE), referring to it as a faster route of informational transmission across generations-compared with genetic inheritance-that guides human evolution in a Lamarckian (i.e., experience-dependent) manner. Of the molecular processes that are implicated in this phenomenon, well-known (methylation) and novel (non-coding RNA, ncRNA) regulatory mechanisms are converging. Our discussion of the chief methods that are used to study epigenetic inheritance highlights the most compelling technical and theoretical problems of this discipline. Experimental suggestions to expand this field are provided, and their practical and ethical implications are discussed extensively.

AB  - Aim of the Study: This review aims to systematically synthesize the body of literature examining the association between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and serious mental illness (SMI)-type 2 diabetes (T2D) co-occurrence. Methods: We conducted an electronic search of four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science. Studies were considered eligible if they were published in English, peer reviewed, quantitative, and focused on the association between neighborhood disadvantage and SMI-T2D comorbidity. Study conduct and reporting complied with PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol is made available at PROSPERO (CRD42017083483). Results: The one eligible study identified reported a higher burden of T2D in persons with SMI but provided only a tentative support for the association between neighborhood disadvantage and SMI-T2D co-occurrence. Conclusion: Research into neighborhood effects on SMI-T2D comorbidity is still in its infancy and the available evidence inconclusive. This points to an urgent need for attention to the knowledge gap in this important area of public health. Further research is needed to understand the health resource implications of the association between neighborhood deprivation and SMI-T2D comorbidity and the casual pathways linking them.

AB  - Stable isotope and hormone analyses offer insight into the health, stress, nutrition, movements, and reproduction of individuals and populations. Such information can provide early warning signs or more in-depth details on the ecological and conservation status of marine megafauna. Stable isotope and hormone analyses have seen rapid development over the last two decades, and we briefly review established protocols and particular questions emphasized in the literature for each type of analysis in isolation. Little has been published utilizing both methods concurrently for marine megafauna yet there has been considerable effort on this front in seabird and terrestrial predator research fields. Using these other taxa as examples, we offer a few of the major research areas and questions we foresee as productive for the intersection of these two methods and discuss how they can inform marine megafauna conservation and management efforts. Three major research areas have utilized a combination of these two methods: (1) nutrition and health, (2) reproduction, and (3) life history. We identify a fourth area of research, examinations of evolutionary versus ecological drivers of behavior, that could also be well served by a combined stable isotope and hormone analyses approach. Each of these broad areas of research will require methodological developments. In particular, research is needed to enable the successful temporal alignment of these two analytical techniques.

AB  - Background: In order to gain insight into the health impact of violence related injury, the psychological consequences should be taken into account. There has been uncertainty regarding the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder (ASD), and depression among patients with violence related injury. An overview of prevalence rates may inform our understanding of both prognosis and recovery for these patients. Therefore, we aim to provide an overview of the published literature reporting the prevalence rates and trajectories of PTSD, ASD, and depression following violence related injury, and to assess the quality of the studies included.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted in order to provide an overview of the published literature reporting the prevalence of PTSD, ASD and depression following violence related injury treated at the emergency department or hospital. The EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases were searched systematically. The quality of the included studies was assessed.
   Results: We included sixteen studies reporting the prevalence rates of PTSD, ASD, or depression. Clear prevalence trajectories could not be identified because the range of prevalence rates was diverse at each time point. Heterogeneity resulting from the use of different diagnostic instruments limited comparability. The included studies were susceptible to bias due to low response rates and loss to follow-up.
   Conclusions: The differences in diagnostic instruments limited comparability of the prevalence rates. Therefore, clear prevalence trajectories could not be identified. Study participation and loss to follow-up require more attention in future studies. Uniformity in diagnostic procedures is needed in order to draw general conclusions on the prevalence of PTSD, ASD, and depression following violence related injury.

AB  - Sedentary behavior refers to certain activities in a reclining, seated, or lying position requiring very low energy expenditure. It has been suggested to be distinct from physical inactivity and an independent predictor of metabolic risk even if an individual meets current physical activity guidelines. Over the past decades, a shift in the activity profile of individuals has been observed with vigorous physical activity and sleep being partly replaced by cognitive work, a potential neurogenic stress component considering its hormonal and neurophysiological effects, leading to various impacts on health. Mental work, for instance, may significantly increase glycemic instability leading to an increase in the desire to eat and thus, higher energy intakes. Furthermore, screen-based leisure activities (e.g., television watching) and screen-based work activities (e.g., computer use for work purposes) have often been considered together while they may not trigger the same stress response and/or use of substrate. Thus, the problems of sedentariness may not only be attributed to a lack of movement, but also to the stimulation provided by replacing activities. The objective of this review is to discuss the (1) recent evidence and current state of knowledge regarding the health impact of sedentary behaviors on health; (2) potential neurogenic effects of cognitive work as a sedentary behavior; (3) link between sedentary behaviors and the diet; (4) resemblance between sedentary behaviors and the inadequate sleeper; and (5) potential solutions to reduce sedentary behaviors and increase physical activity.

AB  - Background: Psychotic disorders are severe mental health conditions that adversely affect the quality of life and life expectancy. Schizophrenia, the most common and severe form of psychosis affects 21 million people globally. Informal caregivers (families) are known to play an important role in facilitating patient recovery outcomes, although their own health and well-being could be adversely affected by the illness. The application of novel digital interventions in mental health care for patient groups is rapidly expanding; interestingly, however, far less is known about their role with family caregivers.
   Objective: This study aimed to systematically identify the application of digital interventions that focus on informal caregivers of people with psychosis and describe their outcomes.
   Methods: We completed a search for relevant papers in four electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science). The search also included the Cochrane database and manual search of reference lists of relevant papers. The search was undertaken in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines.
   Results: The search identified 9 studies derived from 8 unique datasets. Most studies were assessments of feasibility and were undertaken in the United States. Interventions were predominately Web-based, with a focus on improving the caregivers' knowledge and understanding about psychosis.
   Conclusions: This study offers preliminary support for the feasibility and acceptability of digital interventions for psychosis in informal caregiver populations. However, the findings underpin a clear need for greater development in the range of caregiver-focused digital approaches on offer and robust evaluation of their outcomes. The use of digital approaches with caregiver populations seemingly lags someway behind the significant developments observed in patient groups.

AB  - A modest association can be found between people with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis (psychosis) and perpetrating acts of violence. When a person with psychosis does engage in violence, it is their informal carers, when compared to those from the general population, who are more likely to be the targets, and violence will often occur within the family home. Despite the importance of carer support for improving patient outcomes, our understanding of how carers are impacted by patient initiated violence in psychosis remains limited. This paper reviews literature documenting the effects of patient-initiated violence in psychosis on carer functioning. The review comprised searches of Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, and Web of Science databases and the hand searches of reference lists from relevant published papers. The review was limited to English language publications from inception to 11th September 2017, and where carer experiences following reports of violence from patients with psychosis were specifically recorded. Data from 20 papers using mixed methodologies were reviewed. Patient violence in psychosis was linked to poorer carer outcomes, including carer reports of burden, trauma, fear, and helplessness. There is, however, a significant need for further studies to systematically quantify the impact and correlates of patient initiated violence on psychosis caregivers, and improve prevention.

AB  - Climate-induced drought hazard has been emerging as one of the major challenges in the mid-hill farming system and rural livelihood in Nepal. Drought stress, in combination with century-long socio-political issues such as unequal social structure, gender discrimination, and marginalization of poor and disadvantaged groups have made smallholders more vulnerable in society. Climate changes are exacerbating issues within an already vulnerable society. Therefore, a review study on the impact of drought on the rain-fed hill farming system, and the potential adaptation measures, was carried out in the mid-hill region of western Nepal. Both agricultural impacts such as depletion of traditional varieties of crops, crop-specific diseases, low production, lack of water for irrigation; and non-agricultural impacts such as changing rural livelihood patterns, and social conflict due to agriculture and water issues were identified as major impacts. Some of the agricultural adaptation measures viz. the promotion of climate smart agriculture practices, crop diversification, and agroforestry practices seem to have been more effective in the region. At the same time, small-scale structural water harvesting measures, for instance, rainwater harvesting, conservation ponds, and irrigation channels, drip water irrigation, and an early warning system for drought events could also be an advantage in this context. Nonetheless, there are several adaptation barriers including ecological and physical constraints, human and information resource-shortages, and social barriers to adaptation. Therefore, local site-specific adaptation measures should be developed, and implemented, to increase the adaptive capacity of smallholders, and enhance the farming system in the face of the climate-induced drought scenario.

AB  - Numerous scholars have stated that there is a silent crisis in men's mental health. In this article, we aim to provide an overview of core issues in the field of men's mental health, including a discussion of key social determinants as well as implications for mental health services. Firstly, we review the basic epidemiology of mental disorders with a high incidence and prevalence in men, including suicide and substance use disorder. Secondly, we examine controversies around the low reported rates of depression in men, discussing possible measurement and reporting biases. Thirdly, we explore common risk factors and social determinants that may explain higher rates of certain mental health outcomes in men. This includes a discussion of 1) occupational and employment issues; 2) family issues and divorce; 3) adverse childhood experience; and 4) other life transitions, notably parenthood. Fourthly, we document and analyze low rates of mental health service utilization in men. This includes a consideration of the role of dominant notions of masculinity (such as stubbornness and self-reliance) in deterring service utilization. Fifthly, we note that some discourse on the role of masculinity contains much victim blaming, often adopting a reproachful deficit-based model. We argue that this can deflect attention away from social determinants as well as issues within the mental health system, such as claims that it is feminized and unresponsive to men's needs. We conclude by calling for a multipronged public health-inspired approach to improve men's mental health, involving concerted action at the individual, health services, and societal levels.

AB  - Background Psychological therapies are increasingly delivered in community care settings. In existing literature, patient, disorder and service variables are known to have a significant impact on the recovery outcomes for patients undergoing psychological treatment in secondary care. The aim of this review is to establish which predictors have a significant impact on recovery from common mental health disorders in community settings.
   Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines to identify variables with a predictive power on psychological therapy outcomes. We searched databases using key words and MeSH terms and a strict scoring system and bias check were used.
   Results A total of 486 unique references were identified from the search. Overall, 19 papers met the inclusion criteria. These reported on a total of 34 778 patients from five countries in various community care settings. Predictive factors identified and found to be significant were initial severity and comorbid depression (11/19 studies), which negatively impacted outcome in all studies.
   Conclusions We identified key predictors for recovery in a community settings from five countries. The evidence currently available for this setting is limited, so this review serves as a starting point to highlight key factors that warrant further investigation.

AB  - Although a growing field, much is still unknown about how different clinical and social care services might improve outcomes for female victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) and their children who are indirectly exposed to it. This review sought to characterize the structure of programs that have been tested and documented in existing literature, and the mechanisms by which change, if any, may occur. Seventeen individual interventions and two follow-ups (n = 19) were included in the review. Findings suggest that a multileveled program of mothers and children working both separately and jointly together across sessions might generate the most successful psychosocial recovery for mothers and children who have experienced violence in the home. The mechanism by which this happens is likely a collaborative one, focused on enhancing the dyadic interaction. This article adds to the growing evidence base on IPV and confirms the positive impact on well-being that programs for IPV victims can have. The evidence-base overall could benefit from testing and replicating a combination of the results found in this review.

AB  - Context: Depression is a common problem during pregnancy. Depression has several adverse effects on the mother and infant.
   Evidence Acquisition: The present study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of depression in pregnant women in Iran. This study was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched the literature in the national and international databases, including Magiran, Barakat knowledge network system, SID, RICST, Iranian National Library, IranDoc, Scopus, PubMed, Elsevier (Science Direct, Embase, and Scopus), Web of Science (ISI), and Google Scholar using Persian and English (MeSH) keywords. Cochran's Q test and I-2 index were used to assess the heterogeneity between studies. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence using comparative meta-analysis software ver. 2.
   Results: Forty studies containing 15,870 Iranian pregnant women were included in the Meta-analysis. The heterogeneity of the studies was estimated to be high (I2 = 99.70%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of depression was estimated to be 41.22% (95% CI: 33.88 - 48.96). The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe depression was estimated to be 23.71% (95% CI: 16.39 - 33.01), 10.67% (95% CI: 7.02 - 15.98), and 4.30% (95% CI: 2.33 - 7.80), respectively. The lowest and highest depression prevalence was estimated in the West of Iran (34.41% [95% CI: 17.38 - 56.67]) and the South of Iran (51.69% [95% CI: 37.32 - 65.78]), respectively, and the test result for subgroup analysis was not significant (P = 0.60). Based on the subgroup analysis, the prevalence of depression in the first, second, and third trimester of pregnancy was estimated to be 50.52% (95% CI: 39.91 - 61.08), 44.96% (95% CI: 26.92 - 64.42), and 48.33% (95% CI: 36.64 - 60.20), respectively, and the test result for subgroup analysis was not significant (P = 0.11). Most of the studies (57.5%) used the Beck's questionnaire to survey the prevalence of depression in pregnant Iranian women and the prevalence of depression according to this questionnaire was estimated to be 45.84% (95% CI: 35.47 - 56.60).
   Conclusions: According to the high prevalence of depression in pregnant Iranian woman, identification and treatment of depression during pregnancy seem essential. Thus, program designing and implementation are recommended for improving the psychological health of pregnant women.

AB  - Major depressive disorder is a severe, refractory mental disorder. Only one third of patients treated with antidepressants achieve remission after 3 trials, while subject to adverse effects. Therefore, the investigation of alternative treatments is paramount. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the most recent evidence of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) intervention for the acute phase of major depressive disorder. A PubMed search was performed including the terms transcranial direct current stimulation OR transcranial direct stimulation OR tDCS AND major depressive disorder OR major depression OR depression AND trial. The search was conducted from inception until February 2018. Our search yielded initially 165 results, and 14 randomized clinical trials were included according to eligibility criteria. Most studies were pilot studies, with mixed findings. Two large randomized clinical trials recently published also presented primary negative findings. Study protocols usually used anodal left/cathodal right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation, 1 to 2.5 mA, and 5 to 20 tDCS sessions. We discuss the limitations of the included trials, such as sample and tDCS parameters heterogeneity between studies. To conclude, tDCS seems to be safe and devoid of serious adverse effects, although robust efficacy has not been consistently demonstrated in clinical trials assessing an acute treatment course of up to 4 weeks. Further directions are discussed, such as parameter individualization, investigation of biological markers, and home-use tDCS.

AB  - Given its associated burden of disease, climate change in South Africa could be reframed as predominately a health issue, one necessitating an urgent health-sector response. The growing impact of climate change has major implications for South Africa, especially for the numerous vulnerable groups in the country. We systematically reviewed the literature by searching PubMed and Web of Science. Of the 820 papers screened, 34 were identified that assessed the impacts of climate change on health in the country. Most papers covered effects of heat on health or on infectious diseases (20/34; 59%). We found that extreme weather events are the most noticeable effects to date, especially droughts in the Western Cape, but rises in vector-borne diseases are gaining prominence. Climate aberration is also linked in myriad ways with outbreaks of food and waterborne diseases, and possibly with the recent Listeria epidemic. The potential impacts of climate change on mental health may compound the multiple social stressors that already beset the populace. Climate change heightens the pre-existing vulnerabilities of women, fishing communities, rural subsistence farmers and those living in informal settlements. Further gender disparities, eco-migration and social disruptions may undermine the preventionbut also treatmentof HIV. Our findings suggest that focused research and effective use of surveillance data are required to monitor climate change's impacts; traditional strengths of the country's health sector. The health sector, hitherto a fringe player, should assume a greater leadership role in promoting policies that protect the public's health, address inequities and advance the country's commitments to climate change accords.

AB  - Feeding is fundamental for all heterotrophic organisms, providing the means to acquire energy for basic life processes. Recent studies have suggested that experimental ocean acidification (OA) can alter the feeding performance of marine calcifying invertebrates, but results have been inconsistent. While several reviews pertaining to the biological effects of OA exist, none provide a synthesis of OA effects on feeding performance. Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of published experiments testing for effects of elevated CO2 on feeding rates of marine calcifying invertebrates. Results revealed that suspension-feeding molluscs and predatory and grazing echinoderms experienced depressed feeding rates under elevated CO2, while arthropods appeared unaffected; larval and juvenile animals were more susceptible to CO2 effects than adults. Feeding strategy did not appear to influence the overall taxonomic trend, nor did habitat, although exposure time did have an effect. AIC model selection revealed that Phylum best predicted effect size; life stage and exposure time were also included in candidate models. Based on these results, we synthesize potential physiological attributes of different taxa that may drive OA sensitivities in feeding rates, which could potentially result in community-level impacts. We also discuss CO2 effects on calcifier feeding in the context of elevated temperature and other global marine change stressors, and highlight other areas for future research.

AB  - Purpose To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the strength of associations between social network size and clinical and functional outcomes in schizophrenia.
   Method Studies were identified from a systematic search of electronic databases (EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) from January 1970 to June 2016. Eligible studies included peer-reviewed English language articles that examined associations between a quantitative measure of network size and symptomatic and/or functional outcome in schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses.
   Results Our search yielded 16 studies with 1,929 participants. Meta-analyses using random effects models to calculate pooled effect sizes (Hedge's g) found that smaller social network size was moderately associated with more severe overall psychiatric symptoms (N = 5, n = 467, g = -0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.875, -0.184, p = 0.003) and negative symptoms (N = 8, n = 577, g = -0.75, 95% CI = -0.997, -0.512, p = 0.000). Statistical heterogeneity was observed I-2 = 63.04%; I-2 = 35.75%,) which could not be explained by low-quality network measures or sample heterogeneity in sensitivity analyses. There was no effect for positive symptoms (N = 7, n = 405, g = -0.19, 95% CI = 0.494, 0.110, p = 0.213) or social functioning (N = 3, n = 209, g = 0.36, 95% CI = -0.078, 0.801, p = 0.107). Narrative synthesis suggested that larger network size was associated with improved global functioning, but findings for affective symptoms and quality of life were mixed.
   Conclusion Psychosocial interventions which support individuals to build and maintain social networks may improve outcomes in schizophrenia. The review findings are cross-sectional and thus causal direction cannot be inferred. Further research is required to examine temporal associations between network characteristics and outcomes in schizophrenia and to test theoretical models relating to explanatory or mediating mechanisms.

AB  - As the number of migrants worldwide increases, it is worthwhile to examine the extent to which depression has affected this group of often vulnerable individuals. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the aggregate prevalence of depression among international migrants and to explore the variations in prevalence with demographic and educational factors. A search was conducted on the online databases PubMed and ScienceDirect whole using the terms depression, depressive disorder, immigration, immigrant, migration, and migrant. A total of 25 studies met our inclusion criteria. A random-effects model meta-analysis calculated an aggregate prevalence of 15.6% among migrants. Heterogeneity was identified by meta-regression and subgroup analyses, and the level of educational attainment, employment status, and length of residency spent in country of migration were found to be significant moderators contributing to depression prevalence. In conclusion, newly arrived migrants appear to be susceptible to developing depression and it is imperative that more in the form of preventive strategies and increased assistance be incorporated to ensure their psychological wellbeing and improve their mental health outcomes. Further research should be conducted to better understand the risk of psychiatric disorders among members of this subpopulation.

AB  - Studies on processing of emotional faces in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have shown mixed findings. The goal of this systematic review was to investigate brain electrical responses to emotional facial expressions in individuals with ASD. We conducted a literature search of nine databases and grey literature sources up to Jan 2017, resulting in 943 studies. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, with quality assessments varying from three to six out of 10. This systematic review demonstrates that individuals with ASD show a lack of sensitivity to different emotional expressions, especially fear, compared to their peers. Atypical brain responses in processing emotional faces may reflect the abnormalities in visual perception and information processing that are present early in life.

AB  - ObjectivesMany studies indicate that bipolar disorders are underdiagnosed. Yet from 2007 to 2008, a series of publications asserted that bipolar disorders were being overdiagnosed. This review examines the methods used in the studies that reported bipolar disorders were being overdiagnosed.
   MethodsA literature search for studies with original data related to overdiagnosis of bipolar disorders was performed.
   ResultsFour studies were found indicating bipolar disorders were being overdiagnosed. The Structured Clinical Interview of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID) was used in the diagnostic process. The studies compared the clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder to a single SCID interview without interviewing family or reviewing old records. The studies assumed the SCID diagnosis was correct.
   ConclusionsNumerous concerns were found. The SCID frequently missed diagnosis of bipolar, the definitions of bipolar disorder are so narrow and conservative that the outcomes of the studies may have been predetermined. Ultimately, the studies compared the strength of a diagnosis made by a treating psychiatrist to a SCID diagnosis collected with virtually no information from the clinician. The assumption that the SCID diagnosis is always correct and the clinician is always wrong is unsupportable. The premise that bipolar disorders are being overdiagnosed is unsupported by reasonable science.

AB  - Low self-esteem is a feature of several mental health disorders that has been directly treated with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The aim of our study was to determine the efficacy of interventions for improving low self-esteem in adults by utilizing the model outlined in Fennell (1997; 1998; 1999). A literature search identified 8 studies that met the inclusion criteria of CBT-based interventions for low self-esteem using this model, 7 of which were used in a quantitative synthesis. These studies included weekly group and individual sessions and one-day workshop formats. Summary effect sizes of 1.12 and 0.34 at post-treatment were observed, with low levels of heterogeneity, for weekly sessions and one-day workshops, respectively. Comparable results were found for the reduction of depressive symptoms. Results suggest that CBT-based interventions may be efficacious for treating individuals with low self-esteem, according to changes in self-report measures; however, it is unclear whether these interventions are dissimilar to those aimed at reducing depression.

AB  - Network analysis (NA) is an emerging methodology that allows for the characterization of maintaining symptoms and pathways among symptoms of mental disorders. The current paper provides background on NA and discusses the relevance of the network approach for the conceptualization of eating disorders (ED).
   We review the burgeoning literature conceptualizing ED from a network approach. Overall, these papers find that fear of weight gain and overvaluation of weight and shape are core symptoms in networks of ED pathology. We integrate literature on new advances in network methodology (e.g., within-person NA) and the clinical relevance of these approaches for the ED field (e.g., personalized ED treatment). We also provide several considerations (e.g., replicability, sample size, and node (item) selection) for researchers who are interested in using network science and recommend several emerging "best practices" for NA.
   Finally, we highlight novel applications of NA, specifically the ability to identify within-person maintaining symptoms, and the potential treatment implications for ED that network methods may hold. Overall, NA is a new methodology that holds significant promise for new treatment development in the ED field.

AB  - Objective: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether the risk of psychosis is higher in past or future episodes in patients with major depression with psychotic features than in patients with nonpsychotic depression.
   Method: PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched, and studies were selected that 1) identified patients with unipolar major depression, 2) made diagnoses of psychosis based on the presence of delusions or hallucinations, 3) characterized past or subsequent episodes as psychotic or nonpsychotic, and 4) were published in English. Two metaanalyses were then conducted using data from patients having index depressive episodes with or without psychosis at study entry to determine the risk of any prior or subsequent psychotic episode and the risk of psychosis in all episodes.
   Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, and altogether they included 546 psychotic and 1,583 nonpsychotic patients with unipolar depression. In seven of the studies, the risk ratio for a prior or subsequent psychotic episode in patients whose index depressive episode was psychotic compared with those whose index episode was nonpsychotic was 9.98 (95% CI=4.75, 20.94). In eight studies, the risk ratio for psychosis among all episodes of depression in the subgroups with psychotic and nonpsychotic index episodes was 7.24 (95% CI=5.03, 10.43). Differences in risk of psychosisbetween these subgroups remained robust when potential sources of heterogeneity were explored.
   Conclusions: The findings support the hypothesis that psychotic depression runs true to form, and they support the distinction between psychotic and nonpsychotic depression. Because patients with psychotic depression are at high risk for psychosis in future episodes, determination of effective preventive treatments is imperative.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating, progressive and neurodegenerative disease. A disturbance on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can be observed in patients with MS, showing altered cortisol levels. We aimed to identify basal cortisol levels and verify the relationship with clinical symptoms in patients with MS. A systematic search was conducted in the databases: Pubmed, Web of Science and SCOPUS. Both higher and lower cortisol levels were associated with MS. Higher cortisol levels were associated with depression and anxiety, while lower levels were associated with depression, fatigue and urinary dysfunction. Higher cortisol levels may be associated with the progression and severity of MS.

AB  - Receiving a mental health diagnosis can be pivotal for service users, and it has been described in both positive and negative terms. What influences service-user experience of the diagnostic process is unclear; consequently, clinicians report uncertainty regarding best practice. This Review aims to understand and inform diagnostic practice through a comprehensive synthesis of qualitative data on views and experiences from key stakeholders (service users, clinicians, carers, and family). We searched five databases and identified 78 papers for inclusion, originating from 13 countries and including 2228 participants. Eligible papers were assessed for quality, and data were coded and then developed into themes, which generated a model representing factors to consider for clinicians conveying, and individuals receiving, mental health diagnoses. Themes included disclosure, information provision, collaboration, timing, stigma, and functional value of diagnosis for recovery. Variations between different stakeholders and clinical contexts are explored. Findings support an individualised, collaborative, and holistic approach to mental health diagnosis.

AB  - This review aims to examine the prevalence and incidence of postpartum depression among healthy mothers without prior history of depression including postpartum depression and who gave birth to healthy full-term infants. A systematic search of ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PubMed was performed for English articles from the inception of the database to November 2017, as well as a manual search of the reference lists of the included articles, and an expert panel was consulted. Across 15,895 articles, 58 articles (N = 37,294 women) were included in the review. The incidence of postpartum depression was 12% [95% CI 0.04-0.20] while the overall prevalence of depression was 17% [95% CI 0.15-0.20] among healthy mothers without a prior history of depression. Prevalence was similar regardless of the type of diagnostic tool used; however, there were statistical differences in the prevalence between different geographical regions, with the Middle-East having the highest prevalence (26%, 95% CI 0.13-0.39) and Europe having the lowest (8%, 95% CI 0.05-0.11). There was no statistical difference in prevalence between different screening time points, but an increasing prevalence was observed beyond six months postpartum. Intervention studies often neglect healthy mothers. This review reports a similar prevalence rate of postpartum depression among mothers without history of depression when compared to mothers with history of depression. Thus, future studies should place equal emphasis on this neglected group of mothers so that targeted interventions and follow-ups can be introduced at appropriate time points.

AB  - Background: The habenula is a small, mostly underrated structure in the pineal region. Multidisciplinary findings demonstrate an underlying complex connectivity of the habenula with the rest of the brain, sub serving its major role in normal behavior and the pathophysiology of depression. These findings suggest the potential application of "habenular psychosurgery" in the treatment of mental disorders.
   Objective/Hypothesis: The remission of two patients with treatment-resistant major depression treated with deep brain stimulation of the habenula supported the hypothesis that the habenula is an effective target for deep brain stimulation and initiated a surge of basic science research. This review aims to assess the viability of the deep brain stimulation of the habenula as a treatment option for treatment resistant depression.
   Methods: PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases were searched with no chronological restrictions for the identification of relevant articles.
   Results: The results of this review are presented in a narrative form describing the functional neuroanatomy of the human habenula, its implications in major depression, findings of electrode implantation of this region and findings of deep brain stimulation of the habenula for the treatment of depression.
   Conclusion: Data assessing the hypothesis are scarce. Nonetheless, findings highlight the major role of the habenula in normal, as well as in pathological brain function, particularly in depression disorders. Moreover, findings of studies utilizing electrode implantation in the region of the habenula underscore our growing realization that research in neuroscience and deep brain stimulation complement each other in a reciprocal relationship; they are as self-reliant, as much as they depend on each other.

   MethodThe MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from inception to March 21st, 2018. International guidelines covering the treatment of mixed episodes, manic/hypomanic, or depressive episodes with mixed features were considered for inclusion. A methodological quality assessment was conducted with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-AGREE II.
   ResultsThe final selection yielded six articles. Despite their heterogeneity, all guidelines agreed in interrupting an antidepressant monotherapy or adding mood-stabilizing medications. Olanzapine seemed to have the best evidence for acute mixed hypo/manic/depressive states and maintenance treatment. Aripiprazole and paliperidone were possible alternatives for acute hypo/manic mixed states. Lurasidone and ziprasidone were useful in acute mixed depression. Valproate was recommended for the prevention of new mixed episodes while lithium and quetiapine in preventing affective episodes of all polarities. Clozapine and electroconvulsive therapy were effective in refractory mixed episodes. The AGREE II overall assessment rate ranged between 42% and 92%, indicating different quality level of included guidelines.
   ConclusionThe unmet needs for the mixed symptoms treatment were associated with diagnostic issues and limitations of previous research, particularly for maintenance treatment.

AB  - Apathy is a common problem after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can have a major impact on cognitive function, psychosocial outcome and engagement in rehabilitation. For scientists and clinicians it remains one of the least understood aspects of brain-behaviour relationships encompassing disturbances of cognition, motivation, emotion and action, and is variously an indication of organic brain disease or psychiatric disorder. Apathy can be both sign and symptom and has been proposed as a diagnosis in its own right as well as a secondary feature of other conditions. This review considers previous approaches to apathy in terms of relevant psychological constructs and those neural counterparts most likely to be implicated after TBI. Neurobehavioural disorders of apathy are characterised chiefly by dysfunction of executive control of goal-oriented behaviour or the neural substrates of reward-based and emotional learning. We argue that it is possible to distinguish a primary disorder of apathy as an organic neurobehavioural state from secondary presentations due to an impoverished environment or psychological disturbance which has implications for treatment.

AB  - Background: Mental health has not had the same public profile as physical health. This has contributed to the stigma associated with mental illness and to its treatments. Research investigating how the traditions and values amongst those with an Arab heritage contribute to stigmatizing beliefs, attitudes or actions in the provision of mental healthcare has not been widely reported.
   Aim: To systematically review the literature and summarize the findings of studies reporting stigmatizing beliefs, actions and attitudes toward treatment of people with mental illness in the Arab population.
   Methods: PubMed, Ovid, Psycharticles and Embase were used to identify original studies of non-institutionalized Arab adults or children reporting findings relevant to stigma toward mental illness. A manual search of the bibliography of all selected original studies was also undertaken. Independent data extraction was performed by two reviewers, who then met to compare data and reach consensus. Findings were classified as stigmatizing beliefs, actions or attitudes toward mental health treatments.
   Results: A total of 33 articles were retrieved for full review. Those utilizing qualitative methodology provided insight into the many ways mental illness is viewed and defined among those with an Arab heritage. Among the studies using quantitative methodology, most compared stigmatizing beliefs, attitudes toward mental health treatments or stigmatizing actions among different Arab populations, some also investigated correlations between characteristics of the Arab population tested with stigmatizing beliefs, actions and attitudes toward mental health treatments. Findings from studies undertaken in Qatar reported greater stigmatizing beliefs, actions or attitudes toward mental health treatments among Qatari versus non-Qatari Arabs.
   Conclusion: A large diversity in the stigmatizing beliefs, actions and attitudes toward treatment of mental illness within the Arab population were identified. The influence of cultural variations on stigma should be explored further and used to tailor anti-stigma interventions in this population.

AB  - Lithium has long been used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, due to its robust beneficial effect as a mood stabilizing drug. Lithium's effectiveness for improving neurological function is therefore well-described, stimulating the investigation of its potential use in several neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD) and Huntington's (HD) diseases. A narrow therapeutic window for these effects, however, has led to concerted efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms of lithium action in the brain, in order to develop more selective treatments that harness its neuroprotective potential whilst limiting contraindications. Animal models have proven pivotal in these studies, with lithium displaying advantageous effects on behavior across species, including worms (C. elegans), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and rodents. Due to their susceptibility to genetic manipulation, functional genomic analyses in these model organisms have provided evidence for the main molecular determinants of lithium action, including inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPA) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Accumulating pre-clinical evidence has indeed provided a basis for research into the therapeutic use of lithium for the treatment of dementia, an area of medical priority due to its increasing global impact and lack of disease-modifying drugs. Although lithium has been extensively described to prevent AD-associated amyloid and tau pathologies, this review article will focus on generic mechanisms by which lithium preserves neuronal function and improves memory in animal models of dementia. Of these, evidence from worms, flies and mice points to GSK-3 as the most robust mediator of lithium's neuro-protective effect, but it's interaction with downstream pathways, including Wnt/beta-catenin, CREB/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF kappa B), have identified multiple targets for development of drugs which harness lithium's neurogenic, cytoprotective, synaptic maintenance, anti-oxidant, antiinflammatory and protein homeostasis properties, in addition to more potent and selective GSK-3 inhibitors. Lithium, therefore, has advantages as a multi-functional therapy to combat the complex molecular pathology of dementia. Animal studies will be vital, however, for comparative analyses to determine which of these defense mechanisms are most required to slow-down cognitive decline in dementia, and whether combination therapies can synergize systems to exploit lithium's neuro-protective power while avoiding deleterious toxicity.

AB  - Background: The insula is one of the most researched brain regions with many highly cited papers. However, unlike the literature of other fields, there is currently no study that has identified the 100 most cited papers within the literature of the insula. The aim of the current study was to fill in the knowledge gap by determining which publications concerning the insula have been cited most often, who contributed to them, and what topics they were dealing with.
   Methods: The Web of Science online database was searched to identify the 100 most cited publications mentioning the insular cortex in their titles, abstracts or keywords. To systematically exclude irrelevant publications, the search strategy was finalized as: TS = (insula OR insular OR "island of Reil") NOT TS = ("insular biogeography" OR "insular mammal*" OR "*insular lymphatic*") NOT WC = ("Geochemistry and Geophysics" OR "Ecology"). The identified publications were sorted in descending order of citation count. The 100 most cited publications concerning the insula of the brain were identified and their bibliometric data was extracted and assessed. The VOSviewer software was used with default parameters to generate a bubble map that analyzes and visualizes the words/phrases used in the titles and abstracts of the publications.
   Results: There were 67 articles on experiments/lab studies and 33 meta-analyses/reviews but no opinion or methods paper. They had an average of 943.4 citations (or 62.9 citations per year), 93.5 references and 13.4 pages. There were 35 papers published in open access. USA was the major contributing country. The most top-ranked publications were concerning emotion, salience and pain.
   Conclusion: Two-thirds of the publications concerned the normal brain function/mechanism (n = 67), whereas 20 publications concerned disease/therapeutic intervention and another 13 concerned normal anatomy. For the 67 original articles, 57 used human subjects whereas 10 used animal models. MRI was the commonest modality (n = 37), followed by PET (n = 16). Nine articles investigated by histology, two by multiple modalities and three by other modality.

AB  - Background: Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder among people living with HIV (PLWHIV) and is associated with poor quality of life, additional comorbidities, disability, unemployment, poorer therapeutic outcomes and risky behaviors. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to systematically summarize empirical evidence and to formulate recommendations for future research.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and relevant literature for possible studies to include. A qualitative and quantitative analysis was undertaken for this systematic review. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were performed. Cochran's Q- and the I-2 test were used to assess heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias was evaluated by using Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots.
   Results: Of 283 titles initially identified, 81 abstracts were eligible for review. Of these, 46 articles qualified for full text review and 19 were retained. In our meta-analysis the pooled prevalence of depression in PLWHIV was 38% (95% CI 29.30-47.54). The pooled prevalence estimates of depression was 49.79% in Ethiopia and 30.88% in Uganda. In addition, the prevalence of depression was 12.40% and 46% as measured by diagnostic and screening instrument respectively. Our qualitative synthesis showed that factors such as having opportunistic infection, perceived stigma, negative life event, WHO clinical staging of disease, hospitalization in the past one month, stressful life events, food insecurity, self-efficacy, missed frequency of clinic visit, frequency of follow-up, older age, low income, urban residence and being government employee were strongly and significantly associated with depression in PLWHIV in east Africa.
   Conclusion: The pooled prevalence estimates of prevalence of depression in PLWHIV was 38%. The prevalence estimates of depression in PLWHIV in Ethiopia was significantly higher than Uganda. In addition the prevalence of depression was significantly higher in studies conducted by screening than diagnostic instrument. Routine screening and integrated management of depression into the existing HIV care services is warranted. Validation and use of standard instrument to assess depression in PLWHIV is needed. Moreover, longitudinal and community based studies focusing on incidence and determinates of depression in PLWHIV are recommended.

AB  - Microtubule stabilizing agents are among the most clinically useful chemotherapeutic drugs. Mostly, they act to stabilize microtubules and inhibit cell division. While not without side effects, new generations of these compounds display improved pharmacokinetic properties and brain penetrance. Neurological disorders are intrinsically associated with microtubule defects, and efforts to reposition microtubule-targeting chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric illnesses are underway. Here we catalog microtubule regulators that are associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schizophrenia and mood disorders. We outline the classes of microtubule stabilizing agents used for cancer treatment, their brain penetrance properties and neuropathy side effects, and describe efforts to apply these agents for treatment of brain disorders. Finally, we summarize the current state of clinical trials for microtubule stabilizing agents under evaluation for central nervous system disorders.

AB  - Background: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a prevalent subtype of early life stress associated with changes in immunological and neuroendocrine systems leading to inflammatory responses of the organism and increasing several inflammatory and immune markers. We aimed to conduct a systematic review concerning the association between CSA and indicators of immune activity.
   Methods: We conducted a search for articles in PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, using the key words: ("Child sexual abuse" OR "childhood maltreatment" OR "sexual violence" OR "posttraumatic stress disorder" OR "rape") AND ("cytokines" OR "inflammatory markers" OR "interleukin" OR "tumor necrosis factor" OR "C-reactive protein"). PRISMA guidelines were used in order to improve the quality of this research, and MeSH terms were used in PubMed.
   Results: A total of 3,583 studies were found and, after application of the exclusion criteria, 17 studies were included in this review. Most studies reported an increase of inflammatory activity associated with the presence of early abuse. IL-6, TNF-alpha, and C-reactive protein were the most frequently analyzed markers and some studies showed higher levels in individuals that suffered CSA compared with controls, although the results were heterogeneous, as was the assessment of CSA, repeated trauma, and time of occurrence. It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis because the results were diversified.
   Conclusion: CSA is associated with changes in inflammatory markers levels. Improving the assessment of subtypes of trauma is important to further understand the complex correlations of CSA and its biological consequences such as psychiatric and physical illness in later life.

AB  - Over recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) has emerged as an alternative communication system between the human brain and an output device. Deciphered intents, after detecting electrical signals from the human scalp, are translated into control commands used to operate external devices, computer displays and virtual objects in the real-time. BCI provides an augmentative communication by creating a muscle-free channel between the brain and the output devices, primarily for subjects having neuromotor disorders, or trauma to nervous system, notably spinal cord injuries (SCI), and subjects with unaffected sensorimotor functions but disarticulated or amputated residual limbs. This review identifies the potentials of electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI applications for locomotion and mobility rehabilitation. Patients could benefit from its advancements such as wearable lower-limb (LL) exoskeletons, orthosis, prosthesis, wheelchairs, and assistive-robot devices. The EEG communication signals employed by the aforementioned applications that also provide feasibility for future development in the field are sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), event-related potentials (ERP) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). The review is an effort to progress the development of user's mental task related to LL for BCI reliability and confidence measures. As a novel contribution, the reviewed BCI control paradigms for wearable LL and assistive-robots are presented by a general control framework fitting in hierarchical layers. It reflects informatic interactions, between the user, the BCI operator, the shared controller, the robotic device and the environment. Each sub layer of the BCI operator is discussed in detail, highlighting the feature extraction, classification and execution methods employed by the various systems. All applications' key features and their interaction with the environment are reviewed for the EEG-based activity mode recognition, and presented in form of a table. It is suggested to structure EEG-BCI controlled LL assistive devices within the presented framework, for future generation of intent-based multifunctional controllers. Despite the development of controllers, for BCI-based wearable or assistive devices that can seamlessly integrate user intent, practical challenges associated with such systems exist and have been discerned, which can be constructive for future developments in the field.

AB  - Background: Childhood trauma subtypes sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional maltreatment, and neglect may have differential effects on the brain that persist into adulthood. A systematic review of neuroimaging findings supporting these differential effects is as yet lacking.
   Objectives: The present systematic review aims to summarize the findings of controlled neuroimaging trials regarding long-term differential effects of trauma subtypes on the human brain.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed and PsycINFO databases from January 2017 up to and including January 2018. Additional papers were identified by a manual search in the reference lists of selected papers and of relevant review articles retrieved by the initial database search. Studies were then assessed for eligibility by the first author. Only original human studies directly comparing neuroimaging findings of exposed and unexposed individuals to well-defined emotional, physical or sexual childhood maltreatment while controlling for the effects of other subtypes were included. A visual summary of extracted data was made for neuroimaging modalities for which comparison between trauma subtypes was feasible, taking the studies' numbers and sample sizes into account.
   Results: The systematic literature search yielded 25 publications. Sexual abuse was associated with structural deficits in the reward circuit and genitosensory cortex and amygdalar hyperreactivity during sad autobiographic memory recall. Emotional maltreatment correlated with abnormalities in fronto-limbic socioemotional networks. In neglected individuals, white matter integrity and connectivity were disturbed in several brain networks involved in a variety of functions. Other abnormalities, such as reduced frontal cortical volume, were common to all maltreatment types.
   Conclusions: There is some evidence for long-term differential effects of trauma subtypes on the human brain. The observed alterations may result from both protective adaptation of and damage to the brain following exposure to threatening life events. Though promising, the current evidence is incomplete, with few brain regions and neuroimaging modalities having been investigated in all subtypes. The comparability of the available evidence is further limited by the heterogeneity of study populations regarding gender, age and comorbid psychopathology. Future neuroimaging studies should take this potentially differential role of childhood trauma subtypes into account.

AB  - Background: Exercise referral schemes within clinical populations may offer benefits for inactive and sedentary individuals, and improve and aid treatment of specific health disorders. This systematic review aims to provide an overview, and examine the impact, of exercise referral schemes in patients with cardiovascular, mental health, and musculoskeletal disorders. This review focuses on populations within the United Kingdom (UK) only, with an aim to inform national exercise referral policies and guidelines.
   Method: Data was collected from specific sources using validated methodology through PRISMA. Systematic searches were performed using Locate, PubMed, Scopus and Pro Quest: Public Health databases. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria set for each sub group. This included that all studies aimed to prevent, observe, or decrease ill-health relating to the disorder, participants over the age of sixteen, and health disorders and outcomes were reviewed. All studies were conducted in the UK only.
   Results: In the 13 articles, a variety of modes and types of exercise were utilised. One-to-one supervised exercise sessions based in a gym environment were most frequently employed. Results showed that longer length schemes (20+ weeks) produced better health outcomes, and had higher adherence to physical activity prescribed, than those of shorter length (8-12 weeks). In patients referred with cardiovascular disorders, cardiovascular-related measures showed significant decreases including blood pressure. Schemes increased physical activity levels over the length of scheme for all disorders.
   Conclusion: Longer length schemes (20+ weeks) improved adherence to physical activity prescribed over the course of the scheme, and could support longer term exercise adherence upon completion, however additional research on larger samples should examine this further. An implication is that schemes currently recommended in guidelines do not tailor programmes to support long term adherence to exercise, which must be addressed. There is currently a lack of research examining programmes tailored to suit the individual's health conditions thus further research might allow providers to tailor delivery and build upon policy recommendations in the UK.

AB  - Objective: To summarize findings of previous studies on the prevalence of trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Conduct Disorder (CD).
   Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines. EBSCO-host, PubMed, CDSR and ARIF databases were searched in October 2016, employing relevant keywords.
   Results: 19 studies met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis resulted in a lifetime PTSD prevalence of 11% (95% CI: 7-17%) in children and adolescents with CD, 14% (95% CI: 12-15%) in adults with pre-existing CD and 32% (95% CI: 25-40%) in juvenile offenders with CD. Higher lifetime PTSD prevalence was observed in individuals with than without CD, and in females compared to males with CD.
   Conclusions: Studies focusing on the association of trauma, PTSD and CD are still relatively rare. Possible comorbidity models are discussed considering psychological and biological risk factors in a comprehensive model. The high rate of PTSD in CD may be due to shared risk factors; furthermore, CD might increase the risk for comorbid PTSD due to CD inherent risk taking behavior. To study pathways of risk, especially longitudinal studies are necessary. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - Vividness
KW  - COGNITION
KW  - OBJECT
AB  - Visualization is defined as the production of mental images in the process of reading (Esrock 2005: 633). This article is concerned with varieties of visualization during an absorbing reading of a fictional narrative, the mental images that range from an indistinct and largely automatic default visualization to the much more vivid images that occur at significant stages in the narrative. Neuroscientific studies of vision have collected a large and impressively varied body of experimental evidence for two major processing streams the dorsal and the ventral-specialized for vision-for-action and vision for-perception respectively. Further experiments distinguish different dispositional specializations: visualizers with a high spatial visualizing ability demonstrating a more efficient use of resources in the dorsal pathway, and those with a high object visualization and more efficient use of the ventral pathway (Kozhevnikov et al., 2010: 29). We can assume that both types of mental processing will be prompted in fictional narratives with differences in prominence depending on their authors' inclinations and the design and purpose of the narrative text. According to Amedeo D'Angiulli (2013: 7), who conducted elaborate tests of vividness in mental imagery using written descriptive passages as stimulus, dynamic imagery was significantly less vivid than static imagery. These results confirm traditional literary criticism based on introspection which argues that detailed description of static objects elicits an especially lively imagination. However, narratives can provoke even stronger visualizations by rendering subjective moments of seeing in which a fictional character is emotionally involved. In encouraging readers to shift now and then from the default mode of motion-oriented visualizing to a more affective and more conscious object visualization, literary fictions exercise their power to evoke imaginings that one would not generate by oneself. This may indicate that literary narratives can prove a training ground for expanding one's visualizing capacities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: A new model of radicalisation has appeared in Western countries since the 2010s. Radical groups are smaller, less hierarchical and are mainly composed of young, homegrown individuals. The aim of this review is to decipher the profiles of the European adolescents and young adults who have embraced the cause of radical Islamism and to define the role of psychiatry in dealing with this issue.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search in several databases from January 2010 to July 2017 and reviewed the relevant studies that included European adolescents and/or young adults and presented empirical data.
   Results: In total, 22 qualitative and quantitative studies were reviewed from various fields and using different methodologies. Psychotic disorders are rare among radicalised youths. However, they show numerous risk factors common with adolescent psychopathologies. We develop a comprehensive three-level model to explain the phenomenon of radicalisation among young Europeans: (1) individual risk factors include psychological vulnerabilities such as early experiences of abandonment, perceived injustice and personal uncertainty; (2) micro-environmental risk factors include family dysfunction and friendships with radicalised individuals; (3) societal risk factors include geopolitical events and societal changes such as Durkheim's concept of anomie. Some systemic factors are also implicated as there is a specific encounter between recruiters and the individual. The former use sectarian techniques to isolate and dehumanise the latter and to offer him a new societal model.
   Conclusion: There are many similarities between psychopathological manifestations of adolescence and mechanisms at stake during the radicalisation process. As a consequence, and despite the rarity of psychotic disorders, mental health professionals have a role to play in the treatment and understanding of radical engagement among European youth. Studies with empirical data are limited, and more research should be promoted (in particular in females and in non-Muslim communities) to better understand the phenomenon and to propose recommendations for prevention and treatment.

AB  - Background: The circadian rhythm regulation plays a crucial role in people` s healthy lives affected by factors consisting of cosmic events related to the universe and earth, environmental factors (light, night and day duration, seasons) and lifestyles. These factors changes lead to disturbance of circadian rhythm and it causes increasing the incidence of mental diseases like depression and physiological problems like cancers, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
   Methods: The present review searched Elsevier, SID, Pub Med, Springer, and Google Scholar databases for relevant articles were published between 1996 and 2017. Keywords used included lifestyle, circadian rhythm, cancer, metabolic diseases and cosmic factors.
   Results: Circadian rhythm can be affected by lifestyle, heredity, cosmos spin and seasonal factors. Two first factors have physically direct effects on circadian rhythm and health, while other factors influence on them mentally. After all, all of them lead to cancer, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic obesity.
   Conclusion: Although environmental factors are universal events which are unrelated to human control but affect human` s body and circadian rhythm. Other factors are manageable by human to prevent disturbance of circadian rhythm making physical disorders.

AB  - Background: Accurate monitoring of population health is essential to ensure proper recovery after earthquakes. We aimed to summarize the findings and features of postearthquake epidemiological studies conducted in high-income countries and to prompt the development of future surveillance plans.
   Methods: Medline, Scopus and six sources of grey literature were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria were: observational study conducted in high-income countries with at least one comparison group of unexposed participants, and measurement of health outcomes at least 1 month after the earthquake.
   Results: A total of 52 articles were included, assessing the effects of 13 earthquakes that occurred in eight countries. Most studies: had a time-series (33%) or cross-sectional (29%) design; included temporal comparison groups (63%); used routine data (58%); and focused on patient subgroups rather than the whole population (65%). Individuals exposed to earthquakes had: 2% higher all-cause mortality rates [95% confidence interval (CI), 1% to 3%]; 36% (95% CI, 19% to 57%) and 37% (95% CI, 29% to 46%) greater mortality rates from myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively; and 0.16 higher mean percent points of glycated haemoglobin (95% CI, 0.07% to 0.25% points). There was no evidence of earthquake effects for blood pressure, body mass index or lipid biomarkers.
   Conclusions: A more regular and coordinated use of large and routinely collected datasets would benefit post-earthquake epidemiological surveillance. Whenever possible, a cohort design with geographical and temporal comparison groups should be used, and both communicable and non-communicable diseases should be assessed. Postearthquake epidemiological surveillance should also capture the impact of seismic events on the access to and use of health care services.

AB  - Aggressive behavior is often core or comorbid to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Transgenic animal models are commonly used to study the neurobiological mechanisms underlying aggressive phenotypes and have led to new insights into aggression. This systematic review critically evaluates the available literature on transgenic animal models tested for aggression with the resident-intruder test. By combining the available literature on this topic, we sought to highlight effective methods for laboratory aggression testing and provide recommendations for study design as well as aggression induction and measurement in rodents that are translational to humans, taking into consideration possible confounding factors. In addition, we built a molecular landscape of interactions between the proteins encoded by the aggression-linked genes from our systematic search. Some molecular pathways within this landscape overlap with psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and the landscapes point towards a number of putative (drug) targets for aggression that need to be validated in future studies.

AB  - Background: Nursing is not just task-based work, but also emotional work. Nurses are also obliged to satisfy patients emotional needs, which often results in burnout and depression. We aimed to propose an effective method for reducing their emotional burden.
   Methods: We took theoretical measure to verify some theories on emotion and emotional labor.
   Results: Empathy can be enhanced by reading literature. It has been recognized from ancient times that reading is an empathic experience in its very essence. Reading is not possible without the reader identifying and sympathizing with the character in the story.
   Conclusion: Reading literature is not only an efficient means of enhancing empathy, but also very practical to implement. Among programs that proved efficient are role exchange programs, here-and-now spontaneity, perspective taking, simulation exercises, and so on. The problem with them is that they require special facilities and equipment. If they are not available, reading practice would be the best alternative.

AB  - The development of depression may involve a complex interplay of environmental and genetic risk factors. PubMed and Psyclnfo databases were searched from inception through August 3, 2017, to identify meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies of environmental risk factors associated with depression. For each eligible meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size and its 95% confidence interval (CI) by random effects modeling, the 95% prediction interval, heterogeneity with I-2, and evidence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. Seventy meta-analytic reviews met the eligibility criteria and provided 134 meta analyses for associations from 1283 primary studies. While 109 associations were nominally significant (P < 0.05), only 8 met the criteria for convincing evidence and, when limited to prospective studies, convincing evidence was found in 6 (widowhood, physical abuse during childhood, obesity, having 4-5 metabolic risk factors, sexual dysfunction, job strain). In studies in which depression was assessed through a structured diagnostic interview, only associations with widowhood, job strain, and being a Gulf War veteran were supported by convincing evidence. Additionally, 8 MR studies were included and provided no consistent evidence for the causal effects of obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The proportion of variance explained by genetic risk factors was extremely small (0.1-0.4%), which limited the evidence provided by the MR studies. Our findings suggest that despite the large number of putative risk factors investigated in the literature, few associations were supported by robust evidence. The current findings may have clinical and research implications for the early identification of individuals at risk for depression.

AB  - Major depression is the most frequent morbidity in pregnancy. The first-line therapies, psychopharmacologic treatment and psychotherapy, are either insufficient or may cause severe or teratogenic adverse events. As a result of its local limitation to the patient's brain, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could potentially be an ideal treatment for pregnant women with depression. A literature search was conducted in medical databases, globally published newspapers, search engines, and clinical trial registers to collect all articles on tDCS for the treatment of depression during pregnancy. The aim of this review was to investigate the scientific evidence of tDCS use for depression during pregnancy and to compare these results with the textual and emotional perception in the media as interventions during pregnancy are under particular surveillance. We detected 13 medical articles dealing with tDCS for depression in pregnancy. Overall, the scientific evidence as well as articles in the media for tDCS in pregnancy are sparse, but promising. Further studies are required in this specifically vulnerable population of pregnant women to generate evidence. It is likely that public interest will increase when the results of a pilot study in Canada are published.

AB  - According to the cognitive-behavioral model, illness anxiety is developed and maintained through biased processing of health-threatening information and maladaptive responses to such information. Objective: This study is a systematic review of research that attempted to validate central tenets of the cognitive-behavioral model regarding etiological and maintenance mechanisms in illness anxiety.
   Methods: Sixty-two studies, including correlational and experimental designs, were identified through a systematic search of databases and were evaluated for their quality.
   Results: Outcomes were synthesized following a qualitative thematic approach under categories of theoretically driven mechanisms derived from the cognitive-behavioral model: attention, memory and interpretation biases, perceived awareness and inaccuracy in perception of somatic sensations, negativity bias, emotion dysregulation, and behavioral avoidance.
   Conclusions: Findings partly support the cognitive-behavioral model, but several of its hypothetical mechanisms only receive weak support due to the scarcity of relevant studies. Directions for future research are suggested based on identified gaps in the existing literature.

AB  - Brain photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy using red to near-infrared (NIR) light is an innovative treatment for a wide range of neurological and psychological conditions. Red/NIR light is able to stimulate complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (cytochrome c oxidase) and increase ATP synthesis. Moreover, light absorption by ion channels results in release of Ca2+ and leads to activation of transcription factors and gene expression. Brain PBM therapy enhances the metabolic capacity of neurons and stimulates anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant responses, as well as neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Its therapeutic role in disorders such as dementia and Parkinson's disease, as well as to treat stroke, brain trauma, and depression has gained increasing interest. In the transcranial PBM approach, delivering a sufficient dose to achieve optimal stimulation is challenging due to exponential attenuation of light penetration in tissue. Alternative approaches such as intracranial and intranasal light delivery methods have been suggested to overcome this limitation. This article reviews the state-of-the-art preclinical and clinical evidence regarding the efficacy of brain PBM therapy.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe the mental health effects of high ambient temperatures and heat waves, determine whether heat-related morbidity and mortality are increased among people with known mental disorders and identify knowledge gaps to inform targeting of future research.
   Study design: Systematic literature review and narrative synthesis.
   Methods: A systematic review of published literature using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO without geographical or temporal limits was conducted. We included studies that explicitly linked high ambient temperatures and/or heat waves to mental health outcomes. Evidence was graded using a National Institute of Health framework.
   Results: A total of 35 studies were included in the review, among which 34 were observational studies and one was a case-control study. Six broad mental health outcome categories were identified: suicide and heat; bipolar disorder, mania and depression and heat; schizophrenia and heat; organic mental health outcomes and heat including dementia; alcohol and substance misuse and heat; and multiple mental health outcomes/mental health service usage and heat. The studies included were heterogeneous in terms of study design, population, setting, exposure measures, outcomes and location making meta-analysis unfeasible. Fifteen studies showed an increased suicide risk with heat (relative risk [RR] 1.014-1.37 per 1 degrees C, P < 0.05; r = 0.10-0.64, P < 0.05). Increased risks of mental health-related admissions and emergency department visits at higher temperatures were also found. No evidence of change in community care use was found. Evidence for the impact of heat on other mental health outcomes was mixed.
   Conclusions: High ambient temperatures have a range of mental health effects. The strongest evidence was found for increased suicide risk. Limited evidence was found for an increase in heat-related morbidity and mortality among people with known mental health problems. Knowledge gaps exist on the impact of high temperatures on many common mental health disorders. Mental health impacts should be incorporated into plans for the public health response to high temperatures, and as evidence evolves, psychological morbidity and mortality temperature thresholds should be incorporated into hot weather -warning systems.

AB  - Depression is a significant public health problem but symptom remission is difficult to predict. This may be due to substantial heterogeneity underlying the disorder. Latent class analysis (LCA) is often used to elucidate clinically relevant depression subtypes but whether or not consistent subtypes emerge is unclear. We sought to critically examine the implementation and reporting of LCA in this context by performing a systematic review to identify articles detailing the use of LCA to explore subtypes of depression among samples of adults endorsing depression symptoms. PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched to identify eligible articles indexed prior to January 2016. Twenty-four articles reporting 28 LCA models were eligible for inclusion. Sample characteristics varied widely. The majority of articles used depression symptoms as the observed indicators of the latent depression subtypes. Details regarding model fit and selection were often lacking. No consistent set of depression subtypes was identified across studies. Differences in how models were constructed might partially explain the conflicting results. Standards for using, interpreting, and reporting LCA models could improve our understanding of the LCA results. Incorporating dimensions of depression other than symptoms, such as functioning, may be helpful in determining depression subtypes.

AB  - Aggressive behavior is not uniform, including proactive and reactive forms of aggression. Aberrant functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is frequently associated with abnormal aggression. Here, we review the rodent literature in order to assess whether developmental abnormalities in the HPA axis can be causally linked with the emergence of abnormal aggression. We examine studies that involve genetic models and life challenges (e.g., early life stress, drug exposure) that course with developmental alterations in the HPA axis. Although the lack of systematic studies hinders development of an integrated model, existing evidence supports a U-shaped function regarding differences in HPA axis functioning during development and the emergence of aggressive phenotypes. Thus, developmentally low or high HPA axis reactivity are typically found to be aligned with the emergence of aggressive phenotypes; however, existing information is insufficient to causally link divergent HPA axis aberration with specific types of aggression. Progress in this field is needed to support interventions in children aimed at ameliorating social dysfunctions associated with aberrations in HPA axis function. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not allow prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response. A possible strategy to improve this situation is the identification of depression subtypes on the bases of biomarkers reflecting underlying pathological processes such as neuro-inflammation.
   Methods: The PubMed/Medline database was searched until Apr 25th, 2017. In the initial search 1018 articles were retrieved, which were subsequently screened and only selected when the inclusion and exclusion criteria were fulfilled.
   Results: Eight eligible studies were found. Overall, serum interleukin-6 and 113 values were increased in the melancholic MDD subtype compared to controls and the non-melancholic MDD subtype. C-reactive protein was increased in non-melancholic MDD in 2 out of 4 studies, while there was no difference for tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin-2 and 10.
   Conclusion Given the paucity of eligible studies the tentative conclusion must be drawn that peripheral inflammation markers have limited added value thus far to distinguish between melancholic and non-melancholic depression. To allow for a more definitive conclusion, further research is warranted using a broader panel of inflammatory markers in MDD subtypes, preferably based on a general consensus regarding diagnostic criteria and subtype definitions.

AB  - Background: An increasing number of studies have suggested adverse effects of air pollution on mental health. Given the potentially negative impacts of ozone exposure on the immune and nervous system driven from animal experiments, ozone might also affect mental health. However, no systematic synthesis of the relevant literature has been conducted yet. This paper reviews the studies that assessed the link between ozone exposure and mental health thus far.
   Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE were systematically searched for epidemiological studies on ambient ozone exposure and mental or behavioral disorders according to the International Classification of Disease. The period was from January 1st, 1960 to December 14st, 2017. We evaluated the risk of bias by the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Approach and Navigation Guide for each included study.
   Results: The keyword search yielded 567 results. 31 papers met the selection criteria and were included in the review. We found only inconclusive evidence that ozone affects autism spectrum disorders, impairment of cognitive functions and dementia, depression, and suicide. The large heterogeneity of study designs, outcome definitions and study quality in general prevented us from conducting meta-analyses.
   Conclusions: Current evidence for an association between ambient ozone exposure and mental health outcomes is inconclusive and further high quality studies are needed to assess any potential links given the strong biologic plausibility.

AB  - Although the basal ganglia have been implicated in a growing list of human behaviors, they include some of the least understood nuclei in the brain. For several decades studies have employed numerous methodologies to uncover evidence pointing to the basal ganglia as a hub of both motor and non-motor function. Recently, new electrophysiological characterization of the basal ganglia in humans has become possible through direct access to these deep structures as part of routine neurosurgery. Electrophysiological approaches for identifying non-motor function have the potential to unlock a deeper understanding of pathways that may inform clinical interventions and particularly neuromodulation. Various electrophysiological modalities can also be combined to reveal functional connections between the basal ganglia and traditional structures throughout the neocortex that have been linked to non-motor behavior. Several reviews have previously summarized evidence for non-motor function in the basal ganglia stemming from behavioral, clinical, computational, imaging, and non-primate animal studies; in this review, instead we turn to electrophysiological studies of non-human primates and humans. We begin by introducing common electrophysiological methodologies for basal ganglia investigation, and then we discuss studies across numerous non-motor domains-emotion, response inhibition, conflict, decision-making, error-detection and surprise, reward processing, language, and time processing. We discuss the limitations of current approaches and highlight the current state of the information.

AB  - Oxidative stress has been suggested to play a key role in Parkinson's disease, but inconsistent results were found in clinical studies. This study sought to quantitatively summarize the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oxidative stress marker data in PD patients. We performed a systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science, and studies were included if they provided data on peripheral blood and CSF oxidative stress marker concentrations in PD patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. Data were extracted by three independent investigators from 80 included studies encompassing 7,212 PD patients and 6,037 HC subjects. Of the 22 oxidative stress markers analyzed, random effects meta-analysis showed that blood concentrations of 8-OhdG, MDA, nitrite, and ferritin were increased in patients with PD compared with HC subjects. In contrast, we showed that blood levels of catalase, uric acid, glutathione, and total-cholesterol were significantly down-regulated in patients with PD when compared with controls. There were no significant differences between PD patients and HC subjects for blood, Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe, SOD, albumin, glutathione peroxidase, vitamin E, ceruloplasmin, triglycerides, lactoferrin, transferrin, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol. Due to the limited number of CSF studies with small sample size, this meta-analysis only showed non-significant association between CSF 8-OhdG and PD. The findings of our meta-analysis demonstrated higher blood concentrations of 8-OhdG, MDA, nitrite and ferritin, and lower blood concentrations of catalase, uric acid, glutathione and total-cholesterol in PD patients, strengthening the clinical evidence that PD is accompanied by increased oxidative stress.

AB  - Stress is recognized as an important issue in basic and clinical neuroscience research, based upon the founding historical studies by Walter Canon and Hans Selye in the past century, when the concept of stress emerged in a biological and adaptive perspective. A lot of research after that period has expanded the knowledge in the stress field. Since then, it was discovered that the response to stressful stimuli is elaborated and triggered by the, now known, stress system, which integrates a wide diversity of brain structures that, collectively, are able to detect events and interpret them as real or potential threats. However, different types of stressors engage different brain networks, requiring a fine-tuned functional neuroanatomical processing. This integration of information from the stressor itself may result in a rapid activation of the Sympathetic-Adreno-Medullar (SAM) axis and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, the two major components involved in the stress response. The complexity of the stress response is not restricted to neuroanatomy or to SAM and HPA axes mediators, but also diverge according to timing and duration of stressor exposure, as well as its short-and/or long-term consequences. The identification of neuronal circuits of stress, as well as their interaction with mediator molecules over time is critical, not only for understanding the physiological stress responses, but also to understand their implications on mental health.

AB  - We provide a literature overview of 30 years of research on the amount of invested mental effort (AIME, Salomon, 1984), illuminating relevant literature in this field. Since the introduction of AIME, this concept appears to have vanished. To obtain a clearer picture of where the theory of AIME has diffused, we conducted a literature search focusing on the period 1985-2015. We examined scientific articles (N = 244) that cite Salomon (1984) and content-analyzed their keywords. Based on these keywords, we identified seven content clusters: affect and motivation, application fields, cognition and learning, education and teaching, media technology, learning with media technology, and methods. We present selected works of each content cluster and describe in which research field the articles had been published. Results indicate that AIME was most commonly (but not exclusively) referred to in the area of educational psychology indicating its importance regarding learning and education, thereby investigating print and TV, as well as new media. From a methodological perspective, research applied various research methods (e.g., longitudinal studies, experimental designs, theoretical analysis) and samples (e.g., children, college students, low income families). From these findings, the importance of AIME for further research is discussed.

AB  - Background: Anxiety is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes. There has been a relative paucity of studies concerning treatment of anxiety in patients with CHD. Objective: We conducted a systematic review to organize and assess research into the treatment of anxiety in patients with CHD. Methods: We searched CCTRICENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for randomized clinical trials conducted before October 2016 that measured anxiety before and after an intervention for patients with CHD. Results: A total of 475 articles were subjected to full text review, yielding 112 publications that met inclusion criteria plus an additional 7 studies from reference lists and published reviews, yielding 119 studies. Sample size, country of origin, study quality, and demographics varied widely among studies. Most studies were conducted with nonanxious patients. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and State -Trait Anxiety Inventory were the most frequently used instruments to assess anxiety. Interventions included pharmacological,counseling, relaxation-based, educational, or "alternative" therapies. Forty (33% of total) studies reported that the interventions reduced anxiety; treatment efficacy varied by study and type of intervention. Elevated anxiety was an inclusion criterion in only 4 studies, with inconsistent results. Conclusion: Although there have been a number of randomized clinical trials of patients with CHD that assessed anxiety, in most cases anxiety was a secondary outcome, and only one-third found that symptoms of anxiety were reduced with treatment. Future studies need to target anxious patients and evaluate the effects of treatment on anxiety and relevant clinical endpoints.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that immigrants and ethnic minorities may be at higher risk of suicidal behaviour as compared to the general population. We conducted a literature search to identify studies in English from 1980 to 2017 related to suicide risk among immigrants and ethnic minorities. Six hundred and seventy-eight reports were screened, and 43 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis of the review. Some studies reported lower rates of suicide attempts, while other findings suggested higher rates of suicidal behaviour and deaths among immigrants as compared to the native population. Also, a positive correlation was found between suicidal behaviour and specific countries of origin. Non-European immigrant women were at the highest risk for suicide attempts, a group which included young women of South Asian and black African origin. Risk factors among migrants and ethnic minorities were found to be: language barriers, worrying about family back home, and separation from family. The lack of information on health care system, loss of status, loss of social network, and acculturation were identified as possible triggers for suicidal behaviour. Overall, results suggest that specific migrant populations and ethnic minorities present a higher risk of suicidal behaviour than native populations, as well as a higher risk of death by suicide.

AB  - Aims: This literature review aims to illustrate the variety and multitude of studies showing that participation in arts activities and clinical arts interventions can be beneficial for citizens with mental and physical health problems. The article is focused on mental health benefits because this is an emerging field in the Nordic countries where evidence is demanded from national health agencies that face an increasing number of citizens with poor mental health and a need for non-medical interventions and programmes.
   Methods: A total of 20 articles of interest were drawn from a wider literature review. Studies were identified through the search engines: Cochrane Library, Primo, Ebscohost, ProQuest, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed and Design and Applied Arts Index. Search words included the following: arts engagement + health/hospital/recovery, arts + hospital/evidence/wellbeing, evidence-based health practice, participatory arts for wellbeing, health + poetry/literature/dance/singing/music/community arts, arts health cost-effectiveness and creative art or creative activity + health/hospital/recovery/mental health. The inclusion criteria for studies were (1) peer review and (2) empirical data.
   Results: The studies document that participation in activities in a spectrum from clinical arts interventions to non-clinical participatory arts programmes is beneficial and an effective way of using engagement in the arts to promote holistic approaches with health benefits. Engagement in specially designed arts activities or arts therapies can reduce physical symptoms and improve mental health issues.
   Conclusion: Based on the growing evidence of the arts as a tool for enhancing mental health wellbeing, and in line with the global challenges in health, we suggest that participatory arts activities and clinical arts interventions are made more widely available in health and social settings. It is well-documented that such activities can be used as non-medical interventions to promote public health and wellbeing.

AB  - Aim: The objective of this review is to provide a synthesis of current knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying vulnerability and resilience in substance use disorders (SUD).
   Methods: PubMed and PsycINFO database search was conducted from May 1997 until April 2017, for relevant articles outlining the outcomes of case files, control studies and observational studies regarding neurochemical aberrations secondary to drug abuse as well as allostatic processes affecting the course and severity of SUD.
   Results: The relation between drugs of abuse and the neurobiological milieu seems to be a mutual process; drugs of abuse affect the expression of neurobiological systems, and neurobiological systems affect the manifestation of addiction. The review of current literature outlines the roles of early life experience, allostatic processes and genetic polymorphism, which confer the vulnerable or resilient phenotype in SUD. Human and animal studies have revealed dysregulation and adaptive responses of specific neurochemical mechanisms in the brain reward systems (dopamine, opioid peptides, substance P, GABA, estrogen), the brain stress systems (CRH, cortisol, norepinephrine), the brain anti-stress system (serotonin, DHEA, NYP, endocannabinoids, galanin, oxytocin), as well as glutamate implicated in impulse control and BDNF associated with neuroprotection. Genetic studies suggest roles for the genes encoding the neurochemical elements involved in these neurobiological systems, predisposing to vulnerability and resilience in hedonic biochemical use.
   Conclusion: Major neurobiological changes in substance abuse disorder common to human and animal studies include a compromised reward system, over activated brain stress systems, compromised anti-stress system as well as compromised impulse control and response inhibition system. Existing data indicate that allostatic processes and genetic polymorphism exert a significant influence on the course and severity of SUD, conferring the vulnerable or resilient phenotype.

AB  - The prevalence of mental disorders amongst children and adolescents is an increasing global problem. Schools have been positioned at the forefront of promoting positive mental health and well-being through implementing evidence-based interventions. The aim of this paper is to review current evidence-based research of mental health promotion interventions in schools and examine the reported effectiveness to identify those interventions that can support current policy and ensure that limited resources are appropriately used.
   The authors reviewed the current state of knowledge on school mental health promotion interventions globally. Two major databases, SCOPUS and ERIC were utilised to capture the social science, health, arts and humanities, and education literature.
   Initial searches identified 25 articles reporting on mental health promotion interventions in schools. When mapped against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 studies were included and explored. Three of these were qualitative and seven were quantitative.
   A range of interventions have been tested for mental health promotion in schools in the last decade with variable degrees of success. Our review demonstrates that there is still a need for a stronger and broader evidence base in the field of mental health promotion, which should focus on both universal work and targeted approaches to fully address mental health in our young populations.

AB  - Background: Maternal postpartum psychoses pose a serious risk to the mother-infant interaction. It is unclear how different subtypes of postpartum psychosis, including acute and chronic, might differentially affect the mother-infant interaction.
   Method: A systematic search of electronic journal databases was performed.
   Results: This systematic review yielded 17 studies with adequate overall study quality. They focused on child custody and involvement of social services as indirect indicators of themother-infant interaction, observed motherinfant interactions as direct indicators, or potential transitional mechanisms, including memory processing, mind-mindedness, and affect recognition, that may partially explain the effects of psychotic disorders. An acute onset of psychosis during the postpartum period (de novo or relapse) was typically related to better mother-infant interactions. Mothers with schizophrenia have the highest risk of child displacement, and interventions by social services were more likely. However, mothers with postpartum schizophrenia did not exhibit more harm to the child or self-harmthan mothers with postpartum depression. Heterogeneity of methodology, case definitions, and assessments characterized the studies; hence, they were not pooled.
   Conclusions: In addition to evaluating social risk factors in patientswith acute onset and chronic psychoses during the postpartum period, negative preconceptions about motherhood and schizophrenia have to be carefully examined. Clinical research on postpartum psychoses should consider the onset criteria, prevalence of self-harm or harm to the child, significance of specific (e. g., religious) delusions and expressed hostility toward the child. More studies on the impact of first-onset (de novo) postpartum psychoses on the mother-infant interaction are needed. (c) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We systematically reviewed the current use of Google Street View (GSV) in health research and characterized major themes, strengths and weaknesses in order to highlight possibilities for future research. Of 54 qualifying studies, we found that most used GSV to assess the neighborhood built environment, followed by health policy compliance, study site selection, and disaster preparedness. Most studies were conducted in urban areas of North America, Europe, or New Zealand, with few studies from South America or Asia and none from Africa or rural areas. Health behaviors and outcomes of interest in these studies included injury, alcohol and tobacco use, physical activity and mental health. Major strengths of using GSV imagery included low cost, ease of use, and time saved. Identified weaknesses were image resolution and spatial and temporal availability, largely in developing regions of the world. Despite important limitations, GSV is a promising tool for automated environmental assessment for health research. Currently untapped areas of health research using GSV include identification of sources of air, soil or water pollution, park design and usage, amenity design and longitudinal research on neighborhood conditions.

AB  - Objective To examine stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders among primary care professionals and to identify potential factors related to stigmatizing attitudes through a systematic review.
   Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, Lilacs, IBECS, Index Psicologia, CUMED, MedCarib, Sec. Est. Saude SP, WHOLIS, Hanseniase, LIS-Localizador de InformacAo em Saude, PAHO, CVSO-Regional, and Latindex, through the Virtual Health Library portal (http://www.bireme.br website) through to June 2017. The articles included in the review were summarized through a narrative synthesis.
   Results After applying eligibility criteria, 11 articles, out of 19.109 references identified, were included in the review. Primary care physicians do present stigmatizing attitudes towards patients with mental disorders and show more negative attitudes towards patients with schizophrenia than towards those with depression. Older and more experience doctors have more stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness compared with younger and less-experienced doctors. Health-care providers who endorse more stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness were likely to be more pessimistic about the patient's adherence to treatment.
   Conclusions Stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders are common among physicians in primary care settings, particularly among older and more experienced doctors. Stigmatizing attitudes can act as an important barrier for patients to receive the treatment they need. The primary care physicians feel they need better preparation, training, and information to deal with and to treat mental illness, such as a user friendly and pragmatic classification system that addresses the high prevalence of mental disorders in primary care and community settings.

AB  - Objective: Bipolar disorder is highly comorbid with anxiety disorders, however current and lifetime comorbidity patterns of each anxiety disorder and their associated features are not well studied. Here, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis and meta-regression study of current evidence.
   Method: We searched PubMed to access relevant articles published until September 2015, using the keywords "Bipolar disorder" or "Affective Psychosis" or "manic depressive" separately with "generalized anxiety," "panic disorder," "social phobia," "obsessive compulsive," and "anxiety." Variables for associated features and prevalence of anxiety disorders were carefully extracted.
   Results: Lifetime any anxiety disorder comorbidity in BD was 40.5%; panic disorder (PD) 18.1%, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 13.3%, social anxiety disorder (SAD) 13.5% and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 9.7%. Current any anxiety disorder comorbidity in BD is 38.2%; GAD is 15.2%, PD 13.3%, SAD 11.7%, and OCD 9.9%. When studies reporting data about comorbidities in BDI or BDII were analyzed separately, lifetime any anxiety disorder comorbidity in BDI and BDII were 38% and 34%, PD was 15% and 15%, GAD was 14% and 16.6%, SAD was 8% and 13%, OCD was 8% and 10%, respectively. Current any DSM anxiety disorder comorbidity in BDI or BDII were 31% and 37%, PD was 9% and 13%, GAD was 8% and 12%, SAD was 7% and 11%, and OCD was 8% and 7%, respectively. The percentage of manic patients and age of onset of BD tended to have a significant impact on anxiety disorders. Percentage of BD I patients significantly decreased the prevalence of panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. A higher rate of substance use disorder was associated with greater BD-SAD comorbidity. History of psychotic features significantly affected current PD and GAD.
   Conclusions: Anxiety disorder comorbidity is high in BD with somewhat lower rates in BDI vs BDII. Age of onset, substance use disorders, and percentage of patients in a manic episode or with psychotic features influences anxiety disorder comorbidity.

AB  - This essay synthesizes the place of biological evolutionism in the early history of psychoanalysis, and shows the implicit significance of German Darwinism in Sigmund Freud's whole psychoanalytical works. In particular, Freud, together with Sandor Ferenczi (1873-1933), applied to mental disorders hypotheses inspired by August Pauly's (1850-1914) psychological Lamarckism and Ernst Heckel (1834-1919) theory of recapitulation. Both of these theories rested upon the principle of inheritance of acquired characteristics, and were disproved by biological discoveries during the interwar period. However, despite these scientific progresses, Freud never gave up his idea of inherited unconscious memories, and we try here to sketch out what would have cost him a renunciation to such outdated biological principles. Notwithstanding, Sigmund Freud was the first to elaborate on evolutionary causes of mental syndromes, which makes of him the forerunner of current neo-Darwinian psychopathology, with few continuators to date within the psychoanalytic field. Nowadays, the extended neo-Darwinian synthesis and affective neuroscience may pave the way for a rational Darwinian approach to human mental disorders, which would take into account the whole neurological and psychological evolution of species, and be centered on emotions and their vicissitudes.

AB  - Aim: There is an extensive body of research examining the efficacy of Eye-Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in treatment of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This systematic narrative review aimed to systematically, and narratively, review robust evidence from Randomized-Controlled Trials examining the efficacy of EMDR therapy.
   Method: Eight databases were searched to identify studies relevant to the study aim. Two separate systematic searches of published, peer-reviewed evidence were carried out, considering relevant studies published prior to April 2017. After exclusion of all irrelevant, or non-robust, studies, a total of two meta-analyses and four Randomized-Controlled Trials were included for review.
   Results: Data from meta-analyses and Randomized-Controlled Trials included in this review evidence the efficacy of EMDR therapy as a treatment for PTSD. Specifically, EMDR therapy improved PTSD diagnosis, reduced PTSD symptoms, and reduced other trauma-related symptoms. EMDR therapy was evidenced as being more effective than other trauma treatments, and was shown to be an effective therapy when delivered with different cultures. However, limitations to the current evidence exist, and much current evidence relies on small sample sizes and provides limited follow-up data.
   Conclusions: This systematic narrative review contributes to the current evidence base, and provides recommendations for practice and future research. This review highlights the need for additional research to further examine the use of EMDR therapy for PTSD in a range of clinical populations and cultural contexts.

AB  - BackgroundSelf-reported psychotic experiences (PEs) are associated with psychopathology of all kinds, not just psychoses. However, systematic reviews on the relevance of this for health services are unavailable. Furthermore, whether association with service use is confounded by other psychopathology is unknown, and is relevant to prevention and treatment.
   ObjectivesLiterature examining associations between PEs and service use was systematically reviewed. Study quality and the direction and extent of any associations were assessed, and meta-analysis conducted.
   MethodsSystematic review and meta-analysis was carried out as per PRISMA guidelines. A search of electronic databases was performed based on free-text and structured terms. Included studies were evaluated by two raters using a structured tool and estimates extracted for reporting.
   ResultsThirteen studies were returned. We found two prospective studies, and a minority of studies accounted for concurrent psychopathology, limiting our ability to test our main hypotheses. Five studies reported associations by different types of service use. Almost all studies assessed service use by self-report. Meta-analysis suggested that people who reported PEs were around twice as likely to report service use compared to those who did not (pooled OR for all included studies: 2.20,95% confidence intervals (95%CI): 1.66,2.91).
   ConclusionsThere was consistent evidence of association between PEs and mental health service use at the general population level. However, evidence for causation was poor due to a limited number of studies. Whether increased service use in this group is solely attributable to PEs, and therefore whether interventions aimed at limiting/preventing PEs might be effective, requires studies focusing on the relationships between PEs, psychopathology and service use.

AB  - The prevalence of marijuana use among adolescents with anxiety disorders in the USA is markedly high and well documented; however, the literature on this co-occurrences effect on adolescent brain development and functioning is limited. This systematic review searched six databases to 1) explore the literature concerning marijuana use among adolescents with anxiety and 2) examine the effects of marijuana on brain structure and functioning. Overall, 27 studies from six countries were included in this review. Out of these studies, several disparate designs were utilized. The majority of studies revealed an association between marijuana use and anxiety, but the strength of the association and the variability among the studies' designs limited the comparison and warrants additional investigation. Only five studies met criteria that used brain imaging techniques, and findings were non-conclusive. Future evaluations should further investigate the effects of co-occurring marijuana use and anxiety disorders on brain structure and functioning among adolescents.

AB  - Background: Suicide rates are high among older adults and many conditions have been related to suicide in this population: chronic illnesses, physical disabilities, cancer, social isolation, mental disorders and neurocognitive disorders.
   Objectives: Among neurocognitive disorders, analysis of the relationships between dementia and suicidal behaviors led to conflicting results and some questions are still without answer. Particularly, it is not known whether (i) Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases the risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (SA) or the frequency of death by suicide; (ii) the presence of suicidal ideation or SA in people older than 65 years of age is an early dementia sign; and (iii) amyloid load in frontal areas facilitates SA by modifying the decision-making pathway.
   Methods: Therefore, in this narrative review, we searched the PubMed database using the medical subject heading (MeSH) terms ("Suicide" AND "Depression") OR ("Amyloid" OR "Dementia") to identify recent (from 2000 to 2017) original studies on the links between suicidal behavior, dementia and brain amyloid load. We also explored the clinical and pathophysiological role of depression in these relationships.
   Results and Discussion: The findings from these studies suggest that late stage dementia could protect against suicidal ideation and SA. Conversely, the risk of complete suicide is increased during the early phase of cognitive decline.
   Conclusions: Serious cognitive impairment and decline of executive functions could protect against negative thoughts related to cognitive disability awareness and against suicide planning Several factors, including brain amyloid load, could be involved in the increased suicide rate early after the diagnosis of dementia.

AB  - Objectives and importance of study: Values and ethics: guidelines for ethical conduct in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research (Values and ethics) describes key values that should underpin Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous)-focused health research. It is unclear how research teams address this document in primary health care research. We systematically review the primary health care literature focusing on Indigenous social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) to identify how Values and ethics and community preferences for standards of behaviour (local protocols) are addressed during research.
   Study type: Systematic review in accordance with PRISMA Guidelines and MOOSE Guidelines for Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies.
   Methods: We searched four databases and one Indigenous-specific website for qualitative, quantitative and mixed-method studies published since Values and ethics was implemented (2003). Included studies were conducted in primary health care services, focused on Indigenous SEWB and were conducted by research teams. Using standard data extraction forms, we identified actions taken (reported by authors or identified by us) relating to Values and ethics and local protocols.
   Results: A total of 25 studies were included. Authors of two studies explicitly mentioned the Values and ethics document, but neither reported how their actions related to the document's values. In more than half the studies, we identified at least three actions relating to the values. Some actions related to multiple values, including use of culturally sensitive research processes and involving Indigenous representatives in the research team. Local protocols were rarely reported.
   Conclusion: Addressing Values and ethics appears to improve research projects. The academic community should focus on culturally sensitive research processes, relationship building and developing the Indigenous research workforce, to facilitate acceptable research that affects health outcomes. For Values and ethics to achieve its full impact and to improve learning between research teams, authors should be encouraged to report how the principles are addressed during research, including barriers and enablers that are encountered.

AB  - For most, the transition from high school to university marks the simultaneous transition from adolescence into emerging adulthood. Many studies have discussed the degradation of health throughout this time period and identified the increased chance of this cohort engaging in risky or unhealthy behavior. Ego depletion may provide a useful tool for beginning the exploration of this transition and its challenges. This systematic review intends to identify the studies over the last 5 years that have focused on the effect of ego depletion on cognitive and emotional variables with university students. The systematic search resulted in 48 studies from which to draw data and revealed that undergraduate university students are susceptible to the ego depletion effect (92% significant), and that it pervades across wide variety of cognitive and emotional variables such as self-control, prospective memory, and anxiety. These studies could yield suggestions for future planning of advisor-student relationships, peer-to-peer assistance programs, and many other useful avenues for easing the early years of university.

AB  - We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing teacher burnout. Online and reference list searches yielded 513 unique results, and the final sample contains 23 controlled trials (19 journal articles and 4 unpublished dissertations). More than two thirds of the studies had optimal quality, and the risk of bias was not related to the overall effectiveness of the interventions. The overall effects were small, but statistically significant (d = 0.18, SE = 0.05, Z = 3.26, p < 0.001, k = 23). Separate analyses on each burnout component showed similar intervention effects on emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment, but almost null effects on depersonalization (d = 0.03, SE = 0.06, Z = 0.53, p > 0.05, k = 11). Additional moderator analyses suggested that mindfulness interventions had significant effects on exhaustion and personal accomplishment. Interventions on primary and middle school teachers reported effect sizes below the average effect. Similar to previous findings, interventions that lasted less than 1 month had the smallest levels of efficacy.

AB  - Intrusive memories, when persistent and distressing, are theorized to underlie a range of transdiagnostic psychological symptoms and associated impairment. However, little is known about factors predicting the development and persistence of intrusive memories. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the literature on pre-event, event-based, and post-event predictors of intrusive memories. A systematic review was conducted, searching for studies that examined intrusive, event-based memories. One hundred and six articles were identified from PsycInfo, PubMed, and Medline databases. Experimental and prospective studies with clinical (N = 14) and nonclinical (N = 92) samples were critically reviewed, provided the inclusion of an analogue stressor with nonclinical samples, and that intrusive memories frequency and/or distress were assessed as primary dependent variables. Pre-existing psychopathology and pre-event appraisal style appear to predict intrusive memories (small to medium effects), whereas trait dissociation did not predict intrusive memories. Of studies examining event-based predictors, higher data-driven processing appears to predict intrusive memories with generally large effects. Post-event negative appraisals consistently predicted intrusive memories (medium to large effects), and preliminary evidence suggests higher post-event conceptual processing predicting fewer intrusive memories. This review synthesizes findings regarding a broad range of pre-event, event-based, and post-event factors that may influence the development of intrusive memories. Methodological issues of current paradigms and the lack of emphasis on memory retrieval processes limit our understanding of what predicts intrusive memory persistence. These limitations are particularly important given that individuals typically seek treatment for distressing intrusive memories once a memory has been fully consolidated, where retrieval processes are of utmost importance.

AB  - Objectives. - Ghrelin is an orexigenic digestive hormone that plays a role in sleep and memory. Our work aims is to synthesize the effects of ghrelin on appetite, sleep and memory, and also to evidence its role in depressive disorders.
   Methods. - A systematic search was carried out on PubMed with no time boundaries. The following MeSH terms were used: ghrelin AND (appetite regulation OR obesity), (sleep wake disorders OR sleep) (memory OR cognition disorders) (depression OR depressive disorder OR mood disorder).
   Results. - Ghrelin triggers appetite and alters meal patterns by making them longer and richer. This can lead to pathologies, obesity and insulin-resistance. Ghrelin seems to have a favourable effect on sleep in human beings. It tends to make sleep more efficacious and better quality. Finally, it seems to have an effect on synaptic plasticity in the zones involved in memory and it has been shown to improve memory capacity in rodents. Regarding depression, the administration of ghrelin leads to an anti-depressive effect in animals and in humans. Conversely, post anti-depressant ghrelin titrations have generally shown a decrease in ghrelin levels. Resistant patients seem to retain high levels. Finally, the seriousness of depression could be related to ghrelin levels.
   Conclusion. - Ghrelin plays a probable part in depression, especially for particular endophenotypes. A better understanding of ghrelin in depression could potentially help to optimize future therapeutic treatments. (C) 2017 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB  - ObjectiveNoncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including mental disorders, have become major threats to human health worldwide. People with NCDs are particularly vulnerable to disasters. We systematically reviewed reports describing studies of NCDs at the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) to clarify the circumstances of people with NCDs and to build strong measures to support them.MethodsRelevant articles published from March 2011 through December 2016 were collected by searching the PubMed database (National Library of Medicine). We specifically examined reports describing NCDs and including the key words East Japan Earthquake. NCDs included every disease type aside from injury and infectious disease.ResultsWe collected 160 relevant articles, 41 of which described NCDs that existed in residents before the GEJE. Articles describing respiratory diseases and mental illnesses were found most frequently. Interruption of regular treatment was the most frequent problem, followed by lack of surveillance capacity. We found 101 reports describing NCDs that had developed after the GEJE, of which 60% were related to mental health issues.ConclusionsNCDs pose major health issues after large-scale disasters. Establishment of strong countermeasures against interruption of treatment and surveillance systems to ascertain medical needs for NCDs are necessary to prepare for future disasters.

AB  - Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a major mental illness with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 1-3%, characterized by a persistent pattern of instability in relationships, mood, impulse regulation, and sense of self. This results in impulsive self-damaging behavior, high suicide rates, and severe functional impairment. BPD has a complex, multifactorial etiology, resulting from an interaction among genetic and environmental substrates, and has moderate to high heritability based on twin and family studies. However, our understanding of the genetic architecture of BPD is very limited. This is a critical obstacle since genetics can pave the way for identifying new treatment targets and developing preventive and disease-modifying pharmacological treatments which are currently lacking.
   We review genetic studies in BPD, with a focus on limitations and challenges and future directions. Genetic research in BPD is still in its very early stages compared to other major psychiatric disorders. Most early genetic studies in BPD were non-replicated association studies in small samples, focused on single candidate genes. More recently, there has been one genome-wide linkage study and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of subclinical BPD traits and a first GWAS in a relatively modest sample of patients fulfilling full diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Although there are adequate animal models for some of the core dimensions of BPD, there is a lack of translational research including data from animal models in BPD. Research in more pioneering fields, such as imaging genetics, deep sequencing and epigenetics, holds promise for elucidating the pathophysiology of BPD and identifying new treatment targets.

AB  - Religion and spirituality play a significant role as coping resources under stressful circumstances. Nursing professionals confront with a variety of stressors repeatedly and are found to employ religious/spiritual coping techniques in managing the negative impact of work stress. The present review explores different religious and spiritual coping strategies utilized by nurses of different socio-cultural and religious backgrounds and highlights the importance of treating religion and spirituality as two separate entities in studying their stress-buffering effect. The MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycArticles databases and Google Scholar were searched from 2006 to 2017 with the key words nursing, stress, religious coping, religiosity and spirituality. Various notions of the divine/transcendent aspect of life have led to lack of consensus over a functional definition of religion as well as spirituality. This is found to be the core element of methodological inadequacy in studying individuals' reliance on religion and spirituality during stress. Further, most of the existing measures do not adequately explore spirituality as a construct independent of religion. Measures should be more culture sensitive to discover culturally enriched religious practices and rituals adopted by individuals belonging to different socio-cultural milieu to overcome stress. The role of religion and spirituality in stress resilience, emotion regulation and burnout among nurses around the globe needs further empirical support. Multiple levels at which religious and spiritual coping may moderate/mediate the relationship between work stress and behavioral/emotional outcomes among human service personnel who face high emotional labor demands should be more comprehensively analyzed.

AB  - Context: Depression is a major health problem in geriatric population and has many adverse consequences. The aim of this study was to review the existing literature on psychosocial factors that protect against depression in later life.
   Evidence Acquisition: A MEDLINE systematic search was done via Pubmed and Sciencedirect web pages to gather the published articles on psychosocial factors of late life depression First, the titles and abstracts reviewed and relevant articles were selected according to the inclusion criteria. Then full texts of the selected articles obtained, read, and data were extracted and categorized.
   Results: There were 204 articles on psychosocial factors of late life depression in community dwelling older adults and among them 29 articles included protective factors. Reading them carefully, protective factors were extracted and organized into 5 main categories: Demographic factors, psychological factors, social factors, health related factors and also spiritual factors.
   Conclusion: Psychosocial factors protecting older adults against depression are diverse. Identification of the modifiable ones and provision of appropriate interventions to enhance them, can be helpful in preventing geriatric depression.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the evidence for an association between maternal depression and the risk of diarrheal illness in infants. Study design: This study is a meta-analysis.
   Methods: Nine databases were searched systematically for studies that investigated the risk of diarrheal illness in infants born to mothers with depression.
   Results: Our search strategy yielded 10 studies of the association between maternal depression and the risk of diarrheal illness in infants: eight studies of postnatal depression, two studies of antenatal depression, and one study of perinatal depression. Our meta-analysis showed that infants born to mothers with postnatal depression were more likely to develop diarrheal illness (odds ratio [OR] = 1.902, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.385-2.612, P < 0.001, n = 18,585). A similar trend was noted for antenatal depression OR = 2.703, 95% CI = 0.920-7.942, P = 0.071, n = 583). Only one study reported an association between perinatal depression and risk of diarrhea in infants (OR = 1.848, log OR = 0.614, standard error = 0.093, n = 107,587).
   Conclusions: Only a few studies so far have identified an association between maternal depression and risk of diarrhea in infants. The evidence available to date suggests that infants born to mothers with depression are more likely to develop diarrhea than infants whose mothers do not have depression.

AB  - Fear memory underlies anxiety-related disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a fear-based disorder, characterized by difficulties in extinguishing the learned fear response and maintaining extinction. Currently, the first-line treatment for PTSD is exposure therapy, which forms an extinction memory to compete with the original fear memory. However, the extinguished fear often returns under numerous circumstances, suggesting that novel methods are needed to eliminate fear memory or facilitate extinction memory. This review discusses research that targeted extinction and reconsolidation to manipulate fear memory. Recent studies indicate that sleep is an active state that can regulate memory processes. We also discuss the influence of sleep on fear memory. For each manipulation, we briefly summarize the neural mechanisms that have been identified in human studies. Finally, we highlight potential limitations and future directions in the field to better translate existing interventions to clinical settings.

AB  - Background: The number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in China continues to increase. Depression, a common mental disorder in this population, may confer a higher likelihood of worse health outcomes. An estimate of the prevalence of this disorder among PLHA is required to guide public health policy, but the published results vary widely and lack accuracy in China. The goal of this study was to estimate the pooled prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among PLHA in China.
   Methods: A systematic literature search of several databases was conducted from inception to June 2017, focusing on studies reporting on depression or depressive symptoms among PLHA in China. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The overall prevalence estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Differences according to study-level characteristics were examined using stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression.
   Results: Seventy-four observational studies including a total of 20,635 PLHA were included. The pooled prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms was 50.8% (95% CI: 46.0-55.5%) among general PLHA, 43.9% (95% CI: 36.2-51.9%) among HIV-positive men who have sex with men, 85.6% (95% CI: 64.1-95.2%) among HIV-positive former blood/plasma donors, and 51.6% (95% CI: 31.9-70.8%) among other HIV-positive populations. Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these prevalence estimates. Heterogeneity in the prevalence of depression among the general population of PLHA was partially explained by the geographic location and baseline survey year.
   Conclusions: Because of the significant heterogeneity detected across studies regarding these prevalence estimates of depression or depressive symptoms, the results must be interpreted with caution. Our findings suggest that the estimates of depression or depressive symptoms among PLHA in China are considerable, which highlights the need to integrate screening and providing treatment for mental disorders in the treatment package offered to PLHA, which would ultimately lead to better health outcomes in PLHA.

AB  - Background: Suicide rates generally peak in the second half of life and are particularly high in older men; however, little is known about the contribution of dispositional factors to late-life suicide. Maladaptive personality traits have been strongly implicated in suicide among younger adults, but the extent to which they continue to play a role in late-life suicidal behavior is unclear. We also do not know whether specific personality profiles interact with the stressors of aging to cause suicidal behavior.
   Methods: We sought to synthesize the data on personality pathology in late-life suicidal ideation and behavior via a systematic review using the PubMed, Google Scholar, PsycInfo, Scopus, Ovid, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane search engines. The included key words related to three descriptors: "personality," "suicide," and "elderly." Included articles evaluated personality based on the Five-Factor Model (FFM) or ICD/DSM diagnostic criteria in older samples with minimum age cutoffs of 50 years or older. Our original search identified 1,183 articles, of which 31 were retained.
   Results: Included studies were heterogeneous in their design and personality measurements. Studies of categorical personality disorders were particularly scarce and suggested a stronger association with late-life suicidal ideation than with death by suicide. Only obsessive-compulsive and avoidant personality traits were associated with death by suicide in old age, but only in studies that did not control for depression. All personality constructs were positively linked to suicidal ideation, except for histrionic personality, which emerged as a negative predictor. Studies employing the FFM also indicated that older adults who died by suicide were less likely to display a maladaptive personality profile than elderly suicide attempters and younger suicide victims, having both lower levels of neuroticism and higher levels of conscientiousness than these comparison groups. Nevertheless, older suicide victims displayed lower levels of openness to experience than younger victims in two samples.
   Conclusion: Maladaptive personality manifests in milder, subthreshold, and more heterogeneous forms in late-life vs. early-life suicide. An inability to adapt to the changes occurring in late life may help explain the association between suicide in old age and higher conscientiousness as well as obsessive-compulsive and avoidant personality disorders.

AB  - The origin(s) and purpose(s) of consciousness continue to be fervently debated by neuroscientists. A recent unconventional hypothesis put forth by Morsella et al. suggests the primary function of consciousness is the integration, selection, and execution of advantageous lower-level voluntary skeletal muscle behavior on surrounding external environments. However, at main issue is whether more precise, adaptable voluntary skeletal motor action, and therefore the corresponding workings of consciousness, first emerged and evolved in animals to exert control over external environments or internal ones regulated by less flexible autonomic function. Using the example of voluntary immunomodulation, one can identify the strengths and weaknesses of either rationale. For instance, highly trained meditative techniques for immunomodulation more or-less conform to Morsella et al.'s assumptions on higher-level indirect conscious control of autonomic function. Whereas, untrained skeletal motor resolution of infection-related approach avoidance conflicts support conclusions contrary to those of Morsella et al. In such cases, primitive voluntary changes in host respiration rate and volume may selectively facilitate/inhibit acute autonomic psychophysiological stress responses to pathogen insult. This and other types of scenarios predictably give evolutionary and ecological rise to self-awareness of (visceral) internal states as well as to voluntary regulation of internal state action conflicts.

AB  - Current diagnosis of schizophrenia relies exclusively on the potentially subjective interpretation of clinical symptoms and social functioning as more objective biological measurement and medical diagnostic tests are not presently available. The use of metabolomics in the discovery of disease biomarkers has grown in recent years. Metabolomic methods could aid in the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers of schizophrenia. This systematic review focuses on biofluid metabolites associated with schizophrenia. A systematic search of Web of Science and Ovid Medline databases was conducted and 63 studies investigating metabolite biomarkers of schizophrenia were included. A review of these studies revealed several potential metabolite signatures of schizophrenia including reduced levels of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPUFAs), vitamin E and creatinine; and elevated levels of lipid peroxidation metabolites and glutamate. Further research is needed to validate these biomarkers and would benefit from large cohort studies and more homogeneous and well-defined subject groups. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction The work of carrying water falls mainly on women and children, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and rural areas. While concerns have been raised, how water carriage is associated with health of the water carrier is not clear. The aim of this review is to summarise evidence on whether, and how, water carriage is associated with the water carrier's health.
   Methods A systematic review of literature was conducted, searching Embase; Medline; Web of Science Social Sciences Citation Index; Web of Science Arts and Humanities Citation Index; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation website; WHO Virtual Health Sciences Library and WHO African index medicus, from inception to 8 November 2017.
   Results Forty-two studies were included. Their ability to demonstrate cause and effect relationships was limited by study design and fair or poor methodological quality. Overall, the studies suggest that water carriage is associated with negative aspects of the water carriers' health. There is moderate quantitative and strong qualitative evidence that water carriage is associated with pain, fatigue, perinatal health problems and violence against vulnerable people, and inconclusive evidence of an association with stress or self-reported mental health and general health status.
   Conclusion In many circumstances, water carriage is a potential barrier to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 target 'universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all' and SDG 3 'ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages'. Efforts should focus on providing water on premises, and where this is not possible, providing water close to home and reducing risk of gender-based violence.

AB  - Objective: Recent improvements in life expectancy globally require intensified focus on noncommunicable diseases and age-related conditions. The purpose of this article is to inform the development of age-specific prevention guidelines for adults aged 50 and above, which are currently lacking.
   Data Source: PubMed, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar and explicit outreach to experts in the field.
   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Meta-analyses, intervention-based, and prospective cohort studies that reported all-cause mortality, disease-specific mortality, or morbidity in adults were included.
   Data Extraction: A systematic review was undertaken in 2015 using search terms of a combination of <risk factor> and "intervention," "mortality," "reduction," "improvement," "death," and "morbidity."
   Data Synthesis: Interventions were categorized according to the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence framework.
   Results: A summary table reports for each intervention the impact, strength of evidence, initiation, duration, and details of the intervention. Age-decade-specific preventive recommendations have been proposed relating to physical activity, diet, tobacco and alcohol use, medication adherence, screening and vaccination, and mental and cognitive health.
   Conclusion: Clear recommendations have been made according to the existing evidence base, but further research investment is needed to fill the many gaps. Further, personalized approaches to healthy aging complemented by population-wide approaches and broader cross-sector partnerships will help to ensure greater longevity is an opportunity, rather than a burden, for society.

AB  - Mounting evidence suggests that aberrations in immune-inflammatory pathways contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), and individuals with MDD may have elevated levels of predominantly pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein. In addition, previous meta-analyses suggest that antidepressant drug treatment may decrease peripheral levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-6. Recently, several new studies examining the effect of antidepressants on these cytokines have been published, and so we performed an updated meta-analysis of studies that measured peripheral levels of cytokines and chemokines during antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD. The PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo databases were searched from inception through March 9, 2017. Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria (N = 1517). Peripheral levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1 beta, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma, IL-8, the C-C motif ligand 2 chemokine (CCL-2), CCL-3, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-13, IL-17, IL-5, IL-7, and the soluble IL-2 receptor were measured in at least three datasets and thus were meta-analyzed. Antidepressant treatment significantly decreased peripheral levels of IL-6 (Hedges g = -0.454, P < 0.001), TNF-alpha (g = -0.202, P = 0.015), IL-10 (g = -0.566, P = 0.012), and CCL-2 (g = -1.502, P = 0.006). These findings indicate that antidepressants decrease several markers of peripheral inflammation. However, this meta-analysis did not provide evidence that reductions in peripheral inflammation are associated with antidepressant treatment response although few studies provided separate data for treatment responders and non-responders.

AB  - Indigenous Australians are under-represented in the health workforce. The shortfall in the Indigenous health workforce compounds the health disparities experienced by Indigenous Australians and places pressure on Indigenous health professionals. This systematic review aims to identify enablers and barriers to the retention of Indigenous Australians within the health workforce and to describe strategies to assist with development and retention of Indigenous health professionals after qualification. Four electronic databases were systematically searched in August 2017. Supplementary searches of relevant websites were also undertaken. Articles were screened for inclusion using pre-defined criteria and assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. Fifteen articles met the criteria for inclusion. Important factors affecting the retention of Indigenous health professionals included work environment, heavy workloads, poorly documented/understood roles and responsibilities, low salary and a perception of salary disparity, and the influence of community as both a strong personal motivator and source of stress when work/life boundaries could not be maintained. Evidence suggests that retention of Indigenous health professionals will be improved through building supportive and culturally safe workplaces; clearly documenting and communicating roles, scope of practice and responsibilities; and ensuring that employees are appropriately supported and remunerated. The absence of intervention studies highlights the need for deliberative interventions that rigorously evaluate all aspects of implementation of relevant workforce, health service policy, and practice change.

The present study collected evidence on the effectiveness, from 2011 to 2016, of employment strategies for persons with MDs; (3) Results: A total of 18 studies were included, representing 5216 participants (aged 18-65, mean age of 38.5 years old) from 7 countries. Job access programs demonstrated effectiveness in four out of six studies. Return to work (RTW) interventions showed significant positive results in two studies, while four studies did not refer to effectiveness. There were inconsistent results in another four studies; (4) Conclusions: Our findings highlight the complexities of the implementation of employment strategies (job access and return to work). Job access strategies seem to improve employment outcomes. The effectiveness of return to work strategies remains unclear. The involvement and commitment of physicians, employment specialists, and employers, and employees capacity for self-care seem decisive for employment re-integration success. Further analyses are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions and corroborate our results, with longer follow-ups.

AB  - Question Recent data suggest that anxiety disorders are as often comorbid with bipolar disorder (BD) as with unipolar depression. The literature on panic disorder (PD) comorbid with BD has been systematically reviewed and subject to meta-analysis.
   Study selection and analysis The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were thoroughly followed for literature search, selection and reporting of available evidence. The variance-stabilising Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation was used in the meta-analysis of prevalence estimates. Both fixed-effect and random-effects models with inverse variance method were applied to estimate summary effects for all combined studies. Heterogeneity was assessed and measured with Cochran's Q and I-2 statistics.
   Findings Overall, 15 studies (n=3391) on cross-sectional prevalence and 25 independent lifetime studies (n=8226) were used to calculate pooled estimates. The overall random-effects point prevalence of PD in patients with BD, after exclusion of one potential outlier study, was 13.0% (95% CI 7.0% to 20.3%), and the overall random-effects lifetime estimate, after exclusion of one potential outlier study, was 15.5% (95% CI 11.6% to 19.9%). There were no differences in rates between BD-I and BD-II. Significant heterogeneity (I-2 >95%) was found in both estimates.
   Conclusions Estimates that can be drawn from published studies indicate that the prevalence of PD in patients with BD is higher than the prevalence in the general population. Comorbid PD is reportedly associated with increased risk of suicidal acts and a more severe course. There is no clear indication on how to treat comorbid PD in BD. Findings from the current meta-analysis confirm the highly prevalent comorbidity of PD with BD, implicating that in patients with BD, PD might run a more chronic course.

AB  - Olfactory dysfunction has been well studied in depression. Common brain areas are involved in depression and in the olfactory process, suggesting that olfactory impairments may constitute potential markers of this disorder. Olfactory markers of depression can be either state (present only in symptomatic phases) or trait (persistent after symptomatic remission) markers. This study presents the etiology of depression, the anatomical links between olfaction and depression, and a literature review of different olfactory markers of depression. Several studies have also shown that olfactory impairment affects the quality of life and that olfactory disorders can affect daily life and may be lead to depression. Thus, this study discusses the links between olfactory processing, depression, and quality of life. Finally, olfaction is an innovative research field that may constitute a new therapeutic tool for the treatment of depression.

AB  - Background: There is a vast literature investigating the possible associations between competitive anxiety, athlete variables and sports context. As far as we are concerned, there is no study which has compiled such findings to produce more robust evidence on this topic. Objectives: The aim of the study was to conduct an exploratory systematic review of the literature followed by a meta-analysis in order to investigate possible associations between competitive anxiety, social-demographic characteristics, profile of the athlete and sports context. Methods: Systematic searches of PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Lilacs and SciELO electronic databases were performed to identify studies published between January 2006 and January 2018, including a manual search in the references of the selected studies. Results: A total of 59 studies were included for qualitative synthesis and 27 for meta-analysis. More robust associations were observed between competitive anxiety and female gender, lower age, and less experience time. Discussion: Knowing the variables which exert influence on competitive anxiety can be relevant to plan specific treatment and intervention programs, enabling the athlete's development beyond technical and physical preparation.

AB  - Objective: Meta-analyses of trials of psychological treatments for emotional distress in breast cancer (BCa) conclude that efficacious treatments exist. Subsequently, their implementation in routine care is widely promoted by health policy. However, the methodological quality of these trials has not been systematically evaluated. The present review investigates this issue.
   Method: A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials of psychological treatments for emotional distress in BCa. The Psychotherapy Outcome Study Methodology Rating Form was used to assess the quality of trials. Generic design elements, including representativeness of sample, control of concomitant treatments, reporting clinical significance outcomes, and design elements specific to psychotherapy trials, including manualisation, therapist training, and therapist adherence and competence were evaluated.
   Results: 91 trials were eligible. Overall, methodological quality was low. Generic design elements were limited in most trials: 15% specified as an inclusion criterion that participants were distressed; 10% controlled for concomitant treatments; and 11% reported the clinical significance of findings. Design elements specific to psychotherapy trials were also implemented poorly: 51% used treatment manuals; 8% used certified trained therapists; and monitoring of adherence and competence occurred in 15% and 4%, respectively.
   Conclusion: The methodological quality of psychological treatment trials for emotional distress in BCa is improving. However, if relevant health policies are to be adequately empirically informed, trials of greater methodological rigour are essential. Trials should include participants with clinical levels of distress, control for concomitant treatments and report the clinical significance of findings. Trialists must also consider the specific requirements of psychotherapy trials.

AB  - In a state of oxidative stress, there is an increase of reactive species, which induce an altered intracellular signaling, leading to dysregulation of the inflammatory response. The inability of the antioxidant defense systems to modulate the proinflammatory response is key to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this work is to review the effect of the state of oxidative stress on the loss of regulation of the inflammatory response on the microglia and astrocytes, the induction of different CD4(+)T cell populations in neuroinflammation, as well as its role in some neurodegenerative diseases. For this purpose, an intentional search of original articles, short communications, and reviews, was carried out in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The articles reviewed included the period from 1997 to 2017. With the evidence obtained, we conclude that the loss of redox balance induces alterations in the differentiation and number of CD4(+)T cell subpopulations, leading to an increase in Th1 and Th17 response. This contributes to the development of neuroinflammation as well as loss of the regulation of the inflammatory response in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In contrast, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th2 modulate the inflammatory response of effect of T cells, microglia, and astrocytes. In this respect, it has been found that the mobilization of T cells with anti-inflammatory characteristics toward damaged regions of the CNS can provide neuroprotection and become a therapeutic strategy to control inflammatory processes in neurodegeneration.

AB  - Social cognition has become recognized as an important driver of functional outcomes and overall recovery in patients with schizophrenia, mediating the relationship between neurocognition and social functioning. Since antipsychotic therapy targeting remission of clinical symptoms has been shown to have a limited impact on social cognition, there has been an increasing drive to develop therapeutic strategies to specifically improve social cognition in schizophrenia. We sought to review current evidence relating to social cognition in schizophrenia and its clinical implications, including interventions designed to target the core domains of social cognition (emotion processing, theory of mind, attributional bias, and social perception) as a means of improving functional outcomes and thereby increasing the likelihood of recovery. Relevant articles were identified by conducting a literature search in PubMed using the search terms "schizophrenia"AND "cognition" AND "social functioning," limited to Title/Abstract, over a time period of the past 10 years. Current evidence demonstrates that schizophrenia is associated with impairments in all four core domains of social cognition, during the pre-first-episode, first-episode, early, and chronic phases of the disease, and that such impairments are important determinants of functional outcome. Interventions targeting the four core domains of social cognition comprise psychosocial approaches (social cognition training programs) and pharmacological therapies. Social cognition training programs targeting multiple and specific core domains of social cognition have shown promise in improving social cognition skills, which, in some cases, has translated into improvements in functional outcomes. Use of some psychosocial interventions has additionally resulted in improvements in clinical symptoms and/or quality of life. Pharmacological therapies, including oxytocin and certain antipsychotics, have yielded more mixed results, due in part to the confounding impact of factors including variation in receptor genetics, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and drug-drug interactions, and inconsistencies between study designs and medication dosages. Additional research is required to advance our understanding of the role of social cognition in schizophrenia, and to further establish the utility of targeted interventions in this setting.

AB  - Background: We systematically reviewed the literature to determine the influence of sex hormones on facial emotion processing (FEP) in healthy women at different phases of life.
   Methods: Searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, LILACS, and SciELO. Twenty-seven articles were included in the review and allocated into five different categories according to their objectives and sample characteristics (menstrual cycle, oral contraceptives, pregnancy/postpartum, testosterone, and progesterone).
   Results: Despite the limited number of studies in some categories and the existence of inconsistencies in the results of interest, the findings of the review suggest that FEP may be enhanced during the follicular phase. Studies with women taking oral contraceptives showed reduced recognition accuracy and decreased responsiveness of different brain structures during FEP tasks. Studies with pregnant women and women in the postpartum showed that hormonal changes are associated with alterations in FEP and in brain functioning that could indicate the existence of a hypervigilant state in new and future mothers. Exogenous administration of testosterone enhanced the recognition of threatening facial expressions and the activation of brain structures involved in the processing of emotional stimuli.
   Conclusions: We conclude that sex hormones affect FEP in women, which may have an impact in adaptive processes of the species and in the onset of mood symptoms associated with the premenstrual syndrome.

AB  - Background: Alexithymia is a multifaceted personality construct that represents a deficit in the cognitive processing of emotions and is currently understood to be related to a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions. The present review aims to investigate the relationship of alexithymia with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders as functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID, as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)] and liver diseases as chronic hepatitis C (CHC), cirrhosis, and liver transplantation.
   Methods: The articles were selected from the main electronic databases (PsycInfo, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, and Science Direct) using multiple combinations of relevant search terms (defined GI and liver diseases, articles in English, use of the Toronto scales [TAS] for alexithymia). The TAS was selected as inclusion criterion because it is the most widely used measure, thus allowing comparisons across studies.
   Results: Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 38 focused on GI disorders (27 on FGID and 11 on IBD) and 10 on liver diseases. Most studies (n = 30, 62%) were cross-sectional. The prevalence of alexithymia was higher in FGID (two third or more) than IBD and liver diseases (from one third to 50% of patients, consistent with other chronic non-GI diseases) than general population (10-15%). In functional disorders, alexithymia may be viewed as a primary driver for higher visceral perception, symptom reporting, health care use, symptom persistence, and negative treatment outcomes. Also, it has been found associated with psychological distress and specific GI-related forms of anxiety in predicting symptom severity as well as post-treatment outcomes and is associated with several psychological factors increasing the burden of disease and impairing levels of quality of life. A number of critical issues (small sample sizes, patients referred to secondary and tertiary care centers, cross-sectional study design, use of one single scale for alexithymia) constitutes a limitation to the generalization of findings.
   Conclusions: Alexithymia showed to play different roles in gastroenterology according to the clinical characteristics and the psychological burden of the various disorders, with main relevance in increasing subjective symptom perception and affecting negatively post-treatment outcomes.

AB  - Context: Recent studies on patients with psychiatric disorders suggest a possible association between borna disease virus (BDV) and mood disorders. However, a clear association remains controversial. The current systematic review and meta-analysis study aimed at investigating the association between BDV infection and mood disorders.
   Methods: The current study was conducted based on preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. To obtain the evidence, several databases were searched including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Em-base, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar search engine without time limit until 2017. Heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using Q test and I-2 index. A random effect model was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results: Meta-analysis of 23 studies comprising 3628 cases and 5,810 controls showed that BDV infection was associated with a significantly increased risk of mood disorders (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.21-2.15, P = 0.001, I-2 = 44%). Subgroup analysis was used according to diagnostic method indicating OR was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.37-2.8) for immunofluorescence antibody (IFA), 1.26 (95% CI: 0.5-3.18) for western blot (WB) assay, 1.58 (95% CI: 1.06-2.38) for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 1.16 (95% CI: 0.24-5.70) for radioligand assay (RLA), 2.55 (95% CI: 1.67-3.88) for enzyme immunoassay (EIA), 2.15 (95% CI: 0.68-6.80) for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 3.29 (95% CI: 1.35-7.98) for electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), 4.00 (95% CI: 0.89-17.87) for peptide array, and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.23-4.27) for proliferation assay method. In subgroup analysis of bipolar and unipolar disorder, OR was 1.99 (95% CI: 1.29-3.08, P = 0.002) and 1.16 (95% CI: 0.76-1.76, P = 0.481), respectively.
   Conclusions: These results can confirm the significant role of BDV infection in mood disorders. Therefore, it might be necessary to consider BDV infection to manage psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Introduction: Schizophrenia is a disabling psychiatric disorder. The role of Borna Disease Virus (BDV) in the etiology of schizophrenia has been suggested by several studies. However, the existence of such association remained controversial. The present meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate this association.
   Method: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). Online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google scholar search engine were searched until January 15, 2017. The heterogeneity of the studies was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and I-2 statistic. Finally, random effects model was used for combining the results using Stata software version 11.1.
   Result: Overall, 30 studies containing 2533 cases and 4004 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the relationship between BDV and schizophrenia was estimated to be 2.72 (95% CI: 1.75-4.20). This association based on RT-PCR, WB, IFA, EIA, RLA, ECLIA methods was estimated to be 3.83 (95% CI: 1.59-9.20), 4.99 (95% CI: 1.80-13.85), 1.27 (95% CI: 0.23-7.12), 2.26 (95% CI: 0.48-10.64), 1.67 (95% CI: 0.50-5.56) and 2.88 (95% CI: 1.38-6.01), respectively. Subgroup analysis according to WBC, serum and plasma samples was estimated to be 3.31 (95% CI: 1.19-9.25), 2.21 (95% CI: 1.17-4.17), 2.21 (95% CI: 1.03-4.73) and 7.89 (95% CI: 1.75-35.53), respectively.
   Conclusion: The results indicated the role of BDV in the etiology of schizophrenia.

AB  - Objective: Disparities in cardiovascular health by socioeconomic status (SES) are a pressing public health concern. Hypothesized mechanisms linking low SES to poor health are large cardiovascular responses to and delayed recovery from psychological stress. The current study presents a meta-analysis of the literature on the association of SES with blood pressure and heart rate reactivity to and recovery from acute stress tasks.
   Methods: The PubMed database was searched, and 26 unique studies with relevant data were identified (k = 25 reactivity [n = 14,617], k = 6 recovery [n = 1,324]).
   Results: Using random-effects models, no significant association between SES and cardiovascular reactivity to stress emerged (r = .008, 95% confidence interval = -.02 to .04), although higher SES was associated with better recovery from stress (r = -.14, 95% confidence interval -. 23 to -. 05). Stressor type moderated the reactivity effect, wherein higher SES was associated with greater reactivity to cognitive stressors (r = .036, p = .024), not with reactivity to interpersonal stressors (r = -.02, p = .62), but was associated with lower reactivity to tasks with combinations of cognitive, interpersonal, and physical challenges (r = -.12, p = .029). Accounting for publication bias revealed a significant association between SES and reactivity in the opposite direction of hypotheses.
   Conclusions: Cardiovascular recovery from acute stress, but not reactivity to stress, may be a key pathway between low SES and risk for cardiovascular diseases. Heterogeneity in effect size and direction, challenges related to working across temporal dynamics, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Identification of individuals with an at-risk mental state (ARMS) who are at a heightened risk of developing psychosis allows researchers and clinicians to identify what factors are associated with poorer outcomes and transitions to psychosis. A number of socioenvironmental factors are linked to an increase risk of developing psychosis, of which childhood trauma is widely acknowledged. The current review aims to examine what impact trauma has on the ARMS by reviewing reported relationships between trauma variables and transition to psychosis, ARMS severity, adaptive functioning and comorbid symptomology from both cross sectional and prospective design studies. A literature search was conducted for all relevant original research articles published in the English language up to December 2015 using 3 electronic databases: PsycINFO, Web of Science and PubMed. A total of 6 papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. Trauma was found to have a significant impact on the ARMS observed through reported relationships between trauma variables and transition to psychosis, ARMS severity, adaptive functioning and comorbid symptomology. Sexual trauma demonstrated the most consistent trauma variable to impact the ARMS. Individuals with an ARMS who have experienced sexual trauma are at a heightened risk of poorer outcomes and transitions to psychosis. Further prospective design studies are required to examine this observation further.

AB  - Objective To conduct a systematic review of pain anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and fear of pain measures psychometrically established in youth with chronic pain. The review addresses three specific aims: (1) to identify measures used in youth with chronic pain, summarizing their content, psychometric properties, and use; (2) to use evidence-based assessment criteria to rate each measure according to the Society of Pediatric Psychology (SPP) guidelines; (3) to pool data across studies for meta-analysis of shared variance in psychometric performance in relation to the primary outcomes of pain intensity, disability, generalized anxiety, and depression. Methods We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and relevant literature for possible studies to include. We identified measures studied in youth with chronic pain that assessed pain anxiety, pain catastrophizing, or fear of pain and extracted the item-level content. Study and participant characteristics, and correlation data were extracted for summary and meta-analysis, and measures were rated using the SPP evidence-based assessment criteria. Results Fifty-four studies (84 papers) met the inclusion criteria, including seven relevant measures: one assessed pain anxiety, three pain catastrophizing, and three fear of pain. Overall, five measures were rated as "well established." We conducted meta-analyses on four measures with available data. We found significant positive correlations with the variables pain intensity, disability, generalized anxiety, and depression. Conclusion Seven measures are available to assess pain anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and fear of pain in young people with chronic pain, and most are well established. We present implications for practice and directions for future research.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review and evaluation of research examining multidimensional perfectionism and cortisol in non-clinical populations. A literature search yielded 6 studies examining cortisol reactivity (CR) and 2 studies examining cortisol awakening response (CAR). Each study was rated in terms of the methodological quality and evidence for the relationship between dimensions of perfectionism (perfectionistic strivings, PS, and perfectionistic concerns, PC) and cortisol was recorded. For CR, 1 study was rated as low methodological quality, 1 study was rated as medium methodological quality, and 4 studies were rated as high methodological quality. Of the high-quality studies, one study provided supportive evidence of a positive relationship between PC and CR, and a further 3 provided inconclusive/null evidence. The only high-quality study to examine the relationship between PS and CR provided inconclusive/null evidence. For CAR, 1 study was rated as low methodological quality and the other as medium methodological quality. Based on these findings, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the relationship between perfectionism and cortisol. Moreover, if research continues in the same vein, future research is unlikely to examine the relationship appropriately. We therefore recommend future research follows expert guidelines regarding assessing cortisol responses.

AB  - On the basis of the parenting stress model we compared levels of parenting stress in families with and without a child with a chronic physical condition and analysed correlates of parenting stress in families with a child with a chronic condition. A systematic search through electronic databases identified 547 relevant studies that were included in a random-effects meta-analysis. Parents of children with a chronic condition showed small to moderate elevations of general parenting stress and stress related to the parent-child relationship in particular. They showed moderate to large elevations in health-related parenting stress. Parents of children with cancer, cerebral palsy, HIV infection or AIDS, and spina bifida showed the highest levels of parenting stress. Stress levels also varied by illness severity and duration, child age, parental gender and mental health, marital status, marital quality, and levels of perceived support. Behaviour problems of the child and low parental mental health were the strongest correlates of parenting stress. The present results assist with identifying parents at highest needs for interventions aimed at reducing parenting stress. These interventions should address the reduction of child behaviour problems, the promotion of parental mental health, the increase in marital quality and social support in general, and skills for dealing with stressors.

AB  - The relative safety of antidepressants during pregnancy has received substantial attention, but most syntheses fail to account for mental illness effects. We aimed to evaluate the literature comparing low birth weight (LBW) and neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural outcomes for children whose mothers took antidepressants in pregnancy compared to those whose mothers had common mental disorders, or symptoms, but who did not take antidepressants during pregnancy. A systematic review was conducted searching PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase in January 2015. A modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality. Eleven cohort studies were included: four reporting a LBW outcome (all with higher risk of bias) and seven reporting a neurodevelopmental outcome (five with higher risk of bias). We found only limited evidence of gestational age-adjusted LBW in exposed children in two studies which had a higher risk of bias and did not control for depressive symptom severity. Only five (7.5%) neurodevelopmental outcomes and one (12.5%) neurobehavioural outcome showed evidence of a statistically significant effect, three out of four were from studies with a higher risk of bias. There is little robust evidence indicating a detrimental effect of antidepressant use during pregnancy on LBW and neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural outcomes. More rigorous study designs are needed.

AB  - When the follicle reserve, which is developed solely during the fetal period, is depleted, women enter menopause. Intrauterine and childhood adverse conditions might affect the ovarian capacity by influencing follicle production in the first trimester, limiting the initial follicle pool or mediate an accelerated follicular loss thereafter. To investigate if adverse early life influences result in younger age at menopause, the following online databases were systematically searched: PubMed, EMBASE, CINHAL (EBSCO) and Cochrane library (Wiley) up to 1 January 2017. Eligibility, data extraction and quality assessment was independently performed by two researchers. A total of 5278 studies were identified, 11 studies were deemed eligible and included. Nine were cohort studies, 1 case-control study and 1 twin study. Due to the diversity of reported data and risk estimates we were unable to pool data or perform meta-analysis on pooled data. Prenatal and childhood exposure to famine was significantly associated to an earlier age at menopause in three studies. Mean differences in age at menopause varied from 4 months up to 1.7 years between famine exposed and unexposed women. Three studies described a significant association between a low weight at ages 1 or 2 and a younger age at menopause. A younger age at menopause was associated with a higher weight at birth in only one study and with a high ponderal index, a measure for fatness at birth in another study. None of the nine studies reporting on low birth weight and age at natural menopause find a significant association.

AB  - This study reviewed recently published scientific literature on the use of portable EEG technology (PEEGT) in educational research. After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, 22 relevant papers were located and included in the study. The results indicate that (1) PEEGT was mainly used in seven research topics: reading context, presentation patterns of learning materials, interactive behavior, edutainment, e-learning, motor skill acquisition, and promoting learning performance with PEEGT; (2) PEEGT was mainly used to evaluate attention and meditation of participants; (3) most EEG experiments were endured less than 60 min, the sample sizes of EEG experiments were small, the largest research group was university students, portable EEG devices used in educational research were mainly developed by NeuroSky Inc. and Emotiv Inc., and 45% of the papers depicted the validity of PEEGT by citing previous studies and only 3 papers assessed the validity of PEEGT by experiments. As PEEGT is still at its early developing stage, it encounters with two big challenges: considerable measuring errors, and inconvenience to wear in large-scale samples and long-time. It also has some research limitations: not only lack of studies in naturalistic classrooms settings and sports education, but also lack of studies in investigating all cognitive aspects. PEEGT would be employed extensively in education field in the near future if it can address the challenges mentioned above. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is often accompanied by clinically identified depression. Providing effective pharmacotherapies that concomitantly treat both motor and psychological symptoms can pose a challenge to physicians. For this reason, alternatives to standard anti-depressant treatments, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), have been evaluated within the Parkinson's population.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted on the PubMed database for all studies that evaluated rTMS as a treatment in patients with both depression and PD. A meta-analysis was performed on all studies that reported mean pre-and post-rTMS depression inventory scores. Widely used depression inventories included both self-report and clinician-administered measures. Effect size for individual study groups and across all studies was calculated.
   Results: Six of 7 studies meeting inclusion criteria reported significantly improved depression scores, large effect sizes, and significant p-values. Total weighted average effect size was calculated at 1.32 across all study groups that applied rTMS.
   Conclusions: Across all but one study, rTMS appears to effectively reduce depression scores among self-reported and clinician administered inventories. The total weight average effect size showed that, when considering study sample sizes and degree of findings, this form of neurostimulation can relieve PD patients of their depressive symptoms. Further, rTMS is a promising alternative to traditional anti-depressant therapies when treating refractory depression in patients with PD.

AB  - Background: Monitoring and evaluation of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) programs is critical to facilitating learning and providing accountability to stakeholders. As part of an inter-agency effort to develop recommendations on MHPSS monitoring and evaluation, this scoping review aimed to identify the terminology and focus of monitoring and evaluation frameworks in this field.
   Methods: We collected program documents (logical frameworks (logframes) and theories of change) from members of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on MHPSS, and systematically searched the peer-reviewed literature across five databases. We included program documents and academic articles that reported on monitoring and evaluation of MHPSS in low-and middle-income countries describing original data. Inclusion and data extraction were conducted in parallel by independent reviewers. Thematic analysis was used to identify common language in the description of practices and the focus of each monitoring and evaluation framework. Logframe outcomes were mapped to MHPSS activity categories.
   Results: We identified 38 program documents and 89 peer-reviewed articles, describing monitoring and evaluation of a wide range of MHPSS activities. In both program documents and peer-reviewed literature there was a lack of specificity and overlap in language used for goals and outcomes. Well-validated, reliable instruments were reported in the academic literature, but rarely used in monitoring and evaluation practices. We identified six themes in the terminology used to describe goals and outcomes. Logframe outcomes were more commonly mapped to generic program implementation activities (e.g. "capacity building") and those related to family and community support, while outcomes from academic articles were most frequently mapped to specialized psychological treatments.
   Conclusions: Inconsistencies between the language used in research and practice and discrepancies in measurement have broader implications for monitoring and evaluation in MHPSS programs in humanitarian settings within low-and middle-income countries. This scoping review of the terminology commonly used to describe monitoring and evaluation practices and their focus within MHPSS programming highlights areas of importance for the development of a more standardized approach to monitoring and evaluation.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), developed in the 30's by Bini and Cerletti, remains a key element of the therapeutic armamentarium in psychiatry, particularly for severe and life-threatening psychiatric symptoms. However, despite its well-established clinical efficacy, the prescription of ECT has declined constantly over the years due to concerns over its safety (cognitive side effects) and an increasingly negative public perception. As for other treatments in the field of psychiatry, ECT is well suited to a personalized approach that would increment its efficacy, as well as reducing the impact of side effects. This should be based on the priori identification of sub-populations of patients sharing common clinical and biological features that predict a good response to ECT. In this review we have selectively reviewed the evidence on clinical and biological predictors of ECT response. Clinical features such as an older age, presence of psychotic and melancholic depression, a high severity of suicide behavior, and speed of response, appear to be shared by ECT good responders with depressive symptoms. In mania, a greater severity of the index episode, and a reduction of whole brain cortical blood flow are associated with ECT good response. Biological determinants of ECT response in depressive patients are the presence of pre-treatment hyperconnectivity between key areas of brain circuitry of depression, as well as of reduced glutamine/glutamate levels, particularly in the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC). Furthermore, pre ECT high plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) levels, as well as of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and low pre-ECT levels of S-100 B protein, appear to predict ECT response. Finally, polymorphisms within the genes encoding for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the dopamine 2 receptor gene (DRD2), the dopamine receptor 3 gene (DRD3), the cathechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), the serotonin-transporter (5-HTF), the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 A receptor (5-HT2A), and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), appear to predict a good response to ECT. The integration of these data in specific treatment algorithm might facilitate a personalized approach in ECT. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
