AB  - IMPORTANCE With a prevalence of 4% to 13% in the United States, autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is a major health problem. Besides somatic complications, patients with AIT can also experience psychiatric disorders. The extent of these organic psychiatric diseases in patients with AIT, however, is so far not commonly known.
   OBJECTIVE To provide meta-analytic data on the association of depression and anxiety with AIT.
   DATA SOURCES Google Scholar, the EBSCO Host databases, theWeb of Knowledge, and PubMed were searched from inception through December 5, 2017. Articles identified were reviewed and reference lists were searched manually.
   STUDY SELECTION Case-control studies that reported the association between AIT and either depression or anxiety disorders or both were included.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extractionwas performed by multiple observers following the PRISMA guidelines. Two univariate random-effects meta-analyses were performed, and moderators were tested with Bonferroni-corrected meta-regression analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results. Small study effects were assessed with funnel plots and the Egger test.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The odds ratio of patients with AIT and depression compared with a healthy control group, as well as the odds ratio of patients with AIT and anxiety disorders compared with a healthy control group.
   RESULTS Nineteen studies comprising 21 independent samples were included, with a total of 36 174 participants (35 168 for depression and 34 094 for anxiety). Patients with AIT, Hashimoto thyroiditis, or subclinical or overt hypothyroidism had significantly higher scores on standardized depression instruments, with an odds ratio of 3.56 (95% CI, 2.14-5.94; I-2 = 92.1%). For anxiety disorders, patients with AIT, Hashimoto thyroiditis, or subclinical or overt hypothyroidism had an odds ratio of 2.32 (95% CI, 1.40-3.85; I2 = 89.8%). Funnel plot asymmetry was detected for studies of depression. Study quality assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case-control studies (mean [SD] score: anxiety, 5.77 [1.17]; depression, 5.65 [1.14]; of a possible maximum score of 9) and proportion of females did not modulate the meta-analytic estimate, whereas mean age did.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This meta-analysis establishes the association between AIT and depression and anxiety disorders. Patients with AIT exhibit an increased chance of developing symptoms of depression and anxiety or of receiving a diagnosis of depression and anxiety disorders. This finding has important implications for patients and could lead to the choice of early treatment-and not only psychotherapeutic treatment-of the organic disorder.

AB  - Background: An increasing number of reports suggest early life exposures result in adverse effects in offspring who were never directly exposed; this phenomenon is termed "transgenerational inheritance." Given concern for public health implications for potential effects of exposures transmitted to subsequent generations, it is critical to determine how widespread and robust this phenomenon is and to identify the range of exposures and possible outcomes.
   Objectives: This scoping report examines the evidence for transgenerational inheritance associated with exposure to a wide range of stressors in humans and animals to identify areas of consistency, uncertainty, data gaps, and to evaluate general risk of bias issues for the transgenerational study design.
   Methods: A protocol was developed to collect and categorize the literature into a systematic evidence map for transgenerational inheritance by health effects, exposures, and evidence streams following the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) approach for conducting literature-based health assessments.
   Results: A PubMed search yielded 63,758 unique records from which 257 relevant studies were identified and categorized into a systematic evidence map by evidence streams (46 human and 211 animal), broad health effect categories, and exposures. Data extracted from the individual studies are available in the Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC) program. There are relatively few bodies of evidence where multiple studies evaluated the same exposure and the same or similar outcomes. Studies evaluated for risk of bias generally had multiple issues in design or conduct.
   Conclusions: The evidence mapping illustrated that risk of bias, few studies, and heterogeneity in exposures and endpoints examined present serious limitations to available bodies of evidence for assessing transgenerational effects. Targeted research is suggested to addressed inconsistencies and risk of bias issues identified, and thereby establish more robust bodies of evidence to critically assess transgenerational effects - particularly by adding data on exposure-outcome pairs where there is some evidence (i.e., reproductive, metabolic, and neurological effects).

AB  - Objective Cognitive dysfunction has been reported in individuals with fibromyalgia. However, findings regarding cognitive function examined using neuropsychological tests have been inconsistent. The aim of the study was to determine domain-specific cognitive impairment in patients with fibromyalgia compared with healthy controls.
   Methods We conducted a meta-analysis that systematically searched six databases (PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) for articles published before September 2017.
   Results Twenty-three case-control studies with a total of 2096 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Cognitive function was significantly lower (g = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.60-1.15) in individuals with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls. Large effect sizes were found in learning/memory and attention/psychomotor speed (g = 0.94, p = .013; g = 1.22, p < .001, respectively); medium effect sizes were reported in executive function and working memory (g = 0.72, p < .001; g = 0.75, p < .001, respectively). Depression and anxiety scores were associated with the effect size of group differences in cognitive function (B = 0.11, p < .001, 95% CI = 0.09-0.13; B = 0.02, p < .001, 95% CI = 0.01-0.02, respectively).
   Conclusions Cognitive impairment across different cognitive domains was found in individuals with fibromyalgia compared with healthy controls. Mood states (depression and anxiety) may explain the heterogeneity across studies.

AB  - Background: The adverse effects of loneliness and of poor perceived social support on physical health and mortality are established, but no systematic synthesis is available of their relationship with the outcomes of mental health problems over time. In this systematic review, we aim to examine the evidence on whether loneliness and closely related concepts predict poor outcomes among adults with mental health problems.
   Methods: We searched six databases and reference lists for longitudinal quantitative studies that examined the relationship between baseline measures of loneliness and poor perceived social support and outcomes at follow up. Thirty-four eligible papers were retrieved. Due to heterogeneity among included studies in clinical populations, predictor measures and outcomes, a narrative synthesis was conducted.
   Results: We found substantial evidence from prospective studies that people with depression who perceive their social support as poorer have worse outcomes in terms of symptoms, recovery and social functioning. Loneliness has been investigated much less than perceived social support, but there is some evidence that greater loneliness predicts poorer depression outcome. There is also some preliminary evidence of associations between perceived social support and outcomes in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders.
   Conclusions: Loneliness and quality of social support in depression are potential targets for development and testing of interventions, while for other conditions further evidence is needed regarding relationships with outcomes.

AB  - Back ground : Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent, recurrent, and potentially chronic disorder. Identifying risk factors and underlying mechanisms to inform preventive and therapeutic interventions is therefore imperative. Emotion regulation is a proposed factor in the development and maintenance of MDD. The aim of the present review was to summarize and synthesize research on self-reported emotion regulation strategy use and emotion regulation abilities in adults diagnosed with current and remitted MDD.
   Methods : Seventy-two eligible studies were retrieved from databases through a systematic literature search. Group differences between individuals with current MDD, remitted MDD, and healthy controls were calculated using meta-analytic procedures. Meta-regression analyses investigated potential moderator effects on emotion regulation difficulties.
   Results : Results indicated that individuals with current MDD report higher maladaptive emotion regulation strategy use for avoidance (Hedges' g = 1.3), rumination (g = 2.1), and suppression (g = 1.1) compared to healthy controls. Also, they reported lower adaptive emotion regulation strategy use for acceptance (g = -1.0), problem solving (g = -1.0), and reappraisal (g = -0.7). Individuals with current MDD reported limited general emotion regulation abilities, indicated by higher alexithymia (g = 1.45), lower emotional awareness (g = -0.95), emotional clarity (g = -1.50) and emotional tolerance (g = -1.89). Similar results were found in individuals with remitted MDD for avoidance (g = 1.0), rumination (g = 1.1), suppression (g = 0.6), and general emotion regulation abilities. However, no difference was found between individuals with remitted MDD and healthy controls for adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Meta-regression analyses suggest that age of illness onset, comorbid anxiety and duration of remission influence emotion regulation.
   Conclusion : The present review and meta-analysis indicates that individuals with current and remitted MDD have difficulties with emotion regulation compared to individuals who have never been depressed. Although depressive symptoms improve, emotion regulation difficulties may continue, and could be a contributing factor to relapse. Our findings inform future research on emotion regulation and psychotherapeutic interventions.

AB  - Despite increasing research and clinical interest in delivering psychosocial interventions for children affected by war, little research has been conducted on the underlying mechanisms of change associated with these interventions. This review aimed to identify these processes in order to inform existing interventions and highlight research gaps. A systematic review of reviews was conducted drawing from academic databases (PubMed, PILOTS, Cochrane Library for Systematic Reviews) and field resources (e.g. Medecins Sans Frontieres and the Psychosocial Centre of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies), with extracted data analysed using Thematic Content Analysis. Thirteen reviews of psychosocial or psychological interventions for children and adolescents (<25 years old) affected by war, armed conflict or political violence were identified, covering over 30 countries worldwide. Qualitative analysis identified 16 mechanisms of change, one of which was an adverse mechanism. Themes included protection from harm, play, community and family capacity building, strengthening relationships with caregivers, improved emotional regulation, therapeutic rapport, trauma processing, and cognitive restructuring; with the adverse mechanism relating to the pathologising of normal reactions. However, only 4 mechanisms were supported by strong empirical evidence, with only moderate or poor quality evidence supporting the other mechanisms. The poor quality of supporting evidence limits what can be inferred from this review's findings, but serves to highlight clinically informed mechanisms of change for existing and widely used non-specialist interventions in the field, which urgently need rigorous scientific testing to inform their continued practice.

AB  - Depression is the most commonly experienced mental health condition in adults with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, it is unclear what tools are currently being used to assess depression in ASC, or whether tools need to be adapted for this group. This systematic review therefore aimed to identify tools used to assess depression in adults with and without ASC, and then evaluate these tools for their appropriateness and measurement properties. Medline, PsychINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched for studies of depression in: (a) adults with ASC, without co-morbid intellectual disability; and (b) adults from the general population without co-morbid conditions. Articles examining the measurement properties of these tools were then searched for using a methodological filter in PubMed, and the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the COSMIN checklist. Twelve articles were identified which utilized three tools to assess depression in adults with ASC, but only one article which assessed the measurement properties of one of these tools was identified and thus evaluated. Sixty-four articles were identified which utilized five tools to assess depression in general population adults, and fourteen articles had assessed the measurement properties of these tools. Overall, two tools were found to be robust in their measurement properties in the general populationthe Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Crucially only one study was identified from the COSMIN search, which showed weak evidence in support of the measurement properties of the BDI-II in an ASC sample. Implications for effective measurement of depression in ASC are discussed. Autism Res2018, 11: 738-754. (c) 2018 The Authors Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
   Lay SummaryDepression is the most common mental health problem experienced by adults with autism. However, the current study found very limited evidence regarding how useful tools developed for the general population are for adults with autism. We therefore suggest how these tools could be adapted to more effectively assess depression in adults with autism, and improve these individuals access to mental health assessment and support.

AB  - Variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in bipolar disorder, depression, or other psychiatric disorders have been studied for decades, since mitochondrial dysfunction was first suggested in the brains of patients with these diseases. Candidate gene association studies initially resulted in findings compatible with the mitochondrial dysfunction hypothesis. Many of those studies, however, were conducted with modest sample sizes (N, 1000), which could cause false positive findings. Furthermore, the DNA samples examined in these studies, including genome-wide association studies, were generally derived from peripheral tissues. One key unanswered question is whether there is an association between mood disorders and somatic mtDNA mutations (deletions and point mutations) in brain regions that accumulate a high amount of mtDNA mutations and/or are involved in the regulation of mood. Two lines of robust evidence supporting the importance of mtDNA mutations in brain tissues for mood disorders have come from clinical observation of mitochondrial disease patients who carry primary mtDNA mutations or accumulate secondary mtDNA mutations due to nuclear mutations and an animal model study. More than half of mitochondrial disease patients have comorbid mood disorders, and mice with neuronspecific accumulation of mtDNA mutations show spontaneous depression-like episodes. In this review, we first summarize the current knowledge of mtDNA and its genetics and discuss what mtDNA analysis tells us about neuropsychiatric disorders based on an example of Parkinson's disease. We also discuss challenges and future directions beyond mtDNA analysis toward an understanding of the pathophysiology of "idiopathic" mood disorders.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proved useful for several movement disorders (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia), in which first and/or second line pharmacological treatments were inefficacious. Initial evidence of DBS efficacy exists for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and impulse control disorders. Ethical concerns have been raised about the use of an invasive surgical approach involving the central nervous system in patients with possible impairment in cognitive functioning and decision-making capacity. Most of the disorders in which DBS has been used might present with alterations in memory, attention, and executive functioning, which may have an impact on the mental capacity to give informed consent to neurosurgery. Depression, anxiety, and compulsivity are also common in DBS candidate disorders, and could also be associated with an impaired capacity to consent to treatment or clinical research. Despite these issues, there is limited empirical knowledge on the decision-making levels of these patients. The possible informed consent issues of DBS will be discussed by focusing on the specific treatable diseases.

AB  - Growing evidence has suggested that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) could have beneficial effects on the acute phase of depression and on the prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence. Despite growing clinical interest, the effects of MBIs on brain functioning in patients with MDD remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the changes in brain functioning associated with MBIs in patients with MDD. A systematic search was conducted, and of the 56 articles found, 8 were eligible. MBIs have modulatory effects on several brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, such as the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, and the parietal cortex. These regions have been implicated in self-awareness, attention and emotion regulation. Some of these findings were consistent with the effects of MBIs observed in healthy subjects and patients with other psychiatric disorders, especially enhanced activity in the frontal and subcortical regions related to the improved somatosensory awareness. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of MBIs in MDD.

AB  - Background. The term "dual diagnosis" (DD) has been used in clinical practice for years. However, there is confusion about these medical cases, which consist in the presence of both a psychiatric disorder and a substance abuse disorder (in this case, alcohol). There are evidences that in the alcohol use disorder (AUD) population, 50.3% of patients had a psychiatric comorbidity during their lifetime. Nevertheless, to these days there are not any thorough guidelines for the management of these patients. A precise nosography would prevent delay in diagnosis and treatment and all the self-evident negative outcomes of those delays. Materials and methods. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, including studies published between 1980 and 2015. Search terms were: "guidelines", "treatment", "comorbidity", "substance abuse", "alcohol", "dual-diagnosis", "etiopathogenesis", "outpatient", "inpatient", "unit", "diagnosis". Out of 1045 titles, 43 studies were included in this article for their relevance on definition and nosography of DD. Results. Taking into account the state of art available in the literature, we contributed to clarify the definition of DD in the alcohol addiction field. Clinical data confirm high prevalence of DD, and allow to better describe and understand the complex relationship between alcohol dependence and other psychiatric diseases. Conclusions. We believe that a clear nosographic framework and a precise diagnostic process are essential for a timely management of every case, using specific guidelines to standardize and improve clinical practice. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which introduces dimensional approach, could be a useful tool to improve diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined the efficacy and safety of adjunctive N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant drug, in treating major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.
   Methods: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CNKI, CBM, and WanFang databases were independently searched and screened by two researchers. Standardized mean differences (SMDs), risk ratios, and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed.
   Results: Six RCTs (n = 701) of NAC for schizophrenia (three RCTs, n = 307), bipolar disorder (two RCTs, n = 125), and MDD (one RCT, n = 269) were identified and analyzed as separate groups. Adjunctive NAC significantly improved total psychopathology (SMD = -0.74, 95% CI: -1.43, -0.06; I-2 = 84%, P = 0.03) in schizophrenia, but it had no significant effect on depressive and manic symptoms as assessed by the Young Mania Rating Scale in bipolar disorder and only a small effect on major depressive symptoms. Adverse drug reactions to NAC and discontinuation rates between the NAC and control groups were similar across the three disorders.
   Conclusions: Adjunctive NAC appears to be a safe treatment that has efficacy for schizophrenia, but not for bipolar disorder or MDD. Further higher quality RCTs are warranted to determine the role of adjunctive NAC in the treatment of major psychiatric disorders.

AB  - This paper applies evolutionary and functional constructivism approaches to the discussion of psychological taxonomies, as implemented in the neurochemical model Functional Ensemble of Temperament (FET). FET asserts that neurochemical systems developed in evolution to regulate functionaldynamical aspects of construction of actions: orientation, selection (integration), energetic maintenance, and management of automatic behavioural elements. As an example, the paper reviews the neurochemical mechanisms of interlocking between emotional dispositions and performance capacities. Research shows that there are no specific neurophysiological systems of positive or negative affect, and that emotional valence is rather an integrative product of many brain systems during estimations of needs and the capacities required to satisfy these needs. The interlocking between emotional valence and functional aspects of performance appears to be only partial since all monoamine and opioid receptor systems play important roles in non-emotional aspects of behaviour, in addition to emotionality. This suggests that the Positive/Negative Affect framework for DSM/ICD classifications of mental disorders oversimplifies the structure of non-emotionality symptoms of these disorders. Contingent dynamical relationships between neurochemical systems cannot be represented by linear statistical models searching for independent dimensions (such as factor analysis); nevertheless, these relationships should be reflected in psychological and psychiatric taxonomies.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Diverse perspectives on diversity: multi-disciplinary approaches to taxonomies of individual differences'.

AB  - Background: Survivors of complex childhood trauma (CT) such as sexual abuse show poorer outcomes compared to single event trauma survivors. A growing number of studies investigate Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no systematic reviews have focused on EMDR treatment for CT as an intervention for both adults and children. This study therefore systematically reviewed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of EMDR on PTSD symptoms in adults and children exposed to CT.
   Methods: Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched in October 2017. Randomized controlled trials which recruited adult and children with experience of CT, which compared EMDR to alternative treatments or control conditions, and which measured PTSD symptoms were included. Study methodology quality was evaluated with Platinum Standard scale.
   Results: Six eligible RCTs of 251 participants were included in this systematic review. The results indicated that EMDR was associated with reductions in PTSD symptoms, depression and/or anxiety both post-treatment and at follow-up compared with all other alternative therapies (cognitive behavior therapy, individual/group therapy and fluoxetine) and control treatment (pill placebo, active listening, EMDR delayed treatment, and treatment as usual). However, studies suffered from significant heterogeneity in study populations, length of EMDR treatment, length of follow-up, comparison groups, and outcome measures. One study had a high risk of bias.
   Discussion: This systematic review suggests that there is growing evidence to support the clinical efficacy of EMDR in treating CT in both children and adults. However, conclusions are limited by the small number of heterogenous trials. Further RCTs with standardized methodologies, as well as studies addressing real world challenges in treating CT are required.

AB  - Objective: There is growing evidence supporting the association between migration and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Considering the growing population of migrants and the particularities of providing culturally sensitive mental health care for these persons, clinicians should be kept up to date with the latest information regarding this topic. The objective of this study was to critically review the literature regarding migration, trauma and PTSD, and mental health services.
   Methods: The PubMed, SciELO, LILACS, and ISI Web of Science databases were searched for articles published in Portuguese, English, Spanish, or French, and indexed from inception to 2017. The following keywords were used: migration, mental health, mental health services, stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and trauma.
   Results: Migration is associated with specific stressors, mainly related to the migratory experience and to the necessary process of acculturation occurring in adaptation to the host country. These major stressors have potential consequences in many areas, including mental health. The prevalence of PTSD among migrants is very high (47%), especially among refugees, who experience it at nearly twice the rate of migrant workers.
   Conclusions: Mental health professionals must be trained to recognize and provide appropriate care for posttraumatic and/or stress-related disorders among migrants.

AB  - The addictive use of video games is recognized as a problem with clinical relevance and is included in international diagnostic manuals and classifications of diseases. The association between "Internet addiction" and mental health has been well documented across a range of investigations. However, a major drawback of these studies is that no controls have been placed on the type of Internet use investigated. The aim of this study is to review systematically the current literature in order to explore the association between Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and psychopathology. An electronic literature search was conducted using PubMed, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Google Scholar (r.n. CRD42018082398). The effect sizes for the observed correlations were identified or computed. Twenty-four articles met the eligibility criteria. The studies included comprised 21 cross-sectional and three prospective designs. Most of the research was conducted in Europe. The significant correlations reported comprised: 92% between IGD and anxiety, 89% with depression, 85% with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and 75% with social phobia/anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Most of the studies reported higher rates of IGD in males. The lack of longitudinal studies and the contradictory results obtained prevent detection of the directionality of the associations and, furthermore, show the complex relationship between both phenomena.

AB  - Purpose of Review There has been growing clinical and research attention to the unique developmental stage of emerging adulthood. This stage is a time of significant change and growth for all individuals, as it includes identity exploration, emotional, behavioral, and financial independence from caregivers, and completion of educational or vocational requirements.
   Recent Findings Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health diagnoses among emerging adults, and individuals suffering from these disorders often experience compounding functional impairments across health, financial, and social domains. While evidence-based treatments exist for both child/adolescent anxiety disorders and adult anxiety disorders, no specialized assessment or treatment methods have been established for the unique period of emerging adulthood.
   Summary Our review examines literature pertinent to anxiety disorders in emerging adulthood and describes a novel, specialized intervention to address the unique challenges faced by anxious emerging adults. The Launching Emerging Adults Program (LEAP) is a developmentally informed cognitive-behavioral treatment model that aims to simultaneously reduce anxiety symptoms and promote independence. We conclude with a discussion of lessons learned and future directions.

AB  - Objective: Emotion regulation (ER) includes a set of cognitive and attentional processes used to change or maintain emotional state. A small but growing body of research suggests that maladaptive ER might be a risk factor for the development of chronic pain. This review aims to summarize existing literature on the association between ER and chronic pain, and to determine whether the construct of ER may further enhance our understanding of the risk and protective factors that may contribute to the onset and maintenance of chronic pain.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the search terms "chronic pain" and "emotion regulation." Studies that measured both constructs across all age groups were included.
   Results: We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Nine studies were completed within the last five years, suggesting that the evaluation of ER as it relates to pain is a new line of research. Studies that measured "response-focused" ER found associations between maladaptive ER and pain. Studies that measured "antecedent focused" ER strategies were less likely to show a direct association with pain.
   Conclusion: Maladaptive response-focused ER may be an important risk factor in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, as it is associated with pain and psychological comorbidities. Adding ER to chronic pain investigations may help to further explain individual differences in the risk and protective mechanisms that are known to influence chronic pain. Importantly, this line of research has potential to directly inform future interventions for patients with chronic pain.

AB  - Observations from clinical trials have frequently demonstrated that light therapy can be an effective therapy for seasonal and non-seasonal major depression. Despite the fact that light therapy is known to have several advantages over antidepressant drugs like a low cost, minimal side-effects, and fast onset of therapeutic effect, the mechanism underlying light therapy remains unclear. So far, it is known that light therapy modulates mood states and cognitive functions, involving circadian and non-circadian pathways from retinas into brain. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic effect of light on major depression and its relationship to direct retinal projections in the brain. We finally emphasize the function of the retino-raphe projection in modulating serotonin activity, which probably underlies the antidepressant effect of light therapy for depression.

AB  - Objectives Job stressors are known determinants of common mental disorders. Over the past 10 years, there has been evidence that job stressors may also be risk factors for suicidality. The current paper sought to examine this topic through the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to date.
   Methods We used a three-tier search strategy of seven electronic databases. Studies were included if they reported on a job stressor or job-related stress as an exposure and suicide ideation, self-harm, suicide attempt or suicide as an outcome. Two researchers independently screened articles. All extracted effect estimates were converted to log-transformed ORs.
   Results There were 22 studies that were included in meta-analysis. Overall, exposure to job stressors was associated with elevated risk of suicide ideation and behaviours. The OR for suicide ideation (14 studies) ranged from 1.45 (95%CI 1.01 to 2.08) for poor supervisor and colleague support to 1.91 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.99) for job insecurity. For suicide (six studies), exposure to lower supervisor and collegial support produced an OR of 1.16 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.38), while low job control resulted in an OR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.50). There were only two studies that examined suicide attempt, both of which suggested an adverse effect of exposure to job stressors.
   Conclusions This study provides some evidence that job stressors may be related to suicidal outcomes. However, as most studies in the area were cross-sectional and observational in design, there is a need for longitudinal research to assess the robustness of observed associations.

AB  - Objective: Several countries have developed Clinical Practice Guidelines regarding treatment of perinatal depressive symptoms and perinatal use of antidepressant. We aimed to compare guidelines to guide clinicians in best clinical practice.
   Methods: An extensive search in guideline databases, MEDLINE and PsycINFO was performed. When no guidelines were (publicly) available online, we contacted psychiatric-, obstetric-, perinatal- and mood disorder societies of all first world countries and the five largest second world countries. Only Clinical Practice Guidelines adhering to quality criteria of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation instrument and including a systematic review of evidence were included. Data extraction focussed on recommendations regarding continuation or withdrawal of antidepressants and preferred treatment in newly depressed patients.
   Results: Our initial search resulted in 1094 articles. After first screening, 40 full-text articles were screened. Of these, 24 were excluded for not being an official Clinical Practice Guidelines. In total, 16 Clinical Practice Guidelines were included originating from 12 countries. Eight guidelines were perinatal specific and eight were general guidelines.
   Conclusion: During pregnancy, four guidelines advise to continue antidepressants, while there is a lack of evidence supporting this recommendation. Five guidelines do not specifically advise or discourage continuation. For new episodes, guidelines agree on psychotherapy (especially cognitive behavioural therapy) as initial treatment for mild to moderate depression and antidepressants for severe depression, with a preference for sertraline. Paroxetine is not preferred treatment for new episodes but switching antidepressants for ongoing treatment is discouraged (three guidelines). If mothers use antidepressants, observation of the neonate is generally recommended and breastfeeding encouraged.

AB  - Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are among the leading causes of disability, morbidity, and mortality worldwide. In addition to being serious mental illnesses, these disorders are associated with considerable systemic physiological dysfunction, including chronic inflammation and elevated oxidative stress. The advent of sophisticated sequencing techniques has led to a growing interest in the potential role of gut microbiota in human health and disease. Advances in this area have transformed our understanding of a number of medical conditions and have generated a new perspective suggesting that gut microbiota might be involved in the development and maintenance of brain/mental health. Animal models have demonstrated strong though indirect evidence for a contributory role of intestinal microbiota in psychiatric symptomatology and have linked the microbiome with neuropsychiatric conditions. We present a systematic review of clinical studies of microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The published literature has a number of limitations; however, the investigations suggest that these disorders are associated with reduced microbial diversity and show global community differences compared to non-psychiatric comparison samples. In some reports, specific microbial taxa were associated with clinical disease characteristics, including physical health, depressive and psychotic symptoms, and sleep, but little information on the functional potential of those community changes. Studies also suggest increased intestinal inflammation and permeability, which may be among the principal mechanisms by which microbial dysbiosis impacts systemic physiological functioning. We highlight gaps in the current literature and implications for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions, and outline future directions for microbiome research in psychiatry.

AB  - Background: Emotion (dys) regulation as well as the interventions for improving these difficulties are receiving a growing attention in the literature. The aim of the present paper was to conduct a systematic review about the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in both substance and behavioral addictions (BAs).
   Method: A literature search was conducted using Cochrane, PubMed, and Web of Science. Fifty-four randomized controlled trials published in English since 2009 to April 2017 were included into a narrative synthesis.
   Results: Mindfulness-based interventions were applied in a wide range of addictions, including substance use disorders (from smoking to alcohol, among others) and BAs (namely, gambling disorder). These treatments were successful for reducing dependence, craving, and other addiction-related symptoms by also improving mood state and emotion dysregulation. The most commonly used MBI approaches were as follows: Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention, Mindfulness Training for Smokers, or Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement, and the most frequent control group in the included studies was Treatment as Usual (TAU). The most effective approach was the combination of MBIs with TAU or other active treatments. However, there is a lack of studies showing the maintenance of the effect over time. Therefore, studies with longer follow-ups are needed.
   Conclusion: The revised literature shows support for the effectiveness of the MBIs. Future research should focus on longer follow-up assessments as well as on adolescence and young population, as they are a vulnerable population for developing problems associated with alcohol, drugs, or other addictions.

AB  - Background: Yoga is increasingly used as a therapeutic treatment and seems to improve psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders and depression. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence of yoga for reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Methods: The Cochrane Library, Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and IndMED were searched through July 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of yoga on symptoms of PTSD. Mean differences (MD) and standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. The quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation were graded according to the GRADE recommendations.
   Results: Seven RCTs (N = 284) were included. Meta-analysis revealed low quality evidence for clinically relevant effects of yoga on PTSD symptoms compared to no treatment (SMD = -1.10, 95% CI [-1.72, -0.47], p<.001, I-2 = 72%; MD=-13.11, 95% CI [-17.95, -8.27]); and very low evidence for comparable effects of yoga and attention control interventions (SMD = -0.31, 95% CI = [-0.84, 0.22], p=.25; I-2 = 43%). Very low evidence was found for comparable retention of patients in the trial for yoga and no treatment (OR = 0.68, 95% CI [0.06, 7.72]) or attention control interventions (OR = 0.66, 95% CI [0.10, 4.46]). No serious adverse events were reported.
   Limitations: Few RCTs with only limited sample size were available.
   Conclusions: Only a weak recommendation for yoga as an adjunctive intervention for PTSD can be made. More high quality research is needed to confirm or disconfirm these findings.

AB  - Background: Reviews show that exercise reduces many obesity-related physical health problems. However, it is unclear whether those benefits extend to psychosocial outcomes. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of exercise on psychosocial outcomes in adults with obesity.
   Method: Seven databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, Psyarticle, SportDiscus, Pro quest) were searched until October 2017 to identify relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Two reviewers independently screened articles against the following inclusion criteria: used an experimental or quasi-experimental design, involved adults with a body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2), delivered an intervention consisting of supervised or semi-supervised exercise, and assessed quality of life (QoL), depression, anxiety, and/or body image as outcomes.
   Results: Twenty two articles were included in this review; 16 were randomized controlled trials (RCT). Most interventions were supervised and lasted <= 16 weeks. Meta-analysis of RCTs with available data on QoL (k = 7) and depression (k = 4) did not show that exercise was significantly superior to control conditions for physical QoL (g = 0.16, 95%Cl [-0.05,0.37]), mental QoL (g = 0.20, 95%Cl 1-0.09,0.48j), or depression (g = 0.26, 95%Cl (-0.70,0.191). Only three studies reported data on anxiety and body image.
   Conclusions: Current evidence does not suggest exercise is successful in significantly enhancing psychosocial health in adults with obesity. Limitations associated with the reviewed studies could have biased the results toward a lack of effect. Additional high-quality RCT5 are needed to improve evidence based knowledge.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Animal assisted therapy (AAT) is a structured form of animal assisted intervention (AAI), which specifically adopts animals in healthcare services and education facilities, to achieve therapeutic goals. Although such interventions are widely used, nowadays, evidence supporting them is still largely lacking. A previously published review of the literature highlighted some promising effects of AAT on people presenting psychiatric disorders, though the quality of the studies included was generally low. In order to provide an update of recent evidence, the aim of this study was to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published since 2000, involving people affected by mental disorders and receiving AAT.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The following databases were searched: CINHAL, EBSCO Psychology and Behavioural Science Collection, PubMed and Web of Science. 115 papers were obtained and screened: 28 were from CINHAL, PsycINFO and Psychology and Behavioural Science Collection altogether, 15 from PubMed and 72 from Web of Science. In addition to this, grey literature and references of already published reviews and meta-analyses on the topic were searched, resulting in the addition of 6 further articles. After screening, 10 RCTs were included in this review.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Studies involving outpatients were more frequent than those involving inpatients; sample size was generally low. The majority of studies adopted scales routinely used in clinical trials, with a good level of validity and reliability. Five out of ten studies reported significant differences in the main outcomes favouring AAT. Most of the studies did not include any follow-up; yet, where prospective data were available, the benefits of AAT appeared long lasting. Drop-out rates were higher in studies involving outpatients. However, the only trial which enrolled both inpatients and outpatients showed a higher drop-out rate among the inpatients group, possibly due to their more severe psychopathology.
   CONCLUSIONS: Though a paucity of available studies partly limits our findings, AAT seems to improve empathy, socialization and communication, and to favour therapeutic alliance among patients who have difficulties with therapeutic programs adherence. AAT appears to be a feasible and well-received intervention, potentially with few or no side effects reported. However there is a need for further studies with larger sample sizes and high-quality research standards.

Although binge eating disorder (BED) formally appeared in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), after nearly two decades of research, it is still considered understudied in men. Objective. To carry out a literature review with the variables that have been relevant in research on BED in men, from 1994 to 2015. Method. The article search was conducted in Medline and PsycINFO databases. Results. Twenty-eight articles were analyzed, none specifically investigated male population. Men engage less in restrictive dieting than women (29.8% and 57.3%, respectively). Regarding body image, both men and women are prone to body dissatisfaction, although the ideal body is not necessarily the same. Regarding comorbidity, anxiety disorders are the most common ones in men with BED, in addition to the fact that they are more susceptible to substance abuse. Discussion and conclusion. Investigation on BED has mainly been conducted on female population, which suggests the need for more research on men that provides more empirical evidence.

AB  - In this article, we describe the case of a girl who suffers from a phobia to repetitive patterns, known as trypophobia. This condition has not yet been recognised by diagnostic taxonomies such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Trypophobia usually involves an intense and disproportionate fear towards holes, repetitive patterns, protrusions, etc., and, in general, images that present high-contrast energy at low and midrange spatial frequencies. It is commonly accompanied by neurovegetative symptoms. In the case we present here, the patient also suffered from generalised anxiety disorder and was treated with sertraline. After she was diagnosed, she showed symptoms of both fear and disgust towards trypophobic images. After some time following treatment, she only showed disgust towards said images. We finish this case report presenting a comprehensive literature review of the peer reviewed articles we retrieved after an exhaustive search about trypophobia, we discuss how this case report contributes to the understanding of this anxiety disorder, and what questions future studies should address in order to achieve a better understanding of trypophobia.

AB  - Question Despite mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders being highly prevalent, there is a worldwide gap between service need and provision. WHO launched its Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) in 2008, and the Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) in 2010. mhGAP-IG provides evidence-based guidance and tools for assessment and integrated management of priority MNS disorders in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), using clinical decision-making protocols. It targets a non-specialised primary healthcare audience, but has also been used by ministries, non-governmental organisations and academics, for mental health service scale-up in 90 countries. This review aimed to identify evidence to date for mhGAP-IG implementation in LMICs.
   Study selection and analysis We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge/Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, SciELO/Web of Science, Cochrane, Pubmed databases and Google Scholar for studies reporting evidence, experience or evaluation of mhGAP-IG in LMICs, in any language. Data were extracted from included papers, but heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis.
   Findings We conducted a systematic review of evidence to date, of mhGAP-IG implementation and evaluation in LMICs. Thirty-three included studies reported 15 training courses, 9 clinical implementations, 3 country contextualisations, 3 economic models, 2 uses as control interventions and 1 use to develop a rating scale. Our review identified the importance of detailed reports of contextual challenges in the field, alongside detailed protocols, qualitative studies and randomised controlled trials.
   Conclusions The mhGAP-IG literature is substantial, relative to other published evaluations of clinical practice guidelines: an important contribution to a neglected field.

   Methods: We searched and reviewed articles from nine online databases: PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Embase, DBpia, KISS, KMbase, KoreaMed and RISS, which were published up until January 2017. We identified 38 quantitative studies that examined psychiatric symptoms and pertinent factors for this population.
   Results: The relative risks of psychiatric symptoms among married immigrant women varied across diverse samples. We summarized the associated factors existing prior to and after marriage migration that may moderate their mental health consequences. We identified five key risk factors: acculturative stress, country of origin, family stress, domestic violence and extended family structure, and two protective factors: social support and marriage satisfaction, which were consistently supported by the included studies.
   Conclusion: With the paucity of prospective studies, longitudinal research is needed that addresses the long-term processes of married immigrant women's psychological adaptation and the underlying risk and protective factors at diverse settlement phases. Furthermore, we suggest that future research should focus on how women's personal attributes interact with macro-level, socio-cultural contexts, including familial relationship and the community social-support system. Future evidence-based policy and interventions should comprehensively address married immigrant women's socio-cultural, economic and mental health needs.

AB  - Stress is one of the world's largest health problems, leading to exhaustion, burnout, anxiety, a weak immune system, or even organ damage. In Germany, stress-induced work absenteeism costs about 20 billion Euros per year. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Central Federal Association of the public Health Insurance Funds in Germany ascribes particular importance to stress prevention and stress management as well as health enhancing measures. Building on current integrative and embodied stress theories, Creative Arts Therapies (CATs) or arts interventions are an innovative way to prevent stress and improve stress management. CATs encompass art, music, dance/movement, and drama therapy as their four major modalities. In order to obtain an overview of CATs and arts interventions' efficacy in the context of stress reduction and management, we conducted a systematic review with a search in the following data bases: Academic Search Complete, ERIC, Medline, Psyndex, PsycINFO and SocINDEX. Studies were included employing the PICOS principle and rated according to their evidence level. We included 37 studies, 73% of which were randomized controlled trials. 81.1% of the included studies reported a significant reduction of stress in the participants due to interventions of one of the four arts modalities.

AB  - Background: Headache is one of the most common complaints in children and adolescents and comorbidity rates are very high and the major associated diseases are depression, anxiety, atopic disorders, sleep, and behavioral disorders. In recent years, it has been highlighted that difficulties regulating emotions such as alexithymia have also been associated with diagnosis of somatization.
   Methods: We carried out a mini review analyzing the relation between alexithymia and primary headache (e.g., migraine and tension type headache) in children and adolescents by synthesizing the relevant studies in the literature on PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. Search terms were "alexithymia" combined with the "primary headache," " migraine," " tension type headache," " children," and "adolescents."
   Results: All analyzed studies found higher levels of alexithymia in children and adolescents with headache than control groups but there are different opinions about the relationship between headache and alexithymia. For example, some studies suggest that the association between headache and alexithymia in children may be due to an incomplete development of emotive competency or a general immature cognitive development, instead other studies found a correlation between headache symptoms, insecure attachment, and alexithymia. There seems to be also differences between children with migraine compared to those with tension type headache (TTH).
   Conclusion: There are some studies on adults suffering from headache or migraine and alexithymia, but there is only a moderate amount of research on pediatric age with different opinions and theories about this relationship. Further studies on children and adolescents are necessary to effectively understand this relationship and to help children to reduce headache and improve emotional consciousness.

AB  - Different types of studies suggest a link between maternal depression/anxiety and excessive infant crying (EC). However, comparability is hampered due to different designs, definitions and measurements. This systematic review investigates the specific role of maternal depression and anxiety considering them as preceding, concurrent and subsequent conditions of EC. A computerised literature search was conducted in January 2017 using Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science. After screening n = 399 records for inclusion/exclusion criteria, n = 33 records based on n = 30 projects were eligible for systematic qualitative data synthesis. All studies on maternal depression/anxiety and EC within the first 3 years of life were included. Included studies investigated predominantly maternal depression (25/30) and secondly maternal anxiety (17/30). Significant positive results were found in the majority of studies for maternal depression (21/25) as well as for maternal anxiety (12/17) in relation to EC. In-depth analyses further revealed that concurrent and subsequent maternal depression was robustly related with EC, whilst preceding maternal depression was not. In contrast, preceding and concurrent (but not subsequent) maternal anxiety was consistently related to subsequent EC. Maternal depression is more likely a correlate or even a consequence of EC, whereas anxiety is rather a temporally preceding condition and thus a potential risk factor or risk marker for both subsequent EC and associated maternal depression. Interventions for EC should address concurrent maternal depression, whilst preventive approaches might target preceding maternal anxiety as early as prior to or during pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Electrodermal activity (EDA) and other peripheral autonomic electrical parameters have been used as indicators of emotional states, including depressive states and suicidal state. We aimed to review EDA research systematically, focusing on EDA's usefulness as a biomarker for depression and suicidal behaviour.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases, following PRISMA guidelines. The initial screening of articles was based on titles and abstracts; then the full text was reviewed. A preliminary synthesis of findings was developed using tables, thematic analysis and quality ratings.
   Results: 1287 articles were screened and 77 relevant studies were identified and included in the systematic review. The studies were fairly consistent in maintaining that hypoactive electrodermal response is an established feature of patients affected by depression. There is also preliminary evidence that monitoring EDA may help to differentiate the phases of mood disorders. A few studies provided evidence that EDA can be used to differentiate acutely suicidal subjects from depressed patients who are not severely suicidal. Although EDA has been shown to be a valid, sensitive marker of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and violent suicidal behaviour, it also seems to be influenced to some extent by antidepressant treatment.
   Conclusions: Most of the studies summarised in this review are quite outdated and employed a variety of designs and methods to evaluate EDA. This limits the generalisability of the results and makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions about the role of EDA in real-world settings. Electrodermal hypoactivity seems to be a reliable feature of depression and a valid marker of suicidal risk. Nevertheless, the potential utility of EDA in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment planning for depression and suicidal behaviour, should be thoroughly studied.

AB  - Microglia are the predominant immune response cells and professional phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS) that have been shown to be important for brain development and homeostasis. These cells present a broad spectrum of phenotypes across stages of the lifespan and especially in CNS diseases. Their prevalence in all neurological pathologies makes it pertinent to reexamine their distinct roles during steady-state and disease conditions. A major question in the field is determining whether the clustering and phenotypical transformation of microglial cells are leading causes of pathogenesis, or potentially neuroprotective responses to the onset of disease. The recent explosive growth in our understanding of the origin and homeostasis of microglia, uncovering their roles in shaping of the neural circuitry and synaptic plasticity, allows us to discuss their emerging functions in the contexts of cognitive control and psychiatric disorders. The distinct mesodermal origin and genetic signature of microglia in contrast to other neuroglial cells also make them an interesting target for the development of therapeutics. Here, we review the physiological roles of microglia, their contribution to the effects of environmental risk factors (e.g., maternal infection, early-life stress, dietary imbalance), and their impact on psychiatric disorders initiated during development (e.g., Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD), hereditary diffuse leukoencephaly with spheroids, Rett syndrome, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)) or adulthood (e.g., alcohol and drug abuse, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, eating disorders and sleep disorders). Furthermore, we discuss the changes in microglial functions in the context of cognitive aging, and review their implication in neurodegenerative diseases of the aged adult (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's). Taking into account the recent identification of microglia-specific markers, and the availability of compounds that target these cells selectively in vivo, we consider the prospect of disease intervention via the microglial route.

AB  - Background: Following remission of an anxiety disorder or a depressive disorder, antidepressants are frequently discontinued and in the case of symptom occurrence reinstated. Reinstatement of antidepressants seems less effective in some patients, but an overview is lacking. This systematic review aimed to provide insight into the magnitude and risk factors of response failure after reinstatement of antidepressants in patients with anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: PubMed, Embase, and trial registers were systematically searched for studies in which patients: (1) had an anxiety disorder, a depressive disorder, OCD, or PTSD and (2) experienced failure to respond after reinstatement of a previously effective antidepressant. Results: Ten studies reported failure to respond following antidepressant reinstatement. The phenomenon was observed in 16.5% of patients with a depressive disorder, OCD, and social phobia and occurred in all common classes of antidepressants. The range of response failure was broad, varying between 3.8 and 42.9% across studies. No risk factors for failure to respond were investigated. The overall study quality was limited. Conclusion: Research investigating response failure is scarce and the study quality limited. Response failure occurred in a substantial minority of patients. Contributors to the relevance of this phenomenon are the prevalence of the investigated disorders, the number of patients being treated with antidepressants, and the occurrence of response failure for all common classes of antidepressants. This systematic review highlights the need for studies systematically investigating this phenomenon and associated risk factors. (C) 2018 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The putative role of gluten in the pathophysiology of severe mental illnesses remains uncertain and there is doubt about the possible benefit of gluten-free diets for individuals affected by psychosis and mood disorders. The objective of this review was to summarize the findings linking gluten related conditions to pathophysiological substrates implicated in schizophrenia and mood disorders and review the evidences of potential benefits of glute-free diets in these populations. A literature search was conducted within PubMed and Scielo databases including references from inception until March 1st 2017. The strategy search was to use the key words "gluten", "celiac disease", "wheat", "bipolar disorder", "mood disorders", "psychosis", "schizophrenia", "depression". In the review about the potential efficacy of gluten-free diets in severe mental illnesses, we included only studies with original data, including cross sectional and longitudinal studies and clinical trials. Book chapters, review articles and meta-analysis and republished data were excluded. Although the current available evidences suggest that people with celiac disease or gluten allergy could have a slightly higher risk of schizophrenia and mood disorders compared to the general population, the literature review reveals significant inaccuracies in the data. There is insufficient evidence to recommend gluten-free diets for populations with psychosis and mood disorders.

AB  - Objective: It is unclear whether blockade of the angiotensin system has effects on mental health. Our objective was to determine the impact of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers on mental health domain of quality of life.
   Study design: Meta-analysis of published literature.
   Data sources: PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov databases. The last search was conducted in January 2017.
   Study selection: Randomized controlled trials comparing any angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or AT1R blocker versus placebo or non-angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or non-AT1R blocker were selected. Study participants were adults without any major physical symptoms. We adhered to meta-analysis reporting methods as per PRISMA and the Cochrane Collaboration.
   Data synthesis: Eleven studies were included in the analysis. When compared with placebo or other antihypertensive medications, AT1R blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were associated with improved overall quality of life (standard mean difference = 0.11, 95% confidence interval = [0.08, 0.14], p < 0.0001), positive wellbeing (standard mean difference = 0.11, 95% confidence interval = [0.05, 0.17], p < 0.0001), mental (standard mean difference = 0.15, 95% confidence interval = [0.06, 0.25], p < 0.0001), and anxiety (standard mean difference = 0.08, 95% confidence interval = [0.01, 0.16], p < 0.0001) domains of QoL. No significant difference was found for the depression domain (standard mean difference = 0.05, 95% confidence interval = [0.02, 0.12], p = 0.15).
   Conclusions: Use of angiotensin blockers and inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension in otherwise healthy adults is associated with improved mental health domains of quality of life. Mental health quality of life was a secondary outcome in the included studies. Research specifically designed to analyse the usefulness of drugs that block the angiotensin system is necessary to properly evaluate this novel psychiatric target.

Autobiographical memory specificity and emotional disorder. Psychological Bulletin, 133(1), 122-148. doi:10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.122) posits that reduced autobiographical memory specificity, a key factor associated with the emergence and maintenance of emotional disorders, may result from heightened rumination. We provide the first meta-analysis of the relation between autobiographical memory specificity and trait rumination. PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and MEDLINE databases were searched and the following were extracted: the correlation between the number of specific memories recalled in the Autobiographical Memory Test and self-reported trait rumination scores, and its sub-factors - brooding and reflection. The pooled effect size for the correlation between memory specificity and trait rumination was small (d=-.05) and did not differ significantly from zero (p=.09). The effect sizes for the correlation with brooding and reflection were not significantly different from zero. There is limited support for the association between trait rumination and memory specificity suggested in CaRFAX.

AB  - Objectives: This narrative review article provides an overview of current psychotherapeutic approaches specific for adjustment disorders (ADs) and outlines future directions for theoretically-based treatments for this common mental disorder within a framework of stepped care.Methods: Studies on psychological interventions for ADs were retrieved by using an electronic database search within PubMed and PsycINFO, as well as by scanning the reference lists of relevant articles and previous reviews.Results: The evidence base for psychotherapies specifically targeting the symptoms of AD is currently rather weak, but is evolving given several ongoing trials. Psychological interventions range from self-help approaches, relaxation techniques, e-mental-health interventions, behavioural activation to talking therapies such as psychodynamic and cognitive behavioural therapy.Conclusions: The innovations in DSM-5 and upcoming ICD-11, conceptualising AD as a stress-response syndrome, will hopefully stimulate more research in regard to specific psychotherapeutic interventions for AD. Low intensive psychological interventions such as e-mental-health interventions for ADs may be a promising approach to address the high mental health care needs associated with AD and the limited mental health care resources in most countries around the world.

The aim of this systematic review is to update and summarise the published TCS findings in psychiatric disorders and critically address the question whether TCS may be a valuable tool for the diagnosis or differential diagnosis of psychiatric disorders similarly to the field of movement disorders.Methods: This paper provides detailed information about the perspectives and limitations of TCS, including guidelines for the scanning procedures, assessment of midbrain structures and discusses the potential causes of the ultrasound abnormalities in psychiatric disorders.Results: Changes in the echogenicity of subcortical brain structures were detected in different disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), bipolar disorder and depressive disorder. Although the physical properties of brain tissue underlying the echogenic features in TCS are largely unknown, no alternative technique provides the same insight into the specific central nervous structural characteristics.Conclusions: Urgent research questions to further clarify the underlying pathophysiological and structural alterations are further outlined to bring this promising technique to the clinic.

AB  - Background: Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are widely used in medical practice. Their discontinuation has been associated with a wide range of symptoms. The aim of this paper is to identify the occurrence, frequency, and features of withdrawal symptoms after SNRI discontinuation. Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed to conduct a systematic review. Electronic databases included PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MEDLINE from the inception of each database to June 2017. Titles, abstracts, and topics were searched using a combination of the following terms: "duloxetine" OR "venlafaxine" OR "desvenlafaxine" OR "milnacipran" OR "levomilnacipran" OR "SNRI" OR "second generation antidepressant" OR "serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor" AND "discontinuation" OR "withdrawal" OR "rebound." Only published trials in the English language were included. Results: Sixty-one re-ports met the criteria for inclusion. There were 22 double-blind randomized controlled trials, 6 studies where patients were treated in an open fashion and then randomized to a double-blind controlled phase, 8 open trials, 1 prospective naturalistic study, 1 retrospective study, and 23 case reports. Withdrawal symptoms occurred after discontinuation of any type of SNRI. The prevalence of withdrawal symptoms varied across reports and appeared to be higher with venlafaxine. Symptoms typically ensued within a few days from discontinuation and lasted a few weeks, also with gradual tapering. Late onset and/or a longer persistence of disturbances occurred as well. Conclusions: Clinicians need to add SNRI to the list of drugs potentially inducing withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, together with other types of psychotropic drugs. The results of this study challenge the use of SNRI as first-line treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Purpose of review
   Major depressive disorder with a comorbid anxiety disorder or with significant anxiety symptoms (here called anxious depression) is common and has been associated with poor clinical course trajectories. However, various dichotomous as well as dimensional definitions have been used to label anxious depression and it remains unclear to which extent these result in inconsistent findings. This review provides an overview of recent literature on the impact of anxiety in depressed patients on clinical course trajectories, treatment outcomes, and underlying neurobiological dysregulations.
   Recent findings
   Anxious depression seems associated with poorer clinical course trajectories and treatment nonresponse as compared with 'pure' depression, regardless of which definition is used. Recent studies have attempted to determine specific efficacy of novel pharmacological treatments for anxious depressed patients, but have not been conclusive because of the insufficient number of studies and differences in definitions and assessment of anxious depression. Neurobiology studies suggest that anxious depression is associated with increased immune dysregulation, more cortical thinning, and corticolimbic dysfunctions as compared with 'pure' depression.
   Summary
   Anxious depression appears to be a common and clinically relevant subtype of depression as it predicts poorer course trajectories. As populations with anxious depression may benefit from specific treatment regimens, further research is necessary to better delineate its definition and neurobiology. The relatively new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 anxious distress specifier is a welcome development and should be further investigated and compared against other anxiety constructs.

AB  - A systematic review of the available evidence examining the cost of work-related stress (WRS) would yield important insights into the magnitude of this social phenomenon. The objective of this review was to collate, extract, and synthesize economic evaluations of the cost of WRS to society. A research protocol was developed. Included cost-of-illness (COI) studies estimated the cost of WRS at a societal level, and were published in English, French or German. Searches were carried out in ingentaconnect, EBSCO, JSTOR, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, Google, and Google scholar. Included studies were assessed against 10 COI quality assessment criteria. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. These originated from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the EU-15. The total estimated cost of WRS was observed to be considerable and ranged substantially from US$221.13 million to $187 billion. Productivity related losses were observed to proportionally contribute the majority of the total cost of WRS (between 70 to 90%), with health care and medical costs constituting the remaining 10 to 30%. The evidence reviewed here suggests a sizable financial burden imposed by WRS on society. The observed range of cost estimates was understood to be attributable to variations in definitions of WRS; the number and type of costs estimated; and, in how production loss was estimated. It is postulated that the cost estimates identified by this review are likely conservative because of narrow definitions of WRS and the exclusion of diverse range of cost components.

AB  - A psychological model of classic psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy informed by contemporary scientific data is presented in this paper. It is suggested that classic psychedelic-occasioned mystical experience is characterized by profound awe, a discrete emotion experienced in the presence of a vast stimulus requiring accommodation of mental structures. Awe, in turn, promotes the small self, a construct that, in the extreme, is analogous to those of unitive experience and ego dissolution. The small self is conceptualized as key to understanding the downstream effects of mystical experience occasioned in the context of classic psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. With this novel theoretical framework in mind, a number of clinical implications and recommendations are provided so as to advance this incipient field of study.

AB  - This article reviews studies examining health issues associated with commercial sexual exploitation and sex trafficking (CSE/ST) of children in the United States. We searched five health and social sciences databases for peer-reviewed articles published in English between January 1990 and April 2017. After independent screening of the records, we identified 27 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Descriptions of the included studies and their definitions of CSE/ST are provided. Most of the studies sampled children and youth in urban, metropolitan areas and employed cross-sectional surveys or reviewed case files and medical records of convenience samples. Studies differed widely in their operationalization of CSE/ST, which limit systematic comparison across studies and the generalizability of findings. Qualitative analysis of the included studies shows that among commercially sexually exploited/trafficked children, there are elevated burdens of substance use and abuse, mental health disorders such as depression, PTSD, suicidal behaviors, and sexual and reproductive health issues including STIs, HIV, and pregnancy. This review underscores the need for more empirical studies, to guide an evidence-based understanding of and response to the range and complexity of the health issues in this population. Of particular utility are studies that address some of the methodological limitations of prior research in this field (e.g., cross-sectional, convenience samples) and those that assess overlooked health issues (e.g., malnutrition, eating disorders, post-trauma growth, and long-term health consequences).

In subjects with genetic risk for depression, early stress factors are able to mediate not only the genetic risk but also gene expression. There is evidence that endocrine and immune interactions have an important impact on monoamine function and that the altered monoamine signalling observed in the depressive syndrome has a neuro-endocrino-immunological origin early in the development.Conclusions: Neurodevelopment is a key aspect to understand the whole neurobiology of depression.

AB  - Background Non-suicidal self-injury is being increasingly recognised as a prominent public health concern. Identification of early and modifiable risk factors is necessary to advance the screening and intervention efforts, particularly early detection of at-risk individuals. We aimed to examine childhood maltreatment, including its specific subtypes, in relation to non-suicidal self-injury.
   Methods We did a comprehensive meta-analysis of childhood maltreatment (overall, sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect, and emotional abuse and neglect) in association with non-suicidal self-injury. We also provided a qualitative review of mediators and moderators of this association. We identified relevant articles published from inception to Sept 25, 2017, through a systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. We extracted continuous and categorical data and assessed for potential moderators using ten study characteristics. We generated random-effects models for analysis and evaluated for publication bias.
   Findings We identified 71 publications that met eligibility criteria. Overall childhood maltreatment was associated with non-suicidal self-injury (odds ratio 3.42, 95% CI 2.74-4.26), and effect sizes for maltreatment subtypes ranged from 1.84 (1.45-2.34) for childhood emotional neglect to 3.03 (2.56-3.54) for childhood emotional abuse. Publication bias was not evident, except in the case of childhood emotional neglect. Across multiple maltreatment subtypes, we found stronger associations with non-suicidal self-injury in non-clinical samples.
   Interpretation With the exception of childhood emotional neglect, childhood maltreatment and its subtypes are associated with non-suicidal self-injury. Screening of childhood maltreatment history in non-suicidal self-injury risk assessments might hold particular value in community settings, and increased attention to childhood emotional abuse is warranted.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to be effective in treating mood disorders such as major depressive disorder, however, its detailed mechanism of action is not fully understood. Human and animal experiments have demonstrated that tDCS promotes brain plasticity and have suggested that this consequence may underlie its therapeutic benefits. Nonetheless, the specific neurobiological underpinnings of tDCS-induced brain plasticity have only recently begun to be investigated. While brain plasticity occurs in synapses formed by neurons, astrocytes, a major glial cell type, have recently been shown to support synaptic plasticity via intracellular Ca2+ signaling. In this perspective article, we discuss our recent results demonstrating that tDCS induces the activation of astrocytic calcium signaling that constitutes a required component for treating chronic restraint stress-induced depressive mice. We put forward the notion that activation of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling could be used clinically as a potent remedy for depression. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB  - Human research with psychedelics is making groundbreaking discoveries. Psychedelics modify enduring elements of personality and seemingly reduce anxiety, depression, and substance dependence in small but well-designed clinical studies. Psychedelics are advancing through pharmaceutical regulatory systems, and neuroimaging studies have related their extraordinary effects to select brain networks. This field is making significant basic science and translational discoveries, yet preclinical studies have lagged this renaissance in human psychedelic research. Preclinical studies have a lot to offer psychedelic research as they afford tight control of experimental parameters, subjects with documented drug histories, and the capacity to elucidate relevant signaling cascades as well as conduct invasive mechanistic studies of neurochemistry and neural circuits. Safety pharmacology, novel biomarkers, and pharmacokinetics can be assessed in disease state models to advance psychedelics toward clinical practice. This chapter documents the current status of psychedelic research, with the thematic argument that new preclinical studies would benefit this field.

Excluded articles included qualitative studies, acceptance and compassion therapies, case reports and reviews. Studies were identified by searching the databases Medline, Embase and PsycINFO.Results: Six randomised controlled trials, seven prospective studies and one retrospective study were identified. Clinical improvements were observed on psychotic symptoms, and on improvements of depression symptoms, cognition, mindfulness, psycho-social and vocational factors.Conclusions: Findings suggest that mindfulness is feasible for individuals with SPMI, and displays potential benefits in outcomes aside from psychotic symptoms. The effects of mindfulness in psychotic symptoms needs further investigation in larger definitive studies using methodological rigor and thorough assessments of other psychiatric populations who are also representative of SPMI.

AB  - Background: Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), often experienced as more debilitating for patients and caregivers than motor problems. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the course of cognitive decline and the identification of valid progression markers for Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is essential.
   Objective: This systematic review summarizes the current state of knowledge on cognitive decline over time by reporting effect sizes of cognitive changes in neuropsychological tests.
   Methods: 1368 studies were identified by a PubMed database search and 25 studies by additionally scanning previous literature. After screening all records, including 69 full-text article reviews, 12 longitudinal studies on the progression of cognitive decline in PD met our criteria (e.g., sample size >= 50 patients).
   Results: Only a few studies monitored cognitive decline over a longer period (> 4 years). Most studies focused on the evaluation of change in global cognitive state by use of the Mini-Mental State Examination, whereas the use of neuropsychological tests was highly heterogenic among studies. Only one study evaluated patients' cognitive performance in all specified domains (executive function, attention & working memory, memory, language, and visual-spatial function) allowing for diagnosis of cognitive impairment according to consensus guidelines. Medium to strong effect sizes could only be observed in studies with follow-up intervals of four years or longer.
   Conclusions: The results emphasize the need for the assessment of larger PD cohorts over longer periods of follow-up with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery.

AB  - The history of psychedelic drug use in psychotherapy spans over half of a century. Presently, psychedelic drugs are being studied as psychotherapy adjuncts. There are promising findings (Evans et al. 2018; Watts et al. 2017; Gasser et al. 2014) on the usage of such drugs as lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, ketamine, and ayahuasca in the treatment of mood disorders. This may be an alternative way to solve the problem of treatment-resistant mood disorders.
   Novel findings suggest that psychedelic drugs are capable of changing the neural mechanisms underlying mental dysfunction and producing long-lasting improvements in functioning of clinical populations. The alterations produced by these drugs are clustered in a set of regions - the default-mode network (DMN) - which are engaged in various intrinsic processes, e.g. forming internal experience and building self-narrative. Research shows that changes in the DMN are characteristic for mood disorders (Mulders et al. 2015; Kaiser et al. 2015), and for this reason the DMN can become a trigger for response to therapy. Alterations in the DMN may be a marker of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy efficacy, as the state produced by psychedelics is characterised by a pattern of DMN functioning in an opposite way to that seen in mood disorders.
   In this narrative review we will take a closer look at how some psychedelics effect DMN activity and functional connectivity, sum up the proposed interpretations of such changes, compare those results to findings in the field of mood disorders (mainly depression), and propose future directions for research on psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.

AB  - Depression is increasingly being recognised as a significant mental health problem in the workplace contributing to productivity loss and economic burden to organisations. This paper reviews recently published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of universal and targeted interventions to reduce depression in the workplace. Studies were identified through searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES Full Text, and Global Health and Social Policy and Practice databases. Studies were included if they included an RCT of a workplace intervention for employees targeting depression as the primary outcome. Twenty-two published RCTs investigating interventions utilising various therapeutic approaches were identified. The cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approach is the most frequently used in the workplace, while interventions that combine different therapeutic approaches showed the most promising results. A universal intervention in the workplace that combines CBT and coping flexibility recorded the highest effect size (d=1.45 at 4 months' follow-up). Most interventions were delivered in group format and showed low attrition rates compared with other delivery formats. Although all studies reviewed were RCTs, the quality of reporting is low. Interventions using different therapeutic approaches with different modes of delivery have been used. Most of these interventions were shown to reduce depression levels among employees in the workplace, particularly those that combine more than one therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Purpose: A number of studies, including systematic reviews, show beneficial effects of psychosocial interventions for people with diabetes mellitus; however, they have not been assessed using meta-analysis. The purpose of this meta analysis of randomized controlled trials is to investigate the effects of psychosocial interventions on depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life and self-efficacy in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
   Methods: The databases Pubmed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and SocINDEX were searched with no year restriction. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials published in English that included individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, aged 18 years or above, who engaged in a psychosocial intervention, with outcome measures addressing depressive or anxiety symptomology, quality of life or self-efficacy. Eligible studies needed to compare the intervention to usual care. Study selection was completed using Covidence and meta-analysis was undertaken using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.
   Results: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Five studies investigated the effects of psychosocial interventions and showed a medium to large benefit for depressive symptoms (SMD: -0.70; CI: -1.27, -0.13) which persisted at follow up (SMD: -1.54, CI: -2.97, -0.12). Similar results were not seen immediately post-intervention in the three studies that assessed anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.30; CI: -0.69, 0.10); however, a medium beneficial effect was seen at follow up (SMD = -0.61, CI = -0.92 to -0.31). Small benefits were seen in the three studies assessing quality of life outcomes (SMD: 0.30, CI: -0.06, 0.55). No benefit was seen in the two studies assessing self-efficacy (SMD: 0.23, CI: -0.11, 0.57).
   Conclusions: The results of the current study provide preliminary evidence that psychosocial interventions, compared to usual care, reduce depressive symptoms, and may improve quality of life in individuals with diabetes. However, only a few studies were included and the clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

The aim was to identify publications about autism and potential gaps of knowledge in this region. The search was conducted on March 31, 2016 using PubMed, PsycINFO and EMBASE databases. The search was updated on August 31, 2016; a total of 47 studies were analysed. Current research on autism in Baltic States is still in its beginning. Areas studied were education, medicine, parenting, autism in adulthood, treatments and epidemiology. Education sector is the most researched discipline about autism in Baltic countries especially addressing issue on schooling practices for autistic children. The prevalence of autism is unclear as only one outdated epidemiological study was found. Further epidemiological, clinical intervention research need to be conducted in this region.

   Recent Findings The review is based on a research literature and the authors' clinical and healthcare administration experiences. Articles searched-on telepsychiatry, telemental health, mobile mental health, informatics, cellular phone, ambulatory monitoring, telemetry, and algorithms-were restricted to 2016 and 2017. Technologies are used in a variety of clinical settings, including patients with varying mental illness severity, social supports, and technological literacy. Good practices for evaluating apps, understanding user needs, and training and educating users can increase success rates. Ethics and risk management should be considered.
   Summary Mobile apps are versatile. Integrating apps into psychiatric treatment requires addressing both patient and clinical workflows, design and usability principles, accessibility, social concerns, and digital health literacy.

AB  - Medications targeting stroke risk factors have shown good efficacy, yet adherence is suboptimal. To improve adherence, its determinants must be understood. To date, no systematic review has mapped identified determinants into the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) in order to establish a more complete understanding of medication adherence.
   The aim of this study was to identify psychological determinants that most influence stroke survivors' medication adherence.
   In line with the prospectively registered protocol (PROSPERO CRD42015016222), five electronic databases were searched (1953-2015). Hand searches of included full text references were undertaken. Two reviewers conducted screening, data extraction and quality assessment. Determinants were mapped into the TDF.
   Of 32,825 articles, 12 fulfilled selection criteria (N = 43,984 stroke survivors). Tested determinants mapped into 8/14 TDF domains. Studies were too heterogeneous for meta-analysis. Three TDF domains appeared most influential. Negative emotions ('Emotions' domain) such as anxiety and concerns about medications ('Beliefs about Consequences' domain) were associated with reduced adherence. Increased adherence was associated with better knowledge of medications ('Knowledge' domain) and stronger beliefs about medication necessity ('Beliefs about Consequences' domain). Study quality varied, often lacking information on sample size calculations.
   This review provides foundations for evidence-based intervention design by establishing psychological determinants most influential in stroke survivors' medication adherence. Six TDF domains do not appear to have been tested, possibly representing gaps in research design. Future research should standardise and clearly report determinant and medication adherence measurement to facilitate meta-analysis. The range of determinants explored should be broadened to enable more complete understanding of stroke survivors' medication adherence.

AB  - This article aims to review the concept of emotion dysregulation, focusing on issues related to its definition, meanings and role in psychiatric disorders. Articles on emotion dysregulation published until May 2016 were identified through electronic database searches. Although there is no agreement about the definition of emotion dysregulation, the following five overlapping, not mutually exclusive dimensions of emotion dysregulation were identified: decreased emotional awareness, inadequate emotional reactivity, intense experience and expression of emotions, emotional rigidity and cognitive reappraisal difficulty. These dimensions characterise a number of psychiatric disorders in various proportions, with borderline personality disorder and eating disorders seemingly more affected than other conditions. The present review contributes to the literature by identifying the key components of emotion dysregulation and by showing how these permeate various forms of psychopathology. It also makes suggestions for improving research endeavours. Better understanding of the various dimensions of emotion dysregulation will have implications for clinical practice. Future research needs to address emotion dysregulation in all its multifaceted complexity so that it becomes clearer what the concept encompasses.

AB  - Clinical burnout is one of the leading causes of work absenteeism in high- and middle-income countries. There is hence a great need for the identification of effective intervention strategies to increase return-to-work (RTW) in this population. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of tertiary interventions for individuals with clinically significant burnout on RTW and psychological symptoms of exhaustion, depression and anxiety. Four electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed and CINAHL Plus) were searched in April 2016 for randomized and non-randomized controlled trials of tertiary interventions in clinical burnout. Article screening and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with random-effects meta-analyses. Eight articles met the inclusion criteria. There was some evidence of publication bias. Included trials were of variable methodological quality. A significant effect of tertiary interventions compared with treatment as usual or wait-list controls on time until RTW was found, HR = 4.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.15-9.45; however, considerable heterogeneity was detected. The effect of tertiary interventions on full RTW was not significant, OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.59-2.98. No significant effects on psychological symptoms of exhaustion, depression or anxiety were observed. In conclusion, tertiary interventions for individuals with clinically significant burnout may be effective in facilitating RTW. Successful interventions incorporated advice fromlaborexperts and enabled patients to initiate a workplace dialogue with their employers.

AB  - Mental health disorders contribute a significant burden to society. This systematic literature review aims to summarize the current state of the literature on race/skin color and mental health disorders in Brazil. Methods: PubMed and Lilacs were searched using descriptors for mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, Common Mental Disorders, psychiatric morbidity, etc.) and race to find studies conducted in Brazil. Studies of non-population groups, that did not analyze race/skin color, or for which the mental disorder was not the object of study were excluded. After evaluation of quality, 14 articles were selected for inclusion. There was an overall higher prevalence of mental health disorders in non-Whites. Of the six multivariate analyses that found statistically significant results, five indicated a greater prevalence or odds of mental health disorder in non-Whites compared to Whites (measure of association between 1.18-1.85). This review identified the trend in the literature regarding the association between race and mental health disorders. However, important difficulties complicate the comparability of the studies, principally in function of the differences in the mental health disorders studied, the method of categorizing race/skin color, and the screening tools used in the studies analyzed.

AB  - Glutamatergic dysregulation is implicated in the neuropathology of bipolar disorder (BD). There is increasing interest in investigating the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in BD and as a target for treatment intervention. Bipolar mGluR studies (published January 1992 April 2016) were identified via PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. Full-text screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal were conducted in duplicate, with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The initial literature search for mGluRs in BD, including non-bipolar mood disorders and primary psychotic disorders, identified 1544 articles. 61 abstracts were selected for relevance, 16 articles met full inclusion criteria, and three additional articles were found via citations. Despite limited literature, studies demonstrated: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BD, including a GRM3 SNP associated with greater likelihood of psychosis (rs6465084), mRNA binding protein Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein associated with altered mGluR1/5 activity in BD populations, and lithium decreasing mGluR5 expression and mGluR-mediated intracellular calcium signaling. Limited research has been performed on the role of mGluRs in BD, but results highlight the importance of ongoing study. Future directions for research of mGluRs in BD include GRM polymorphisms, epigenetic regulation, intracellular proteins, and pharmacologic interactions.

AB  - Background. Although the presence of a gambling disorder (GD) together with another mental disorder poses special treatment challenges, such as relapses, severe outcomes for patients and families, and increased number of hospitalizations, there are only a few critical reviews in the literature. Objective. To review empirical evidence of psychological approaches to cope specifically with these dual disorders. Method. A narrative review of the relevant bibliography on this topic was carried out. A systematic search of original articles (2010-October 2017) was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycInfo. Key terms were: 1. gambling/gamblers, 2. treatment/intervention/therapy/therapeutics, and 3. dual diagnosis/comorbidity. Results. Current treatment for GD involves a number of different options, including inpatient treatments, intensive outpatient therapy, individual and group cognitive-behavioral options (CBT), self-help groups, and pharmacotherapy. Inpatient care is generally limited to patients with severe acute crises, treatment failures, and severe comorbid disorders, particularly depression and attempted suicide. Treatment for GD with other mental disorder needs more research. CBT, motivational enhancement therapy and self-help groups have some empirical support when GD is comorbid with other addiction, mood disorder, or schizophrenia. Programs that combine pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatments for GD into a single comprehensive package are most likely to have good treatment outcomes, at least with regard to treatment retention. Discussion and conclusion. Interventions should be tailored to the needs of the patients. Future research should be concerned about the statistical power of the studies, implement motivational strategies for patients with poor medication adherence, and design measures to study treatment fidelity in the CBT groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine the similarities and differences among practice guidelines for managing bipolar disorders (BDs) in adults.
   METHODS: A literature search in PubMed/Medline was performed using multiple search terms and bibliographies for guidelines from July 2013 (since FDA approval of lurasidone) to June 2017.
   RESULTS: Six treatment guidelines for BDs in adults were identified. These guidelines showed consensus on first-line treatment of mania (mood stabilizer and/or an antipsychotic), and most first-line medications for bipolar depression. However, beyond first-line treatments, the guidelines' recommendations showed major differences. Some guidelines did not specify a type of BD. In addition, there was variability in the stages when important treatments, such as electroconvulsive therapy, should be considered and in the recommended treatment or lack of recommended treatment for mixed episodes and features.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review found consistency across guidelines on first line recommendations for treating manic and depressive episodes, but wide differences for second- and third-line treatments and for other phases of BD, therefore limiting the generation of any "meta-consensus." We recommend creating an international workgroup to reconcile the evidence and develop more unified international recommendations.

   Recent Findings The use of VR in psychiatric practice shows promise with much of the research demonstrating clinical effectiveness for conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and phobias, chronic pain, rehabilitation, and addictions. However, more research is needed before the use of VR is considered a clinical standard of practice in some areas.
   Summary The recent release of first generation consumer VR products signals a change in the viability of further developing VR systems and applications. As applications increase so will the need for good quality research to best understand what makes VR effective, and when VR is not appropriate for clinical services. As the field progresses, it is hopeful that the flexibility afforded by this technology will yield superior outcomes and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms impacting those outcomes.

AB  - Until recently, whether invertebrates might exhibit emotions was unknown. This possibility has traditionally been dismissed by many as emotions are frequently defined with reference to human subjective experience, and invertebrates are often not considered to have the neural requirements for such sophisticated abilities. However, emotions are understood in humans and other vertebrates to be multifaceted brain states, comprising dissociable subjective, cognitive, behavioural and physiological components. In addition, accumulating literature is providing evidence of the impressive cognitive capacities and behavioural flexibility of invertebrates. Alongside these, within the past few years, a number of studies have adapted methods for assessing emotions in humans and other animals, to invertebrates, with intriguing results. Sea slugs, bees, crayfish, snails, crabs, flies and ants have all been shown to display various cognitive, behavioural and/or physiological phenomena that indicate internal states reminiscent of what we consider to be emotions. Given the limited neural architecture of many invertebrates, and the powerful tools available within invertebrate research, these results provide new opportunities for unveiling the neural mechanisms behind emotions and open new avenues towards the pharmacological manipulation of emotion and its genetic dissection, with advantages for disease research and therapeutic drug discovery. Here, we review the increasing evidence that invertebrates display some form of emotion, discuss the various methods used for assessing emotions in invertebrates and consider what can be garnered from further emotion research on invertebrates in terms of the evolution and underlying neural basis of emotion in a comparative context.

AB  - Introduction: A psychotic episode may be sufficiently traumatic to induce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which could impact outcomes in first-episode psychosis (FEP). The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to estimate the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in relation to psychosis in FEP and to identify risk factors for the development of PTSD symptoms.
   Methods: We searched electronic databases and conducted manual searching of reference lists and tables of contents to identify relevant studies. Quantitative studies were included if the population was experiencing FEP and if PTSD was measured in relation to psychosis. Prevalence of PTSD symptoms and diagnoses were meta-analyzed using a random effects model. Potential risk factors for PTSD symptoms were summarized qualitatively.
   Results: Thirteen studies were included. Eight studies assessed PTSD symptoms, three studies assessed full PTSD, and two studies assessed both. The pooled prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 42% (95% CI 30%-55%), and the pooled prevalence of a PTSD diagnosis was 30% (95% CI 21%-40%). Exploratory subgroup analyses suggest that prevalence may be higher in affective psychosis and inpatient samples. Evidence from included studies implicate depression and anxiety as potential risk factors for PTSD symptoms.
   Conclusions: Approximately one in two people experience PTSD symptoms and one in three experience full PTSD following a first psychotic episode. Evidence-based interventions to treat PTSD symptoms in the context of FEP are needed to address this burden and improve outcomes after the first psychotic episode. Further studies are needed to clarify the associated risk factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in the world. Both an early cannabis use onset and the amount used contribute to the risk of suffering mental disorders in adulthood. Objective. Review longitudinal studies conducted on adolescents associating early cannabis use with the subsequent occurrence of mental disorders. Method. A search was conducted in PubMed until December 2016, focusing on longitudinal researches and prioritizing studies that clearly distinguished between an early and late onset of cannabis use. To achieve the objective, the word "cannabis" was used in combination with the main psychiatric diseases. A manual search of articles that appeared in the references was also conducted. Results. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, but only five studies discriminated clearly between early and late onset of cannabis use. An association was found between early onset of cannabis use and mental disorders, particularly psychosis. The information regarding affective and anxiety disorders is more controversial. Discussion and conclusion. Early onset of cannabis use is associated with mental disorders, especially psychosis. Prevention plans for cannabis use in adolescents should be developed in order to decrease the risk of mental disorders.

AB  - There is an increasing need for mental health promotion strategies that effectively engage men. Although researchers have examined the effectiveness of diverse mental wellness interventions in male-dominated industries, and reviewed suicide prevention, early intervention, and health promotion interventions for boys and men, few have focused on sex-specific program effects. The purpose of this review was to (a) extend the previous reviews to examine the effectiveness of mental health promotion programs in males, and (b) evaluate the integration of gender-specific influences in the content and delivery of men's mental health promotion programs. A search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases for articles published between January 2006 and December 2016 was conducted. Findings from the 25 included studies indicated that a variety of strategies offered within (9 studies) and outside (16 studies) the workplace show promise for promoting men's mental health. Although stress was a common area of focus (14 studies), the majority of studies targeted multiple outcomes, including some indicators of positive well-being such as self-efficacy, resilience, self-esteem, work performance, and happiness/quality of life. The majority of programs were offered to both men and women, and six studies explicitly integrated gender-related influences in male-specific programs in ways that recognized men's interests and preferences.

AB  - Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are seen as the gold standard of evidence-based care. Because of their influence, these guidelines can have profound legal and economic effects. Despite their proliferation and influence, the trustworthiness and quality of guidelines have been seriously questioned and they have been implicated as drivers of overtreatment. In the U.S,augmentation with second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) is becoming an increasingly common strategy for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) when initial antidepressant treatment does not result in remission of symptoms. However, there is debate about the evidence for augmentation and whether this strategy is a form of overtreatment. We conducted a systematic search to identify treatment guidelines for MDD. Fourteen international guidelines met inclusion criteria and we reviewed them to determine: 1) if augmentation with SGAs was recommended for patients who did not respond to antidepressant medication; 2) what evidence was cited for the recommendation for or against augmentation; 3) the extent to which the guidelines addressed risk/benefit concerns when making their recommendations. There was significant variation among the CPGs regarding the recommendation to augment with antipsychotic medication for Major Depressive Disorder. Seven guidelines explicitly recommended augmentation with antipsychotics; 1 guideline reviewed the evidence but neither recommended for nor against; 1 guideline did not make a clear recommendation; 2 guidelines explicitly recommended against augmentation; and 3 guidelines did not address augmentation with antipsychotics as a potential treatment strategy. There was wide variation in terms of attention to risk/benefit issues and to the conditions under which augmentation should be considered. The results are discussed in terms of the implications for risk management and informed consent practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two database (MEDLINE and PsycINFO) and hand-searched the references in identified publications were searched. For each identified publication, the measurements and time related-change of risk perception and anxiety regarding radiation were summarized. Twenty-four publications were identified. Quantitative measures of risk perception or anxiety were roughly divided into two types: single-item Likert scales that measure anxiety about radiation; and theoretical, or model-based measures. Rates of Fukushima residents with radiation-related anxiety decreased from 2012 to 2015. Factors governing risk perception or radiation-related anxiety were summarized by demographics, disaster-related stressors, trusted information, and radiation-related variables. The effects of risk perception or anxiety regarding radiation were summarized as severe distress, intention to leave employment or not to return home, or other dimensions. This review provides summary of current findings on risk perception or anxiety regarding radiation in Japan after the accident. Further researches are needed about detailed statistical analysis for time-related change and causality among variables.

Comprehensive terms were used to search four electronic databases up to July 2015. Twenty-seven papers that administered the EASI or EAS in English and provided psychometric information were included; 107 articles that administered the measures in a language other than English or that used various modifications were kept for narrative review. For the EASI, results demonstrated acceptable convergent and predictive validity, yet low to marginally acceptable internal consistency for the subscales, and poor factor structure was observed. For the EAS, internal consistency was generally acceptable, and predictive and concurrent validity was good, whereas support for the factor structure was mixed with some studies requiring modifications to the measure. The EAS demonstrated the most research support and best psychometric properties; however, revision of the measure may lead to improved overall psychometrics. Adoption of a revised, psychometrically sound version of this measure would facilitate greater consistency across the literature.

AB  - Depression and cognitive dysfunction share a common neuropathological platform. Abnormal neural plasticity in the frontolimbic circuits has been linked to changes in the expression of neurotrophic factors, including IGF-1. These changes may result in clinical abnormalities observed over the course of major depressive disorder (MDD), including cognitive dysfunction. The present review aimed to summarize evidence regarding abnormalities of peripheral IGF-1 in MDD patients and assess a marker and predictive role of the neurotrophin for emotional and cognitive disturbances, and treatment effectiveness. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted for studies, in which peripheral IGF-1 levels were evaluated. Our analysis revealed four main findings: (1) IGF-1 levels in MDD patients mismatch across the studies, which may arise from various factors, e.g., age, gender, the course of the disease, presence of cognitive impairment, ongoing therapy, or general health conditions; (2) the initial peripheral IGF-1 levels may predict the occurrence of depression in future; (3) peripheral IGF-1 levels may reflect cognitive dysfunction, although the data is limited; (4) it is difficult to evaluate the influence of treatment on IGF-1 levels as there is discrepancy of this growth factor among the studies at baseline, although most of them showed a decrease in IGF-1 levels after treatment.

AB  - Objective: The brain-gut-microbiota axis has been put forward as a new paradigm in neuroscience, which may be of relevance to mental illness. The mechanisms of signal transmission in the brain-gut-microbiota axis are complex and involve bidirectional communications that enable gut microbes to communicate with the brain and the brain to communicate with the microbes. This review assesses the potential usefulness and limitations of the paradigm.
   Methods: A selective literature review was conducted to evaluate the current knowledge in clinical and preclinical brain-gut-microbiota interactions as related to psychiatric disorders.
   Results: Most published studies in the field are preclinical, and there is so far a lack of clinical studies. Preliminary studies in psychiatric populations support the view of a dysbiosis in some conditions, but studies are often small scale and marred by potential confounding variables. Preclinical studies support the view that psychobiotics ("bacteria which when ingested in adequate amounts have a positive mental health benefit") might be of use in treating some patients with mental health difficulties. To date, we have no well-conducted studies in clinical populations, although there are some studies in healthy volunteers. A cocktail of probiotics has been shown to alter brain activity as monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and Bifidobacterium longum was reported to alter brain electrical activity.
   Conclusions: It has yet to be convincingly demonstrated that the exciting findings of psychobiotic efficacy demonstrated in preclinical models of psychiatric illness will translate to patients.

   Recent Findings Evidence from the diverse body of literature presented here, from translational research, genetic and neuroimaging studies, to clinical trials of intranasal (IN) OXT reveals a positive association. In addition, some moderators (e.g., sex, specificities to cues) of OXT's anxiolytic effects can have an important influence on its outcomes, awaiting further research.
   Summary Evidence for the role of OXT in regulating anxiety is undeniable. We expect that the diverse particularities of the OXT system will help broaden our understanding of anxiety and stress-related disorders. We conclude that OXT promises an enticing treatment option for human anxiety disorders especially those associated with socio-emotional dysfunctions.

AB  - Background: Recent evidence suggests that there is an increasing need for accessible and anonymous services to support higher education (HE) students suffering from psychological and/ or academic difficulties. Such difficulties can lead to several negative outcomes, including poor academic performance, sub-optimal mental health, reduced study satisfaction, and dropout from study. Currently, universities in the UK lack financial resources and the on-campus mental health services traditionally offered to students are increasingly economically unsustainable. Compounded by the perceived stigma of using such services, mental health providers have been driven to address the escalating needs of students through online services.
   Methods: In this paper, we review online support systems identified through a literature search and a manual search of references in the identified papers. Further systems were identified through web searches, and systems still in development were identified by consultation with researchers in the field. We accessed systems online to extract relevant information, regarding the main difficulties addressed by the systems, the psychological techniques used and any relevant research evidence to support their effectiveness.
   Conclusion: A large number of web-based support systems have been developed to support mental health and wellbeing, although few specifically target HE students. Further research is necessary to establish the effectiveness of such interventions in providing a cost-effective alternative to face-to-face therapy, particularly in certain settings such as HE institutions.

AB  - It is difficult to accurately assess and differentially diagnose the anxiety disorders. The current system of assessment relies heavily on the subjective measures of client self-report, clinical observation, and clinical judgment. Fortunately, recent technological advances may enable practitioners to utilize objective, biobehavioral measures of assessment in a clinical setting. The current body of literature on two of these biobehavioral tools (eyetracking and electrocardiogram devices) is promising, but more validation and standardization research is needed to maximize the utility of these devices. Eye-tracking devices are uniquely capable of providing data that can be used to differentially diagnose anxiety disorders from both other commonly comorbid and misdiagnosed disorders. Both eye-tracking and electrocardiogram devices are able to provide change-sensitive assessment information. This objective, real-time feedback can assist clinicians and researchers in assessing treatment efficacy and symptom fluctuation. Recently developed wearable and highly portable electrocardiogram devices, like the wearable fitness and behavior tracking devices used by many consumers, may be particularly suited for providing this feedback to clinicians. Utilizing these biobehavioral devices would supply an objective, dimensional component to the current categorical diagnostic assessment system. We posit that if adequate funding and attention are directed at this area of research, it could revolutionize diagnostic and on-going assessment practices and, in doing so, bring the field of diagnosis out of the 20th century.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We calculated the pooled prevalence using a random-effects model and performed subgroup analyses according to pain location, the population and assessment method.
   Results: Twenty-one studies were included and the PTSD prevalence varied from 0-57%, with a pooled mean prevalence of 9.7%, 95% CI (5.2-17.1). In subgroup analysis, the PTSD prevalence was 20.5%, 95% CI (9.5-39.0) among persons with chronic widespread pain, 11.2%, 95% CI (5.7-22.8) among persons with headache, and 0.3%, 95% CI (0.0-2.4) among persons with back pain. The prevalence in clinical populations was 11.7%, 95% CI (6.0-21.5) and in non-clinical populations 5.1%, 95% CI (0.01-17.2). In studies of self-reported PTSD symptoms, PTSD prevalence was 20.4%, 95% CI (10.6-35.5), and in studies where structured clinical interviews had been used to assess PTSD its prevalence was 4.5%, 95% (CI 2.1-9.3). The risk of bias was medium for most studies and the heterogeneity was high (I-2 = 98.6).
   Conclusion: PTSD is overall more prevalent in clinical cohorts of persons with CP and particularly in those with widespread pain, but may not always be more prevalent in non-clinical samples of persons with CP, compared to the general population. There is a large heterogeneity in prevalence across studies. Future research should identify sources of heterogeneity and the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of the two conditions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Eating disoders (EDs) are complex mental illnesses with a multifactorial etiopathogenesis. These disoders are typically ego-syntonic thus entailing a protracted course in a substantial proportion of cases. Anorexia nervosa (AN) has been reported to have the greatest mortality of any other mental illnesses but all EDs strongly impact patients' lives. International guidelines highlight psychotherapy as a useful therapeutic intervention for EDs with respect to both short-and long-term outcomes. The most used approaches include: psychodynamic psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy and family-based therapy. This review aims to provide the reader with an update on the available psychotherapy approaches in the ED treatment and to convey some clinical inputs on how to choose the different psychotherapy techniques.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The online search was performed on Medline and PsycInfo databases then a hand-search of the reference list has been also carried out. Inclusion criteria were the following: 1) papers published between 1980 and February 2017; 2) studies focusing on individuals with AN, bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED); 3) research articles and case reports; 4) English language. Reviews were not included.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Sixty articles were finally retained in the present review. Eighteen studies analyzed psychodynamic treatments in AN with the majority of articles reporting that psychodynamic therapies are effective with results maintained at follow-up. Twelve studies on psychodynamic therapies in BN were included. Psychodynamic therapies were not found to be clearly more effective than other approaches. Thirteen articles analyzed psychodynamic therapies in BED. Data are scarce, but all studies found that psychodynamic therapies are effective in both general psychopathology and eating psychopathology with results overall maintained at follow-up. Fifteen articles analyzed psychodynamic therapies in mixed diagnoses and psychodynamic therapies to be effective in improving weight and psychiatric symptoms with satisfactory results at follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Research is still needed to clarify the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapies in the ED field also because of methodological flaws making the available studies difficultly comparable to each other. Nevertheless, psychodynamic interventions showed to be effective, mostly for AN, in treating particularly severe conditions like EDs.

AB  - Learning objectives: After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to:
   Evaluate the prevalence of early emotional trauma in patients with bipolar disorder (BD)
   Assess the impact of these traumas on patients and on their development of BD
   Objectives: We performed a systematic literature review to (1) evaluate the prevalence of early emotional trauma (EET) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and the impact of these traumas on the development of the disorder, and (2) integrate the findings of our review with those previously reported by Fisher and Hosang, Daruy-Filho and colleagues, and Maniglio.
   Methods: The literature search was performed on PubMed, SciELO, and PsycINFO databases using the keywords bipolar disorder, early trauma, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, maltreatment, adversity, and neglect.
   Results: Twenty-eight articles were selected and analyzed. Taken together, the articles described a high prevalence of EET in BD, consisting mainly of emotional neglect/abuse (approximately 40%), particularly when compared to healthy subjects. The review also identified substantial evidence regarding an association between the presence of EET, early disease onset, rapid cycling, comorbidity with anxiety/stress disorders, and cannabis use.
   Conclusion: The integration of the current findings with the identified studies reveals that (1) the methodological limitations noted by Daruy-Filho and colleagues have been largely resolved in more recent studies and (2) the presence of EET in patientswith BD is associated with worse clinical outcomes, particularly early disease onset, presence of clinical or psychiatric comorbidities, suicide, and presence of psychotic episodes/symptoms. The review shows that patients with BD experience more traumatic situations than controls and that emotional trauma is the most frequent type of trauma in this group.

AB  - Background: In recent decades, psychiatrists have become increasingly involved in the care of patients with cancer. Psychiatrists are often less familiar with the field of radiation oncology than with other medical specialties. Objective: Therefore, it is beneficial for consulting psychiatrists to be familiar with the basic principles of radiation therapy (RT) and its potential neuropsychiatric sequelae. Methods: We performed a PubMed search to identify articles describing neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting from RT, including anxiety, claustrophobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and neurocognitive impairment. We also searched for other sequelae of RT that may produce psychiatric symptoms, such as radiation necrosis and endocrinopathies. We provide a basic introduction to the delivery of RT. Results: Psychiatrists may be involved in the treatment of patients before, during, or after RT, and each phase of treatment produces unique considerations. Anxiety about the treatment, especially the need for immobilization with a mask, can be treatment limiting. Adverse effects from treatment, including cognitive impairment and endocrinopathies, can result in psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Consulting psychiatrists should be familiar with the basic principles of RT and the neuropsychiatric sequelae that may result from the treatment. Further research is needed to identify strategies to help patients tolerate RT and to identify additional preventive and therapeutic options for RT-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Machine learning techniques provide new methods to predict diagnosis and clinical outcomes at an individual level. We aim to review the existing literature on the use of machine learning techniques in the assessment of subjects with bipolar disorder. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for articles published in any language up to January 2017. We found 757 abstracts and included 51 studies in our review. Most of the included studies used multiple levels of biological data to distinguish the diagnosis of bipolar disorder from other.psychiatric disorders or healthy controls. We also found studies that assessed the prediction of clinical outcomes and studies using unsupervised machine learning to build more consistent clinical phenotypes of bipolar disorder. We concluded that given the clinical heterogeneity of samples of patients with BD, machine learning techniques may provide clinicians and researchers with important insights in fields such as diagnosis, personalized treatment and prognosis orientation.

AB  - Deficits in emotional processing in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have received increasing interest over the past decades. In this systematic review, we present the results of 18 behavioral studies that have examined the neurobiological base of emotional processing in PD. Multiple aspects of emotional processing have been studied, using a variety of research methods. Deficits in PD are mainly related to autonomic and perceptive processing of intense emotional stimuli, which is accompanied by structural and functional neurobiological abnormalities in predominantly ventral regions of affective neurocircuitry. These structures are more strongly dependent on dopaminergic neurotransmission than the dorsal structures of affective neurocircuitry, which are more related to the cognitive and regulatory aspects of emotion and appear to remain largely intact in PD patients. Considering the importance of active dopaminergic neurotransmission, PD can serve as a prolific model for studying the neurobiological correlates of normal human emotional behavior as well as psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and apathy. Moreover, the fact that PD patients are able to cognitively regulate or modulate their emotional responses despite reduced dopamine supplies, can have important implications for the treatment of affective disorders not only in PD patients but in the general population likewise.

AB  - There is growing awareness of the problem of intimate partner violence (IPV) among military populations. IPV victimisation has been shown to be associated with mental disorder. A better understanding of the link between IPV and mental disorder is needed to inform service development to meet the needs of military families. We aimed to systematically review the literature on the association between IPV victimisation and mental health disorders among military personnel.
   Searches of four electronic databases (Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) were supplemented by reference list screening. Heterogeneity among studies precluded a meta-analysis.
   Thirteen studies were included. There was stronger evidence for an association between IPV and depression/alcohol problems than between IPV and PTSD. An association between IPV and mental health problems was more frequently found among veterans compared to active duty personnel. However, the link between IPV and alcohol misuse was more consistently found among active duty samples. Finally, among active duty personnel psychological IPV was more consistently associated with depression/alcohol problems than physical/sexual IPV. The review highlighted the lack of research on male IPV victimisation in the military.
   There is evidence that the burden of mental health need may be significant among military personnel who are victims of IPV. The influence of attitudes towards gender in the military on research in this area is discussed. Further research is needed to inform development of services and policy to reduce IPV victimisation and the mental health consequences among military personnel.

AB  - Research examining pubertal timing effects on psychopathology has emphasized that a subset of adolescents, particularly females, who experience early pubertal maturation relative to their peers appear to be at increased risk for psychopathology. The aims of the current meta-analysis were (a) to quantify the magnitude of early pubertal timing effects on psychopathology, (b) to examine potential moderators of pubertal timing effects (sex, psychopathology domain, sample composition, measurement method, and mean sample age), and (c) to examine findings in relation to hypotheses in the extant literature explicating differential pubertal timing effects for early versus late youth and males versus females. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and PsycInfo databases and 101 articles met criteria for inclusion. Included studies reported a quantitative association between pubertal timing and higher-order broadband dimensions of psychopathology (i.e., internalizing, externalizing), and/or lower-order subdomains (i.e., distress, fear, antisocial behavior, substance abuse, eating pathology). Using meta-analytic methods, we estimated global effect sizes (Cohen's ds) for the association between pubertal timing and psychopathology. Adolescent sex did not moderate early pubertal timing effects on emotional and behavior problems. However, robust early pubertal timing effects emerged for both males and females across all domains of psychopathology that were small in magnitude (ds similar to.20). Measurement method of pubertal timing, but not sample composition or mean sample age, significantly contributed to the heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies. Findings have implications for refinement of theoretical models of pubertal timing effects on psychopathology and highlight the importance of empirical work that can identify pathways which may link offset pubertal timing to psychopathology during adolescence.

AB  - People with mental illness often face different types of mental illness stigma that may affect their lives, including perceived stigma, self-stigma, harmful coping strategies and poor quality of life. Although anti-stigma interventions for people with mental illness from Western countries have been identified by recent systematic reviews, their efficacy in China is unknown. This review evaluates the efficacy of anti-stigma interventions among people with mental illness in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. A systematic search of 8 electronic databases in English and Chinese yielded 17 randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated wherever possible. Psychoeducation was the most commonly used intervention. SMDs were large and significant for perceived/experienced/anticipated stigma, self-prejudice and coping with stigma, as well as for depression and anxiety symptoms and quality of life. Both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and psychoeducation had positive effects on perceived/experienced/anticipated stigma. The quality of studies was modest and heterogeneity across studies was high. Anti-stigma interventions demonstrated promise to reduce stigma's negative impact on people with mental illness in China, but more high quality intervention research is needed.

AB  - Background: Anxiety and depression are associated with a range of adverse outcomes and represent a large global burden to individuals and health care systems. Prevention programs are an important way to avert a proportion of the burden associated with such conditions both at a clinical and subclinical level. eHealth interventions provide an opportunity to offer accessible, acceptable, easily disseminated globally low-cost interventions on a wide scale. However, the efficacy of these programs remains unclear. The aim of this study is to review and evaluate the effects of eHealth prevention interventions for anxiety and depression.
   Method: A systematic search was conducted on four relevant databases to identify randomized controlled trials of eHealth interventions aimed at the prevention of anxiety and depression in the general population published between 2000 and January 2016. The quality of studies was assessed and a meta-analysis was performed using pooled effect size estimates obtained from a random effects model.
   Results: Ten trials were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. All studies were of sufficient quality and utilized cognitive behavioural techniques. At post-treatment, the overall mean difference between the intervention and control groups was 0.25 (95% confidence internal: 0.09, 0.41; p = 0.003) for depression outcome studies and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.52; p = 0.004) for anxiety outcome studies, indicating a small but positive effect of the eHealth interventions. The effect sizes for universal and indicated/selective interventions were similar (0.29 and 0.25 respectively). However, there was inadequate evidence to suggest that such interventions have an effect on long-term disorder incidence rates.
   Conclusions: Evidence suggests that eHealth prevention interventions for anxiety and depression are associated with small but positive effects on symptom reduction. However, there is inadequate evidence on the medium to long-term effect of such interventions, and importantly, on the reduction of incidence of disorders. Further work to explore the impact of eHealth psychological interventions on long-term incidence rates.

   Study selection and analysis A search was conducted on three major mobile platforms: Apple iTunes, Google Play and Windows Store. Apps were included if they addressed social anxiety and used an English language interface. A systematic review of the literature from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science to identify evidence-based evaluations of social anxiety apps was also undertaken.
   Findings Of the 1154 apps identified, 38 apps met the inclusion criteria: iTunes (n=18), Google Play (n=16) and Windows Store (n=4). Over 60% of apps were exclusively focused on social anxiety, while the remainder targeted social anxiety and related conditions. Most developers did not provide information on their organisational affiliations or their content source. Most apps used multimedia while 17 apps used text only. Finally, although the systematic review of the literature identified 94 articles, none of which met inclusion criteria.
   Conclusions Social anxiety apps have the potential to overcome barriers to accessing treatment; however, none of the apps identified have had studies on their effectiveness published. As the evidence base is lacking, it is therefore not currently possible to recommend their use.

This systematic review explored whether chronic illness in adolescents was similarly associated with poor psychiatric outcomes. The literature search identified 129 articles, only 5 of which were indicated to be at a low risk of methodological bias. Four of these articles found a strong relationship between asthma in adolescence and an increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders, while the remaining article, which focused on diabetes mellitus, indicated similarly increased rates of psychiatric illness. Trends among the remaining studies suggested that many illnesses were not associated with poor adolescent mental health. Please note that chronic conditions with a neurological aetiology were excluded from the main review due to indications of qualitative differences in comorbidities. Findings highlight that the well-being of adolescents with chronic illness warrants a specific research focus.

AB  - Aims and method To systematically review the prevalence and associated factors of burnout and stress-related psychiatric disorders among UK doctors. An extensive search was conducted of PubMed, EBSCOhost and British medical journals for studies published over a 20-year span measuring the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity (using the General Health Questionnaire) and burnout (using the Maslach Burnout Inventory).
   Results Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity ranged from 17 to 52%. Burnout scores for emotional exhaustion ranged from 31 to 54.3%, depersonalisation 17.4 to 44.5% and low personal accomplishment 6 to 39.6%. General practitioners and consultants had the highest scores. Factors significantly associated with increase in the prevalence of burnout and psychiatric morbidity include low job satisfaction, overload, increased hours worked and neuroticism.
   Clinical implications The results indicate a worryingly high rate of burnout and psychiatric morbidity among UK doctors, which could have a huge negative impact on healthcare provision in general. Factors at personal and organisational levels contribute to burnout and psychiatric morbidity, and so efforts made to counter these problems should target both levels.

AB  - Objective: Research has suggested that sexual minority young people are more likely to have depressive symptoms or depressive disorder, but to date most studies in the field have relied on convenience-based samples. This study overcomes this limitation by systematically reviewing the literature from population-based studies and conducting a meta-analysis to identify whether depressive disorder and depressive symptoms are elevated in sexual minority youth.
   Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted and informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement to determine if rates of depressive symptoms or depressive disorder differ for sexual minority youth, relative to heterosexual adolescents. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and ERIC databases were searched. Studies reporting depressive symptom data or the prevalence of depressive disorder in population-based samples of adolescents, which included sexual minority youth and heterosexual young people, were included in the review. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine differences between groups.
   Results: Twenty-three articles met the inclusion criteria. The proportion of sexual minority youth in the studies ranged from 2.3% to 12%. Sexual minority youth reported higher rates of depressive symptoms and depressive disorder (odds ratio=2.94, p<0.001 and standardized mean difference, d=0.39, p<0.001) in comparison to heterosexual young people. Female sexual minority youth were more likely to report depressive symptoms when compared to male sexual minority youth (standardized mean difference, d=0.34, p<0.001). Limitations included variations in how sexuality was operationalized and how depressive symptoms or depressive disorder was measured.
   Conclusions: There is robust evidence that rates of depressive disorder and depressive symptoms are elevated in sexual minority youth in comparison to heterosexual young people. Despite the elevated risk of depressive symptoms or depressive disorder for sexual minority youth, the treatment for this group of young people has received little attention.

AB  - Background: Stress and anxiety are common in pregnancy and shown to have adverse effects on maternal and infant health outcomes. The aim of this review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of music-based interventions in reducing levels of stress or anxiety among pregnant women.
   Methods: Six databases were searched using key terms relating to pregnancy, psychological stress, anxiety and music. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled or quasi-experimental trials that assessed the effect of music during pregnancy and measured levels of psychological stress or anxiety as a primary or secondary outcome. Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Quality assessment was performed using The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias criteria. Meta-analyses were conducted to assess stress and anxiety reduction following a music-based intervention compared to a control group that received routine antenatal care.
   Results: Five studies with 1261 women were included. Music interventions significantly reduced levels of maternal anxiety (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD): -0.21; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.39, -0.03; p = 0.02). There was no significant effect on general stress (SMD: -0.08; 95% CI -0.25, 0.09; p = 0.35) or pregnancy-specific stress (SMD: -0. 02; 95% CI -0.19, 0.15; p = 0.80). The methodological quality of included studies was moderate to weak, all studies having a high or unclear risk of bias in allocation concealment, blinding and selective outcome reporting.
   Conclusions: There is evidence that music-based interventions may reduce anxiety in pregnancy; however, the methodological quality of the studies was moderate to weak. Additional research is warranted focusing on rigour of assessment, intensity of interventions delivered and methodological limitations.

AB  - Despite a lack of proven efficacy, pre-employment or pre-duty screening, which alleges to test for vulnerability to PTSD and other mental health disorders, remains common amongst emergency services. This systematic review aimed to determine the usefulness of different factors in predicting mental disorder amongst emergency workers and to inform practice regarding screening procedures. Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE to identify cohort studies linking pre-employment or pre-duty measures in first responders with later mental health outcomes. Possible predictors of poor mental health were grouped into six categories and their overall level of evidence was assessed. Twenty-one prospective cohort studies were identified. Dynamic measures including physiological responses to simulated trauma and maladaptive coping styles (e.g. negative self-appraisal) had stronger evidence as predictors of vulnerability in first responders than more traditional static factors (e.g. pre-existing psychopathology). Personality factors (e.g. trait anger) had moderate evidence for predictive power. Based on the evidence reviewed, however, we are unable to provide emergency services with specific information to enhance their current personnel selection. The results indicate that pre-duty screening protocols that include personality assessments and dynamic measures of physiological and psychological coping strategies may be able to identify some personnel at increased risk of mental health problems. However, further longitudinal research is required in order to provide meaningful guidance to employers on the overall utility of either pre-employment or pre-duty screening. In particular, research examining the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of various screening measures is urgently needed.

AB  - Background: Emotional lability (EL) is an associated feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, contributing to functional impairment. Yet the effect of pharmacological treatments for ADHD on EL symptoms is unknown. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effects of stimulants and atomoxetine on symptoms of EL and compare these with the effects on core ADHD symptoms.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted on the databases Embase, PsychInfo, and Ovid Medline1 and the clinicaltrials. gov website. We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of stimulants and atomoxetine in adults aged 18-60 years, with any mental health diagnosis characterised by emotional or mood instability, with at least one outcome measure of EL. All identified trials were on adults with ADHD. A random-effects meta-analysis with standardised mean difference and 95% confidence intervals was used to investigate the effect size on EL and compare this to the effect on core ADHD symptoms.
   Results: Of the 3,864 publications identified, nine trials met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Stimulants and atomoxetine led to large mean weighted effect-sizes for on ADHD symptoms (n = 9, SMD = -0.8, 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.53). EL outcomes showed more moderate but definite effects (n = 9, SMD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.25).
   Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, stimulants and atomoxetine were moderately effective for EL symptoms, while effect size on core ADHD symptoms was twice as large. Methodological issues may partially explain the difference in effect size. Reduced average effect size could also reflect heterogeneity of EL with ADHD pharmacotherapy responsive and non-responsive sub-types. Our findings indicate that EL may be less responsive than ADHD symptoms overall, perhaps indicating the need for adjunctive psychotherapy in some cases. To clarify these questions, our findings need replication in studies selecting subjects for high EL and targeting EL as the primary outcome. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundThis meta-narrative review, conducted according to the RAMESES (Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards) standards, critically examines the construct of self-compassion to determine if it is an accurate target variable to mitigate work-related stress and promote compassionate caregiving in healthcare providers.
   MethodsPubMed, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies were coded as referring to: (1) conceptualisation of self-compassion; (2) measures of self-compassion; (3) self-compassion and affect; and (4) self-compassion interventions. A narrative approach was used to evaluate self-compassion as a paradigm.
   ResultsSixty-nine studies were included. The construct of self-compassion in healthcare has significant limitations. Self-compassion has been related to the definition of compassion, but includes limited facets of compassion and adds elements of uncompassionate behavior. Empirical studies use the Self-Compassion Scale, which is criticised for its psychometric and theoretical validity. Therapeutic interventions purported to cultivate self-compassion may have a broader effect on general affective states. An alleged outcome of self-compassion is compassionate care; however, we found no studies that included patient reports on this primary outcome.
   ConclusionWe critically examine and delineate self-compassion in healthcare providers as a composite of common facets of self-care, healthy self-attitude, and self-awareness rather than a construct in and of itself.

AB  - Background Explosive remnants of war (ERW)-landmines, unexploded ordnance (UXO), and abandoned explosive ordnance (AXO)-have been recognised as a threat to health since the 1990s. We aimed to study the effect of ERW on global public health.
   Methods In this systematic mixed-studies review, we searched the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and ProQuest databases, and hand searched relevant websites, for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and Aug 31, 2015. We used keywords and Medical Subject Headings related to ERW, landmines, UXO, and AXO to locate original peer-reviewed quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods studies in English of the direct physical or psychological effects of ERW on direct victims of the explosive device or reverberating social and economic effects on direct victims and indirect victims (their families and the wider at-risk community). We excluded studies if more than 20% of participants were military, if they were of deminers, if they were from high-income countries, or if they were of chemical weapons. We identified no peer-reviewed studies of AXO effects, so we extended the search to include grey literature. We critically appraised study quality using a mixed methods appraisal tool. We used a narrative synthesis approach to categorise and synthesise the literature. We extracted quantitative data and calculated means and percentages.
   Findings The initial search identified 10 226 studies, leaving 8378 (82%) after removal of duplicates, of which we reviewed 54 (26 [48%] were quantitative descriptive studies, 20 [37%] were quantitative non-randomised studies, four [7%] were mixed-methods studies, and four [7%] were grey literature). The direct psychological effects of landmines or UXO appear high. We identified comorbidity of anxiety and depression in landmine or UXO victims in four studies, more women presented with post-traumatic stress disorder than did men in two studies, and landmine or UXO victims reported a greater prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, or depression than did control groups in two studies. Overall injury and mortality rates caused by landmines or UXO decreased over time across five studies and increased in one. More men were injured or killed by landmines or UXO than were women (0-30.6% of women), the mean ages of casualties ranged from 18.5 years to 38.1 years, and victims were likely to be doing an activity of economic necessity at the time of injury. The proportion of casualties of landmines or UXO younger than 18 years ranged from 22% to 55% across twelve studies. Landmine or UXO victims who had one or more limbs amputated ranged from 19.5% to 82.6%. Landmines and UXO had a negative effect on internally displaced populations and returning refugees, physical security, economic productivity, child health and educational attainment, food security, and agriculture in studies from seven countries. We could not establish the proportion of casualties caused by AXO from unplanned explosions at munitions sites, although the grey literature suggests that AXO is a substantial problem.
   Interpretation Individually, these landmine and UXO results are not new and substantiate findings from existing research. Taken together, however, these findings provide a picture of the effect of landmines and UXO that stretches far beyond injury and mortality prevalence, making landmine and UXO clearance a more favourable option for funders. AXO effects are understudied and warrant further research. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 license.

AB  - Transition to parenthood represents an important life event which increases vulnerability to psychological disorders. Aim of this article is to analyze all studies which investigated the effects of untreated perinatal paternal depression in offspring. We searched pertinent, peer-reviewed articles published in English (January 1980 to April 2016) on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Science.gov. Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of the reviewed studies suffer from methodological limitations, including the small sample, the lack of a structured psychiatric diagnosis, and inclusion bias. Despite such limitations, paternal depression seems to be associated with an increased risk of developmental and behavioural problems and even psychiatric disorders in offspring. In particular, in infants and toddlers such problems vary from increased crying to hyperactivity and conduct problems to psychological and developmental impairment, and poor social outcomes. School-age children of depressed fathers have a doubled risk for suffering from specific psychiatric disorders. Hence, facilitating access to vigorous and evidence based treatments is a public health opportunity for improving the quality of life of depressed parents and their children. Evidences emerging from this review actually suggest that the traditional gender-focused approach to perinatal mood disorders should be completed by a family-centred approach, in order to improve the effectiveness of perinatal mental health programs.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been found to be effective for treating PTSD, but whether different frequencies have different effects remains controversial. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to address this question. We searched the literature for studies written in English or Chinese in 9 electronic databases from the databases' inception to August 1, 2016. Additional articles were identified from the reference lists of identified studies and from personal reference collections. Eighteen articles were included, and 11 were suitable for the meta-analysis (Combined sample size was 377 (217 in active rTMS groups, 160 in sham-controlled groups)). Low-frequency (LF) rTMS resulted in a significant reduction in the PTSD total score and the depression score (1. PTSD total score: pooled SMD, 0.92; Cl, 0.11-1.72; 2. Depression: pooled SMD, 0.54; CI, 0.08-1.00). High-frequency (HF) rTMS showed the following results: 1. PTSD total score: pooled SMD, 3.24; CI, 2.24-4.25; 2. re-experiencing: pooled SMD, -1.77; CI, -2.49(-1.04); 3. Avoidance: pooled SMD, -1.57; CI, -2.50-(-0.84); 4. hyperarousal: pooled SMD, -1.32; CI, -2.17-(-0.47); 5. depression: pooled SMD, 1.92; CI, 0.80-3.03; and 6. Anxiety: pooled SMD, 2.67; CI, 1.82-3.52. Therefore, both HF and LF rTMS can alleviate PTSD symptoms. Although the evidence is extremely limited, LF rTMS can reduce overall PTSD and depression symptoms. HF rTMS can improve the main and related symptoms of PTSD. However, additional research is needed to substantiate these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective : To systematically review the effect of psychosocial interventions on improving QoL, depression and anxiety of cancer caregivers.
   Methods : We conducted a systematic review of psychosocial interventions among adult cancer caregivers published from 2011 to 2016. PsycINFO, PubMed, Proquest, Cochrane Library, Embase, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and EBSCO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WANFANG were searched. Inclusion criteria were: randomized controlled trails (RCTs); psychosocial intervention to cancer caregivers; psychosocial health indicators including quality of life, depression or anxiety.
   Results : 21 studies out of 4,666 identified abstracts met inclusion criteria, including 19 RCTs. The intervention modes fell into the following nine categories: family connect intervention, self-determination theory-based intervention (SDT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), emotion-focused therapy (EFT), comprehensive health enhancement support system (CHESS), FOCUS programme, existential behavioral therapy (EBT), telephone interpersonal counseling (TIP-C), problem-solving intervention (COPE).
   Conclusion : paired-intervention targeting self-care and interpersonal connections of caregivers and symptom management of patients is effective in improving quality of life and alleviating depression of cancer caregivers while music therapy is helpful for reducing anxiety of cancer caregivers.

AB  - Background: Many young people who receive psychiatric care in inpatient or residential settings in North America have experienced various forms of emotional trauma. Moreover, these settings can exacerbate trauma sequelae. Common practices, such as seclusion and restraint, put young people at risk of retraumatization, development of comorbid psychopathology, injury, and even death. In response, psychiatric and residential facilities have embraced trauma-informed care (TIC), an organizational change strategy which aligns service delivery with treatment principles and discrete interventions designed to reduce rates of retraumatization through responsive and non-coercive staff-client interactions. After more than two decades, a number of TIC frameworks and approaches have shown favorable results. Largely unexamined, however, are the features that lead to successful implementation of TIC, especially in child and adolescent inpatient psychiatric and residential settings.
   Methods: Using methods proposed by Pawson et al. (J Health Serv Res Policy 10: 21-34, 2005), we conducted a modified five-stage realist systematic review of peer-reviewed TIC literature. We rigorously searched ten electronic databases for peer reviewed publications appearing between 2000 and 2015 linking terms "trauma-informed" and "child*"or"youth,"plus"inpatient"or"residential"plus"psych*"or"mental." After screening 693 unique abstracts, we selected 13 articles which described TIC interventions in youth psychiatric or residential settings. We designed a theoretically-based evaluative framework using the active implementation cycles of the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN) to discern which foci were associated with effective TIC implementation. Excluded were statewide mental health initiatives and TIC implementations in outpatient mental health, child welfare, and education settings. Interventions examined included: Attachment, Self-Regulation, and Competency Framework; Six Core Strategies; Collaborative Problem Solving; Sanctuary Model; Risking Connection; and the Fairy Tale Model.
   Results: Five factors were instrumental in implementing trauma informed care across a spectrum of initiatives: senior leadership commitment, sufficient staff support, amplifying the voices of patients and families, aligning policy and programming with trauma informed principles, and using data to help motivate change.
   Conclusions: Reduction or elimination of coercive measures may be achieved by explicitly targeting specific coercive measures or by implementing broader therapeutic models. Additional research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of both approaches.

AB  - Background: Marijuana represents the most widely used illicit drug on college campuses. Repeated use can impair students' academic, emotional, and physical success and can lead to chronic diseases. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate existing literature on the associated effects of marijuana use on U.S. college students' academic success, including conduct/legal issues, negative outcomes, normative perceptions, and physical/mental health. Method: A critical review was conducted in January 2015 using the PubMed, Academic Search Complete, Electronic Journal Center, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases. Studies were included if they focused on epidemiological outcomes of marijuana use on U.S. undergraduate college students aged 17-24. Results: Overall, studies lacked scientific rigor. In several studies, researchers relied on convenience samples, used small sample sizes, did not report response rates, or did not report the psychometrics of the instrument. The majority of the studies were conducted at single institutions, limiting external validity. Conclusion: More rigorous and methodically sound research is necessary. Specifically, researchers should employ randomized sampling methods, collect representative response rates, and assess reliability and validity appropriately. Translation to Health Education Practice: Practitioners should design, implement, and evaluate programs that focus on social norms, acute and chronic health issues, and academic outcomes.

AB  - Unipolar depression is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders in youth, particularly with anxiety and disruptive disorders. Previous literature reviews suggested that patterns of comorbidity differed by age and sex. However, most authors from previous published reviews did not specifically target age and sex as a priori criteria in selecting studies on comorbidity during adolescence. Moreover, these reviews did not consider potentially important methodological issues that might explain inconsistencies in comorbidity rates across studies. In our literature review, we selected empirical studies published within the last 15 years with the aim of targeting age and sex as principal variables associated with heterotypic comorbidity of either anxiety or disruptive disorders and depression. Additionally, relevant methodological aspects that were not considered systematically in previous reviews were taken into account in the presentation of results (e.g., type of instrument, informant assessing youth's mental disorders). In the present review, a total of 29 cross-sectional and longitudinal studies met the following selection criteria in their research design: (a) structured or semistructured instruments assessing anxiety, disruptive, and depressive disorders; and (b) samples of adolescents aged at least 12 years. Our review highlights inconsistent results across clinical and community studies regarding age-and sex-related patterns of comorbidity. However, some studies indicated the presence of high comorbidity rates between either anxiety or disruptive disorders and depression in adolescent girls. This review suggests that the complexity of the comorbidity phenomenon precludes definitive conclusions about its variations according to age and sex. Implications for prevention, treatment, and future research are discussed.

AB  - The long-term consequences of psychosocial and socioeconomic challenges are hardly distinguishable from those of inappropriate nutrition, suggesting the existence of common physiological pathways funnelling the effects of early adversity. Obesity and mood disorders are highly prevalent and co-morbid in adult subjects. In order to unravel such comorbidity, and to gain a more complete understanding of how the programming by early-life stress takes place, it is necessary to describe the common pathways, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. There is now robust evidence to indicate that the body reacts to stress through changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, setting up adult responsiveness to environmental stressors and leading to individual vulnerability/resilience to stress and disease. Glucocorticoids (GCs) and neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), play a critical role in the integration of behavioural and metabolic responses to external challenges, including nutrients availability, and have important effects on brain plasticity. In addition, very recent data indicate the existence of the gut-brain axis as another important target and mediator of the effects of early life stress and nutrition. A complete understanding of these complex regulations needs to take into account multiple intervening variables, such as sex and genetic/epigenetic landscapes, and consider the developmental/life stage in a life-long perspective. Integrative and multidisciplinary approaches will be needed in the future to advance the field and to devise early intervention strategies for a life-long mental and behavioural health.

AB  - Over the last quarter of a century, research in the field of stress resilience has provided a unique perspective of how the brain responds to stress. In particular, it sheds light on the various psychosocial, biological and external factors that determines whether an individual will either be resilient or susceptible in the face of stress. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA sequences with a major role in regulating gene expression at the transcriptional level and a growing body of evidence suggests that they may be key molecular mediators of stress resilience. In this review we argue that an increased understanding of the functional role microRNAs have in relation to various biological determinants of resilience will enable us to develop intervention strategies which could be used to promote resilience in at-risk individuals or individuals who have experienced stress. This approach may attenuate the risk of psychiatric sequelae such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders which currently have a significant economic and social burden on society.

AB  - Background: An individual's subjective perception of well-being is increasingly recognized as an essential complement to clinical symptomatology and functional impairment in children's mental health. Measurement of quality of life (QoL) has the potential to give due weight to the child's perspective. Scope and methodology: Our aim was to critically review the current evidence on how childhood mental disorders affect QoL. First, the major challenges in this research field are outlined. Then we present a systematic review of QoL in children and adolescents aged 0-18 years formally diagnosed with a mental and behavioural disorder, as compared to healthy or typically developing children or children with other health conditions. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current evidence base and future directions based on the results of the systematic review and other relevant literature. Findings and conclusions: The systematic review identified 41 eligible studies. All were published after the year 2000 and 21 originated in Europe. The majority examined QoL in neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (k = 17), autism spectrum disorder (k = 6), motor disorders (k = 5) and intellectual disability (k = 4). Despite substantial heterogeneity, studies demonstrate that self-reported global QoL is significantly reduced compared to typical/healthy controls across several disorders and QoL dimensions. Parents' ratings were on average substantially lower, casting doubt on the validity of proxy-report. Studies for large diagnostic groups such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, (early onset) schizophrenia and eating disorders are largely lacking. We conclude that representative, well-characterized normative and clinical samples as well as longitudinal and qualitative designs are needed to further clarify the construct of QoL, to derive measures of high ecological validity, and to examine how QoL fluctuates over time and is attributable to specific conditions or contextual factors.

AB  - Aim: Early intervention and prevention of serious mental disorders such as bipolar disorder has the promise of decreasing the burden associated with these disorders. With increasing early and preventive intervention efforts among cohorts such as those with a familial risk for bipolar disorder, there is a need to examine the associated ethical concerns. The aim of this review was to examine the ethical issues underpinning the clinical research on pre-onset identification and preventive interventions for bipolar disorder.
   Methods: We undertook a PubMed search updated to November 2014 incorporating search terms such as bipolar, mania, hypomania, ethic* (truncated), early intervention, prevention, genetic and family.
   Results: Fifty-six articles that were identified by this method as well as other relevant articles were examined within a framework of ethical principles including beneficence, nonmaleficence, respect for autonomy and justice. The primary risks associated with research and clinical interventions include stigma and labelling, especially among familial high-risk youth. Side effects from interventions are another concern. The benefits of preventive or early interventions were in the amelioration of symptoms as well as the possibility of minimizing disability, cognitive impairment and progression of the illness. Supporting the autonomy of individuals and improving access to stigma-free care may help moderate the potential challenges associated with the risks of interventions.
   Conclusions: Concerns about the risks of early identification and pre-onset interventions should be balanced against the potential benefits, the individuals' right to choice and by improving availability of services that balance such dilemmas.

AB  - AIM
   To identify health and psychosocial problems associated with bullying victimization and conduct a meta-analysis summarizing the causal evidence.
   METHODS
   A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, ERIC and PsycINFO electronic databases up to 28 February 2015. The study included published longitudinal and cross-sectional articles that examined health and psychosocial consequences of bullying victimization. All meta-analyses were based on quality-effects models. Evidence for causality was assessed using Bradford Hill criteria and the grading system developed by the World Cancer Research Fund.
   RESULTS
   Out of 317 articles assessed for eligibility, 165 satisfied the predetermined inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Statistically significant associations were observed between bullying victimization and a wide range of adverse health and psychosocial problems. The evidence was strongest for causal associations between bullying victimization and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, poor general health and suicidal ideation and behaviours. Probable causal associations existed between bullying victimization and tobacco and illicit drug use.
   CONCLUSION
   Strong evidence exists for a causal relationship between bullying victimization, mental health problems and substance use. Evidence also exists for associations between bullying victimization and other adverse health and psychosocial problems, however, there is insufficient evidence to conclude causality. The strong evidence that bullying victimization is causative of mental illness highlights the need for schools to implement effective interventions to address bullying behaviours.

AB  - AIM
   To provide an overview of the current research in the functional neuroanatomy of panic disorder.
   METHODS
   Panic disorder (PD) is a frequent psychiatric disease. Gorman et al (1989; 2000) proposed a comprehensive neuroanatomical model of PD, which suggested that fear-and anxiety-related responses are mediated by a so-called "fear network" which is centered in the amygdala and includes the hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray region, locus coeruleus and other brainstem sites. We performed a systematic search by the electronic database PubMed. Thereby, the main focus was laid on recent neurofunctional, neurostructural, and neurochemical studies (from the period between January 2012 and April 2016). Within this frame, special attention was given to the emerging field of imaging genetics.
   RESULTS
   We noted that many neuroimaging studies have reinforced the role of the "fear network" regions in the patho-physiology of panic disorder. However, recent functional studies suggest abnormal activation mainly in an extended fear network comprising brainstem, anterior and midcingulate cortex (ACC and MCC), insula, and lateral as well as medial parts of the prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, differences in the amygdala activation were not as consistently reported as one would predict from the hypothesis of Gorman et al (2000). Indeed, amygdala hyperactivation seems to strongly depend on stimuli and experimental paradigms, sample heterogeneity and size, as well as on limitations of neuroimaging techniques. Advanced neurochemical studies have substantiated the major role of serotonergic, noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of PD. However, alterations of GABAergic function in PD are still a matter of debate and also their specificity remains questionable. A promising new research approach is "imaging genetics". Imaging genetic studies are designed to evaluate the impact of genetic variations (polymorphisms) on cerebral function in regions critical for PD. Most recently, imaging genetic studies have not only confirmed the importance of serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission in the etiology of PD but also indicated the significance of neuropeptide S receptor, CRH receptor, human TransMEMbrane protein (TMEM123D), and amiloride-sensitive cation channel 2 (ACCN2) genes.
   CONCLUSION
   In light of these findings it is conceivable that in the near future this research will lead to the development of clinically useful tools like predictive biomarkers or novel treatment options.

AB  - Despite being the object of a thriving field of clinical research, the investigation of intrinsic brain network alterations in psychiatric illnesses is still in its early days. Because the pathological alterations are predominantly probed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), many questions about the electrophysiological bases of resting-state alterations in psychiatric disorders, particularly among mood disorder patients, remain unanswered. Alongside important research using electroencephalography (EEG), the specific recent contributions and future promise of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in this field are not fully recognized and valued. Here, we provide a critical review of recent findings from MEG resting-state connectivity within major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). The clinical MEG resting-state results are compared with those previously reported with fMRI and EEG. Taken together, MEG appears to be a promising but still critically underexploited technique to unravel the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate abnormal (both hyper- and hypo-) connectivity patterns involved in MDD and BD. In particular, a major strength of MEG is its ability to provide source-space estimations of neuromagnetic long-range rhythmic synchronization at various frequencies (i.e., oscillatory coupling). The reviewed literature highlights the relevance of probing local and interregional rhythmic synchronization to explore the pathophysiological underpinnings of each disorder. However, before we can fully take advantage of MEG connectivity analyses in psychiatry, several limitations inherent to MEG connectivity analyses need to be understood and taken into account. Thus, we also discuss current methodological challenges and outline paths for future research. MEG resting-state studies provide an important window onto perturbed spontaneous oscillatory brain networks and hence supply an important complement to fMRI-based resting-state measurements in psychiatric populations.

AB  - Introduction: Although suicidality is frequently the cause of stigma, it is conversely true that stigma may be the cause of suicidality. The present paper focuses on the complex relationships that exist between suicidal behavior and stigmatizing attitudes.
   Methods: A narrative review of the topic will be presented on the basis of the relevant literature collected from an electronic search of PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases, using stigma, public stigma, structural stigma, perceived stigma, self-stigma, suicide, attempted suicide, and suicidality as key words.
   Results: A negative perception is frequently held of suicidal people, labeling them as weak and unable to cope with their problems, or selfish. Individuals who have attempted suicide are subject to similar processes of stigmatization and "social distancing"; insurance policies include an exclusion clause against death by suicide. Subjects with a direct personal experience of depression or suicide strongly endorse a feeling of self-stigma; those who have attempted suicide are often ashamed and embarrassed by their behavior and tend to hide the occurrence as much as possible. Similar processes are observed among family members of subjects who have committed suicide or made a suicide attempt, with a higher perceived stigma present in those bereaved by suicide. Perceived or internalized stigma produced by mental or physical disorders, or through belonging to a minority group, may represent a significant risk factor for suicide, being severely distressing, reducing self-esteem and acting as a barrier in help-seeking behaviors.
   Conclusion: With the aim of preventing suicide, greater efforts should be made to combat the persisting stigmatizing attitudes displayed toward mental disorders and suicide itself. Indeed, the role of stigma as a risk factor for suicide should further motivate and spur more concerted efforts to combat public stigma and support those suffering from perceived or internalized stigma. Experts and scientific societies should form an alliance with the media in an effort to promote a marked change in the societal perception of mental health issues and suicide. As stigma may result in severe consequences, specialist care and psychological interventions should be provided to populations submitted to stigma.

AB  - Background: Pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may be effective in reducing symptoms in the majority of patients. The study of moderators and predictors of treatment response may help clinicians both to select appropriate interventions to maximize the probability of response and to inform the general prognosis.
   Methods: A systematic literature search of electronic databases, selected authors, and reference lists was used to identify articles that reported trials of drug monotherapy in GAD. Data on predictors and moderators were extracted. Quality of evidence was determined by the presence of a priori hypotheses, number of variables investigated, adequate quality of the measurement, and use of interaction-effects testing.
   Results: From the 98 articles meeting inclusion criteria, 24 reported a total of 22 factors associated with treatment response. The reported results were heterogeneous, ranging over sociodemographic, clinical, comorbidity, genetic, and functional-imaging studies. Major depressive symptoms were found to moderate treatment outcome in favor of antidepressants versus benzodiazepines. Neuroticism, previous treatment, genetic polymorphisms (including serotonin receptor gene 2A), and functional activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala were identified as potential predictors of treatment response.
   Conclusions: Correlates of poor emotion regulation predicted poor treatment response, but subclinical depression was the only variable capable of informing treatment selection in this review. Future research should focus on further exploring the value of depression as a moderator and on a narrower list of potential genetic, brain-imaging, and temperament predictors of response to pharmacotherapy in GAD.

AB  - Background
   Although there are consistent reports of higher psychosis rates among immigrants, the information on mood disorders is limited.
   Aims
   To review and quantify the difference in incidence of mood disorders in first- and second-generation immigrant (FGI and SGI) groups v. non-immigrants.
   Method
   PubMed, EMBASE and-PsycINFO were searched for articles from cohort studies reporting incidence of mood disorders among FGIs and SGIs.
   Results
   Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. The summary relative risk (RR) for FGIs was 1.25 (95% CI 1.11-1.41), based on 17 effect sizes and 6120 cases, and 1.16 (95% CI 0.96-1.40) for SGIs based on three effect sizes. Men seemed at higher risk (RR= 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1.56).
   Conclusions
   Clinicians should view FGIs as a group at risk of mood disorders, especially men. Further research is needed to understand immigrants' risk, especially in SGI.

AB  - The literature regarding exercise for people with established anxiety disorders is equivocal. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the benefits of exercise compared to usual treatment or control conditions in people with an anxiety and/or stress-related disorders. Major electronic databases were searched from inception until December/2015 and a random effect meta-analysis conducted. Altogether, six randomized control trials (RCTs) including 262 adults (exercise n=132, 34.74 [9.6] years; control n=130, 37.34 [10.0] years) were included. Exercise significantly decreased anxiety symptoms more than control conditions, with a moderate effect size (Standardized Mean Difference=-0.582, 95%CI -1.0 to -0.76, p=0.02). Our data suggest that exercise is effective in improving anxiety symptoms in people with a current diagnosis of anxiety and/ or stress-related disorders. Taken together with the wider benefits of exercise on wellbeing and cardiovascular health, these findings reinforce exercise as an important treatment option in people with anxiety/stress disorders.

AB  - Psychophysiological research integrating heart rate variability (HRV) has increased during the last two decades, particularly given the fact that HRV is able to index cardiac vagal tone. Cardiac vagal tone, which represents the contribution of the parasympathetic nervous system to cardiac regulation, is acknowledged to be linked with many phenomena relevant for psychophysiological research, including self-regulation at the cognitive, emotional, social, and health levels. The ease of HRV collection and measurement coupled with the fact it is relatively affordable, non-invasive and pain free makes it widely accessible to many researchers. This ease of access should not obscure the difficulty of interpretation of HRV findings that can be easily misconstrued, however, this can be controlled to some extent through correct methodological processes. Standards of measurement were developed two decades ago by a Task Force within HRV research, and recent reviews updated several aspects of the Task Force paper. However, many methodological aspects related to HRV in psychophysiological research have to be considered if one aims to be able to draw sound conclusions, which makes it difficult to interpret findings and to compare results across laboratories. Those methodological issues have mainly been discussed in separate outlets, making difficult to get a grasp on them, and thus this paper aims to address this issue. It will help to provide psychophysiological researchers with recommendations and practical advice concerning experimental designs, data analysis, and data reporting. This will ensure that researchers starting a project with HRV and cardiac vagal tone are well informed regarding methodological considerations in order for their findings to contribute to knowledge advancement in their field.

AB  - Interpretation biases have been extensively explored in a range of populations, including patients with anxiety and depressive disorders where they have been argued to influence the onset and maintenance of such conditions. Other populations in which interpretation biases have been explored include patients with chronic pain, anorexia nervosa, and alcohol dependency among others, although this literature is more limited. In this research, stimuli with threatening/emotional and neutral meanings are presented, with participant responses indicative of ambiguity resolution. A large number of paradigms have been designed and implemented in the exploration of interpretation biases, some varying in minor features only. This article provides a review of experimental paradigms available for exploring interpretation biases, with the aim to stimulate and inform the design of future research exploring cognitive biases across a range of populations. A systematic search of the experimental literature was conducted in Medline, PsychINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms were information, stimuli, and ambiguous intersected with the terms interpretation and bias*. Forty-five paradigms were found, categorized into those using ambiguous words, ambiguous images, and ambiguous scenarios. The key features, strengths and limitations of the paradigms identified are discussed.

AB  - Aim of this systematic review is to assess short and long-lasting effects of antenatal exposure to untreated maternal depressive symptoms. Pertinent articles were identified through combined searches of Science.gov, Cochrane library, and PubMed databases (through August 2015). Forty-three, selected articles revealed that untreated gestational depression and even depressive symptoms during pregnancy may have untoward effects on the developing fetus (hyperactivity, irregular fetal heart rate), newborns (increased cortisol and norepinephrine levels, decreased dopamine levels, altered EEG patterns, reduced vagal tone, stress/depressive-like behaviors, and increased rates of premature deaths and neonatal intensive care unit admission), and children (increased salivary cortisol levels, internalizing and externalizing problems, and central adiposity). During adolescence, an independent association exists between maternal antenatal mood symptoms and a slight increase in criminal behaviors. In contrast, the relationship between gestational depression and increased risks of prematurity and low birth weight remains controversial. Given this background, when making clinical decisions, clinicians should weigh the growing evidences suggesting the detrimental and prolonged effects in offspring of untreated antenatal depression and depressive symptoms during pregnancy against the known and emerging concerns associated with in utero exposure to antidepressants.

AB  - Public attitudes towards psychiatry are crucial determinants of help-seeking for mental illness. It has been argued that psychiatry as a discipline enjoys low esteem among the public, and a crisis of psychiatry has been noted. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population studies examining public attitudes towards various aspects of psychiatric care. Our search in PubMed, Web of Science, PsychINFO and bibliographies yielded 162 papers based on population surveys conducted since 2000 and published no later than 2015. We found that professional help for mental disorders generally enjoys high esteem. While general practitioners are the preferred source of help for depression, mental health professionals are the most trusted helpers for schizophrenia. If respondents have to rank sources of help, they tend to favor mental health professionals, while open questions yield results more favorable to general practitioners. Psychiatrists and psychologists/psychotherapists are equally recommended for the treatment of schizophrenia, while for depression psychologists/psychotherapists are more recommended, at least in Europe and America. Psychotherapy is consistently preferred over medication. Attitudes towards seeking help from psychiatrists or psychologists/psychotherapists as well as towards medication and psychotherapy have markedly improved over the last twenty-five years. Biological concepts of mental illness are associated with stronger approval of psychiatric help, particularly medication. Self-stigma and negative attitudes towards persons with mental illness decrease the likelihood of personally considering psychiatric help. In conclusion, the public readily recommends psychiatric help for the treatment of mental disorders. Psychotherapy is the most popular method of psychiatric treatment. A useful strategy to further improve the public image of psychiatry could be to stress that listening and understanding are at the core of psychiatric care.

This meta-analysis investigated: HRV differences in BD compared with HC, major depressive disorder or schizophrenia; HRV differences between affective states; HRV changes from mania/depression to euthymia; and HRV changes following interventions.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis reported according to the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched. A total of 15 articles comprising 2534 individuals were included.
   Results: HRV was reduced in BD compared to HC (g=-1.77, 95% CI: 2.46; 1.09, P<0.001, 10 comparisons, n=1581). More recent publication year, larger study and higher study quality were associated with a smaller difference in HRV. Large between-study heterogeneity, low study quality, and lack of consideration of confounding factors in individual studies were observed.
   Conclusions: This first meta-analysis of HRV in BD suggests that HRV is reduced in BD compared to HC. Heterogeneity and methodological issues limit the evidence. Future studies employing strict methodology are warranted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) bear a disproportionate burden of diabetes and associated long-term complications. Behavioral interventions play a vital role in promoting diabetes medical and psychological outcomes, yet the development of interventions for AI/AN communities has been limited. A systematic review was conducted of studies focused on the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of diagnosed diabetes among AI/ANs. Ovid and PubMed databases and published reference lists were searched for articles published between 1987 and 2014 that related to the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the AI/AN population. Twenty studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Nineteen studies were observational and one study was intervention based. Two of the studies used community-based participatory research methodology. Of the 20 studies, 2 discussed cultural influences associated with diabetes self-management and 10 identified the specific tribes that participated in the study. Tribal affiliations among the studies were broad with the number of AI/AN participants in each study ranging from 30 to 23,529 participants. Emotional and behavioral topics found in the literature were adherence (n = 2), depression (n = 9), physical activity (n = 3), psychosocial barriers (n = 1), social support (n = 3), and stress (n = 2). Relatively few studies were identified using AI/AN populations over a 27-year period. This is in stark contrast to what is known about the prevalence and burden that type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus place on AI/AN communities. Future research should promote community engagement through the use of community-based participatory research methodologies, seek to further understand and describe the emotional and behavioral context for diabetes self-management in this population, and develop and test innovative interventions to promote the best possible diabetes outcomes.

AB  - The gastro-intestinal peptide ghrelin has been assigned many functions. These include appetite regulation, energy metabolism, glucose homeostasis, intestinal motility, anxiety, memory or neuroprotection. In the last decade, this pleiotropic peptide has been proposed as a therapeutic agent in gastroparesis for diabetes and in cachexia for cancer. Ghrelin and its receptor, which is expressed throughout the brain, play an important role in motivation and reward. Ghrelin finely modulates the mesencephalic dopaminergic signaling and is thus currently studied in pathological conditions including dopamine-related disorders. Dopamine regulates motivated behaviors, modulating reward processes, emotions and motor functions to enable the survival of individuals and species. Numerous dopamine-related disorders including Parkinson's disease or eating disorders like 'anorexia nervosa involve altered ghrelin levels. However, despite the growing interest for ghrelin in these pathological conditions, global integrative studies investigating its role in brain dopaminergic structures are still lacking. In this review, we discuss the role of ghrelin on dopaminergic neurons and its relevance in the search for new therapeutics for Parkinson's disease- and anorexia nervosa-related dopamine deficits.

AB  - The reported prevalence of depression and anxiety among African American children and adolescents and their negative sequalae suggest a need to further explore factors that may be protective of depression and anxiety among this population.
   The aim of this review was to examine empirical studies that focus on the association between family-level factors (e.g., parenting practices, family functioning) and depression and anxiety in African American children. Specifically, we examined the studies' characteristics and the relationship between various family-level factors and depression and anxiety outcomes and assessed the methodological quality of studies.
   This review was guided by systematic review methods postulated by Gough and colleagues and the Prisma Group. Electronic databases searched were Social Work Abstracts, PsycINFO, SocIndex, PubMed, Social Service Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts. Thirty-one studies published from 2003 to 2014 were included and assessed for methodological strength using the Quantitative Research Assessment Tool.
   The majority of the study samples were low income and resided in metropolitan or urban areas, and primary caregivers were female. Parenting practices (58 % of studies) were by far the most frequently examined family-level factor associated with depression and anxiety.
   Positive family-level factors (e.g., positive parenting, healthy family functioning and environment) was associated with decreased depression and anxiety. Findings from this review can inform the development or adaptation of family-based interventions that can effectively reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in African American children.

AB  - The current review focuses on studies in rodents published since 2008 and explores possible reasons for any differences they report in the effects of gestational stress on various types of behavior in the offspring. An abundance of experimental data shows that different maternal stressors in rodents can replicate some of the abnormalities in offspring behavior observed in humans. These include, anxiety, in juvenile and adult rats and mice, assessed in the elevated plus maze and open field tests and depression, detected in the forced swim and sucrose-preference tests. Deficits were reported in social interaction that is suggestive of pathology associated with schizophrenia, and in spatial learning and memory in adult rats in the Morris water maze test, but in most studies only males were tested. There were too few studies on the novel object recognition test at different inter-trial intervals to enable a conclusion about the effect of prenatal stress and whether any deficits are more prevalent in males. Among hippocampal glutamate receptors, NR2B was the only subtype consistently reduced in association with learning deficits. However, like in humans with schizophrenia and depression, prenatal stress lowered hippocampal levels of BDNF, which were closely correlated with decreases in hippocampal long-term potentiation. In mice, down-regulation of BDNF appeared to occur through the action of gene-methylating enzymes that are already increased above controls in prenatally-stressed neonates. In conclusion, the data obtained so far from experiments in rodents lend support to a physiological basis for the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and depression.

AB  - Temporal organization of physiology is critical for human health. In the past, humans experienced predictable periods of daily light and dark driven by the solar day, which allowed for entrainment of intrinsic circadian rhythms to the environmental light-dark cycles. Since the adoption of electric light, however, pervasive exposure to nighttime lighting has blurred the boundaries of day and night, making it more difficult to synchronize biological processes. Many systems are under circadian control, including sleep-wake behavior, hormone secretion, cellular function and gene expression. Circadian disruption by nighttime light perturbs those processes and is associated with increasing incidence of certain cancers, metabolic dysfunction and mood disorders. This review focuses on the role of artificial light at night in mood regulation, including mechanisms through which aberrant light exposure affects the brain. Converging evidence suggests that circadian disruption alters the function of brain regions involved in emotion and mood regulation. This occurs through direct neural input from the clock or indirect effects, including altered neuroplasticity, neurotransmission and clock gene expression. Recently, the aberrant light exposure has been recognized for its health effects. This review summarizes the evidence linking aberrant light exposure to mood.

AB  - Problem statement and significance: Left undiagnosed and/or untreated, the short-and long-term sequelae of postpartum depression may negatively impact both mother and child. In Western countries, access to mental health care is influenced by socioeconomic factors. The objective of this systematic literature review is to compile factors that hinder and improve access to postpartum depression treatment in low-income women after a positive screen for postpartum depression. The key question of focus is: what are the characteristics associated with access to mental health treatment for low-income women with a positive postpartum depression screen in Western countries?
   Methods: A PRISMA-based systematic literature review was conducted of studies published in English before February 2016 that looked at treatment for postpartum depression in low-income women who had been identified with the condition. PubMed and EBSCO databases were searched using MESH and key terms and found 100 articles that met the selection criteria. After review by two independent researchers, 18 studies with 17 unique populations were included in the literature review.
   Results: Two independent abstractors searched the included articles for themes surrounding impediments and advantages for low-income women identified with postpartum depression in obtaining mental health treatment. Characteristics of successful mental health treatment included studies that employed the use of a home visitor and those that separated outcomes for women with previous mental health treatment. Themes that emerged as treatment obstacles included cultural barriers, physical barriers, systemic health care barriers, and social barriers.
   Implications for practice: This review will help to better inform screening and treatment priorities for those in the medical field who may encounter women experiencing postpartum depression and are not aware of the various barriers to care specific to low-income women. This review will also help policymakers identify specific obstacles that are not addressed in postpartum screening mandate policies which can affect the implementation of these policies.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown an alarming prevalence of depression, anxiety, and behavior disorders in youth. Thus, prevention of psychological problems in this population becomes crucial. According to the World Health Organization (1), prevention should also include the promotion and development of the individual's strengths in order to reduce vulnerability to suffering from mental disorders. In addition, other key elements of prevention are the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of interventions. The information and communication technologies, especially the Internet, have much to offer in terms of the prevention and promotion of positive mental health in adolescents. This paper reviews these fields of research-prevention, positive psychology, Internet, and adolescents-and discusses the potential of positive interventions delivered over the Internet as effective and sustainable health promotion tools. The paper provides a brief description of the systems developed so far and a summary of selected features of the studies detected in the literature review. The overall conclusions are that there is a need for more controlled studies with long-term follow-ups, the interventions should be designed considering the specific features of the target users and the specific contexts where the interventions will be delivered, and they could be enhanced by the use of other technologies, such as smartphones, sensors, or social networks.

AB  - In the last decade several studies have investigated the role of parental reflective functioning (RF), defined as the parental ability to understand his/her child's mental states, on the child's development. Herein, a narrative review on parental RF is presented aimed at (1) presenting an overview of the existing empirical studies, (2) pinpointing unrequited questions, and (3) identifying future research directions. Specifically, the current review focused on (a) the impact of parental RF on the quality of caregiving and the child's attachment security, (b) the effect of parental RF on the child's emotion regulation and the child's RF, (c) maternal RF in women with a history of neglect and abuse, (d) the efficacy of mentalization-based clinical interventions, and (e) the recently developed Parental Reflective Questionnaire. The following terms "maternal RF," "paternal RF," "parental RF," "parental mentalization," "maternal mentalization," and "paternal mentalization" were searched in titles, abstracts, and main texts using Medline. Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Next, a search in Mendeley was also conducted. Inclusion criteria comprised original articles if they refer to the RF Scale (Foriagy et al., 1998) and were published in an English language, peer-reviewed journal before July, 2016. According to exclusion criteria, dissertations, qualitative or theoretical papers, and chapters in books were not taken into account. The review includes 47 studies that, taken together, supported the notion that higher parental RF was associated with adequate caregiving and the child's attachment security, whereas low maternal RF was found in mothers whose children suffered from anxiety disorders, impairment in emotion regulation, and externalizing behaviors. In addition, higher parental RF was associated with better mentalizing abilities in children. However, unexpected findings have emerged from the most recent randomized controlled trials that tested the efficacy of mentalization-based interventions in high risk samples of mothers, raising questions about the suitability of the verbal measures in capturing the mentalizing processes at the root of the parental capacity to be adequately responsive to the child's emotional needs.

AB  - The benefit of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in controlling the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease is well established, however, the impact on the non-motor symptoms (NMS) remains to be elucidated, although the growing investigative efforts are promising. This article reviews the reported data and considers the level of evidence available with regard to the effect of DBS on NMS total burden and on the cognitive, neuropsychiatric, sleep, pain, dysautonomic, and weight domains. Multiple case series suggest that DBS improves the burden of NMS by reducing prevalence, intensity, and non-motor fluctuations. There is level I evidence on the effect of DBS on cognition and mood. Slight cognitive decline has been reported in most class I studies, although the functional effect is probably minimal. Two randomized prospective studies reported no change in depression while improvement of anxiety has been reported by a class I trial. Prospective cohort studies point to improvement of hyperdopaminergic behaviors, such as impulse control disorders, while others report that hypodopaminergic states, like apathy, can appear after DBS. There is only class III evidence supporting the benefit of DBS on other NMS such as nocturnal sleep, pain, dysautonomia (urinary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and sweating), and weight loss. Although preliminary results are promising, randomized prospectively controlled trials with NMS as primary end points are necessary to further explore the effect of DBS on these often invalidating symptoms and offer conclusions about efficacy.

AB  - Despite that burnout presents a serious burden for modern society, there are no diagnostic criteria. Additional difficulty is the differential diagnosis with depression. Consequently, there is a need to dispose of a burnout biomarker. Epigenetic studies suggest that DNA methylation is a possible mediator linking individual response to stress and psychopathology and could be considered as a potential biomarker of stress-related mental disorders. Thus, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of DNA methylation mechanisms in stress, burnout and depression. In addition to state-of-the-art overview, the goal of this review is to provide a scientific base for burnout biomarker research. We performed a systematic literature search and identified 25 pertinent articles. Among these, 15 focused on depression, 7 on chronic stress and only 3 on work stress/burnout. Three epigenomewide studies were identified and the majority of studies used the candidate-gene approach, assessing 12 different genes. The glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) displayed different methylation patterns in chronic stress and depression. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) methylation was similarly affected in stress, depression and burnout. Work-related stress and depressive symptoms were associated with different methylation patterns of the brain derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) in the same human sample. The tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) methylation was correlated with work stress in a single study. Additional, thoroughly designed longitudinal studies are necessary for revealing the cause-effect relationship of work stress, epigenetics and burnout, including its overlap with depression.

AB  - Background: Eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems resulting from nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a major stressor across the globe. Despite recognition by scientists and stakeholders of the problems of nutrient pollution, rigorous synthesis of scientific evidence is still needed to inform nutrient-related management decisions, especially in streams and rivers. Nutrient stressor-response relationships are complicated by multiple interacting environmental factors, complex and indirect causal pathways involving diverse biotic assemblages and food web compartments, legacy (historic) nutrient sources such as agricultural sediments, and the naturally high spatiotemporal variability of lotic ecosystems. Determining nutrient levels at which ecosystems are affected is a critical first step for identifying, managing, and restoring aquatic resources impaired by eutrophication and maintaining currently unimpaired resources. The systematic review outlined in this protocol will compile and synthesize literature on the response of chlorophyll a to nutrients in streams, providing a state-of-the-science body of evidence to assess nutrient impacts to one of the most widely-used measures of eutrophication. This review will address two questions: "What is the response of chlorophyll a to total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in lotic ecosystems?" and "How are these relationships affected by other factors?"
   Methods: Searches for published and unpublished articles (peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed) will be conducted using bibliographic databases and search engines. Searches will be supplemented with bibliography searches and requests for material from the scientific and management community. Articles will be screened for relevance at the title/abstract and full text levels using pre-determined inclusion criteria; 10% (minimum 50, maximum 200) of screened papers will be examined by multiple reviewers to ensure consistent application of criteria. Study risk of bias will be evaluated using a questionnaire developed from existing frameworks and tailored to the specific study types this review will encounter. Results will be synthesized using meta-analysis of correlation coefficients, as well as narrative and tabular summaries, and will focus on the shape, direction, strength, and variability of available nutrient-chlorophyll relationships. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression will be used to evaluate potential effects of study quality and modifying factors on nutrient-chlorophyll relationships.

AB  - Epigenetics refers to potentially heritable processes that can mediate both lasting and transient changes in gene expression in the absence of genome sequence alterations. The field of epigenetics has introduced a novel understanding of the mechanisms through which the environment can shape an individual and potentially its offspring. This Mini-Review examines the current literature exploring the role of epigenetics in the development of mood disorders such as depression. Depression is twofold more common in females, yet the majority of preclinical research has been conducted exclusively in male subjects. Here we discuss what is known about sex differences in epigenetic regulation and function and how this may contribute to the etiology and onset of mood disorders. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Migration is a process during which a person moves from one cultural setting to another in order to settle for a longer period of time or permanently. The number of immigrants in the world has more than doubled since 1975, with majority of migrants living in Europe today. Migration is now being increasingly recognized as a risk factor for multiple mental-health related issues, such as schizophrenia, psychosis, anxiety disorders and others.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to collect, systematically review and analyze relevant articles pertaining to the mental health of second-or-higher generations of domesticated immigrant population, as well as to determine common socio-cultural predisposition factors leading to the development of mental illness among the mentioned population.
   Methods: Systematic search of relevant and peer-reviewed electronic database ScienceDirect was performed to identify studies related to mental health and healthcare in before-mentioned immigrant population. Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers, following the agreed specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Results: 2 036 records were identified through initial database search, out of which 5 studies were included in this review, after the selection process. Conclusion: The most consistent clinical finding is an increase in the rate of diagnosis of schizophrenia and related psychoses among migrants when compared to the host population, however the relationship between migration and psychotic disorders remains unexplained. So far, biological factors, such as cannabis use or obstetric complications, have failed to account for the risk of schizophrenia among migrant groups. Socio-environmental factors are now being looked upon as potential contributing factors for psychotic disorders in migrants.

   Design/methodology/approach - This study is a systematic review of peer-reviewed papers presenting a rationale for SDM in mental health. Relevant databases were searched from inception to July 2016. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis which aimed to identify and describe different discourses on the rationale for SDM in mental health care. Data were extracted into a standardised data extraction form which contained fields representing the developing thematic framework, study information and research methodology.
   Findings - An initial search returned returned 1,616 papers, of which 175 were eligible for inclusion in this review. The authors developed ten distinct but interrelated themes which capture the various academic discourses on the rationale for SDM and represent some compelling arguments for SDM from a range of different perspectives including ethical, clinical, "user" focussed, economic and political. Dominant narratives in the literature linked SDM to the recovery moment and person-centred care, and adherence and engagement with mental health services.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors are unable to make any conclusions about the strength of evidence for these rationales. The review was restricted to peer-reviewed publications, published in English.
   Practical implications - The findings could be a useful framework to support the selection of outcome measures for SDM evaluations.
   Originality/value - There have been no systematic reviews published in this area previously.

AB  - Postnatal depression (PND) exerts a significant burden on the global public health system, globally affecting approximately 10 to 20% of women. Despite the recently reported high prevalence of PND in Zimbabwe, it is rarely diagnosed or appropriately managed in primary care settings. This review scopes evidence on PND from studies on screening for PND and the associated risk factors conducted in Zimbabwe over the past 20 years. We searched electronic databases for published articles and checked reference lists of studies relating to depression among women in Zimbabwe. We used the following key words: postnatal, depression, women, screening, risk-factors, and Zimbabwe. A total of 14 studies were retrieved as follows: postnatal depression (4), postnatal mental disorders (1), mental disorders among pregnant women (1), and depression and women in general (8). Reported prevalence of PND ranged from 16% to 34.2%. Studies on PND enrolled women from urban and peri-urban settings. Significant risk factors for PND identified among women in Zimbabwe included multi parity, having a spouse who was older than 35years, poorer relations with spouses or partners, having had experienced an adverse event, being unemployed, and having had experienced intimate partner violence. Psychosocial factors are implicated in PND occurrence among Zimbabwean women. There is need to explore the burden of PND among rural communities.

AB  - Background: Neuropsychiatry is now witnessing a consistently increasing number of reports in peer reviewed literature suggesting that internet use may have addictive potential, conglomerated and mediated through reward pathway and akin to substance abuse.
   Methods: We searched for papers indexed in PubMed/Medline with various combinations of the following terms; Internet use, Internet overuse, Internet Addiction, Social Networking Site, Gaming Disorder, Dopamine, Hippocampus, Limbic system, Neural mechanisms, Nucleus accumbens, Prefrontal cortex, Reward system, and Stress. Literature obtained from this search was subjected to certain inclusion/exclusion defining a focused review question of the neuropsychiatric effects of internet use/overuse. The papers included were subjected to deductive analysis and results were then obtained as per the conceptual outlook of current neuropsychiatry.
   Results: Various neuroimaging studies performed on heavy internet users have demonstrated extensive gray and white matter changes and other organizational variations in the brain. Extensive internet use can also precipitate stress propensity in users manifesting as easy fatigue, sleep disturbances, headache, reduced work efficiency, psychological disturbances and neurological problems including, but not limited to, irritation, anxiety, obsessive-compulsion, indecisiveness, impulsivity, loss of working memory, and similar neurocognitive ailments. Exhaustive use of internet may also reflect on the changing food preferences in the form of meeting instant energy needs, higher intake of stimulant beverages, and presumably novel liking for smoking or use of addictive substances to relieve the accumulated mental strain.
   Conclusions: The present analysis explains the implied neural mechanisms of compulsive internet overuse, and also suggests the possible means to deal with the health problems arising from this phenomenon which is emerging as a serious public health concern.

KW  - ANXIETY
AB  - Participation in music therapy offers opportunities for the participants to engage in identity work -to define, develop, or reflect on their understanding of themselves, and to cultivate new expressions of self-identity. The music therapy involves breaking away from the reality and engaging in intense interactions, which in turn facilitate relationships between participants. Patients tend to be more open to new kinds of experiences and explore new ways of perceiving themselves and others. Their self-understanding develops and leads to self-acceptance and personal growth. Although questions concerning the relationship between music therapy and human identity have been asked since antiquity, many issues have still not been resolved. As of today, there are no publications that systematically review the current state of knowledge.
   This article aims to review the available empirical evidence in order to identify the relationship between music therapy processes, identity, and specific individual identity variables, such as self-esteem. Also, it attempts to discover how self-regulatory behavior relates to both general music instruction and interventions designed to enhance self-esteem and identity.
   We searched PubMed and PsycInfo up to 13.09.2016. Screening, eligibility, and data extraction were done by one reviewer. Out of 31 relevant records, 20 were assessed for eligibility, and 14 were included. There was marked variation across included studies regarding type of MT approach used, type of participants, settings, outcomes and measurement tools. A qualitative analysis showed that expression of emotion and a sense of agency (which is considered valuable for both the client and those around them) is a way to provide one's damaged Self with healthful aspects of personality, thus improving one's self-esteem.
   This review provides insight into the effects of music therapy processes, specifically self-knowledge (music identity) and self-esteem determined by the psychological processes entailed in some kinds of music activities.

AB  - Introduction and objective. Due to the reported efficacy of in vitro fertilization (IVF) this method of dealing with infertility is increasing being used. Experiencing IVF can be a source of psychological and emotional difficulties for couples trying to have a child. A systematic review was performed to discuss IVF as a psychological issue that impacts on the functioning of individuals, couples and families. Ebsco, Science Direct and PsycARTICLES databases were searched using the keywords: IVF fertilization, IVF psychology, infertility, and IVF consequences, using published peer reviewed articles from 2006 onwards. Studies in the English and Polish languages, peer reviewed and investigating general IVF and infertility psychological issues were included. Data was collected by the authors between June 2015-January 2016.
   Brief description of the state of knowledge. Studies indicate that partners going through IVF may not have enough support from their closest social environments. It is argued that these unsupportive social interactions affect the well-being of couples, can hinder conception, and therefore are one of the reasons for attrition from IVF, the most effective assisted reproduction method.
   Conclusions. There is a need to conduct studies on the effect of supportive social interactions for the functioning of couples undergoing IVF.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) quantifies biochemical compounds in vivo, and has been used specifically for analyses of neural metabolism and bioenergetics in older adults with mood disorders, usually via proton or phosphorous spectroscopy. While yet to be clinically implemented, data gathered from research subjects may help indicate potential biomarkers of disease state or trait or putative drug targets. Three prevailing hypotheses for these mood disorders are used as a framework for the present review, and the current biochemical findings within each are discussed with respect to particular metabolites and brain regions. This review covers studies of MRS in geriatric mood disorders and reveals persisting gaps in research knowledge, especially with regard to older age bipolar disorder. Further MRS work, using higher field strengths and larger sample sizes, is warranted in order to better understand the neurobiology of these prevalent late-life disorders.

AB  - This review assesses available evidence on the frequency of and trends in depression and suicide among seafarers. Investigations of depression and suicide are scarce and the findings are inconsistent, they do, nevertheless, show indications of improvement although some recent case series do indicate that suicide remains a problem. A review of additional indicators for mental distress and lack of wellbeing supports the decline in frequency of problems, but nuances this in terms of the relative risks in different groups of seafarers, showing internal variations in the frequency of mental health issues among seafarers, with markers such as rank, type of voyage, gender, age, nationality and crew multiculturalism being relevant variables. The methodological limitations that hinder the understanding of depression and suicide in the maritime sector are identified.

AB  - Psychiatric comorbidities are common in movement disorders. This review provides a practical approach to help clinicians to recognize psychiatric disorders in the most frequent movement disorders. However, the extent of neurodegeneration, as well as the impact of medications with considerable CNS effects, influences the diverse psychiatric presentations that, in turn, are influenced by the stress of living with a movement disorder. Depression, anxiety, and psychosis are the most common psychiatric comorbidities in movement disorders and of the medications used to treat the motor disturbances. These psychiatric problems impair patients' functioning throughout the course of the chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the direct connection between brain dysfunction and psychiatric symptoms, there is hope that understanding the psychiatric comorbidities in movement disorders will lead to a better quality-of-life.

AB  - Wilson's disease (WD) is a relatively rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder causing copper accumulation in different organs, mainly the liver and brain. Psychiatric disturbances represent a diagnostic and therapeutic issue in WD. A search for relevant articles was carried out on PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar, for papers focused on psychiatric disorders in WD published between 1985-2016. Ninety-two articles were included in this review, showing the findings from 35 observational and case-control studies and 57 case reports. This study discussed the findings on the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in WD, their impact on the life of those diagnosed, and the efficacy of available treatments on the psychiatric outcomes of WD. Psychiatric disorders are confirmed frequent in WD, with a high prevalence of mood disorders, and contribute to worse Quality-of-Life and psychosocial outcomes. Because specific therapies for WD lead to a good life expectancy, adherence to medicaments and clinical monitoring should be warranted by a multidisciplinary approach, including a hepathologic, neurologic, and psychiatric careful evaluation and education of those affected and their relatives.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available research on the Skills for Social and Academic Success (SASS) program, a school-based cognitive/behavioural intervention for adolescents with social anxiety disorder. A search of online databases, combined with reference list examination and communication with program implementers/developers, led to the identification of five (5) studies that explored the effects of the SASS program (N = 227). Given the age of target individuals, analyses focused on self-report of anxiety, with effect sizes aggregated according to a random effects model and calculated as differences in scores between time points (e.g. Standardized Mean Gain). This program is unique in that it was developed specifically for implementation within school systems. The preliminary evidence based on existing studies suggests that the program holds promise for assisting teens with social anxiety in an ecologically valid setting. In the contemporary context of evidence-based practice, it demonstrates initial empirical support, though additional trials are needed to bolster the overall sample size of youth served, and additional generalization studies are needed.

AB  - Background: Mental health disorders can affect physical and psychological behaviors. The people of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) have a high risk of mental health disorders, such as depression, stress, and substance abuse because the people in this region are trafficked for forced sex work and various forms of forced labor. In these situations, victims often endure violence and abuse from trafficking recruiters, employers, and other individuals. The purposes of this study were to identify the elements characterizing mental health disorders, especially in terms of depression, stress, and substance abuse, and to identify the treatment modalities for mental health disorders in the GMS.
   Methods: The researcher undertook a comparative analysis of the literature, reviews of epidemiological studies and mental disorder therapies, and overviews of previous research studies, were used to generate a synthesis of the existing knowledge of the mental disorder therapeutic modalities. Regarding the search methods, the data from the electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Dynamed and ScienceDirect were supplemented with a manual reference search covering relevant studies from 2005 to 2016.
   Results: Thirty-one papers were included in the review of elements characterizing mental health disorders, especially in terms of depression, stress, and substance abuse, and to identify the treatment modalities for mental health disorders in the GMS. Nine papers defined characterizing mental health disorders, in terms of depression, stress, and substance abuse. Twenty-two papers showed the treatment modalities for mental health disorders that the treatment was effective, these included pharmacological treatments and psychological treatments, such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, biofeedback, and music therapy. Useful guidance can be provided for the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders, and for the care of people in the Greater Mekong Subregion.
   Conclusion: The finding of this review confirms the therapeutic modalities can provide useful guidance for the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders and the care of the people in the Greater Mekong Subregion. In addition, the effective interventions should be tested regarding their suitability for the socio-cultural context in the Greater Mekong Subregion.

This study quantitatively reviewed the literature on rumination and PTS symptoms in trauma-exposed adults, extending prior research by using an inclusive definition of trauma, addressing PTS symptom clusters, and conducting moderator analyses.Method: Searches were conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, PILOTS, EBSCO Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Google Scholar, and Dissertation Abstracts. Sixty-four unique samples from 59 articles were included.Results: Results showed a moderate, positive relationship between rumination and PTS symptoms (r=.50, p<.001). This was not moderated by time since trauma, gender, prior trauma history, Criterion A congruence of events, type of rumination or PTS symptom measure, or sample setting. However, trauma-focused rumination yielded smaller effect sizes than trait rumination. The association between rumination and intrusive re-experiencing was stronger than that between rumination and avoidance (t (13)=9.18, p<.001), or rumination and hyperarousal (t (9)=2.70, p=.022).Conclusions: Results confirm that rumination is associated with increased PTS symptoms. Future research should identify mechanisms underlying this association and their potential specificity by symptoms cluster, as well as further examine the potential moderating roles of gender and prior trauma history.

AB  - Consumption of psychotropic drugs is still increasing, especially in high-income countries. One of the most crucial consequences of this fact is significant release of them to the environment. Considerable amounts of atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and their metabolites were detected in river, lake, and sea water, as well as in tissues of aquatic organisms. Their ecotoxicity was proved by numerous studies. It should be noticed that interaction between psychotropic pharmaceuticals and radiation may lead to formation of potentially more toxic intermediates. On the other hand, photo-assisted wastewater treatment methods can be used as an efficient way to eliminate them from the environment. Many methods based on photolysis and photocatalysis were proposed and developed recently; nevertheless, the problem is still unsolved. However, according to recent studies, photocatalysis could be considered as the most promising and far more effective than regular photolysis. An overview on photolytic as well as homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation methods with the use of various catalysts is presented. The photostability and phototoxicity of pharmaceuticals were also discussed. Various analytical methods were used for the photodegradation research, and this issue was also compared and summarized. Use of high-resolution multistage mass spectrometry (Q-TOF, ion trap, Orbitrap) was suggested. The combined techniques such as LC-MS, GC-MS, and LC-NMR, which enable qualitative and quantitative analyses in one run, proved to be the most valuable in this case. Assembling of MS/MS spectra libraries of drug molecules and their phototransformation products was identified as the future challenge.

It is a well-known fact that the transdiagnostic approach and psychotherapy integration - the two most influential integrative movements in clinical psychology - search for a sound conceptual foundation of the efforts to organize a plethora of theories and data relating to the psychological aspects of physical and mental health. Following a short presentation of general discrepancies afflicting clinical psychology and the main ideas of both the transdiagnostic approach and psychotherapy integration, the notion of emotional health is introduced and its unifying convenience, as well as limitations, is discussed.

   There is a lack of available evidence in relation to the effectiveness of interventions for adults with mild to moderate intellectual disability and mental health problems.
   Aims
   To evaluate the efficacy of interventions for adults with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and co-occurring mental health problems.
   Method
   An electronic literature search of the databases Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and EBM Reviews aimed at identifying randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled trials testing any type of intervention (psychotherapy, biological or system level) for people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities (IQ score 35-69) targeting comorbid mental health problems. Additionally a meta-analysis was conducted.
   Results
   Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. No significant effect was found for the predefined outcome domains behavioural problems, depression, anxiety, quality of life and functioning. The effect size for depression (d=0.49) was moderate but nonsignificant. Quality of studies was moderate and heterogeneity was high.
   Conclusions
   There is no compelling evidence supporting interventions aiming at improving mental health problems in people with mild to moderate intellectual disability. The number of available trials is too low for definite conclusions. Some interventions are promising and should be evaluated further in larger and more rigorous trials.

AB  - Current evidence suggests that the strength of the psychological control condition greatly impacts treatment outcomes. Psychological controls can be grouped into three general classes: no-treatment or waitlist (delayed treatment), attention placebo or the best available treatment comparison. Of these three, the use of the waitlist condition is the most common and is used in up to 73% of published psychological treatment studies. Many psychological interventions are in use today based on the efficacy demonstrated in waitlist controlled trials. In the field of anxiety disorders, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is considered a first-line treatment. Meta-analyses in anxiety disorders have revealed that effect sizes for CBT compared to waitlist controls are much higher than those found using psychological placebos as comparators. Furthermore, waitlists have been associated with deleterious effects and have been described as "no-cebos" in related conditions such as major depressive disorder. Despite these findings, the use of waitlist controls continues to be a mainstay in the psychological anxiety disorders literature. The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of waitlists with a focus on the anxiety disorders. Methodological and ethical issues associated with waitlist controls will be explored, as well the use of alternative psychological placebos. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundSchool-based interventions (SBIs) are well-established and effective treatments for improving child mental health. Specific school-based topics include prevention (Tier I-III) and interventions (e.g. cognitive-behavioural programmes and daily report cards).
   MethodsWe performed a systematic literature search in five commonly used online databases (ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO and PSYNDEX) for English-language articles published between 1993 and 2015. Additional sources included reference lists of relevant articles and book chapters.
   ResultsWe identified a number of successful behavioural or cognitive-behavioural programmes yielding moderate to strong effects for a range of emotional and behavioural problems. The implementation of these programmes and the collaboration of the involved settings (school and home) and persons are important factors for their effectiveness under real-life conditions.
   ConclusionsEffective SBIs are valuable tools for students with mental health problems if evidence-based cognitive-behavioural interventions are applied and rules of translational algorithms and implementation science are respected.

AB  - Detecting and evaluating emotional information from facial expressions as a basis for behavioural adaption belong to the core social-cognitive abilities of mankind. Dysfunctions in emotional face processing are observed in several major psychiatric disorders like depression and schizophrenia. In search for psychiatric disease biomarkers using the imaging genetics approach, serotonergic gene polymorphisms have been associated with altered brain circuit activation during emotional face processing. Especially the 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism has been extensively investigated in association with emotion regulation processes. In this article, imaging genetics literature on emotional face processing, reporting genetic effects of 5-HTTLPR in healthy volunteers is reviewed. Additionally, these results are regarded in relation to pharmacologic challenge (antidepressants, acute tryptophan depletion) imaging studies and discussed in light of recent neurobiological evidence with a focus on serotonin (5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT2A) receptor findings.

AB  - Objective: Depression is common in people with long term conditions, and is associated with worse medical outcomes. Previous research shows perseverative negative thinking (e.g. worry, rumination) predicts subsequent depression and worse medical outcomes, suggesting interventions targeting perseverative negative thinking could improve depression and medical outcomes. Previous studies recruited healthy individuals, however. This review aimed to determine the temporal relationship and strength of prospective association of perseverative negative thinking with depression, anxiety and emotional distress in people with long term conditions.
   Method: Four electronic databases were searched for studies including standardised measures of perseverative negative thinking and depression, anxiety or emotional distress, and which presented prospective associations. Findings were narratively synthesized.
   Results: Thirty studies were identified in a range of long term conditions. Perseverative negative thinking and subsequent depression, anxiety or emotional distress were significantly correlated in the majority of studies (bi-variate r = 0.23 to r = 0.73). 25 studies controlled for confounders, and in 15 perseverative negative thinking predicted subsequent depression, anxiety or emotional distress. Results varied according to condition and study quality. Six of 7 studies found bivariate associations between depression, anxiety or emotional distress and subsequent perseverative negative thinking, though 2 studies controlling for key covariates found no association. Few studies assessed the impact of perseverative negative thinking on medical outcomes.
   Conclusion: Strongest evidence supported perseverative negative thinking predicting subsequent depression, anxiety and emotional distress in people with long term conditions. Further prospective research is warranted to clarify the association of perseverative negative thinking with subsequent poor medical outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine whether working beyond the standard working hours was associated with a greater risk of depressive disorder among workers included in published prospective studies. This manuscript was prepared according to the PRISMA guideline checklist. A database search was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES using a relevant set of keywords. The eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) participants were adult workers; (2) exposure was defined as overtime work; (3) outcome were depressive disorders clinically diagnosed or assessed by a structured interview and (4) the study design was prospective or cohort. 7 studies were identified in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Overtime work was associated with a small, non-significant, elevated risk of depressive disorder (pooled relative risk=1.075; 95% CI 0.834 to 1.387; p=0.575) in a random effects model. The association tended to be greater for women. The risk of working 50 or more hours per week was slightly but not significantly increased (pooled relative risk=1.241; 95% CI 0.880 to 1.750; p=0.218). The effect of overtime work on depressive disorder remains inconclusive and may be small if not negligible. Sex differences and the effect of longer working hours on depressive disorder should be addressed in the future.

AB  - IntroductionThe importance of parental mental health as a determinant of infant and child outcomes is increasingly acknowledged. Yet, there is limited information regarding paternal mental health during the perinatal period. The aim of this review is to summarize existing clinical research regarding paternal mental health in the perinatal period in various contexts, and its possible impact on infant development.
   MethodAn electronic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and PubMed databases. Key texts were used to cross-check for any further articles of interest.
   ResultsMen are at increased risk of mental health problems during the transition to fatherhood, as well as during the perinatal period. Paternal mental health during the perinatal period has been shown to impact on their child's emotional and behavioral development. However, research addressing the needs of fathers with mental illness and the impact of their illness on their infant and family has been limited.
   ConclusionsA paradigm shift is required, from a focus on women following childbirth and women with pre-existing psychiatric disorders, to a broader family perspective with the focus firmly on parent-infant relationships. This paradigm shift needs to involve greater research into the fathering role and paternal mental illness during the perinatal period, including further studies into risk factors, impact on the family system, and the most appropriate form of intervention and service provision.

AB  - The monoaminergic systems are the target of several drugs for the treatment of mood, motor and cognitive disorders as well as neurological conditions. In most cases, advances have occurred through serendipity, except for Parkinson's disease where the pathophysiology led almost immediately to the introduction of dopamine restoring agents. Extensive neuropharmacological studies first showed that the primary target of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytic drugs were specific components of the monoaminergic systems. Later, some dramatic side effects associated with older medicines were shown to disappear with new chemical compounds targeting the origin of the therapeutic benefit more specifically. The increased knowledge regarding the function and interaction of the monoaminergic systems in the brain resulting from in vivo neurochemical and neurophysiological studies indicated new monoaminergic targets that could achieve the efficacy of the older medicines with fewer side-effects. Yet, this accumulated knowledge regarding monoamines did not produce valuable strategies for diseases where no monoaminergic drug has been shown to be effective. Here, we emphasize the new therapeutic and monoaminergic-based strategies for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. We will consider three main groups of diseases, based on the evidence of monoamines involvement (schizophrenia, depression, obesity), the identification of monoamines in the diseases processes (Parkinson's disease, addiction) and the prospect of the involvement of monoaminergic mechanisms (epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, stroke). In most cases, the clinically available monoaminergic drugs induce widespread modifications of amine tone or excitability through neurobiological networks and exemplify the overlap between therapeutic approaches to psychiatric and neurological conditions. More recent developments that have resulted in improved drug specificity and responses will be discussed in this review.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of current progress in the technological advances and the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, as presented by participants of the Fourth Annual DBS Think Tank, which was convened in March 2016 in conjunction with the Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration at the University of Florida, Gainesveille FL, USA. The Think Tank discussions first focused on policy and advocacy in DBS research and clinical practice, formation of registries, and issues involving the use of DBS in the treatment of Tourette Syndrome. Next, advances in the use of neuroimaging and electrochemical markers to enhance DBS specificity were addressed. Updates on ongoing use and developments of DBS for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, Alzheimer's disease, depression, post traumatic stress disorder, obesity, addiction were presented, and progress toward innovation(s) in closed-loop applications were discussed. Each section of these proceedings provides updates and highlights of new information as presented at this year's international Think Tank, with a view toward current and near future advancement of the field.

AB  - In the burgeoning field of e-mental health interventions, avatars are increasingly being utilized to facilitate online communication between clients and therapists, and among peers. Avatars are digital self-representations, which enable individuals to interact with each other in computer-based virtual environments. In this narrative review, we examine the psychotherapeutic applications of avatars that have been investigated and trialed to date. Five key applications were identified (1) in the formation of online peer support communities; (2) replicating traditional modes of psychotherapy by using avatars as a vehicle to communicate within a wholly virtual environment; (3) using avatar technology to facilitate or augment face-to-face treatment; (4) as part of serious games; and (5) communication with an autonomous virtual therapist. Across these applications, avatars appeared to serve several functions conducive to treatment engagement by (1) facilitating the development of a virtual therapeutic alliance; (2) reducing communication barriers; (3) promoting treatment-seeking through anonymity; (4) promoting expression and exploration of client identity; and (5) enabling therapists to control and manipulate treatment stimuli. Further research into the feasibility and ethical implementation of avatar-based psychotherapies is required.

AB  - Online social networking sites (SNSs) such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace are used by billions of people every day to communicate and interact with others. There has been increasing interest in the potential impact of online social networking on wellbeing, with a broadening body of new research into factors associated with both positive and negative mental health outcomes such as depression. This systematic review of empirical studies (n=30) adds to existing research in this field by examining current quantitative studies focused on the relationship between online social networking and symptoms of depression. The academic databases PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched systematically using terms related to online social networking and depression. Reporting quality was critically appraised and the findings discussed with reference to their wider implications. The findings suggest that the relationship between online social networking and symptoms of depression may be complex and associated with multiple psychological, social, behavioral, and individual factors. Furthermore, the impact of online social networking on wellbeing may be both positive and negative, highlighting the need for future research to determine the impact of candidate mediators and moderators underlying these heterogeneous outcomes across evolving networks.

AB  - Maternal nutrition can have long-term effects on offspring morphology, physiology and behaviours. However, it is unclear whether mothers 'program' offspring behavioural coping strategyilfioactive/reactiv6 according to the predicted nutritional quality of their future environment. We conducted a systematic review on this topic and meta-analytically synthesized relevant experimental data on mice and rats (46 studies). We included data from experiments where clams were subjected to caloric restriction, protein restriction or overfeeding around gestation and subsequently measured offspring activity, exploration, or anxiety. Overall, little evidence existed fur effects of maternal nutrition on the three investigated behavioural traits. The high heterogeneity observed in the data set suggests that maternal programming may sometimes Occur. However; because offspring had access to a balanced diet before testing, behaviours may have been reprogrammed. Our results may indicate that reprogrammed behaviours could ameliorate negative effects associated with sub-optimal nutrition in early life. Further, our systematic review revealed clear knowledge gaps and fruitful future research avenues.

AB  - Unaccompanied asylum seeking children (UASC) are separated from caregivers, have often been exposed to significant additional past and ongoing adversities, and seek protection from war, organized violence, or persecution in a new country. Obtaining a more secure legal position by achieving recognition of the asylum claim and legal rights may involve arduous interviews with officials who appear disbelieving. Assessing a minor's claim to asylum is an important and difficult task. UASC often arrive with little "proof" or documentation to justify their claims and can only provide their account in making their claim. Without such proof, decision makers turn to the subjective judgment of the applicant's credibility. This review appraises the literature on UASC asylum claims from a psychological perspective. Searches were made of the main databases for relevant studies. The review focuses on key findings: developmental processes, mental health, autobiographical memory, cultural influences, and decision makers' own thinking processes and subjective states. Key findings specific to the UASC predicament are their ability to tell their story-an aspect of autobiographical memory, which is affected by developmental stage, presence of mental illness, and culture. The review shows that the decision makers' own beliefs, past experiences, and emotional state also affects their decision-making processes. An adequate assessment requires evaluation of a multitude of factors and careful decision making. The findings are pertinent for understanding the UASC, interviewing style, and appraising the information. The implications for policy and practice are summarized.

AB  - The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) affects numerous behavioral and physiological processes. Drugs that alter 5-HT signaling treat several major psychiatric disorders and may lead to widespread abuse. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in the midbrain provides a majority of 5-HT for the forebrain. The importance of 5-HT signaling propels the search for a general theoretical framework under which the diverse functions of the DRN 5-HT neurons can be interpreted and additional therapeutic solutions may be developed. However, experimental data so far support several seeming irreconcilable theories, suggesting that 5-HT neurons mediate behavioral inhibition, aversive processing, or reward signaling. Here, we review recent progresses and propose that DRN 5-HT neurons encode "beneficialness" - how beneficial the current environmental context represents for an individual. Specifically, we speculate that the activity of these neurons reflects the possible net benefit of the current context as determined by p center dot R - C, in which p indicates reward probability, R the reward value, and C the cost. Through the widespread projections of these neurons to the forebrain, the beneficialness signal may reconfigure neural circuits to bias perception, boost positive emotions, and switch behavioral choices. The "beneficialness" hypothesis can explain many conflicting observations, and at the same time raises new questions. We suggest additional experiments that will help elucidate the exact computational functions of the DRN 5-HT neurons. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of literature reporting on the prevalence of assessment measures, treatments, and biomarkers used in the diagnosis and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Iraqi, Kurdish, and Syrian refugees. We performed a search of medical, psychological, and sociological databases on all relevant literature published between January 2011 and March 2016. Seventeen manuscripts met the study inclusion criteria. Seven assessment measures were used in more than 1 study, 4 of which were clinically administered (Vivo Checklist of War, Detention, and Torture; Clinically Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS); Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview; and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), and 3 of which were self-report measures (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ); Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25); Post Migrational Living Difficulties (PMLD)). Two studies reported on psychological treatment, both of which administered Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET); no other systematic psychological treatments were identified. Several biomarkers were investigated but only in a single study each, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lateral prefrontal regions, right inferior parietal cortex, and bilateral isthmus of the cingulate, EEG event-related potentials, hypercortisolemia, and elevated heart rate. On the basis of these findings, we advocate the use of the HTQ, HSCL-25, and PMLD to exclude PTSD noncases and the CAPS for diagnosis of PTSD in Iraqi, Kurdish, and Syrian refugees in Canada. We further suggest NET as the psychological treatment currently with the strongest evidence base in this population. Finally, we advocate continued research into biomarkers as a means of improving and objectifying psychological assessment and treatment of PTSD in Canadian refugee populations.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the epidemiology of and postintensive care unit (ICU) interventions for anxiety symptoms after critical illness.
   Methods: We searched five databases (1970-2015) to identify studies assessing anxiety symptoms in adult ICU survivors. Data from studies using the most common assessment instrument were meta-analyzed.
   Results: We identified 27 studies (2880 patients) among 27,334 citations. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A) subscale was the most common instrument (81% of studies). We pooled data at 2-3, 6 and 12-14 month time-points, with anxiety symptom prevalences [HADS-A= 8, 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 32%(27-38%), 40%(33-46%) and 34%(25-42%), respectively. In a subset of studies with repeated assessments in the exact same patients, there was no significant change in anxiety score or prevalence over time. Age, gender, severity of illness, diagnosis and length of stay were not associated with anxiety symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms during admission and memories of in-ICU delusional experienceswere potential risk factors. Physical rehabilitation and ICU diaries had potential benefit.
   Conclusions: One third of ICU survivors experience anxiety symptoms that are persistent during their first year of recovery. Psychiatric symptoms during admission and memories of in-ICU delusional experienceswere associated with post-ICU anxiety. Physical rehabilitation and ICU diaries merit further investigation as possible interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a review of the studies that have been published about addiction to cell phones. We analyze the concept of cell-phone addiction as well as its prevalence, study methodologies, psychological features, and associated psychiatric comorbidities. Research in this field has generally evolved from a global view of the cell phone as a device to its analysis via applications and contents. The diversity of criteria and methodological approaches that have been used is notable, as is a certain lack of conceptual delimitation that has resulted in a broad spread of prevalent data. There is a consensus about the existence of cell-phone addiction, but the delimitation and criteria used by various researchers vary. Cell-phone addiction shows a distinct user profile that differentiates it from Internet addiction. Without evidence pointing to the influence of cultural level and socioeconomic status, the pattern of abuse is greatest among young people, primarily females. Intercultural and geographical differences have not been sufficiently studied. The problematic use of cell phones has been associated with personality variables, such as extraversion, neuroticism, self-esteem, impulsivity, self-identity, and self-image. Similarly, sleep disturbance, anxiety, stress, and, to a lesser extent, depression, which are also associated with Internet abuse, have been associated with problematic cell-phone use. In addition, the present review reveals the coexistence relationship between problematic cell-phone use and substance use such as tobacco and alcohol.

AB  - Mental health problems in children can be precursors of psychosocial problems in adulthood. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the universal application of a resilience intervention (PRP and derivatives), which has been proposed for large scale roll-out. Electronic databases were searched for published randomized controlled trials of PRP and derivatives to prevent depression and anxiety and improve explanatory style in students aged 8-17 years. Studies were meta-analysed and effect sizes with confidence intervals were calculated. The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies of the Effective Public Health Practice Project was used to determine the confidence in the effect estimates. Nine trials from Australia, the Netherlands and USA met the inclusion criteria. No evidence of PRP in reducing depression or anxiety and improving explanatory style was found. The large scale roll-out of PRP cannot be recommended. The content and structure of universal PRP should be re-considered. (C) 2016 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB  - Recently, attention in the field of bipolar disorder (BD) has focused on prevention, including early detection and intervention, as these strategies have the potential to delay, lessen the severity, or even prevent full-blown episodes of BD. Although knowledge of the neurobiology of BD has advanced substantially in the last two decades, most research was conducted with chronic patients. The objective of this paper is to comprehensively review the literature regarding the early stages of BD, to explore recent discoveries on the neurobiology of these stages, and to discuss implications for research and clinical care. The following databases were searched: PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and SciELO. Articles published in English from inception to December 2015 were retrieved. Several research approaches were used, including examination of offspring studies, retrospective studies, prospective studies of clinical high-risk populations, and exploration of the progression after the first manic episode. Investigations with neuroimaging, cognition assessments, and biomarkers provide promising (although not definitive) evidence of alterations in the neural substrate during the at-risk stage. Research on BD should be expanded to encompass at-risk states and aligned with recent methodological progress in neuroscience.

AB  - Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition characterized by multiple symptoms that cause great distress. Uncovering the brain areas involved in MDD is essential for improving therapeutic strategies and predicting response to interventions. This systematic review discusses recent findings regarding cortical alterations in depressed patients during emotional or cognitive tasks, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG).
   Methods: A search of the MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane databases was carried out using the keywords EEG and depression, confined to article title.
   Results: The studies identified reveal the frontal cortex as an important brain structure involved in the complex neural processes associated with MDD. Findings point to disorganization of right-hemisphere activity and deficient cognitive processing in MDD. Depressed individuals tend to ruminate on negative information and respond with a pattern of relatively higher right frontal activity to emotional stimuli associated with withdrawal and isolation.
   Conclusion: Patients with MDD may have altered dynamic patterns of activity in several neuroanatomical structures, especially in prefrontal and limbic areas involved in affective regulation. Identification of these alterations might help predict the response of patients to different interventions more effectively and thus maximize the effects both of pharmacotherapeutic and of psychotherapeutic strategies.

AB  - Suicidal behaviors are the leading causes of injury and death worldwide, and are leading causes of maternal deaths in some countries. One of the strongest risk factors, suicidal ideation, is considered a harbinger and distal predictor of later suicide attempt and completion, and also presents an opportunity for interventions prior to physical self-harm. The purpose of this systematic epidemiologic review is to synthesize available research on antepartum suicidal ideation. Original publications were identified through searches of the electronic databases using the search terms pregnancy, pregnant women, suicidal ideation, and pregnan* and suicid* as root searches. We also reviewed references of published articles. We identified a total of 2626 articles through the electronic database search. After irrelevant and redundant articles were excluded, 57 articles were selected. The selected articles were original articles that focused on pregnancy and suicidal ideation. Of the 57 included articles, 20 reported prevalence, 26 reported risk factors, 21 reported consequences of antepartum suicidal ideation, and 5 reported on screening measures. Available evidence indicates that pregnant women are more likely than the general population to endorse suicidal ideation. Additionally, a number of risk factors for antepartum suicidal ideation were identified including intimate partner violence, < 12-year education, and major depressive disorder. There is a need for enhanced screening for antepartum suicidal ideation. The few screening instruments that exist are limited as they were primarily developed to measure antepartum and postpartum depression. Given a substantial proportion of women with suicidal ideation that does not meet clinical thresholds of depression and given the stress-diathesis model that shows susceptibility to suicidal behavior independent of depressive disorders, innovative approaches to improve screening and detection of antepartum suicidal ideation are urgently needed.

AB  - Background Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are commonly observed following injury, few studies have focused on the effect of psychiatric symptoms on return to work (RTW) following occupational injury.
   Aims To determine the impact of psychiatric symptoms on RTW after occupational injury.
   Methods PubMed (1980-2014), MEDLINE (1980-2014) and PsycINFO (1980-2014) databases were examined with linked fields of research in February 2015. Reference lists of eligible articles were also searched. Cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies and intervention studies were selected according to predefined criteria. Evidence was synthesized qualitatively according to the Downs and Black and Crombie checklist. The standard checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of each study by two reviewers.
   Results Five of the 56 records met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After occupational injury, the rates of RTW after the injuries varied widely, ranging from 31 to 63%. PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms appeared to be negatively associated with RTW.
   Conclusions Currently, the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the effects of psychiatric symptoms on RTW after occupational injury and more studies are needed. Future studies with large sample sizes are warranted to determine the prevalence of RTW and to detect the psychiatric factors.

AB  - This meta-analysis evaluated the relation between social support and depression in youth and compared the cumulative evidence for 2 theories that have been proposed to explain this association: the general benefits (GB; also known as main effects) and stress-buffering (SB) models. The study included 341 articles (19% unpublished) gathered through a search in PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, ERIC, and ProQuest, and a hand search of 11 relevant journals. Using a random effects model, the overall effect size based on k = 341 studies and N = 273,149 participants was r =.26 (95% CI [.24, .28]), with robust support for the GB model and support for the SB model among medically ill youth. Stress-buffering analyses suggest that different stressful contexts may not allow youth to fully draw on the benefits of social support, and we propose value in seeking to better understand both stress-buffering (effects of social support are enhanced) and reverse stress-buffering (effects of social support are dampened) processes. Key findings regarding other moderators include a different pattern of effect sizes across various sources of support. In addition, gender differences were largely absent from this study, suggesting that social support may be a more critical resource for boys than is typically acknowledged. Results also demonstrated the importance of using instruments with adequate psychometric support, with careful consideration of methodological and conceptual issues. Building upon these collective findings, we provide recommendations for theory and practice, as well as recommendations for addressing limitations in the extant literature to guide future investigations.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to commonly co-occur with schizophrenia, which is widely considered the most disabling mental illness. Both conditions share neurological risk factors, and present with symptoms that are superficially similar, complicating diagnostic accuracy. The presence of comorbid PTSD is also of concern as additional diagnoses tend to worsen functioning and quality of life. In the current review, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched for articles pertaining to PTSD comorbidity in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Articles went through two stages of review prior to inclusion - one at the abstract level and another at the full-text level. Thirty-four articles were ultimately included in the present review. Prevalence of PTSD in schizophrenia ranged from 0 to 57%, likely due to study heterogeneity. Findings generally indicated that comorbid PTSD was associated with higher levels of positive symptoms, general psychopathology, and neurocognitive impairment, as well as worse functioning and quality of life. As such, it is important for clinicians to differentiate between psychotic and PTSD symptoms, and to pay attention to the associated features of comorbid PTSD in order to provide the most appropriate intervention. Unfortunately, epidemiological and longitudinal studies in this area are lacking. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results and methodological factors were extracted from each study.
   Results: Seventy-eight studies assessed associations between individual-level factors and mental health. The main individual factors shown to have a statistically significant independent association with worse mental health were low income, not living with a partner, lack of social support, female gender, low level of education, low income, low socioeconomic status, unemployment, financial strain, and perceived discrimination. Sixty-nine studies reported associations between area-level factors and mental health, namely neighbourhood socioeconomic conditions, social capital, geographical distribution and built environment, neighbourhood problems and ethnic composition.
   Conclusions: Most of the 150 studies included reported associations between at least one sociodemographic or economic characteristic and mental health outcomes. There was large variability between studies concerning methodology, study populations, variables, and mental illness outcomes, making it difficult to draw more than some general qualitative conclusions. This review highlights the importance of social factors in the initiation and maintenance of mental illness and the need for political action and effective interventions to improve the conditions of everyday life in order to improve population's mental health.

AB  - Adverse childhood experiences are associated with higher risk for suicide and suicidal behavior later in life. There are known associations between childhood trauma, particularly sexual abuse, and higher rates of suicide, non-lethal suicide attempts, and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors in adolescence and adulthood. Emotional abuse/neglect, disrupted parental attachment, and cumulative effect of multiple forms of maltreatment, also increase risk. Yet, the causal relationship remains unclear. The diathesis-stress model provides a framework for understanding how early life adverse experiences contribute to suicide vulnerability. Current findings from the fields of biology, neurology, and genetics shed new light on mediating variables and possible causal links between early childhood trauma and suicide. In this paper, we review recent advances, particularly regarding the interaction of early life environmental adverse events with genetics factors, that increase the diathesis for psychological traits are associated with subsequent deliberate self-harm behaviors.

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental disorder with a multifactorial etiology. The development and maintenance of BPD is sustained by diverse neurobiological factors that contribute to the disorder's complex clinical phenotype. These factors may be identified using a range of techniques to probe alterations in brain systems that underlie BPD. We systematically searched the scientific literature for empirical studies on the neurobiology of BPD, identifying 146 articles in three broad research areas: neuroendocrinology and biological specimens; structural neuroimaging; and functional neuroimaging. We consolidate the results of these studies and provide an integrative model that attempts to incorporate the heterogeneous findings. The model specifies interactions among endogenous stress hormones, neurometabolism, and brain structures and circuits involved in emotion and cognition. The role of the amygdala in BPD is expanded to consider its functions in coordinating the brain's dynamic evaluation of the relevance of emotional stimuli in the context of an individual's goals and motivations. Future directions for neurobiological research on BPD are discussed, including implications for the Research Domain Criteria framework, accelerating genetics research by incorporating endophenotypes and gene x environment interactions, and exploring novel applications of neuroscience findings to treatment research.

AB  - Objective: The literature on mental health in the workplace largely focuses on the negative impacts of work and how work may contribute to the development of mental disorders. The potential mental health benefits of employment have received less attention.
   Method: A systematic search of reviews or meta-analyses that consider the benefits of work in regards to mental health was undertaken using academic databases. All relevant reviews were subjected to a quality appraisal.
   Results: Eleven reviews were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria, with four deemed to be of at least moderate quality. The available evidence supports the proposition that work can be beneficial for an employee's well-being, particularly if good-quality supervision is present and there are favourable workplace conditions. The benefits of work are most apparent when compared with the well-documented detrimental mental health effects of unemployment.
   Conclusions: The potential positive effects of good work and the role work can play in facilitating recovery from an illness and enhancing mental well-being need to be highlighted and promoted more widely. Future research should aim to further investigate what constitutes a good' workplace or a good' job in terms of mental health outcomes.

AB  - Objective: An increasing number of studies have been conducted to look at anxiety and depression in IBD; however, there is no clear consensus on the prevalence of anxiety and depression in this population. The objective of this systematic review was to compile the existing data on the prevalence of all mood and anxiety disorders in Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients.
   Methods: A series of comprehensive literature searches of Medline, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, AMED, and ProQuest Dissertations were performed through March 2014. Inclusion criteria included peer reviewed, published scientific articles that reported a measurement of mood or anxiety among IBD patients. Only studies with adults (>= 18 years old) and with more than 10 patients were included. Methodological quality was assessed for all included studies.
   Results: 171 articles were identified with a total of 158,371 participants. Pooled prevalence estimate for anxiety disorders was 20.5% [4.9%, 36.5%] and 35.1% [30.5, 39.7%] for symptoms of anxiety. IBD patients in active disease had higher prevalence of anxiety of 75.6% [65.5%, 85.7%] compared to disease remission. Pooled prevalence of depression disorders was 15.2% [9.9%, 20.5%] and was 21.6% [18.7%, 24.3%] for symptoms of depression. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher in Crohn's disease (25.3% [20.7%, 30.0%]) compared to UC, and higher with active disease (40.7% [31.1%, 50.3%]) compared to IBD patients in remission.
   Conclusion: Results from this systematic review indicate that patients with IBD have about a 20% prevalence rate of anxiety and a 15% prevalence rate of depression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has remained controversial from the time of its first inclusion in DSM-III. No reviews have fully documented the shifting PTSD definitions across editions of the criteria. This article chronicles the evolution of PTSD across editions of the DSM.
   METHODS: Diagnostic precursors to PTSD in DSM-I and DSM-II were briefly described, followed by systematic review of PTSD in subsequent editions of the DSM. Sections of the criteria and accompanying text were sorted into tables permitting visual comparisons across the editions. Research findings related to specific changes in the editions were provided from available research literature identified through specific PubMed searches using keywords relevant to each specific change.
   RESULTS: Fundamental topics of debate identified in this review are validity of the diagnosis, the trauma criterion, the role of symptoms in defining its psychopathology, differentiation from other disorders, and specifiers such as delayed onset.
   CONCLUSIONS: DSM-5 has corrected several major ambiguities and errors of the former editions that are fundamental to the construct of PTSD as a disorder that is defined conditionally in relation to exposure to trauma, but problems remain in DSM-5 trauma criteria, especially inconsistencies between exposure criteria and the definition of trauma. Discerning the critical distinctions required to understand PTSD depends on underlying clarity in terminology and precision in application of the diagnosis by academicians and clinicians. Trauma must be differentiated from other kinds of stressful events and conceptualized as an incident defined by physical injury rather than by emotional response.

AB  - Question Recent data suggest that anxiety disorders are as often comorbid with bipolar disorder (BD) as with unipolar depression; however, less attention has been paid to comorbidity of anxiety disorders with BD. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders that is highly comorbid with other mental disorders. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the degree of comorbidity between GAD and BD.
   Study selection and analysis We searched for all studies, which included primary data concerning the existence of GAD in patients with BD. The literature search strategy, selection of publications and the reporting of results have been conducted with PRISMA guidelines. The meta-analysis calculated prevalence estimates using the variance-stabilising Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. We applied the inverse variance method using both fixed-effects and random-effects models to estimate summary effects for all combined studies. Heterogeneity was assessed and measured with Cochran's Q and I-2 statistics, respectively.
   Findings The current meta-analysis analysed data from 28 independent studies and a total of 2975 patients from point prevalence studies and 4919 patients from lifetime studies. The overall random-effects point prevalence of GAD in patients with BD was 12.2% (95% CI 10.9% to 13.5%) and the overall random-effects lifetime estimate was 15.1% (95% CI 9.7% to 21.5%). Both estimates reported significant heterogeneity (94.0% and 94.7%, respectively).
   Conclusions Published studies report prevalence rates with high heterogeneity and consistently higher than those typically reported in the general population. It is believed that comorbid GAD might be associated with a more severe BD course and increased suicidality, and it is unknown how best to treat such conditions. The current meta-analysis confirms that GAD is highly prevalent in BD and the rate is higher in comparison to those in the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic validity of mixed features, excluding anxiety or psychomotor agitation in mood disorders, has not yet been fully examined.
   METHOD: PubMed and relevant English-language literature (regardless of year) were searched. Keywords were mixed or mixed state or mixed features or mixed episode and anxious or anxiety or agitation and bipolar disorder or depressive disorder or mood disorder or affective disorder.
   RESULTS: Most studies on anxiety or psychomotor agitation have included a significant correlation relevant to the "with mixed features" specifier, although it is common in both poles of mood episodes regardless of the predominant polarity. There is some confusion between the characteristic of classical mixed states and the definition of the mixed features specifier with the newly added anxious distress specifier in DSM-5, specifically, whether to include anxiety and agitation as significant characteristics. This change is of concern because a large proportion of patients with mixed features are now unspecified, and this may influence treatment planning and prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our review suggest that anxiety and psychomotor agitation can be core symptoms in mood episodes with mixed features and important clinical clues for prediction of treatment effects and disease course.

AB  - Currently, international mobility is common. Living abroad requires adaptation to the new culture, and adaptation outcomes are influenced by various socio-cultural factors. The literature examining these factors is vast but highly specialized. This article reviews studies on adaptation in various groups of cross-cultural travelers to identify the social and cultural contextual antecedents that have been overlooked in each of the specialized research areas. Our review reveals three distinct literature fields: on expatriates and their spouses, on international students, and on first-generation migrants. Each of them conceptualizes adaptation in a different manner. The literature on expatriates is pragmatically oriented and centered on the work context, which translates into a preference for variables that can be easily linked to expatriate work outcomes (socio-cultural adaptation, work-related antecedents). In contrast, the literature on migrants focuses on psychological outcomes of adaptation and tends to understudy factors related to the overall efficacy of migrants' functioning within the host society. The literature on international students is the most eclectic and diverse, both conceptually and empirically, but lacks a common direction. We discuss the differences between these three literature groups in detail and formulate several recommendations for future research.

AB  - Background: Adherence to effective Web-based interventions for common mental disorders (CMDs) and well-being remains a critical issue, with clear potential to increase effectiveness. Continued identification and examination of "active" technological components within Web-based interventions has been called for. Gamification is the use of game design elements and features in nongame contexts. Health and lifestyle interventions have implemented a variety of game features in their design in an effort to encourage engagement and increase program adherence. The potential influence of gamification on program adherence has not been examined in the context of Web-based interventions designed to manage CMDs and well-being.
   Objective: This study seeks to review the literature to examine whether gaming features predict or influence reported rates of program adherence in Web-based interventions designed to manage CMDs and well-being.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to manage CMDs or well-being and incorporated gamification features. Seven electronic databases were searched.
   Results: A total of 61 RCTs met the inclusion criteria and 47 different intervention programs were identified. The majority were designed to manage depression using cognitive behavioral therapy. Eight of 10 popular gamification features reviewed were in use. The majority of studies utilized only one gamification feature (n=58) with a maximum of three features. The most commonly used feature was story/theme. Levels and game leaders were not used in this context. No studies explicitly examined the role of gamification features on program adherence. Usage data were not commonly reported. Interventions intended to be 10 weeks in duration had higher mean adherence than those intended to be 6 or 8 weeks in duration.
   Conclusions: Gamification features have been incorporated into the design of interventions designed to treat CMD and well-being. Further research is needed to improve understanding of gamification features on adherence and engagement in order to inform the design of future Web-based health interventions in which adherence to treatment is of concern. Conclusions were limited by varied reporting of adherence and usage data.

AB  - Anxiety disorders constitute the largest group of mental disorders with a high individual and societal burden. Neurobiological markers of treatment response bear potential to improve response rates by informing stratified medicine approaches. A systematic review was performed on the current evidence of the predictive value of genetic, neuroimaging and other physiological markers for treatment response (pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment) in anxiety disorders. Studies published until March 2015 were selected through search in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase, and CENTRAL. Sixty studies were included, among them 27 on genetic, 17 on neuroimaging and 16 on other markers. Preliminary evidence was found for the functional 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotypes, anterior cingulate cortex function and cardiovascular flexibility to modulate treatment outcome. Studies varied considerably in methodological quality. Application of more stringent study methodology, predictions on the individual patient level and cross-validation in independent samples are recommended to set the next stage of biomarker research and to avoid flawed conclusions in the emerging field of "Mental Health Predictomics".

AB  - Background: Cultural adaptation of mental health care interventions is key, particularly when there is little or no therapist interaction. There is little published information on the methods of adaptation of bibliotherapy and e-mental health interventions.
   Objective: To systematically search for evidence of the effectiveness of minimally guided interventions for the treatment of common mental disorders among culturally diverse people with common mental disorders; to analyze the extent and effects of cultural adaptation of minimally guided interventions for the treatment of common mental disorders.
   Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO for randomized controlled trials that tested the efficacy of minimally guided or self-help interventions for depression or anxiety among culturally diverse populations. We calculated pooled standardized mean differences using a random-effects model. In addition, we administered a questionnaire to the authors of primary studies to assess the cultural adaptation methods used in the included primary studies. We entered this information into a meta-regression to investigate effects of the extent of adaptation on intervention efficacy.
   Results: We included eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) out of the 4911 potentially eligible records identified by the search: four on e-mental health and four on bibliotherapy. The extent of cultural adaptation varied across the studies, with language translation and use of metaphors being the most frequently applied elements of adaptation. The pooled standardized mean difference for primary outcome measures of depression and anxiety was -0.81 (95% CI -0.10 to -0.62). Higher cultural adaptation scores were significantly associated with greater effect sizes (P=. 04).
   Conclusions: Our results support the results of previous systematic reviews on the cultural adaptation of face-to-face interventions: the extent of cultural adaptation has an effect on intervention efficacy. More research is warranted to explore how cultural adaptation may contribute to improve the acceptability and effectiveness of minimally guided psychological interventions for common mental disorders.

AB  - AIM: To conduct a review of the telepsychiatry literature.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature on telepsychiatry using the search terms, "telepsychiatry", "telemental health", "telecare", "telemedicine", "e-health", and "videoconferencing". To meet criteria for inclusion, studies had to: (1) be published in a peer-reviewed journal after the year 2000; (2) be written in English; (3) use videoconferencing technology for the provision of mental health assessment or treatment services; and (4) use an adequately-powered randomized controlled trial design in the case of treatment outcome studies. Out of 1976 studies identified by searches in PubMed (Medline database), Ovid medline, PsychInfo, Embase, and EBSCO PSYCH, 452 met inclusion criteria. Studies that met all inclusion criteria were organized into one of six categories: (1) satisfaction; (2) reliability; (3) treatment outcomes; (4) implementation outcomes; (5) cost effectiveness; and (6) and legal issues. All disagreements were resolved by reassessing study characteristics and discussion.
   RESULTS: Overall, patients and providers are generally satisfied with telepsychiatry services. Providers, however, tend to express more concerns about the poten-tially adverse of effects of telepsychiatry on therapeutic rapport. Patients are less likely to endorse such concerns about impaired rapport with their provider. Although few studies appropriately employ non-inferiority designs, the evidence taken together suggests that telepsychiatry is comparable to face-to-face services in terms of reliability of clinical assessments and treatment outcomes. When non-inferiority designs were appropriately used, telepsychiatry performed as well as, if not better than face-to-face delivery of mental health services. Studies using both rudimentary and more sophisticated methods for evaluating cost-effectiveness indicate that telepsychiatry is not more expensive than face-to-face delivery of mental health services and that telepsychiatry is actually more cost-effective in the majority of studies reviewed. Notwithstanding legal concerns about loss of confidentiality and limited capacity to respond to psychiatric emergencies, we uncovered no published reports of these adverse events in the use of telepsychiatry.
   CONCLUSION: A large evidence base supports telepsychiatry as a delivery method for mental health services. Future studies will inform optimal approaches to implementing and sustaining telepsychiatry services.

AB  - Background: Mental pain, defined as a subjective experience characterized by perception of strong negative feelings and changes in the self and its function, is no less real than other types of grief. Mental pain has been considered to be a distinct entity from depression. We have performed a systematic review analyzing the relationship between mental pain and suicide by providing a qualitative data synthesis of the studies.
   Methods: We have conducted, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search for the literature in PubMed, Web Of Science, and Scopus. Search terms were "mental pain" "OR" "psychological pain" OR "psychache" combined with the Boolean "AND" operator with "suicide." In addition, a manual search of the literature, only including the term "psychache," was performed on Google Scholar for further studies not yet identified.
   Results: Initial search identified 1450 citations. A total of 42 research reports met the predefined inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Mental pain was found to be a significant predictive factor of suicide risk, even in the absence of a diagnosed mental disorder. Specifically, mental pain is a stronger factor of vulnerability of suicidal ideation than depression.
   Conclusion: Mental pain is a core clinical factor for understanding suicide, both in the context of mood disorders and independently from depression. Health care professionals need to be aware of the higher suicidal risk in patients reporting mental pain. In this regard, psychological assessment should include a clinimetric evaluation of mental pain in order to further detect its contribution to suicidal tendency.

   Method: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. The Embase, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched up until October 6, 2015, employing relevant keywords and MeSH terms.
   Results: 128 studies met inclusion criteria. Potential environmental risk factors for OCD have been identified in the broad areas of perinatal complications, reproductive cycle, and stressful life events. There is limited evidence regarding other potential risk factors, such as parental age, season of birth, socioeconomic status, parental rearing practices, infections, traumatic brain injury, substance use or vitamin deficiency. In general, studies were of limited methodological quality.
   Conclusions: At present, no environmental risk factors have convincingly been associated with OCD. We propose a roadmap for future studies, consisting of longitudinal, population-based research, employing quasi-experimental family and twin designs to identify risk factors that are not only associated with the disorder but also contribute to its causation either directly or moderating the effect of genes.

AB  - Over the past 15 years, the emerging field of network science has revealed the key features of brain networks, which include small-world topology, the presence of highly connected hubs, and hierarchical modularity. The value of network studies of the brain is underscored by the range of network alterations that have been identified in neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and many others. Here we briefly summarize the concepts of graph theory that are used to quantify network properties and describe common experimental approaches for analysis of brain networks of structural and functional connectivity. These range from tract tracing to functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography. We then summarize the major findings from the application of graph theory to nervous systems ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to more complex primate brains, including man. Focusing, then, on studies involving the amygdala, a brain region that has attracted intense interest as a center for emotional processing, fear, and motivation, we discuss the features of the amygdala in brain networks for fear conditioning and emotional perception. Finally, to highlight the utility of graph theory for studying dysfunction of the amygdala in mental illness, we review data with regard to changes in the hub properties of the amygdala in brain networks of patients with depression. We suggest that network studies of the human brain may serve to focus attention on regions and connections that act as principal drivers and controllers of brain function in health and disease.(dagger)Published 2016

AB  - Worldwide, disasters are increasing in frequency and severity. Mental health consequences of disasters are extensive, and knowledge of anticipated mental health effects is needed for effective disaster response. Difficulties inherent in conducting disaster research have limited the understanding of research findings. This article presents and interprets disaster mental health research findings in the context of research methods. A brief history of the disaster mental health research field is provided, and the presentation of findings is ordered into topical areas of disaster mental health consequences and timing and prediction of mental health outcomes. Results of different studies varied greatly by several main characteristics of research methods, especially methods of psychiatric assessment, sampling and exposure group determination, and consideration of confounding variables. In conclusion, many complexities in conducting disaster mental health research have limited the understanding and interpretation of available knowledge needed to inform efforts to plan and carry out effective mental health responses to disasters. Thoughtful interpretation of findings in the context of research design and methods is vital to accurate understanding of the types, prevalence, and predictors of anticipated mental health effects of disasters. A wealth of knowledge from disaster mental health research has accumulated in recent decades, but more research is still needed to resolve inconsistent findings through methodological refinements.

AB  - The present review evaluated studies which effectively employed cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to alleviate symptoms of common mental health problems in young people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It assessed the modifications applied to CBT and compliance with recent guidelines from the National Institute of Health Care Excellence (NICE). Systematic searches of electronic databases, reference lists, and journals identified 12 studies meeting predetermined inclusion criteria. Results indicated that modified CBT yielded reductions in anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and depression. There was a lack of gold standard research into the effects of CBT for disorders other than anxiety. A greater number of modifications than recommended by NICE were consistently employed, including disorder-specific modifications. Implications for clinical intervention and future research are discussed.

AB  - Objective Major depressive disorder and related symptoms have been shown to be associated with inflammation, and this association is likely to be mediated through changes in brain structure and function. This article provides a systematic review of studies that have used brain imaging techniques to identify neural mechanisms linking inflammation and depressive symptoms.
   Methods A systematic search of online databases identified 26 studies that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Results In general, increased peripheral inflammation was associated with differences in function in several subcortical regions, as well as medial and ventral prefrontal regionsboth at rest (7 studies) and during exposure to emotional stimuli (14 studies). Also, increased activation in some of these regions was associated with depression (18 studies). Too few studies have measured neuroinflammation markers (three) or brain structure (three), so generalizations about these mechanisms cannot yet be made.
   Conclusions This review supports the view that peripheral inflammation is an etiological process that may influence depression via effects on brain function. Several methodological inconsistencies in the extant literature need to be addressed, most notably a lack of formal mediational testing in longitudinal designs and inconsistencies across imaging methods and inflammation induction and measurement techniques. Further work is also required to establish the mechanisms by which basal inflammation levels influence brain function and depressive symptoms in both healthy and clinical samples.

AB  - Aims To describe the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS).
   Methods GSMS is a longitudinal study of child psychiatric disorders that began in 1992 to look at need for mental health services in a rural area of the USA. Over 20 years it has expanded its range to include developmental epidemiology more generally, not only the development of psychiatric and substance abuse problems but also their correlates and predictors: family and environmental risk, physical development including puberty, stress and stress-related hormones, trauma, the impact of poverty, genetic markers, and epigenetics. Now that participants are in their 30s the focus has shifted to adult outcomes of childhood psychopathology and risk, and early physical, cognitive, and psychological markers of aging.
   Results This paper describes the results from over 11,000 interviews, examples of the study's contributions to science and policy, and plans for the future.
   Conclusions Longitudinal studies can provide insights that aid in policy planning.

AB  - Background: Evidence regarding longer-term psychiatric, psychological, and behavioural outcomes (for example, anxiety, mood disorders, depression, and attention disorders) following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in children and adolescents has not been previously synthesized.
   Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the available evidence examining psychiatric, psychological, and behavioural outcomes following mTBI in children and adolescents.
   Materials and Methods: Nine electronic databases were systematically searched from 1980 to August 2014. Studies selected met the following criteria: original data; study design was a randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental design, cohort or historical cohort study, case-control study, or cross-sectional study; exposure included mTBI (including concussion); population included children and adolescents (<19 years) at the time of mTBI, as well as a comparison group (for example, healthy children, children with orthopaedic injuries); and included psychiatric, psychological, or behavioural outcomes (for example, anxiety, mood disorders, depression, attention disorders). Two authors independently assessed the quality and level of evidence with the Downs and Black (DB) criteria and Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) model, respectively, for each manuscript.
   Results: Of 9472 studies identified in the initial search, 30 were included and scored. Heterogeneity in methodology and injury definition precluded meta-analyses. The median methodological quality for all 30 studies, based on the DB criteria, was 15/33 (range 6 to 19). The highest level of evidence demonstrated by all reviewed studies was level 2b based on OCEBM criteria, with the majority (28/30 studies) classified at this level. Based on the literature included in this systematic review, psychological and psychiatric problems in children with a history of mTBI were found to be more prevalent when mTBI is associated with hospitalization, when assessment occurs earlier in the recovery period (that is, resolves over time), when there are multiple previous mTBIs, in individuals with preexisting psychiatric illness, when outcomes are based on retrospective recall, and when the comparison group is noninjured healthy children (as opposed to children with injuries not involving the head).
   Conclusions: Overall, few rigorous prospective studies have examined psychological, behavioural, and psychiatric outcomes following mTBI. In the absence of true reports of preinjury problems and when ideally comparing mild TBI to non-TBI injured controls, there is little evidence to suggest that psychological, behavioural, and/or psychiatric problems persist beyond the acute and subacute period following an mTBI in children and adolescents.
   Contexte: Les donnees probantes concernant les resultats psychiatriques, psychologiques et comportementaux a long terme (p. ex., l'anxiete, les troubles de l'humeur, la depression, et les troubles de l'attention) par suite d'un traumatisme cranio-cerebral benin (TCCb) chez les enfants et les adolescents n'ont pas ete synthetisees anterieurement.
   Objectif: Mener une revue systematique des donnees probantes disponibles qui examinent les resultats psychiatriques, psychologiques et comportementaux d'un TCCb chez les enfants et les adolescents.
   Materiel et methodes: Neuf bases de donnees electroniques ont ete systematiquement recherchees de 1980 au mois d'aout 2014. Les etudes retenues satisfaisaient aux criteres suivants: des donnees originales; la methode de l'etude etait un essai randomise controle, une methode quasi-experimentale, une etude de cohorte ou de cohorte historique, une etude cas-temoin ou transversale; l'exposition incluse dans le TCCb (y compris la commotion); la population comprenait des enfants et adolescents (< 19 ans) au moment du TCCb, ainsi qu'un groupe de comparaison (p. ex., des enfants en sante; des enfants ayant des blessures orthopediques); et comprenait des resultats psychiatriques, psychologiques ou comportementaux (p. ex., l'anxiete, les troubles de l'humeur, la depression, et les troubles de l'attention). Deux auteurs ont evalue independamment la qualite et le niveau des donnees probantes a l'aide des criteres de Downs et Black (DB) et du modele Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM), respectivement, pour chaque manuscrit.
   Resultats: Sur les 9 472 etudes reperees dans la recherche initiale, 30 ont ete incluses et notees. L'heterogeneite de la methodologie et la definition du traumatisme excluaient les meta-analyses. La qualite methodologique moyenne pour les 30 etudes, selon les criteres DB, etait de 15/33 (ecart 6-19). Le niveau le plus eleve des donnees probantes demontre par toutes les etudes examinees etait le niveau 2b, selon les criteres de l'OCEBM, la majorite des etudes (28/30) etant classees a ce niveau. D'apres la litterature incluse dans cette revue systematique, les problemes psychiatriques et psychologiques des enfants ayant des antecedents de TCCb se sont reveles plus prevalents quand le TCCb est associe a une hospitalisation, quand l'evaluation a lieu plus tot dans la periode de retablissement (c.-a-d., qui se resout avec le temps), quand il y a de multiples TCCb passes, chez des personnes souffrant d'une maladie psychiatrique preexistante, quand les resultats sont bases sur la memoire retrospective, et quand le groupe de comparaison est forme d'enfants en sante non blesses (par opposition aux enfants blesses mais non a la tete).
   Conclusions: En general, peu d'etudes prospectives rigoureuses ont examine les resultats psychologiques, comportementaux et psychiatriques d'un TCCb. En l'absence de rapports fiables de problemes pre-traumatisme et en comparant idealement des sujets ayant subi un TCCb avec des temoins n'ayant pas subi de TCC, il y a peu de donnees probantes qui suggerent que les problemes psychologiques, comportementaux et/ou psychiatriques persistent au-dela de la periode aigue et subaigue suivant un TCCb chez les enfants et les adolescents.

AB  - Objective Psychological distress has been associated with poor outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), which is assumed to be partly due to poor HF self-care behavior. This systematic review and meta-analysis describes the current evidence concerning psychological determinants of self-care in patients with chronic HF.
   Methods Eligible studies were systematically identified by searching electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Web of Science) for relevant literature (1980-October 17, 2014). Study quality was assessed according to the level of risk of bias. Quantitative data were pooled using random-effects models.
   Results Sixty-five studies were identified for inclusion that varied considerably with respect to sample and study characteristics. Risk of bias was high in the reviewed studies and most problematic with regard to selection bias (67%). Depression (r = -0.19, p < .001), self-efficacy (r = 0.37, p < .001), and mental well-being (r = 0.14, p = .030) were significantly associated with self-reported self-care. Anxiety was not significantly associated with either self-reported (r = -0.18, p = .24) or objective self-care (r = -0.04, p = .79), neither was depression associated with objectively measured medication adherence (r = -0.05, p = .44).
   Conclusions Psychological factors (depression, self-efficacy, and mental well-being) were associated with specific self-care facets in patients with chronic HF. These associations were predominantly observed with self-reported indices of self-care and not objective indices. Methodological heterogeneity and limitations preclude definite conclusions about the association between psychological factors and self-care and should be addressed in future research.

AB  - There has been a marked increase in the distribution, intensity and frequency of proliferations of some species of the benthic mat-forming, toxin-producing genus Phormidium in rivers globally over the last decade. This review summarises current knowledge on their taxonomy, distribution, toxin content, environmental drivers of proliferations, and monitoring and management strategies in New Zealand. Although toxic Phormidium proliferation occurs in rivers worldwide little is known about these factors in most countries. Proliferations, defined as >20% cover of a riverbed, have been identified in 103 rivers across New Zealand. Morphological and molecular data indicate the main species responsible is Phormidium autumnale. In New Zealand Phormidium produces anatoxins (anatoxin-a, homoanatoxin-a, dihydroanatoxin-a, and dihydrohomoanatoxin-a) and these were detected in 67% of 771 samples from 40 rivers. The highest concentration measured was 712 mg kg(-1) dried weight (Oreti River, Southland), with considerable spatial and temporal variability in anatoxin concentrations between and within rivers. A synthesis of field based studies suggests that Phormidium proliferations are most likely when there is some enrichment of dissolved inorganic nitrogen but when water-column dissolved reactive phosphorus is less than 0.01 mg L-1. Once established Phormidium-dominated mats trap sediment and internal mat biogeochemistry can mobilise sediment-bound phosphorus, which is then available for growth. Removal of Phormidium-dominated mats is primarily due to shear stress and substrate disturbance, although there is also evidence for autogenic detachment. A combination of factors including; changes to riparian margins, increased nitrate and fine sediment loads, and alterations in flow regimes are likely to have contributed to the rise in Phormidium proliferations.

AB  - Economic, political, and ideological landscapes have impacted the practice of psychiatry throughout its evolution as a medical discipline. Despite enormous scientific advances over the course of the past century, many psychiatrists continue to operate with a split Cartesian picture of mind versus brain and entrenched ideological positions ranging from biological "chemical imbalance" to rigidly followed manualized psychotherapy approaches, both of which frequently result in fractured clinical care. With the impact of systemic economic and political pressures in Canada and the United States, the attention to the doctor-patient relationship has taken a back seat to high-volume practices, computerized assessment tools, and the focus on evidence-based treatments for behaviorally defined syndromes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that often come at the expense of the patient's experience of his or her illness. We spend much time teaching the next generation of psychiatrists what to prescribe versus how to prescribe; what manualized treatments to administer versus questioning why our patients engage in dysfunctional patterns of thinking, feeling, and relating to others, and what impact these patterns may have on their interaction with us in the here-and-now of the treatment setting. In this paper, we propose an integrative psychobiological model, in which biological interventions carry personal meanings, and relational transactions in the treatment setting are a form of learning that results in lasting physiological changes in the brain. Psychiatry needs to reconnect with its roots as a science of attachment and meaning, in which attention to the objective, subjective, and relational domains of the patient-provider experience is equally foundational for any successful treatment outcome.

AB  - Background: In order to provide effective care to patients suffering from chronic pain secondary to neurological diseases, health professionals must appraise the role of the psychosocial factors in the genesis and maintenance of this condition whilst considering how emotions and cognitions influence the course of treatment. Furthermore, it is important not only to recognize the psychological reactions to pain that are common to the various conditions, but also to evaluate how these syndromes differ with regards to the psychological factors that may be involved. As an extensive evaluation of these factors is still lacking, the Italian Consensus Conference on Pain in Neurorehabilitation (ICCPN) aimed to collate the evidence available across these topics.
   Objectives: To determine the psychological factors which are associated with or predictive of pain secondary to neurological conditions and to assess the influence of these aspects on the outcome of neurorehabilitation.
   Methods: Two reviews were performed. In the first, a PUBMED search of the studies assessing the association between psychological factors and pain or the predictive value of these aspects with respect to chronic pain was conducted. The included papers were then rated with regards to their methodological quality and recommendations were made accordingly. In the second study, the same methodology was used to collect the available evidence on the predictive role of psychological factors on the therapeutic response to pain treatments in the setting of neurorehabilitation.
   Results: The first literature search identified 1170 results and the final database included 189 articles. Factors such as depression, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, coping strategies, and cognitive functions were found to be associated with pain across the various conditions. However, there are differences between chronic musculoskeletal pain, migraine, neuropathy, and conditions associated with complex disability with regards to the psychological aspects that are involved. The second PUBMED search yielded 252 studies, which were all evaluated. Anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing, coping strategies, and pain beliefs were found to be associated to different degrees with the outcomes of multidisciplinary programs, surgery, physical therapies, and psychological interventions. Finally, sense of presence was found to be related to the effectiveness of virtual reality as a distraction tool.
   Conclusions: Several psychological factors are associated with pain secondary to neurological conditions and should be acknowledged and addressed in order to effectively treat this condition. These factors also predict the therapeutic response to the neurorehabilitative interventions.

AB  - Background
   Numerous studies describe the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder following disasters, but less is known about the risk of major depression.
   Aims
   To review the risk of depressive disorder in people surviving disasters and in soldiers returning from military deployment.
   Method
   A systematic literature search combined with reference screening identified 23 controlled epidemiological studies. We used random effects models to compute pooled odds ratios (ORs).
   Results
   The average OR was significantly elevated following all types of exposures: natural disaster OR = 2.28 (95% CI 1.30-3.98), technological disaster OR = 1.44 (95% CI 1.21-1.70), terrorist acts OR = 1.80 (95% CI 1.38-2.34) and military combat OR = 1.60 (95% CI 1.09-2.35). In a subset of ten high-quality studies OR was 1.41 (95% CI 1.06-1.87).
   Conclusions
   Disasters and combat experience substantially increase the risk of depression. Whether psychological trauma per se or bereavement is on the causal path is unresolved.

AB  - Eating disorders are associated with alterations of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Among other indices, heart rate variability (HRV) provides a readily available index of ANS function. While ANS dysfunction indexed by HRV in Anorexia Nervosa has been addressed in previous reviews, here we aimed to review the current evidence on HRV in Bulimia Nervosa (BN). A systematic literature search in Web of Science, Psyclnfo, Scopus, and PubMed identified 17 studies reporting HRV in patients with BN. Studies described (i) differences in resting state HRV in patients compared to controls, (ii) alterations in the stress response in BN indexed by HRV, and (iii) treatment effects on HRV in patients with BN. Despite a number of conflicting results, we conclude that BN is characterized by increased resting state vagally-mediated HRV and an impaired stress-response. Intervention -studies suggest that altered ANS-activity in BN is at least partially reversible. Future studies on the complex relation between BN and HRV should investigate the effect of comorbid disorders, subtypes of BN, and mechanisms affecting treatment outcome. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gratitude is seen as a central component of Christian theology, and the extant literature suggests that there is an important relation between gratitude and physical health and well-being. In the current review, we summarize 42 studies published since 2009 that inform this relationship. Based on the theoretical framework by Hill, Allemand, and Roberts (2013), we organize our review in three sections that focus on how gratitude influences physical health through (a) mental health, (b) health behaviors, and (c) interpersonal variables. We discuss and integrate the findings from these studies into a theoretical model of gratitude and physical health. In addition to the three mechanisms in the Hill et al. model, we integrate variables from a previously conducted literature review of gratitude and well-being (Wood, Froh, & Geraghty, 2010), and we add personal factors, positive or adverse events, and explicit interventions as antecedents to gratitude in our model. We conclude by discussing future directions for gratitude and health research and its role within Christian psychology.

AB  - Many patients with systemic immune-inflammatory and neuro-inflammatory disorders, including depression, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disorder, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis, endure pathological levels of fatigue. The aim of this narrative review is to delineate the wide array of pathways that may underpin the incapacitating fatigue occurring in systemic and neuro-inflammatory disorders. A wide array of immune, inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), bioenergetic, and neurophysiological abnormalities are involved in the etiopathology of these disease states and may underpin the incapacitating fatigue that accompanies these disorders. This range of abnormalities comprises: increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interferon (IFN) alpha; O&NS-induced muscle fatigue; activation of the Toll-Like Receptor Cycle through pathogen-associated (PAMPs) and damage-associated (DAMPs) molecular patterns, including heat shock proteins; altered glutaminergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission; mitochondrial dysfunctions; and O&NS-induced defects in the sodium-potassium pump. Fatigue is also associated with altered activities in specific brain regions and muscle pathology, such as reductions in maximum voluntary muscle force, downregulation of the mitochondrial biogenesis master gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, a shift to glycolysis and buildup of toxic metabolites within myocytes. As such, both mental and physical fatigue, which frequently accompany immune-inflammatory and neuro-inflammatory disorders, are the consequence of interactions between multiple systemic and central pathways.

AB  - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a key intervention, enabling workers on sick leave with common mental health problems to return to work. It can be delivered by a variety of methods including face-to-face therapy and the Internet. It is not known which is the optimal method of delivery.
   To establish the optimum method of delivering CBT to workers with common mental health problems.
   We undertook a systematic search of the OvidMEDLINE and EMBASE biomedical databases from the start of electronic records to 31 July 2013 for randomized trials comparing one method of delivering CBT with another for treatment of mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders. We included publications that assessed at least one of four outcomes: clinical or cost-effectiveness, accessibility and acceptability. A scoping search found no studies in the workplace. We therefore focussed on interventions in the 18-65 year age group.
   We found six studies comparing methods of delivery of CBT for anxiety disorders but found no trials which compared methods of delivery for mild-to-moderate depression. All delivery methods led to an improvement in anxiety symptoms. Internet-delivered CBT with some input from a therapist was found to be as clinically effective as face-to-face CBT and more cost-effective.
   Internet CBT should be made available in workplaces for workers with anxiety disorders as part of a stepped care plan.

AB  - Background: Online questionnaires for measuring common mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders are increasingly used. The psychometrics of several pen-and-paper questionnaires have been re-examined for online use and new online instruments have been developed and tested for validity as well. This study aims to review and synthesise the literature on this subject and provide a framework for future research.
   Methods: We searched Medline and PsycINFO for psychometric studies on online instruments for common mental health disorders and extracted the psychometric data. Studies were coded and assessed for quality by independent raters.
   Results: We included 56 studies on 62 online instruments. For common instruments such as the CES-D, MADRS-S and HADS there is mounting evidence for adequate psychometric properties. Further results are scattered over different instruments and different psychometric characteristics. Few studies included patient populations.
   Conclusions: We found at least one online measure for each of the included mental health disorders and symptoms. A small number of online questionnaires have been studied thoroughly. This study provides an overview of online instruments to refer to when choosing an instrument for assessing common mental health disorders online, and can structure future psychometric research.

AB  - Recent work using the eye movement monitoring technique has demonstrated that when people are engaged in thought they tend to disengage from the external world by blinking or fixating on an empty portion of the visual field, such as a blank wall, or out the window at the sky. This 'looking at nothing' behavior has been observed during thinking that does not explicitly involve visual imagery (mind wandering, insight in problem solving, memory encoding and search) and it is associated with reduced analysis of the external visual environment. Thus, it appears to indicate (and likely facilitate) a shift of attention from external to internal stimuli that benefits creativity and problem solving by reducing the cognitive load and enhancing attention to internally evolving activation. We briefly mention some possible reasons to collect eye movement data in future studies of creativity.

AB  - The importance of early experiences for mental health across the lifespan is well recognized. In particular, there is a strong association between adverse caregiving experiences and mental illness. However, relative to studies assessing outcomes in adults, there are far fewer studies assessing the earlier emerging manifestations of caregiving adversity during development. This lack of developmental research limits an understanding of the mechanisms that link adversity with mental illness. Adoption of a developmental approach to research in this field will yield greater insights into the factors that tie adversity to poor emotion function across a lifespan. In this review, we focus on recent findings that have used a developmental approach in the examination of mental health and early adversity. These studies are notable in that, across numerous species, they converge on the idea that early adversity leads to accelerated maturation of emotion circuits in the brain and in the behaviors supported by these regions. We propose that these 'stress acceleration' effects are evidence of early system adaptation.

AB  - Traditional healers form a major part of the mental health workforce worldwide. Despite this, little systematic examination has been done of their effectiveness in treating mental illness or alleviating psychological distress. In this Review, we aim to fill this gap, with a focus on quantitative outcomes. We searched four databases and reference lists for papers that explicitly measured the effectiveness of traditional healers on mental illness and psychological distress. Eligible papers were assessed for quality, and outcomes and other details were extracted with the use of a standardised template. 32 eligible papers from 20 countries were included. The published literature on this topic is heterogeneous and studies are generally of poor quality, although some findings emerge more consistently. Some evidence suggests that traditional healers can provide an effective psychosocial intervention. Their interventions might help to relieve distress and improve mild symptoms in common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. However, little evidence exists to suggest that they change the course of severe mental illnesses such as bipolar and psychotic disorders. Nevertheless, qualitative changes that are captured poorly by conventional rating scales might be as important as the quantitative changes reviewed here. We conclude by outlining the challenges involved in assessing the effectiveness of traditional healers.

AB  - Exercise displays promise as an efficacious treatment for people with depression. However, no systematic review has evaluated the neurobiological effects of exercise among people with major depressive disorder (MDD). The aim of this article was to systematically review the acute and chronic biological responses to exercise in people with MDD. Two authors conducted searches using Medlin (PubMed), EMBASE and PsycINFO. From the searches, twenty studies were included within the review, representing 1353 people with MDD. The results demonstrate that a single bout of exercise increases atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), copepetin and growth hormone among people with MDD. Exercise also potentially promotes long-term adaptations of copeptin, thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and total mean frequency (TMF). However, there is limited evidence that exercise promotes adaptations on neurogenesis, inflammation biomarkers and brain structure. Associations between depressive symptoms improvement and hippocampus volume and IL-113 were found. Nevertheless, the paucity of studies and limitations presented within, precludes a more definitive conclusion of the underlying neurobiological explanation for the antidepressant effect of exercise in people with MDD. Further trials should utilize appropriate assessments of neurobiological markers in order to build upon the results of our review and further clarify the potential mechanisms associated with the antidepressant effects of exercise.

AB  - Background: Various paper-based mood charting instruments are used in the monitoring of symptoms in bipolar disorder. During recent years an increasing number of electronic self-monitoring tools have been developed. The objectives of this systematic review were 1) to evaluate the validity of electronic self-monitoring tools as a method of evaluating mood compared to clinical rating scales for depression and mania and 2) to investigate the effect of electronic self-monitoring tools on clinically relevant outcomes in bipolar disorder.
   Methods: A systematic review of the scientific literature, reported according to the Preferred Reporting items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and The Cochrane Library were searched and supplemented by hand search of reference lists. Databases were searched for 1) studies on electronic self-monitoring tools in patients with bipolar disorder reporting on validity of electronically self-reported mood ratings compared to clinical rating scales for depression and mania and 2) randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating electronic mood self-monitoring tools in patients with bipolar disorder.
   Results: A total of 13 published articles were included. Seven articles were RCTs and six were longitudinal studies. Electronic self-monitoring of mood was considered valid compared to clinical rating scales for depression in six out of six studies, and in two out of seven studies compared to clinical rating scales for mania. The included RCTs primarily investigated the effect of heterogeneous electronically delivered interventions; none of the RCTs investigated the sole effect of electronic mood self-monitoring tools. Methodological issues with risk of bias at different levels limited the evidence in the majority of studies.
   Conclusions: Electronic self-monitoring of mood in depression appears to be a valid measure of mood in contrast to self-monitoring of mood in mania. There are yet few studies on the effect of electronic self-monitoring of mood in bipolar disorder. The evidence of electronic self-monitoring is limited by methodological issues and by a lack of RCTs. Although the idea of electronic self-monitoring of mood seems appealing, studies using rigorous methodology investigating the beneficial as well as possible harmful effects of electronic self-monitoring are needed.

AB  - Background
   Cardiac vagal tone, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), is a proxy for the functional integrity of feedback mechanisms integrating central and peripheral physiology.
   Aims
   To quantify differences in HRV in individuals with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls.
   Method
   Databases were systematically searched for studies eligible for inclusion. Random effect meta-analyses of standardised mean differences were calculated for vagal activity indicated by high-frequency HRV and the root mean square of successive R-R interval differences (RMSSD).
   Results
   Thirty-four studies were included. Significant main effects were found for high-frequency HRV (P=0.0008; Hedges' g= -0.98, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.41, k = 29) and RMSSD (P<0.0001; g = -0.91, 95% CI -1.19 to -0.62; k = 24),. indicating lower vagal activity in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy controls. Considerable heterogeneity was evident but effects were robust in subsequent sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusions
   Given the association between low HRV, threat processing, emotion regulation and executive functioning, reduced vagal tone may be an endophenotype for the development of psychotic symptoms.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a model species for translational research in various neuroscience areas, including depressive disorders. Because of their physiological (neuroanatomical, neuroendocrine, neurochemical) and genetic homology to mammals, robust phenotypes, and value in high-throughput genetic and chemical genetic screens, zebrafish are ideal for developing valid experimental models of major depression and discovering novel therapeutics. Behavioral testing approaches, such as approach-avoidance, cognitive, and social paradigms, are available in zebrafish and have utility in identifying depression-like indices in zebrafish in response to physiological, genetic, environmental, and/or psychopharmacological alterations. In addition, the high sensitivity of zebrafish to commonly prescribed psychotropic drugs supports the use of this model as an invaluable tool for pharmacological research and drug screening. This Review outlines the benefits of using the zebrafish model for depression studies and summarizes the current research in this field. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - As neuroscientists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are starting to appreciate the importance of the gut microbiota to mental health, it is critical to determine the mechanisms of microbiota to brain communication and thereby provide a better understanding of the aspects that may be modifiable with proper intervention in individuals with mental illness. Microbiota-brain communication is emerging as an important factor in brain development and function. Further, immune dysfunction is clearly established to play a role in mental illness. Investigators in the field have established expertise in studying the microbiota, the immune system, brain, and behavior and are poised to contribute significant novel findings to our understanding of microbiota-immune-brain communication in mental illness. This chapter provides a review of the literature related to the influence of microbiota-immune-brain communication to behavior. This research has a clear translational relevance for mental health, contributing to extant findings that indicate a role for the microbiome in brain development and behavior.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThe review provides an update of functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural processes underlying psychotherapy and predict outcomes following psychotherapeutic treatment in anxiety and depressive disorders. Following current developments in this field, studies were classified as mechanistic' or predictor' studies (i.e., informing neurobiological models about putative mechanisms versus aiming to provide predictive information).Recent findingsMechanistic evidence points toward a dual-process model of psychotherapy in anxiety disorders with abnormally increased limbic activation being decreased, while prefrontal activity is increased. Partly overlapping findings are reported for depression, albeit with a stronger focus on prefrontal activation following treatment. No studies directly comparing neural pathways of psychotherapy between anxiety and depression were detected. Consensus is accumulating for an overarching role of the anterior cingulate cortex in modulating treatment response across disorders. When aiming to quantify clinical utility, the need for single-subject predictions is increasingly recognized and predictions based on machine learning approaches show high translational potential.SummaryPresent findings encourage the search for predictors providing clinically meaningful information for single patients. However, independent validation as a crucial prerequisite for clinical use is still needed. Identifying nonresponders a priori creates the need for alternative treatment options that can be developed based on an improved understanding of those neural mechanisms underlying effective interventions.

AB  - Understanding of psychopathology of mental disorder is evolving, particularly with availability of newer insight from the field of genetics, epigenetics, social, and environmental pathology. It is now becoming clear how biological factors are contributing to development of an illness in the face of a number of psychosocial factors. Resilience is a psychobiological factor which determines individuals response to adverse life events. Resilience is a human capacity to adapt swiftly and successfully to stressful/traumatic events and manage to revert to a positive state. It is fundamental for growth of positive psychology which deals with satisfaction, adaptability, contentment, and optimism in peoples life. Of late, there has been a paradigm shift in the understanding of resilience in context of stress risk vulnerability dimension. It is a neurobiological construct with significant neurobehavioral and emotional features which plays important role in deconstructing mechanism of biopsychosocial model of mental disorders. Resilience is a protective factor against development of mental disorder and a risk factor for a number of clinical conditions, e.g. suicide. Available information from scientific studies points out that resilience is modifiable factor which opens up avenues for a number of newer psychosocial as well as biological therapies. Early identification of vulnerable candidates and effectiveness of resilience-based intervention may offer more clarity in possibility of prevention. Future research may be crucial for preventive psychiatry. In this study, we aim to examine whether resilience is a psychopathological construct for mental disorder.

AB  - Dentists and dental students have been reported to be at high risk of burnout and risk factors have been identified. Despite research into burnout in dentists, only a few papers have identified significantly associated factors.
   To identify the most significant factors associated with burnout in dentists and dental students in published literature.
   We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and HMIC electronic databases to source literature on the factors associated with burnout in dentists. We critically appraised and themed papers using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme to find the most significant factors.
   From 115 studies identified by the search string, we deemed 33 papers to be relevant for review. The most prevalent and significant factors associated with burnout were: younger age, male gender, student status, high job-strain/working hours, those enrolled in clinical degree programmes and certain personality types. However, only a limited amount of literature explored the directional relationship between these factors and burnout.
   This review identified several significant factors contributing to burnout in dentists and dental students. Further longitudinal and prospective studies are required to assess causation. Burnout should be considered a multifactorial phenomenon that can develop early in a dental career. Screening programmes and coping strategies might help to identify and prevent it.

AB  - Background: Mental health issues in the workplace are a growing concern among organizations and policymakers, but it remains unclear what interventions are effective in preventing mental health problems and their associated organizational consequences. This synthesis reports on workplace mental health interventions that impact absenteeism, productivity and financial outcomes.
   Objective: To determine the level of evidence supporting mental health interventions as valuable to work outcomes.
   Methods: Databases were searched for systematic reviews between 2000 and 2012: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and TRIP. Grey literature searches included health-evidence. ca, Rehab+, National Rehabilitation Information Center (NARIC), and Institute for Work and Health. The assessment of articles for inclusion criteria and methodological quality was conducted independently by two or more researchers, with differences resolved through consensus.
   Results: The search resulted in 3363 titles, of which 3248 were excluded following title/abstract review, with 115 articles retrieved for full-text review. 14 articles finally met the inclusion criteria and are summarized in this synthesis.
   Conclusion: There is moderate evidence for the effectiveness of workplace mental health interventions on improved workplace outcomes. Certain types of programs, such as those incorporating both mental and physical health interventions, multicomponent mental health and/or psychosocial interventions, and exposure in vivo containing interventions for particular anxiety disorders had a greater level of research evidence to support their effectiveness.

AB  - Ambulatory Assessment (AA) comprises the use of in-field methods to assess individuals' behavior, physiology, and the experience as they unfold in naturalistic settings. We propose that AA is favorable for the investigation of gene-environment interactions and for the search for endophenotypes, being able to assess the experienced environment and to track basic regulatory processes, such as stress reactivity, affective instability, and reward experience, which are potential common factors that underlie psychiatric disorders.
   In this article, we (a) first describe briefly the rationale of AA and summarize the key advantages of the approach, (b) highlight within-subject regulatory processes, such as stress reactivity, affective instability, and reward experience, (c) describe studies that used AA to examine genetic influences in psychiatric disorders, and (d) briefly review longitudinal studies that have investigated phenotypes of psychiatric disorders.
   The reported studies yielded promising, although sometimes inconclusive evidence for genetic effects on endophenotypes of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, most studies were twin or family studies, especially in stress-sensitivity research; thus, it is unclear which specific single nucleotide polymorphisms contribute to the endophenotypes of psychiatric disorders. We do hope that within-subject regulatory processes will enable us to clarify the fundamental psychological dimensions that cut across traditional disorders and link them to their genetic underpinnings.

AB  - Numerous studies have reported on the roles of genetic factors in the development of depression in adolescents and young adults. However, there are few systematic reviews that update our understanding of adolescent depression with the biological findings identifying the roles of gene expression and/or polymorphism(s). This review systematically summarized the findings that clearly identified the contribution of a gene to the risk of depression in adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 years old and young adults between the ages of 20 and 25 years old. Data were obtained through searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. A total of 47 studies on early adolescence and three studies on young adults were included in the current review. Most articles studied genes in the serotonergic system (n = 26), dopaminergic system (n = 3), and the Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) gene (n = 12). 92.3% of studies (24/26) identified positive associations of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism with depressive illness or depressive symptoms. 83.3% of studies (10/12) found positive association between BDNF Val66Met genotype and adolescent depressive symptoms. More studies should be conducted on the 18 genes reported in a few studies to clarify their roles in the risk for adolescent depression.

AB  - Significant interest in the mechanistic underpinnings of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has fueled research on the neural origins of compulsive behaviors. Converging clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that abnormal repetitive behaviors are driven by dysfunction in cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuits. These findings suggest that compulsive behaviors arise, in part, from aberrant communication between lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal striatum. An important body of work focused on the role of this network in OCD has been instrumental to progress in the field. Disease models focused primarily on these regions, however, fail to capture an important aspect of the disorder: affective dysregulation. High levels of anxiety are extremely prevalent in OCD, as is comorbidity with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, deficits in processing rewards and abnormalities in processing emotional stimuli are suggestive of aberrant encoding of affective information. Accordingly, OCD can be partially characterized as a disease in which behavioral selection is corrupted by exaggerated or dysregulated emotional states. This suggests that the networks producing OCD symptoms likely expand beyond traditional lateral OFC and dorsal striatum circuit models, and highlights the need to cast a wider net in our investigation of the circuits involved in generating and sustaining OCD symptoms. Here, we address the emerging role of medial OFC, amygdala, and ventral tegmental area projections to the ventral striatum (VS) in OCD pathophysiology. The VS receives strong innervation from these affect and reward processing regions, and is therefore poised to integrate information crucial to the generation of compulsive behaviors. Though it complements functions of dorsal striatum and lateral OFC, this corticolimbic-VS network is less commonly explored as a potential source of the pathology underlying OCD. In this review, we discuss this network's potential role as a locus of OCD pathology and effective treatment.

AB  - People with PTSD experience high levels of cardiovascular disease and comorbid mental health problems. Physical activity (PA) is an effective intervention in the general population. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of PA on PTSD. We searched major electronic databases from inception till 03/2015 for RCTs of PA interventions among people with PTSD. A random effects meta-analysis calculating hedges g was conducted. From a potential of 812 hits, four unique RCTs met the inclusion criteria (n=200, mean age of participants 34-52 years). The methodological quality of included trials was satisfactory, and no major adverse events were reported. PA was significantly more effective compared to control conditions at decreasing PTSD and depressive symptoms among people with PTSD. There was insufficient data to investigate the effect on anthropometric or cardiometabolic outcomes. Results suggest that PA may be a useful adjunct to usual care to improve the health of people with PTSD. Although there is a relative paucity of data, there is reason to be optimistic for including PA as an intervention for people with PTSD, particularly given the overwhelming evidence of the benefits of PA in the general population. Robust effectiveness and implementation studies are required. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chronobiological therapies for mood disorders include manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle such as sleep deprivation and sleep phase advance and the controlled exposure to light and darkness. Their antidepressant efficacy can overcome drug resistance and targets the core depressive symptoms including suicide, thus making them treatment options to be tried either alone or as adjunctive treatments combined with common psychopharmacological interventions. The specific pattern of mood change observed with chronobiological therapies is characterized by rapid and sustained effects, when used among themselves or combined with drugs. Effects sizes are the same reported for the most effective psychiatric treatments, but side effects are usually marginal or absent. New treatment protocols are developed to adapt them in different clinical settings. This review deals with the general principles of clinical chronobiology and the latest findings in this rapidly developing field.

AB  - The parent-infant relationship is an important context for identifying very early risk and resilience factors and targets for the development of preventative interventions. The aim of this study was to systematically review studies investigating the early caregiver-infant relationship and attachment in offspring of parents with schizophrenia.
   We searched computerized databases for relevant articles investigating the relationship between early caregiver-infant relationship and outcomes for offspring of a caregiver with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Studies were assessed for risk of bias.
   We identified 27 studies derived from 10 cohorts, comprising 208 women diagnosed with schizophrenia, 71 with other psychoses, 203 women with depression, 59 women with mania/bipolar disorder, 40 with personality disorder, 8 with unspecified mental disorders and 119 non-psychiatric controls. There was some evidence to support disturbances in maternal behaviour amongst those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and there was more limited evidence of disturbances in infant behaviour and mutuality of interaction.
   Further research should investigate both sources of resilience and risk in the development of offspring of parents with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and psychosis. Given the lack of specificity observed in this review, these studies should also include maternal affective disorders including depressive and bipolar disorders.

AB  - Background: During the last decades, there have been many different opinions concerning the neurocognitive function in Bipolar disorder (BD). The aim of the current study was to perform a systematic review of the literature and to synthesize the data in a comprehensive picture of the neurocognitive dysfunction in BD.
   Methods: Papers were located with searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, through June 1st 2015. The review followed a modified version of the recommendations of the Preferred Items for Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
   Results: The initial search returned 110,403 papers. After the deletion of duplicates, 11,771 papers remained for further evaluation. Eventually, 250 were included in the analysis.
   Conclusion: The current review supports the presence of a neurocognitive deficit in BD, in almost all neurocognitive domains. This deficit is qualitative similar to that observed in schizophrenia but it is less severe. There are no differences between BD subtypes. Its origin is unclear. It seems it is an enduring component and represents a core primary characteristic of the illness, rather than being secondary to the mood state or medication. This core deficit is confounded (either increased or attenuated) by the disease phase, specific personal characteristics of the patients (age, gender, education, etc.), current symptomatology and its treatment (especially psychotic features) and long-term course and long-term exposure to medication, psychiatric and somatic comorbidity and alcohol and/or substance abuse.

Data were extracted from the results for meta-analysis.Main outcome measures: Use by illness population, country, language and study design. The questionnaire's concurrent validity, predictive validity, sensitivity to change, discriminant validity and mean scores for different populations were summarised.Results: The review included 188 papers. The Brief IPQ has been administered to patients from age 8 to over 80, with a wide range of illnesses, in 26 languages from 36 countries. Pooled correlations between illness perceptions and depression, anxiety, blood glucose levels and quality of life were consistent with previous research and theory (range .25-.49 for consequences, identity and emotional representations; -.12 to -.27 for personal control). All items were able to predict some outcomes up to one-year follow-up. Each subscale demonstrated sensitivity to change after intervention in randomised controlled trials with the personal control and causal items showing most frequent change.Conclusions: The Brief IPQ is widely used and has good psychometric properties. More studies should include and analyse the causal item.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, late-onset neurodegenerative disorder that shows progressive extrapyramidal motor disorders (e.g., bradykinesia, resting tremors, muscle rigidity and postural instability) and various non-motor symptoms (e.g., cognitive impairment, mood disorders, autonomic dysfunction and sleep disorders). While dopaminergic agents such as L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and dopamine D-2 agonists are widely used for the treatment of PD, there is still high clinical unmet need for novel medications that overcome the limitations of current therapies. Evidence is now accumulating that the serotonergic nervous system is involved in the pathophysiological basis of PD and can provide benefits in the treatment of PD through its diverse functions. Among 5-HT receptor subtypes, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT6 receptors play an important role in modulating extrapyramidal motor disorders. In addition, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4 and 5-HT6 receptors are implicated in modulation of cognitive impairment, mood disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety) and/or psychosis, which are frequently observed in patients with PD. Specifically, stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors seems to be effective for multiple PD symptoms including parkinsonism, L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, cognitive impairment, mood disorders and neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons. Blockade of 5-HT2 receptors is also likely to improve parkinsonism, depressive mood and cognitive impairment. In addition, it was recently demonstrated that 5-HT2A inverse agonists can alleviate PD psychosis. All these findings emphasize the therapeutic roles of the serotonergic system in PD and stimulate new insight into novel treatments by modulating 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the health effects of prenatal exposure to disaster, based on a systematic review of existing research.
   A literature search of scientific databases was conducted in February 2015 for articles on prenatal exposure to a natural or man-made disaster. Data was extracted from all articles that met the inclusion criteria, and we systematically analyzed contents based on type of disaster, health outcome, target group and time after birth.
   Prenatal exposure to famine or war was found to be associated with mental health, cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes, with varying degrees of significance. The majority of the studies showed limited or weak associations between exposures and outcomes.
   Due to the lack of variety in type of events studied, as well as large methodological variation, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from existing literature. However, our systematic review highlights the potential of evaluating secondary data, both to accentuate research gaps in the field and to increase the understanding of what effects various types of disasters potentially have on the unborn child.

AB  - The Mental Health Commission of Canada's (MHCC) strategy calls for promoting the health and wellbeing of all Canadians and to improve mental health outcomes. Each year, one in every five Canadians experiences one or more mental health problems, creating a significant cost to the health system. Mental health is pivotal to holistic health and wellbeing. This paper presents the key findings of a comprehensive literature review of Canadian research on the relationship between settlement experiences and the mental health and well-being of immigrants and refugees. A scoping review was conducted following a framework provided by Arskey and O'Malley (Int J Soc Res Methodol 8:19-32, 2005). Over two decades of relevant literature on immigrants' health in Canada was searched. These included English language peer-reviewed publications from relevant online databases Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Healthstar, ERIC and CINAHL between 1990 and 2015. The findings revealed three important ways in which settlement affects the mental health of immigrants and refugees: through acculturation related stressors, economic uncertainty and ethnic discrimination. The recommendations for public health practice and policy are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Depression has been identified as a priority disorder among children and adolescents. While numerous reviews have examined the individual and family factors that contribute to child and adolescent depressive symptoms, less is known about community-level risk and protective factors. The aim of this study was to complete a systematic review to identify community risk and protective factors for depression in school-aged children (4-18years).
   Method: The review adopted the procedures recommended by the Cochrane Non-Randomised Studies Methods Working Group and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify both observational and intervention study designs in both peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed publications.
   Results: A total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen of the 18 community association studies and 2 of the 3 intervention studies reported one or more significant effects. Results indicated that community safety and community minority ethnicity and discrimination act as risk factors for depressive symptoms in school-aged children. Community disadvantage failed to achieve significance in meta-analytic results but findings suggest that the role of disadvantage may be influenced by other factors. Community connectedness was also not directly associated with depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: There is evidence that a number of potentially modifiable community-level risk and protective factors influence child and adolescent depressive symptoms suggesting the importance of continuing research and intervention efforts at the community-level.

AB  - Background Around 1.1 million people suffer from occupational health diseases in the UK. Work-related conditions reported by doctors include mental health disorders, musculoskeletal problems and skin disorders.
   Aims To investigate the prevalence of occupational illness in UK doctors from different specialties.
   Methods A literature search conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE (R) and Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC) identified relevant research about doctors between the years 1990 and 2013.
   Results Seventy-two papers were identified. The majority of studies were cross-sectional with no randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses found. Mental health issues including burnout were widely reported and were attributed to greater job constraints, managerial issues, difficulty with clinical cases and lack of job satisfaction. Substance abuse in doctors was reported to be a risk of maladaptive coping mechanisms and was associated with early retirement. Surgeons were reported as being at greatest risk of needle-stick injuries and musculoskeletal pain. Orthopaedic surgeons were reported to be at risk of noise-induced hearing loss as a result of the use of air-powered and electric drills. There was limited research found concerning contact dermatitis and work-related malignancies amongst doctors in the UK.
   Conclusions Our literature review found research on UK doctors for a variety of work-related illnesses with the prevalence varying depending on both specialty and seniority. This could have adverse effects both on the individual and the provision of patient care. Further studies are required to investigate the epidemiology of noise-induced hearing loss, nosocomial infections, skin-related disorders and work-related malignancies.

AB  - The objective of this review is to summarize the literature (and to the extent possible, report the magnitude and direction of the association) concerning history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and depression or depressive symptoms among pregnant and postpartum women. Publications were identified through literature searches of seven databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PyscINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and Science Direct) using keywords including "child abuse," "depression," "pregnancy," "prenatal," "pregnancy," and "postpartum." The literature search yielded seven eligible studies on the prenatal period and another seven studies on the postpartum period. All but one prenatal study observed statistically significant positive associations of CSA with depression or depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Findings on the association of CSA with postpartum depression or depressive symptoms were inconsistent; pooled unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were 1.82 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.92, 3.60) and 1.20 (95 % CI 0.81, 1.76). In sum, findings suggest a positive association of history of CSA with depression and depressive symptoms in the prenatal period. Findings on the postpartum period were inconsistent. Clinical and public health implications of evidence from the available literature are discussed, as are desirable study design characteristics of future research.

To evaluate the associations and to identify the support for pathways linking inflammatory processes with suicidal behaviour, a comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken.
   MethodThe search terms cytokine', risk factors', kynurenine', asthma', allergy', autoimmunity', traumatic brain injury', infection' along with the terms inflammation' and suicide' were entered into PubMed, and a thorough analysis of the publications and their reference lists was performed.
   ResultsThe effects of inflammation on mood and behaviour could partially be mediated by kynurenine pathway metabolites, modulating neuroinflammation and glutamate neurotransmission. At the same time, the triggers of the inflammatory changes documented in suicidal patients may be attributed to diverse mechanisms such as autoimmunity, neurotropic pathogens, stress or traumatic brain injury.
   ConclusionTargeting the inflammatory system might provide novel therapeutic approaches as well as potential biomarkers to identify patients at increased risk. For the goal of improved detection and treatment of suicidal individuals to be achieved, we need to develop a detailed understanding of the origin, mechanisms and outcomes of inflammation in suicidal behaviour.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) has been associated with impairments in a range of cognitive domains including attention, verbal learning, and mental flexibility. These deficits are increased during the acute phases of the illness and worsen over the course of BD. This review will examine the literature in relation to potential mechanisms associated with cognitive decline in BD. Scopus (all databases), Pubmed, and Ovid Medline were systematically searched with no language or year restrictions, up to January 2015, for human studies that collected cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive data in adults with BD and matched healthy controls (HC). Selected search terms were "bipolar," "cognitive," "aging," "illness duration," "onset," and "progression." Thirty-nine studies satisfied the criteria for consideration. There is evidence that cognitive function in BD is negatively associated with features of illness progression such as number of mood episodes, illness duration, and hospitalizations. Aging does not appear to affect cognitive functioning to a greater extent than in HC. Furthermore, the small number of longitudinal studies in this field does not allow to reaching firm conclusion in terms of which sub-populations would be more prone to cognitive decline in BD. The decline in cognitive abilities over the course of the BD seems to be associated with the number of episodes and number of hospitalizations. No meaningful interaction of age and bipolar disorder has been found in terms of cognitive decline. Future large-scale longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm these findings and assist in the development of preventive interventions in vulnerable individuals.

AB  - Background: Previous studies indicate a possible association between early emotional trauma (EET) and the development of anxiety disorders (ADs) in adult life. However, no previous studies have compiled the findings of such studies and analyzed their statistical significance. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to determine possible associations between EET and three ADs (panic, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety disorders).
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, and Scielo with no publication date limitations. A total of 2127 studies were found, 32 studies of which were selected for the systematic review and 13 studies of which were selected for the meta-analysis.
   Results: High prevalence rates of different EETs were observed among the individuals with ADs (median: 18%-45%). The results of the meta-analysis indicated that individuals with EETs were 1.9- to 3.6-fold more likely to develop ADs compared with a control group of healthy individuals. Emotional traumas were the main risk factor for social anxiety disorder. However, no specific associations were found for the other ADs.
   Conclusions: EET is a risk factor for ADs, underscoring the importance of preventive measures to combat the development of these disorders. Moreover, the identification of EETs among patients with ADs is essential for implementing remedial measures to minimize the impact and damage arising from this association by decreasing the risk and severity of symptoms and to improve the response rate to treatment of ADs.

   Abstract About every 20 years, the American Psychiatric Association revises its official classification of mental disorders. The fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was published in 2013, prompting considerable commentary, debate, and criticism. This article briefly describes the process leading up to DSM-5 and the main changes from the previous version (DSM-IV) that would be of interest to a geriatric psychiatrist. The changes in the areas of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depressive disorders, and anxiety disorders have been many, but the majority of them are minor and unlikely to have major treatment implications. The classification of neurocognitive disorders, however, has seen a major revision and elaboration in comparison to DSM-IV; of special note is the introduction of mild and major neurocognitive disorders, the latter equated with dementia. A common language has also been introduced for the criteria for the various etiological subtypes of neurocognitive disorders. All physicians treating patients with neurocognitive disorders should familiarize themselves with these criteria. Their use in research has the potential to harmonize the field.

AB  - The field of applied sport psychology has traditionally grounded its performance enhancement techniques in the cognitive-behavioral elements of psychological skills training. These interventions typically advocate for controlling one's cognitive and emotional processes during performance. Mindfulness-based approaches, on the other hand, have recently been introduced and employed more frequently in an effort to encourage athletes to adopt a nonjudgmental acceptance of all thoughts and emotions. Like many applied interventions in sport psychology, however, the body of literature supporting the efficacy of mindfulness-based approaches for performance enhancement is limited, and few efforts have been made to draw evidence-based conclusions from the existing research. The current paper had the purpose of systematically reviewing research on mindfulness-based interventions with athletes to assess (a) the efficacy of these approaches in enhancing sport performance and (b) the methodological quality of research conducted thus far. A comprehensive search of relevant databases, including peer-reviewed and gray literature, yielded 19 total trials (six case studies, two qualitative studies, seven nonrandomized trials, and four randomized trials) in accordance with the inclusion criteria. An assessment tool was used to score studies on the quality of research methodology. While a review of this literature yielded preliminary support for the efficacy of mindfulness-based performance enhancement strategies, the body of research also shows a need for more methodologically rigorous trials.

AB  - Military populations may experience more severe forms of domestic violence than the general population. Although mental disorders are associated with domestic violence perpetration among the general population, it is not clear whether this is the case for military populations. This review aimed to establish the prevalence and odds of domestic violence perpetration among male and female military personnel with mental disorders.
   Systematic review: searches of eleven electronic databases were supplemented by hand searches, reference screening, citation tracking and expert recommendations.
   Ten studies were included; nine reporting on partner violence and one on violence against an adult family member. Median prevalence estimates were calculated for partner violence perpetration among male military personnel with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); estimates on other disorders were not possible due to lack of data. 27.5 % of men with PTSD reported past year physical violence perpetration against a partner and 91.0 % reported past year psychological violence perpetration against a partner. Due to limited data, no median estimates could be calculated for female military personnel. Data from individual papers indicate increased odds of past year partner violence perpetration among male and female military personnel with depression; inconsistent findings were reported for risk of partner violence perpetration among male and female military personnel with PTSD.
   There is some evidence that mental disorders among military personnel are associated with past year domestic violence perpetration, though current data cannot confirm direction of causality. Research is needed to inform the development of interventions targeted to reduce domestic violence perpetration among military personnel.

AB  - Despite being considered primarily a mood disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by cognitive and decision making deficits. Recent research has employed computational models of reinforcement learning (RL) to address these deficits. The computational approach has the advantage in making explicit predictions about learning and behavior, specifying the process parameters of RL, differentiating between model-free and model-based RL, and the computational model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. With these merits there has been an emerging field of computational psychiatry and here we review specific studies that focused on MDD.
   Considerable evidence suggests that MDD is associated with impaired brain signals of reward prediction error and expected value ('wanting'), decreased reward sensitivity ('liking') and/or learning (be it model-free or model-based), etc., although the causality remains unclear. These parameters may serve as valuable intermediate phenotypes of MDD, linking general clinical symptoms to underlying molecular dysfunctions. We believe future computational research at clinical, systems, and cellular/molecular/genetic levels will propel us toward a better understanding of the disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The majority of mental health problems are non-psychotic (e.g., depression, anxiety, and phobias). For some people, art therapy may be a more acceptable alternative form of psychological therapy than standard forms of treatment, such as talking therapies. This study was part of a health technology assessment commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research, UK and aimed to systematically appraise the clinical and cost-effective evidence for art therapy for people with non-psychotic mental health disorders.
   Methods: Comprehensive literature searches for studies examining art therapy in populations with non-psychotic mental health disorders were performed in May 2013. A quantitative systematic review of clinical effectiveness and a systematic review of studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of group art therapy were conducted.
   Results: Eleven randomised controlled trials were included (533 patients). Meta-analysis was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity and insufficient comparable data on outcome measures across studies. The control groups varied between studies but included: no treatment/wait-list, attention placebo controls and psychological therapy comparators. Art therapy was associated with significant positive changes relative to the control group in mental health symptoms in 7 of the 11 studies. A de novo model was constructed and populated with data identified from the clinical review. Scenario analyses were conducted allowing comparisons of group art therapy with wait-list control and group art therapy with group verbal therapy. Group art-therapy appeared cost-effective compared with wait-list control with high certainty although generalisability to the target population was unclear; group verbal therapy appeared more cost-effective than art therapy but there was considerable uncertainty and a sizeable probability that art therapy was more cost effective.
   Conclusions: From the limited available evidence art therapy was associated with positive effects compared with control in a number of studies in patients with different clinical profiles. The included trials were generally of poor quality and are therefore likely to be at high risk of bias. Art therapy appeared to be cost-effective versus wait-list but further studies are needed to confirm this finding in the target population. There was insufficient evidence to make an informed comparison of the cost-effectiveness of group art therapy with group verbal therapy.

AB  - The estimate of the global burden of disease predicts that depression will be the second-leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020. Depression is widely prevalent in women in all age groups especially in India where 1.2 billion population lives. In the current scenario of underdiagnosed, untreated cases of females suffering from depression, the hurdles faced by Indian women include inadequate number of mental health professionals, lack of awareness, stigma, disadvantaged position of women, multiple roles, increased levels of stress, and domestic violence. The literature search included an electronic database, published materials, and standard textbooks. The authors have provided a brief overview of different types of depression in females. Epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, and management linked to the reproductive cycle of women have been covered. Awareness through public education, early detection, organized national mental health programs, comprehensive management, with judicious utilization of the limited resources would tackle the rising number of cases of female depression, in a cost effective manner, thereby preventing suicide.

AB  - BackgroundDespite accumulating research and bold claims about the efficacy of cognitive bias modification (CBM) for young populations, no meta-analysis has attempted to synthesize the research literature so far. We examined whether there was empirical evidence for the clinical efficacy of CBM interventions in youths, while also considering the methodological quality of this evidence.
   MethodsStudies were identified through systematic searches in bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsychInfo, Cochrane Library and EMBASE to June 2014). We included randomized controlled trials of CBM interventions, and considered both clinical outcomes and targeted biases. We examined the quality of the trials, as well as potential publication bias and possible moderators.
   ResultsWe identified 23 trials that reported on four types of outcomes: mental health, anxiety, depression and bias. Effect sizes were small and nonsignificant for all symptom outcomes considered. We found a moderate significant effect size for bias outcomes (Hedges' g of 0.53), with significant heterogeneity. There were no differences between types of CBM interventions, or between one versus multiple-session applications. A small but significant effect size for mental health problems arose when the intervention was delivered in schools. The quality of almost all of the included studies was suboptimal and the vast majority did not include information needed for allowing quality assessment.
   ConclusionsWe conducted the first meta-analysis of CBM interventions for childrenand adolescents and found no effects for mental health outcomes, but we did find moderate and significant effects on the targeted biases. Our results cast serious doubts on CBM interventions having any clinical utility for nonadult populations. Demand characteristics might play an important part in CBM research.

AB  - ObjectiveDespite advances in our understanding of mental health issues among military forces, a large proportion of military personnel continue to exhibit deployment-related psychological issues. Recent work has identified symptoms of guilt and shame related to moral injury as contributing significantly to combat-related mental health issues. This systematic scoping review explores the association between morality and symptoms of guilt and shame within military forces.
   MethodA search of the literature pertaining to guilt, shame and morality within military samples was conducted.
   ResultsNineteen articles were selected for review. There is strong evidence linking exposure to and the perceived perpetration of moral transgressions with experiences of guilt and shame. Critically, symptoms of guilt and shame were related to adverse mental health outcomes, particularly the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). No studies have explored moral judgment in conjunction with assessments of guilt or moral injury.
   ConclusionThese findings have important implications for the prevention and treatment of PTSD-related symptoms in military samples. By measuring moral judgment prior to deployment, it may be possible to predict the likelihood of incurring moral injuries and the development of associated symptoms. Early intervention programmes aimed at ameliorating guilt and shame are required to prevent the long-term development of deployment-related psychological distress.

AB  - Aims: Untreated perinatal depression and anxiety disorders are known to have significant negative impact on both maternal and fetal health. Dilemmas still remain regarding the use and safety of psychotropics in pregnant and lactating women suffering from perinatal depression and anxiety disorders. The aim of the current paper was to review the existing evidence base on the exposure and consequences of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics in women during pregnancy and lactation and to make recommendations for clinical decision making in management of these cases.
   Materials and Methods: We undertook a bibliographic search of Medline/PubMed (1972 through 2014), Science Direct (1972 through 2014), Archives of Indian Journal of Psychiatry databases was done. References of retrieved articles, reference books, and dedicated websites were also checked.
   Results and Conclusions: The existing evidence base is extensive in studying multiple outcomes of the antidepressant or anxiolytic exposure in neonates, and some of the findings appear conflicting. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most researched antidepressants in pregnancy and lactation. The available literature is criticized mostly on the lack of rigorous well designed controlled studies as well as lacunae in the methodologies, interpretation of statistical information, knowledge transfer, and translation of information. Research in this area in the Indian context is strikingly scarce. Appropriate risk-benefit analysis of untreated mental illness versus medication exposure, tailor-made to each patient's past response and preference within in the context of the available evidence should guide clinical decision making.

AB  - Background: Previous research has linked sedentary behaviour (SB) to adverse physical health outcomes in adults and youth. Although evidence for the relationship between SB and mental health outcomes (e.g., depression) is emerging, little is known regarding risk of anxiety.
   Methods: A systematic search for original research investigating the association between SB and risk of anxiety was performed using numerous electronic databases. A total of nine observational studies (seven cross-sectional and two longitudinal) were identified. Methodological quality of studies was assessed and a best-evidence synthesis was conducted.
   Results: One cross-sectional study demonstrated a strong methodological quality, five cross-sectional studies demonstrated a moderate methodological quality and three studies (two cross-sectional one longitudinal) received a weak methodological quality rating. Overall, there was moderate evidence for a positive relationship between total SB and anxiety risk as well as for a positive relationship between sitting time and anxiety risk. There was inconsistent evidence for the relationship between screen time, television viewing time, computer use, and anxiety risk.
   Conclusion: Limited evidence is available on the association between SB and risk of anxiety. However, our findings suggest a positive association (i.e. anxiety risk increases as SB time increases) may exist (particularly between sitting time and risk of anxiety). Further high-quality longitudinal/interventional research is needed to confirm findings and determine the direction of these relationships.

AB  - Complications related to preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW) are leading causes of infant morbidity and mortality. Prenatal depression is a hypothesized psychosocial risk factor for both birth outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine evidence published between 1977 and 2013 on prenatal depression and risks of these primary adverse birth outcomes. A systematic search of the PUBMED and PsycINFO databases was conducted to identify studies testing the associations between prenatal depressive symptoms, or diagnoses of depression, and risk of PTB or LBW. We systematically selected 50 published reports on PTB and length of gestation, and 33 reports on LBW and BW. Results were reviewed by two independent reviewers and we evaluated the quality of the evidence with an established systematic review method, the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We then undertook a narrative synthesis of the results following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Less than a quarter of 50 published reports found that prenatal depression was significantly associated with PTB or gestational age. In contrast, slightly more than half of the 33 reports found that prenatal depression was associated with LBW or BW. When weighing methodological features, we determined that the effects of prenatal depression on LBW are more consistent than effects on length of gestation or PTB. Although the evidence may not be strong enough to support routine depression screening for risk of adverse outcomes, screening to enable detection and timely treatment to reduce risk of postpartum depression is warranted. Further rigorous research on prenatal depression and adverse birth outcomes is needed.

AB  - Vortioxetine has a beneficial pharmacological profile for reducing anxiety and depression. Recently, a number of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of vortioxetine have been conducted in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); however, the results from GAD. RCTs are inconsistent. With an extensive search of databases and clinical trial registries, four published short-term RCTs were identified and included in the present meta-analysis. The mean change in total scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) from baseline was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included the response and remission rates, as defined by a >= 50% reduction in HAMA total scores and a <= 7 change in the HAMA total score at the end of treatment. In addition, the mean change in the HAMA total score from baseline in the subgroup with a HAMA total score >= 25 at baseline was included. Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than was placebo, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.118 (95% CIs, -0.203 to -0.033, P = 0.007). In particular, those with severe GAD (HAMA total score >= 25 at baseline) had a significantly greater benefit from vortioxetine than those without (SMD = -0.338, 95% CIs = -0.552 to -0.124, p = 0.002). The odds ratios (ORs) for vortioxetine for response and remission were 1.221 (95% CIs, 1.027 to 1.452, P = 0.024) and 1.052 (95% CIs, 0.853 to 1.296, P = 0.637), respectively. Discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) (OR = 1.560, 1.006 to 2.419, p = 0.047) was marginally higher in vortioxetine than placebo treatment, whereas discontinuation due to any reason (OR = 0.971, 0.794 to 1.187, p = 0.771) and inefficacy (OR = 0.687, 0.380 to 1.243, p = 0.215) were not significantly different among treatment groups. Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may have a potential as an another treatment option for GAD (especially for severe GAD), they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a limited number of RCTs.

AB  - Lifestyle medicine is a patient-engaged field that has grown in tandem with our increasing knowledge of the importance of lifestyle factors and modifiable health behaviors for disease prevention, health promotion, and the management of chronic illness. Stress is at the epicenter of many negative behaviors that contribute to unhealthy lives, such as smoking, overeating, and unhealthy diets, and lack of activity. Mindfulness meditation is a stress reduction practice that teaches awareness, appreciation, and nonjudgmental acceptance of one's present experience, thereby short-circuiting reactive, automatic stress reactions. Our systematic review and meta-analysis focuses on the application of randomized controlled mindfulness intervention studies across a broad range of populations and conditions that are relevant to lifestyle medicine. In addition to organizing and highlighting mindfulness research studies that are relevant to the field of lifestyle medicine, we also empirically examine the impact of study design issues (eg, use of different controls, intervention length and duration, sample size, primary outcomes) on the magnitude of effect of mindfulness interventions in lifestyle medicine. Overall, this systematic review and meta-analysis found partial evidence for mindfulness-based interventions to provide short-term benefits across a wide range of lifestyle medicine-relevant populations and study outcomes, particularly focusing on the areas of diet and weight management and symptom burden. Numerous outcome measures were used; however, the most common were the Perceived Stress Scale and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. This analysis also provides evidence for mindfulness-based interventions that have fewer than 20 individuals per group, as well as partial support for interventions that are less than the standard 8 weeks in duration.

AB  - Background: Adolescence and early adulthood are critical periods for the development of mental disorders. Online peer-to-peer communication is popular among young people and may improve mental health by providing social support. Previous systematic reviews have targeted Internet support groups for adults with mental health problems, including depression. However, there have been no systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of online peer-to-peer support in improving the mental health of adolescents and young adults.
   Objective: The aim of this review was to systematically identify available evidence for the effectiveness of online peer-to peer support for young people with mental health problems.
   Methods: The PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases were searched using keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Retrieved abstracts (n=3934) were double screened and coded. Studies were included if they (1) investigated an online peer-to-peer interaction, (2) the interaction discussed topics related to mental health, (3) the age range of the sample was between 12 to 25 years, and (4) the study evaluated the effectiveness of the peer-to-peer interaction.
   Results: Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria for the current review. The studies targeted a range of mental health problems including depression and anxiety (n=2), general psychological problems (n=1), eating disorders (n=1), and substance use (tobacco) (n=2). The majority of studies investigated Internet support groups (n=4), and the remaining studies focused on virtual reality chat sessions (n=2). In almost all studies (n=5), the peer support intervention was moderated by health professionals, researchers or consumers. Studies employed a range of study designs including randomized controlled trials (n=3), pre-post studies (n=2) and one randomized trial. Overall, two of the randomized controlled trials were associated with a significant positive outcome in comparison to the control group at post-intervention. In the remaining four studies, peer-to-peer support was not found to be effective.
   Conclusions: This systematic review identified an overall lack of high-quality studies examining online peer-to-peer support for young people. Given that peer support is frequently used as an adjunct to Internet interventions for a variety of mental health conditions, there is an urgent need to determine the effectiveness of peer support alone as an active intervention.

   Data sources: A range of medical and psychological science electronic databases were searched (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO). Hand searching and reference checking are also included.
   Review methods: Reviews, systematic reviews, experimental and cross-sectional studies, providing affective instability in neurobiological and behavioural measurements in clinical populations. Studies were selected, data were extracted and quality was appraised.
   Results: Twenty-nine studies were included, 6 of which were review studies (one a meta-analysis) and 23 of which were primary studies, across a wide variety of disorders including ADHD, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, severe mood dysregulation, major depression, and borderline personality disorder.
   Conclusions: The bulk of the studies converge on the role of the amygdala, particularly in borderline personality disorders, and how it connects with other areas of the brain. Future research needs to extend these findings across diagnoses and development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: People with depression often suffer from comorbid chronic physical conditions and such conditions are widely believed to interfere with primary care providers' ability to recognize their depression. We aimed to examine the evidence related to the influence of chronic physical comorbidity burden on depression recognition in routine, community-based primary care settings.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on depression recognition in primary care that featured comparisons between patient groups with higher and lower burdens of chronic physical comorbidity. Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to July 2013. Reference list and reverse citation searches were also performed. A narrative synthesis was conducted given clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies.
   Results: Our search identified 5817 unique citations, out of which we identified 13 studies reporting data on the relationship between chronic physical comorbidity burden and depression recognition in primary care. Four studies provided some evidence that higher chronic physical comorbidity burden negatively affected primary care providers' ability to recognize depression. In contrast, two studies reported higher rates of recognition in patients with higher comorbidity burden and seven studies reported no differences in recognition between comorbidity groups.
   Conclusion: Chronic physical comorbidity burden does not consistently affect depression recognition negatively in primary care. Instead, recognition seems to vary depending on the specific conditions or combination of conditions examined. Methodological choices of authors, such as approaches to measuring recognition and chronic medical comorbidity, also likely explain some divergent results across studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Executive function (EF) is essential for successfully navigating nearly all of our daily activities. Of critical importance for clinical psychological science, EF impairments are associated with most forms of psychopathology. However, despite the proliferation of research on EF in clinical populations, with notable exceptions clinical and cognitive approaches to EF have remained largely independent, leading to failures to apply theoretical and methodological advances in one field to the other field and hindering progress. First, we review the current state of knowledge of EF impairments associated with psychopathology and limitations to the previous research in light of recent advances in understanding and measuring EF. Next, we offer concrete suggestions for improving EF assessment. Last, we suggest future directions, including integrating modern models of EF with state of the art, hierarchical models of dimensional psychopathology as well as translational implications of EF-informed research on clinical science.

AB  - There is increasing evidence of prodromal manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). These affective symptoms may be observed many years before the core diagnostic symptoms of the neurological condition. It is becoming more apparent that depression is a significant modifying factor of the trajectory of disease progression and even treatment outcomes. It is therefore crucial that we understand the potential pathophysiologies related to the primary condition, which could contribute to the development of depression. The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis is a key neuroendocrine signaling system involved in physiological homeostasis and stress response. Disturbances of this system lead to severe hormonal imbalances, and the majority of such patients also present with behavioral deficits and/or mood disorders. Dysregulation of the HPA-axis is also strongly implicated in the pathology of major depressive disorder. Consistent with this, antidepressant drugs, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to alter HPA-axis activity. In this review, we will summarize the current state of knowledge regarding HPA-axis pathology in Alzheimer's, PD and HD, differentiating between prodromal and later stages of disease progression when evidence is available. Both clinical and preclinical evidence will be examined, but we highlight animal model studies as being particularly useful for uncovering novel mechanisms of pathology related to co-morbid mood disorders. Finally, we purpose utilizing the preclinical evidence to better inform prospective, intervention studies.

AB  - BackgroundChild and adolescent mental health problems are common, associated with wide-ranging functional impairments, and show substantial continuities into adult life. It is therefore important to understand the extent to which the prevalence of mental health problems has changed over time, and to identify reasons behind any trends in mental health.
   Scope and MethodologyThis review evaluates evidence on whether the population prevalence of child and adolescent mental health problems has changed. The primary focus of the review is on epidemiological cross-cohort comparisons identified by a systematic search of the literature (using the Web of Knowledge database).
   FindingsClinical diagnosis and treatment of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders increased over recent decades. Epidemiological comparisons of unselected population cohorts using equivalent assessments of mental health have found little evidence of an increased rate of ADHD, but cross-cohort comparisons of rates of ASD are lacking at this time. Findings do suggest substantial secular change in emotional problems and antisocial behaviour in high-income countries, including periods of increase and decrease in symptom prevalence. Evidence from low- and middle-income countries is very limited. Possible explanations for trends in child and adolescent mental health are discussed. The review also addresses how cross-cohort comparisons can provide valuable complementary information on the aetiology of mental illness.

AB  - BackgroundOptimal outcomes' of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders may mean the best possible outcome, or the best considering a child's history. Most research into the outcomes of child and adolescent psychiatric disorder concentrates on the likelihood of adult illness and disability given an earlier history of psychopathology.
   MethodsIn this article, we review the research literature (based on a literature search using PubMed, RePORT and Google Advanced Scholar databases) on including optimal outcomes for young people with a history of anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or substance use disorders in childhood or adolescence. We consider three types of risks that these children may run later in development: future episodes of the same disorder, future episodes of a different disorder, and functional impairment. The impact of treatment or preventative interventions on early adult functioning is briefly reviewed.
   ResultsWe found that very few studies enabled us to answer our questions with certainty, but that in general about half of adults with a psychiatric history were disorder-free and functioning quite well in their 20s or 30s. However, their chance of functioning well was less than that of adults without a psychiatric history, even in the absence of a current disorder.
   ConclusionsAmong adults who had a psychiatric disorder as a child or adolescent, about half can be expected to be disorder-free as young adults, and of these about half will be free of significant difficulties in the areas of work, health, relationships, and crime. Optimal outcomes are predicted by a mixture of personal characteristics and environmental supports.

AB  - Over the last decade, researchers have expanded our understanding of early-emerging mental health problems in preschoolers. In this article, we review the epidemiology, course, and clinical significance of disruptive behavior disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders in preschoolers. We present findings highlighting advances in preschool psychopathology and treatment research, and provide directions for the field of preschool mental health. To understand preschool psychopathology, we need to take an empirically based, developmentally sensitive approach that includes understanding more fully both normative and atypical development. Such an approach will inform how we define, assess, and treat early mental health problems.

AB  - Objective: The rich interconnectedness between gut and brain is increasingly being identified. This article reviews the evidence for brain-gut and gut-brain syndromes, particularly recent epidemiological evidence, and animal studies demonstrating bi-directionality at the formative stage of development.
   Method: Narrative literature review with selection for relevance and quality.
   Results: Population surveys show a strong correlation between anxiety, depression, and functional gastrointestinal disorders, contradicting early suspicions that the high prevalence of anxiety and depression in the clinic was mainly due to neurotic health seeking behaviour. Five and 12 year follow-up shows that psychological distress can predict later onset of a functional gastrointestinal disorder and vice versa. Brain-gut pathways include the autonomic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis including corticotrophin releasing factor directly acting on the gut. Gut-brain pathways include ascending pain pathways, cytokines including tumour necrosis factor alpha in response to bacterial translocation and inflammation, 5-hydroxytryptamine secretion by entero-endocrine cells and psychoactive chemicals of bacterial origin which may enter the blood stream, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, fatty acids and 5-hydroxytryptamine precursors. The ability to control rodent temperament and HPA responsiveness with early modification of gastrointestinal flora, and the effects of early stress on the barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract and flora, suggests an ability of both systems to prime each other in early life for later problems. This hypothesis seems to be supported by a possible protective effect of a probiotic strain of bacteria in a model of early rat psychological trauma.
   Conclusion: Psychological treatments are known to improve functional gastrointestinal disorders, the next wave of research may involve preventative microbiological gut based treatments for primary psychological presentations, both to treat the presenting complaint and inoculate against later functional gastrointestinal disorders.

AB  - Lake sturgeon are arguably the largest and most unique freshwater fish in North America. Unfortunately their uniqueness includes many characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts including overfishing, habitat fragmentation, and degradation. For approximately 100 years lake sturgeon populations across North America have either been in decline and (or) have experienced a sluggish recovery. While this is partly due to lake sturgeon life history, most researchers agree that habitat fragmentation and degradation are currently the highest risk to the species. Though most lake sturgeon populations are depressed, there are a few exceptions that offer a glimpse into what a stable population or recovery may look like. The following review highlights such instances as well as what is known and more importantly what is not known about this unique species. Specifically, we highlight the need for improved and organized sharing of raw data given the fact that many researchers do not have access to the plethora of information available to others (e. g., otoliths for aging). We examine the varying life history and diet choices of this plastic species offering hypotheses for differences in migration routes and distances as well the differing recovery rates found across their range. We highlight myths about the species providing evidence that they may not be as long lived and fecund as previously thought. We examine the lake sturgeon's current legal status across North America including the efforts of nonprofit groups that have had success in increasing population numbers. Most importantly, we highlight logistical problems faced by researchers and data gaps in the literature that must be filled to increase the odds of a successful recovery. Alongside the data gaps, the recovery of this species is fraught with political and industrial road blocks that are as varied as its current recovery. Subsequently, as is the case with many species, its survival will come down to solid scientific knowledge and the value placed on it by society.

AB  - Background: Prenatal depression can negatively affect the physical and mental health of both mother and fetus. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of yoga as an intervention in the management of prenatal depression.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO from all retrieved articles describing such trials up to July 2014.
   Results: Six RCTs were identified in the systematic search. The sample consisted of 375 pregnant women, most of whom were between 20 and 40 years of age. The diagnoses of depression were determined by their scores on Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. When compared with comparison groups (e.g., standard prenatal care, standard antenatal exercises, social support, etc.), the level of depression statistically significantly reduced in yoga groups (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.94 to -0.25; p = 0.0007). One subgroup analysis revealed that both the levels of depressive symptoms in prenatally depressed women (SMD, -0.46; CI, -0.90 to -0.03; p = 0.04) and non-depressed women (SMD, -0.87; CI, -1.22 to -0.52; p < 0.00001) were statistically significantly lower in yoga group than that in control group. There were two kinds of yoga: the physical-exercise-based yoga and integrated yoga, which, besides physical exercises, included pranayama, meditation or deep relaxation. Therefore, the other subgroup analysis was conducted to estimate effects of the two kinds of yoga on prenatal depression. The results showed that the level of depression was significantly decreased in the integrated yoga group (SMD, -0.79; CI, -1.07 to -0.51; p < 0.00001) but not significantly reduced in physical-exercise-based yoga group (SMD, -0.41; CI, -1.01 to -0.18; p = 0.17).
   Conclusions: Prenatal yoga intervention in pregnant women may be effective in partly reducing depressive symptoms.

AB  - Background: The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) saves lives but clinical experience suggests that it may have detrimental effects on mental health. The ICD shock has been largely blamed as the main offender but empirical evidence is not consistent, perhaps because of methodological differences across studies.
   Objective: To appraise methodologies of studies that assessed the psychological effects of ICD shock and explore associations between methods and results.
   Data Sources: A comprehensive search of English articles that were published between 1980 and 30 June 2013 was applied to the following electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, NHS HTA database, PsycINFO, Sciencedirect and CINAHL.
   Review Methods: Only studies testing the effects of ICD shock on psychological and quality of life outcomes were included. Data were extracted according to a PICOS pre-defined sheet including methods and study quality indicators.
   Results: Fifty-four observational studies and six randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Multiple differences in methods that were used to test the psychological effects of ICD shock were found across them. No significant association with results was observed.
   Conclusions: Methodological heterogeneity of study methods is too wide and limits any quantitative attempt to account for the mixed findings. Well-built and standardized research is urgently needed.

AB  - Depression is a multifactorial disorder with clinically heterogeneous features involving disturbances of mood and cognitive function. Noninvasive neuroimaging studies have provided rich evidence that these behavioral deficits in depression are associated with structural and functional abnormalities in specific regions and connections. Recent advances in brain connectomics through the use of graph theory highlight disrupted topological organization of large-scale functional and structural brain networks in depression, involving global topology (e. g., local clustering, shortest-path lengths, and global and local efficiencies), modular structure, and network hubs. These system-level disruptions show important correlates with genetic and environmental factors, which provide an integrative perspective on mood and cognitive deficits in depressive syndrome. Moreover, research suggests that the pathologic networks associated with depression represent potentially valuable biomarkers for early detection of this disorder and they are likely to be regulated and recalibrated by using pharmacologic, psychological, and brain stimulation therapies. These connectome-based imaging studies present new opportunities to reconceptualize the pathogenesis of depression, improve our knowledge of the biological mechanisms of therapeutic effects, and identify appropriate stimulation targets to optimize the clinical response in depression treatment. Here, we summarize the current findings and historical understanding of structural and functional connectomes in depression, focusing on graph analyses of depressive brain networks. We also consider methodological factors such as sample heterogeneity and poor test-retest reliability of recordings due to physiological, head motion, and imaging artifacts to discuss result inconsistencies among studies. We conclude with suggestions for future research directions on the emerging field of imaging connectomics in depression.

AB  - Deficits in emotion regulation processes are a common and widely used explanation for the development and maintenance of binge eating disorder (BED). It is assumed that BED patients - as they have difficulty regulating their negative emotions - use binge eating to cope with these emotions and to find relief. However, the number of experimental studies investigating this assumption is scarce and the differentiation of obese individuals with and without BED regarding the emotion regulation model is not verified.
   We reviewed literature for experimental studies investigating the emotion regulation model in obese patients (OB) with and without BED. Our search resulted in 18 experimental studies examining the triggering effect of negative emotions for binge eating or its effects on subsequent relief.
   We found evidence indicating that negative emotion serves as a trigger for binge eating in the BED group unlike the obese group without BED. Considering the small number of studies, we found evidence for a (short-term) improvement of mood through food intake, irrespective of group. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms, but focused and extensive research in the last years has provided new knowledge in the field of non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms include neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, apathy, impulse control disorders, and occur in the majority of patients with PD. They are associated with impaired quality of life for patients and relatives, additional deterioration of function and increased use of health resources. Medical and surgical therapies commonly used for treatment of PD can induce or worsen such symptoms. This paper discusses the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment approaches for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in PD in the perspective of clinical practice and management. The prevalence rates of various NPS are high, various demographic, clinical and treatment related variables have shown to be associated with higher risk of NPS. Randomized controlled trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of NPS in PD are sparse. Current evidence supports tricyclic antidepressants as efficacious treatment of depression in PD and antipsychotic clozapine as efficacious choice for psychosis. Further studies to evaluate various other management strategies of NPS in PD are required. Neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD should be considered an integral part of the disease; hence a multidisciplinary approach is essential to improve the overall outcome of PD also through raised awareness and enriched knowledge on NPS.

AB  - Background. Low and middle income countries (LMICs) are facing an increase of the impact of mental health problems while confronted with limited resources and limited access to mental health care, known as the 'mental health gap'. One strategy to reduce the mental health gap would be to utilize the internet to provide more widely-distributed and low cost mental health care. We undertook this systematic review to investigate the effectiveness and efficacy of online interventions in LMICs.
   Methods. We systematically searched the data-bases PubMed, PsycINFO, JMIR, and additional sources. MeSH terms, Thesaurus, and free text keywords were used. We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of online interventions in LMICs.
   Results. We found only three articles reported results of RCTs on online interventions for mental health conditions in LMICs, but none of these interventions was compared with an active control condition. Also, the mental health conditions were diverse across the three studies.
   Conclusions. There is a dearth of studies examining the effect of online interventions in LMICs, so we cannot draw a firm conclusion on its effectiveness. However, given the effectiveness of online interventions in high income countries and sharp increase of internet access in LMICs, online interventions may offer a potential to help reduce the 'mental health gap'. More studies are urgently needed in LMICs.

AB  - With increasing age, Joseph Haydn complained of progressive forgetfulness preventing him from composing for about the last 8 years of his life. He spent his days more and more inactive and immobilized, suffering from a disabling gait disturbance. Still, most biographers consider diffuse atherosclerosis and congestive heart failure to be reasons for Haydn's medical condition and physical decline during the last years of his life. A more sophisticated and detailed inspection of documents and sources, however, leads to the diagnosis of subcortical vascular encephalopathy (SVE), caused by progressive cerebral small vessel disease. Important features of the disease are mood changes, urinary symptoms, and in particular a characteristic gait disturbance, while dementia is only mild and occurs later in the course. Haydn was severely disabled by the symptoms of SVE for several years and often reported difficulties in the completion of his last oratorio "Die Jahreszeiten" (The Seasons). Subsequently, the disease prevented him from composing another large oratorio, "Das jungste Gericht" (The last judgement), which had been already drafted. Finally, the progress of SVE stopped his long career as a composer and conductor at the age of 73 years.

AB  - Introduction: China has the largest number of type 2 diabetes mellitus (12DM) cases globally, and T2DM management has become a critical public health issue in China. Individuals with T2DM have an increased risk of developing mental health disorders, psychological disturbances, and functional problems associated with living with their condition. Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated that, generally, psychological interventions are effective in the management of T2DM-related outcomes; however, these reviews have predominantly included studies conducted within English-speaking countries and have not determined the efficacy of the varying types of psychological interventions. As such, this paper aims to synthesize evidence and quantify the efficacy of psychological therapies for the management of glycemic and psychological outcomes of T2DM in China, relative to control conditions.
   Methods: A systematic search (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wangfang Data) for all years to December 2014 identified all available literature. Eligibility criteria included: peer-reviewed journal articles, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of a psychological therapy for the management of T2DM, adult participants (>= 18 years) diagnosed with T2DM or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and Chinese speaking participants only (in mainland China). Outcome measures were glycated hemoglobin, blood glucose concentration, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Effect sizes were pooled using a random effects model. Negative effect sizes corresponded to positive outcomes favoring the intervention.
   Results: Forty-five RCTs were eligible for the meta-analyses. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBI) and motivational interviewing (MI) were more effective than the control condition in the reduction of glycated hemoglobin [CBT: -0.97 (95% CI -1.37 to -0.57); MI: -0.71 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.43)]. CBT and client-centered therapy (CCT) were also associated with reductions in depression and blood glucose concentration, and CBT was associated with reductions in anxiety.
   Conclusion: Psychological interventions, namely, CBT, MI, and CCT are effective in improving certain T2DM-related outcomes in China. Considerable levels of heterogeneity and unclear risk of bias associated with most included RCTs suggest caution when interpreting results. In China, where the burden of T2DM is increasing significantly, psychological interventions may provide promising approaches to assist in the management of T2DM to delay the progression of T2DM related outcomes.

AB  - Current findings indicate that depression and suicidal ideation are prevalent in medical students. The main aim was to systematically review articles related to depression and suicidal behavior among medical students. Using MEDLINE a systematic review was made, combining the keywords "depression", "suicide", "suicidal ideation", "suicidal behavior"and "AND medical students". English and Portuguese peer-reviewed original articles published between January 2005 and June 2011 were included. From the 114 identified by systematic search, 37 articles were found after excluding studies where medical students ' reaction to patient suicide or depression was studied, studies not using a standardized depression instrument and students from other than conventional medical schools. Prevalence of depression in medical students ranged from 2.9% to 38.2%, suicidal ideation from 4.4% to 23.1% and suicidal attempts from 0.0% to 6.4%. Studies suggest that prevalence of depression is higher in female medical students, younger students and lower years in medical schools. Mixed results were found about the relationship between depression and ethnicity. Regarding suicidal behavior there were mixed results in the relationship of gender and year of medical school. No relationship was found between suicidal behavior and age, and suicidal ideation and race. Increasing awareness about the prevalence of depression, suicidal behavior and associated factors among medical students is needed. Psychoeducation on early recognition about depression and suicidal behavior and available treatment resources for students, and counteracting the stigma associated with these conditions, could prevent hazardous consequences, by promoting preventive programs and an easier and confidential access to psychiatric treatment.

AB  - Background
   Cognitive bias modification (CBM) interventions are strongly advocated in research and clinical practice.
   Aims
   To examine the efficiency of CBM for clinically relevant outcomes, along with study quality, publication bias and potential moderators.
   Method
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBM interventions that reported clinically relevant outcomes assessed with standardised instruments.
   Results
   We identified 49 trials and grouped outcomes into anxiety and depression. Effect sizes were small considering all the samples, and mostly non-significant for patient samples. Effect sizes became non-significant when outliers were excluded and after adjustment for publication bias. The quality of the ROTS was suboptimal.
   Conclusions
   CBM may have small effects on mental health problems, but it is also very well possible that there are no significant clinically relevant effects. Research in this field is hampered by small and low-quality trials, and by risk of publication bias. Many positive outcomes are driven by extreme outliers.

TI  - The Pictures Which Children Drew Are Their Mirrors!
KW  - Children's mental health
KW  - children's picture
KW  - reflection of pictures
AB  - Both Freud and Jung, who are the ancestors of modern psychology, pointed out the reciprocal link between art, symbols and personalities in their studies. Freud confirmed with his studies that universal human conflicts and neurosis drive people into the artistic creativity and the expression by drawing is a way to understand the inner world of the human spirit. Jung searched the universality and archetypes contained in the visual arts as he believed that the connection is important between the soul and the image and also he stressed the importance of symbols in description. Jung stated that imagines develop the spirit as creating symbols and individuals exposed to trauma treat themselves by using this way. In parallel with Freud's and Jung's studies, different studies were made as a result of orientation to the pictures of children. In the several studies from the past to the present, pictures are one of the most important ways of expressing themselves for children, in addition to this; it is an indicator for the emotional and cognitive development of children. It is stated that children reflect the inner world of their own as spontaneous and without resistance in the pictures which they draw, and they perceive this activities as a game, and inform the advisor about their psychological status, forms of interpersonal relationship, feelings, briefly many information related with their inner world. It is also specified that drawing is an easy communication instrument especially for the children who are timid, passive and have difficulties in expressing themselves; and it gains an important power to counselor about understanding children. In this review, we tried to tell the therapeutic use of pictures to assess the children mental status and the studies which was made in this subject in our country and the world.

AB  - Background : Instruments are frequently used in case finding, diagnosis and severity grading of major depression, but the evidence supporting their utility is weak. Aim : To systematically review the specificity and sensitivity of instruments used to diagnose and grade the severity of depression. Methods : MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases were searched until April 2014. Fifty studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS. The average sensitivity and specificity of each instrument was estimated with hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics analyses and the confidence in the estimates was evaluated using GRADE. Minimum acceptable sensitivity/specificity, with structured interview as the reference, was 80%/80% for structured interviews and 80%/70% for case-finding instruments. The minimum acceptable standard for severity measures was a correlation of 0.7 with DSM-IV classification. Results : Twenty instruments were investigated. The average sensitivity/specificity was 85%/92% for the Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIV-Axis-I Disorders (SCID-I), 95%/84% for the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), <70%/85% for the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), 88%/78% for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) with a cut-off score of 10, 69%/95% for PHQ-9 as a diagnostic algorithm and 70%/83% for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) with a cut-off score of 7. The confidence in the estimates for the other instruments was very low. Conclusions : Only the SCID-I, MINI and PHQ-9 with a cut-off score of 10 fulfilled the minimum criteria for sensitivity and specificity. The use of the PRIME-MD and HADS is not supported by current evidence.

AB  - Introduction. Bipolar disorder (BD) implies risk of suicide. The age at onset (AAO) of BD carries prognostic significance. Substance abuse may precede the onset of BD and cannabis is the most common illicit drug used. The main goal of this study is to review the association of cannabis use as a risk factor for early onset of BD and for suicide attempts. Materials and Methods. PubMed database was searched for articles using key words "bipolar disorder," "suicide attempts," "cannabis," "marijuana," "early age at onset," and "early onset." Results. The following percentages in bipolar patients were found: suicide attempts 3.6-42%; suicide attempts and substance use 5-60%; suicide attempts and cannabis use 15-42%. An early AAO was associated with cannabis misuse. The mean age of the first manic episode in individuals with and without BD and cannabis use disorder (CUD) was 19.5 and 25.1 years, respectively. The first depressive episode was at 18.5 and 24.4 years, respectively. Individuals misusing cannabis showed increased risk of suicide. Discussion. Cannabis use is associated with increased risk of suicide attempts and with early AAO. However, the effect of cannabis at the AAO and suicide attempts is not clear.

AB  - People living with HIV (PLWH) experience greater psychological distress than the general population. Evidence from high-incomes countries suggests that psychological interventions for PLWH can improve mental health symptoms, quality of life, and HIV care engagement. However, little is known about the effectiveness of mental health interventions for PLWH in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the large majority of PLWH reside. This systematized review aims to synthesize findings from mental health intervention trials with PLWH in LMICs to inform the delivery of mental health services in these settings. A systematic search strategy was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed published papers of intervention trials addressing negative psychological states or disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety) among PLWH in LMIC settings. Search results were assessed against pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data from papers meeting criteria were extracted for synthesis. Twenty-six papers, published between 2000 and 2014, describing 22 unique interventions were identified. Trials were implemented in sub-Saharan Africa (n = 13), Asia (n = 7), and the Middle East (n = 2), and addressed mental health using a variety of approaches, including cognitivebehavioral (n = 18), family-level (n = 2), and pharmacological (n = 2) treatments. Four randomized controlled trials reported significant intervention effects in mental health outcomes, and 11 preliminary studies demonstrated promising findings. Among the limited mental health intervention trials with PLWH in LMICs, few demonstrated efficacy. Mental health interventions for PLWH in LMICs must be further developed and adapted for resource-limited settings to improve effectiveness.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to summarize scientific literature on obesity in policemen through a systematic review of observational studies. For this purpose the following electronic databases were selected: Medline by Pubmed, CINAHL, and Scopus; and a manual search of the referenced studies concerning this topic was performed. There were no restrictions with respect to the year or language of the publication. Twenty-three studies were identified and 9 articles, considered as potentially relevant, were included. The labor time, shift and career progression promoted changes in body composition. Most of the policemen taking part in the studies included in this paper were overweight (BMI: 25.2-29.3), obese (body fat a parts per thousand yen 25%), had increased waist (90.4-102 cm) and abdominal perimeters (18.9-90.5 cm), and had a higher risk of chronic disease, which is associated with depression and stress development. Interventional studies are needed for the purpose of proposing preventive and rehabilitation programs, which would result in providing physical and mental well-being, improvement of life quality and, especially, prevention of obesity related to police work.

AB  - In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), determinants of women's and children's health are complex and differential vulnerability may exist to risk factors of perinatal distress and preterm birth. We examined the contribution of maternal perinatal distress on preterm birth and infant health in terms of infant survival and mother-infant interaction. A critical narrative and interpretive literature review was conducted. Peer-reviewed electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, CINHAL), grey literature, and reference lists were searched, followed by a consultation exercise. The literature was predominantly from high-income countries. We identify determinants of perinatal distress and explicate changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic, immune and cardiovascular systems, and behavioral responses resulting in pathophysiological effects. We suggest cultural-neutral composite measures of allostatic mediators (i.e., several biomarkers) of maternal perinatal distress as objective indicators of dysregulation in body systems in pregnant women in LMIC. Understanding causal links of maternal perinatal distress to preterm birth in women in LMIC should be a priority. The roles of allostasis and allostatic load are considered within the context of the health of pregnant women and fetuses/newborns in LMIC with emphasis on identifying objective indicators of the level of perinatal distress and protective factors or processes contributing to resilience while facing toxic stress. We propose a prospective study design with multiple measures across pregnancy and postpartum requiring complex statistical modeling. Building research capacity through partnering researchers in high-income countries and LMIC and reflecting on unique ethical challenges will be important to generating new knowledge in LMIC.

AB  - The neuroimaging literature of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has grown substantially over the last several decades, facilitating great advances in the identification of specific brain regions, neurotransmitter systems and networks associated with depressive illness. Despite this progress, fundamental questions remain about the pathophysiology and etiology of MDD. More importantly, this body of work has yet to directly influence clinical practice. It has long been a goal for the fields of clinical psychology and psychiatry to have a means of making objective diagnoses of mental disorders. Frustratingly little movement has been achieved on this front, however, and the 'gold-standard' of diagnostic validity and reliability remains expert consensus. In light of this challenge, the focus of the current review is to provide a critical summary of key findings from different neuroimaging approaches in MDD research, including structural, functional and neurochemical imaging studies. Following this summary, we discuss some of the current conceptual obstacles to better understanding the pathophysiology of depression, and conclude with recommendations for future neuroimaging research.

AB  - Happiness underlying factors are considerable from two dimensions: endogenic factors (biological, cognitive, personality and ethical sub-factors) and exogenic factors (behavioral, social-cultural, economical, geographical, life events and aesthetics sub-factors). Among all endogenic factors, biological sub-factors are the significant predictors of happiness. Existence of significant differences in temperament and happiness of infants is an indicator of biological influences. Therefore, this study aimed to consider biological factors that underlie happiness. At the first, all of the biological factors in relation with happiness were searched from following websites: PubMed, Wiley& Sons, Science direct (19902014). Then, the articles divided into five sub-groups (genetic, brain and neurotransmitters, endocrinology and hormones, physical health, morphology and physical attractiveness). Finally, a systematic review performed based on existing information. Results of studies on genetic factors indicated an average effectiveness of genetic about 35 -50 percent on happiness. In spite of difficulties in finding special genes, several genes distributed to emotion and mood. Neuroscience studies showed that some part of brain (e. g. amygdala, hipocamp and limbic system) and neurotransmitters (e. g. dopamine, serotonin, norepinefrine and endorphin) play a role in control of happiness. A few studies pointed to the role of cortisol and adrenaline (adrenal gland) and oxitocin (pituitary gland) in controlling happiness. Physical health and typology also concluded in most related studies to have a significant role in happiness. Therefore, according to previous research, it can be said that biological and health factors are critical in underlying happiness and its role in happiness is undeniable.

AB  - Introduction. With the aging of the population, an increasing number of people have dementia, most of whom are receiving home care. Caregivers are exposed to a variety of stressors, which may lead to feeling burdened, or to depression and anxiety. Various programs or structured interventions have been developed to prevent or lessen these negative consequences. The efficacy of these interventions is debated, mainly due to methodological differences between studies. Review studies so far have presented important discrepancies, thus perpetuating a lack of clarity regarding this important geriatric care problem. The effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent or reduce the burden and/or symptoms of anxiety and depression in informal caregivers are reviewed precisely and rigorously.
   Methods. A systematic review of randomized controlled studies assessing the efficacy of structured interventions on the variables of burden, depression and anxiety in informal caregivers of patients with dementia.
   Results. The literature search yielded 997 references, of which 35 met the screening criteria. Of these studies, 51.4% had results that were statistically favorable to intervention. The methodology used varied widely between studies.
   Conclusions. Overall, the available evidence favors the implementation of structured intervention programs, although the results are heterogeneous. Psychoeducational interventions yield better results and can be better adapted to the needs of caregivers.

AB  - Objective: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), the deliberate, self-inflicted damage of bodily tissue without the intent to die, is associated with various negative outcomes. Although basic and epidemiologic research on NSSI has increased during the last 2 decades, literature on effective interventions targeting NSSI is still emerging. Here, we present a comprehensive, systematic review of existing psychological and pharmacological treatments designed specifically for NSSI, or including outcome assessments examining change in NSSI.
   Method: We conducted a systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ERIC databases to retrieve relevant articles that met inclusion criteria; specifically, uncontrolled and controlled trials that 1) presented quantitative outcome data on NSSI, and 2) clearly differentiated NSSI from suicidal self-injury (SSI). Consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, definition of NSSI, we excluded studies examining populations with developmental or intellectual disabilities, or with psychotic disorders.
   Results: Several interventions appear to hold promise for reducing NSSI, including dialectical behaviour therapy, emotion regulation group therapy, manual-assisted cognitive therapy, dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy, atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole), naltrexone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (with or without cognitive-behavioural therapy). Nevertheless, there remains a paucity of well-controlled studies investigating treatment efficacy for NSSI.
   Conclusions: Structured psychotherapeutic approaches focusing on collaborative therapeutic relationships, motivation for change, and directly addressing NSSI behaviours seem to be most effective in reducing NSSI. Medications targeting the serotonergic, dopaminergic and opioid systems also have demonstrated some benefits. Future studies employing controlled designs as well as a clear delineation of NSSI and SSI will improve knowledge regarding treatment effects.

AB  - This review focuses on suicide in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as well as risk factors and comorbidities of persons with ASD who have attempted suicide. Research was conducted by searching PubMed and Psychinfo for articles. Suicide in ASD is largely understudied. Although suicide is common in clinical samples, we have little knowledge of suicide in persons with ASD in the general population. Comorbidity, particularly with depression and other affective disorders or schizoid disorders and psychotic symptoms, is often reported, so it is difficult to determine if suicidality is associated with ASD or the comorbid disorder. Clinical samples suggest that suicide occurs more frequently in high functioning autism. Physical and sexual abuse, bullying, and changes in routine are precipitating events associated with suicide risk. Persons with ASD present risk factors inherent to their diagnosis (deficit in expression of feelings and thoughts), along with risk factors pertaining to the general population (abuse, depression, anxiety, etc.). The inability of persons with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) to express emotions and thoughts makes the diagnosis of suicidal ideation difficult and demands important adjustments to traditional psychotherapeutic interventions. More research is needed to determine the incidence of suicidal behaviors in persons with ASD, to identify risk and protective factors, as well as to assess the effectiveness of prevention strategies and interventions.

AB  - Objective: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in severe psychiatric disorders (depression, schizophrenia). Here, we provide evidence of how the effects of oxidative stress on fatty acid (FA) and one-carbon (1-C) cycle metabolism, which may initially represent adaptive responses, might underlie comorbidity between CVD and psychiatric disorders.
   Method: We conducted a literature search and integrated data in a narrative review.
   Results: Oxidative stress, mainly generated in mitochondria, is implicated in both psychiatric and cardiovascular pathophysiology. Oxidative stress affects the intrinsically linked FA and 1-C cycle metabolism: FAs decrease in chain length and unsaturation (particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated FAs), and lipid peroxidation products increase; the 1-C cycle shifts from the methylation to transsulfuration pathway (lower folate and higher homocysteine and antioxidant glutathione). Interestingly, corresponding alterations were reported in psychiatric disorders and CVD. Potential mechanisms through which FA and 1-C cycle metabolism may be involved in brain (neurocognition, mood regulation) and cardiovascular system functioning (inflammation, thrombosis) include membrane peroxidizability and fluidity, eicosanoid synthesis, neuroprotection and epigenetics.
   Conclusion: While oxidative-stress-induced alterations in FA and 1-C metabolism may initially enhance oxidative stress resistance, persisting chronically, they may cause damage possibly underlying (co-occurrence of) psychiatric disorders and CVD. This might have implications for research into diagnosis and (preventive) treatment of (CVD in) psychiatric patients.

AB  - Objectives: Recent studies have pointed to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and neurotrophic factors as key mediators in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Little is however known about the cascade of biological episodes underlying the cognitive deficits observed during the acute and euthymic phases of bipolar disorder (BD). The aim of this review is to assess the potential association between cognitive impairment and biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and neurotrophic activity in BD.
   Methods: Scopus (all databases), Pubmed and Ovid Medline were systematically searched with no language or year restrictions, up to November 2013, for human studies that collected both inflammatory markers and cognitive data in BD. Selected search terms were bipolar disorder, depression, mania, psychosis, inflammatory, cognitive and neurotrophic.
   Results: Ten human studies satisfied the criteria for consideration. The findings showed that high levels of peripheral inflammatory-cytokine, oxidative stress and reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were associated with poor cognitive performance. The BDNF val66met polymorphism is a potential vulnerability factor for cognitive impairment in BD.
   Conclusions: Current data provide preliminary evidence of a link between the cognitive decline observed in BD and mechanisms of neuroinflammation and neuroprotection. The identification of BD specific inflammatory markers and polymorphisms in inflammatory response genes may be of assistance for therapeutic intervention. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has yielded promising results as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, to date, no quantitative review of its clinical utility has been published.
   Method: We searched for randomized and sham-controlled trials from 1995 to March 2013 using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and SCOPUS. We then performed an exploratory random effects meta-analysis.
   Results: Studies on rTMS applied to the right DLPFC included 64 adults with PTSD. The pooled Hedges g effect size for pre and post changes in clinician-rated and self-reported PTSD symptoms were, respectively, 1.65 (P < 0.001) and 1.91 (P < 0.001), indicating significant and large-sized differences in outcome favouring active rTMS. Also, there were significant pre and post decreases with active rTMS in overall anxiety (Hedges g = 1.24; P = 0.02) and depressive (Hedges g = 0.85; P < 0.001) symptoms. Dropout rates at study end did not differ between active and sham rTMS groups. Regarding rTMS applied to the left DLPFC, there is only one study published to date (using a high frequency protocol), and its results showed that active rTMS seems to be superior overall to sham rTMS.
   Conclusions: Our exploratory meta-analysis shows that active rTMS applied to the DLPFC seems to be effective and acceptable for treating PTSD. However, the small number of subjects included in the analyses limits the generalizability of these findings. Future studies should include larger samples and deliver optimized stimulation parameters.

AB  - Objective: Divergent opinion surrounds the use of continuation/maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (c/mECT) as a recurrence prevention strategy in depression because of limited data on efficacy and adverse effects. In an effort to synthesize what is known about its efficacy, a systematic review of controlled studies reporting efficacy of c/mECT for the prevention of relapse or recurrence of a depressive episode in adults with unipolar major depression was conducted.
   Methods: Eleven electronic databases were searched with a 3-stage screening process conducted by the author with an independent review. Quality assessments and data extractions were performed on selected studies using preselected tools.
   Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria; these are as follows: 3 randomized controlled trials, 1 small nonrandomized controlled trial, and 2 retrospective chart reviews. All participants had undergone an index course of electroconvulsive therapy with positive effects before receiving c/mECT or control/comparison interventions. One randomized controlled trial and retrospective chart review showed no significant difference between c/mECT and control/comparison interventions; the remaining 4 studies showed a significantly superior effect of c/mECT for the prevention of recurrence of depression. Monotherapy of c/mECT was less efficacious than c/mECT in combination with antidepressant medication, as was c/mECT delivered on a schedule, which was unresponsive to early signs of recurrence.
   Conclusions: This review suggests that c/mECT is efficacious for the prevention of relapse/recurrence of major depression and that efficacy is increased when c/mECT is provided in combination with antidepressant medication and at flexible treatment intervals, responsive to early signs of recurrence.

AB  - This systematic review aimed to assess (1) the level of comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol misuse reported in research studies since 2007 and (2) any associations found between specific PTSD symptom clusters and alcohol misuse.
   A literature search was carried out to capture any papers published from 2007 to the end of July 2012. Six hundred and twenty abstracts were identified and reviewed, and 42 papers were included in the final review after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   The prevalence of comorbid alcohol misuse in those with PTSD ranged from 9.8 to 61.3 %. The prevalence of comorbid PTSD in those with alcohol misuse ranged from 2.0 to 63.0 %, and the majority of prevalence rates were over 10.0 %. Almost all of the odds ratios representing the strength of association between the conditions across a variety of populations were significant, and those ranged from 1.1 to 4.87. Of the different PTSD symptom clusters, this review found most evidence for associations between alcohol misuse and both avoidance/numbing symptoms and hyperarousal symptoms.
   Given that comorbidity appears to be common, the evidence from this systematic review supports the use of routine screening for comorbidity in populations who are known to have PTSD or alcohol misuse.

AB  - Despite the fact that the majority of currently available treatment guidelines propose antidepressants as the first-line pharmacological therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a substantial portion of patients fail to show an adequate response following this type of treatment. In this context, a number of small, open-label studies and randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have found atypical antipsychotics (AAs) to be a beneficial treatment for patients with PTSD. Thus, the present meta-analysis was conducted to enhance the sample size power and further the current understanding of the role of AAs for the treatment of PTSD. An extensive search of several databases identified 12 appropriate RCTs and available data from 9 of these (n = 497) were included in the final meta-analysis. AAs may have potential benefits for the treatment of PTSD as indicated by changes from baseline of the total score on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.289,95% confidence intervals [CIs] = -0.471, -0.106), P = 0.002). Additionally, AAs were found to be significantly more effective (P < 0.0001) than a placebo in terms of change from baseline for the intrusion sub-score on the CAPS (SMD = -0.373, 95% CIs = -0.568, -0.178) but there were no significant reductions for the avoidance and hyperarousal sub-symptoms. The responder rate and rate of improvement of depressive symptoms were also significantly higher in the AA group than the placebo group (P = 0.004 and P < 0.0001, respectively). However, the present results should be interpreted carefully and be translated into clinical practice only with due consideration of the limited quality and quantity of existing RCTs included in this analysis.

AB  - This paper reviews theory and research on the developmental origins of several widely studied personality vulnerabilities to psychopathology that represent the self-definitional (self-criticism, autonomy, and perfectionism) or relatedness (dependency and sociotropy) domains identified in Blatt's (2008), Blatt and Shichman's (1983), and Beck's (Beck et al., 1983) 2-polarities models of personality. We examine the evidence for the effects of both parenting and peer relationships. We conclude that there is a robust relationship between negative parenting behaviors and the 5 personality vulnerabilities reviewed here which pertain to both self-definition and relatedness, with recent evidence suggesting a possible effect of peer relationships over and above parents. The available evidence suggests that all of the negative developmental experiences studied to date contribute to the development of all the personality vulnerabilities reviewed here. In light of this, we suggest possible mechanisms through which adverse developmental experiences may affect personality factors pertaining to self-definition and relatedness. We also suggest that there may be commonalities across the developmental experiences, such that they result in similar developmental consequences. Although there is now much research on the development of these personality factors, there is still relatively little research examining the roles of factors other than parents and peers, including siblings, romantic partners, environmental changes, and genetics, and we conclude by proposing a revised model of the development of self-definition and relatedness in order to outline future directions for this research field.

AB  - Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is considered a valid measure of treatment effectiveness in addictions. However, alcohol research has lagged behind other biomedical fields in using HRQOL outcomes as primary or secondary endpoints. Previous work has suggested that psychiatric co-morbidity may mediate the relationship between alcohol dependence and HRQOL. Aim: The goal was to summarize the literature on HRQOL and its domains in the context of alcohol dependence. A specific focus was on the impact of depression and other psychopathology on these areas of life. Materials and methods: A database search of MEDLINE and PsychINFO was performed within the scope of PARADISE (Psychosocial fActors Relevant to brAin DISorders in Europe); a European Commission funded coordination action. Using pre-defined eligibility criteria, 42 studies were identified. A systematic approach to data collection was employed. Results and conclusions: Alcohol dependence was shown to affect overall HRQOL and its domains, including general health, physical and mental health, general and social functioning, activities of daily living, pain and sleep. The evidence demonstrating that alcohol dependence is a primary cause of impairments in overall HRQOL, general health, mental and physical health and social functioning was fairly strong. Treatment interventions helped improve HRQOL and its aforementioned domains. The reduction or cessation of alcohol use facilitated these improvements; however, it was not reported to be predictive of improvement in all instances where improvement was reported. Depression was associated with further decreases in HRQOL. Personality disorders contributed to the severity of social functioning impairment.

AB  - Introduction The possible link between creativity and psychopathology has been a long time focus of research up to the present day. However, this research is hampered by methodological problems, especially the definition and assessment of creativity. This makes interpretation and comparison of studies difficult and possibly accounts for the contradictory results of this research. Methods In this systematic review of the literature, research articles in the field of creativity and psychopathology were searched for creativity assessment tools. The tools used in the collected articles are presented and discussed. Results The results indicate that a multitude of creativity assessment tools were used, that many studies only used one tool to assess creativity and that most of these tools were only used in a limited number of studies. A few assessment tools stand out by a more frequent use, also outside psychopathological research, and more solid psychometric properties. Conclusion Most scales used to evaluate creativity have poor psychometric properties. The scattered methodology to assess creativity compromises the generalizability and validity of this research. The field should creatively develop new validated instruments.

AB  - Objective: There is widespread support for primary care to help address growing mental health care demands. Incentives and disincentives are widely used in the design of health care systems to help steer toward desired goals. The absence of a conceptual model to help understand the range of factors that influence the provision of primary mental health care inspired a scoping review of the literature. Understanding the incentives that promote and the disincentives that deter treatment for depression and anxiety in the primary care context will help to achieve goals of greater access to mental health care.
   Method: A review of the literature was conducted to answer the question, how are incentives and disincentives conceptualized in studies investigating the treatment of common mental disorders in primary care? A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Google Scholar was undertaken using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-stage methodological framework for scoping reviews.
   Results: We identified 27 studies. A range of incentives and disincentives influence the success of primary mental health care initiatives to treat depression and anxiety. Six types of incentives and disincentives can encourage or discourage treatment of depression and anxiety in primary care: attitudes and beliefs, training and core competencies, leadership, organizational, financial, and systemic.
   Conclusions: Understanding that there are 6 different types of incentives that influence treatment for anxiety and depression in primary care may help service planners who are trying to promote improved mental health care.

AB  - Objective: Up to one in five children experience mental health problems. Social and cultural factors may influence emergence of mental health problems. The 21st century has led to changes in many of these factors, but it is unclear whether rates of internalizing and externalizing problems have also changed in recent cohorts of young people.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken to locate cohort or population studies that examined changes in mental health of children over time, where participants were aged 18 years and under, and the time frame for change was at least 10 years, with data for at least one time point in the 21st century being statistically compared to at least one time point in the 20th century. Studies were reviewed for quality and outcome.
   Results: Nineteen studies met criteria for review. These included studies of toddlers, children, and adolescents. Seventeen studies examined internalizing problems, and 11 studies examined externalizing problems. For both children and toddlers, recent cohorts did not exhibit worsening of mental health symptoms. In adolescents, the burden of externalizing problems appear to be stable. However, the majority of studies report an increase in internalizing problems in adolescent girls. The findings for internalizing problems in boys were mixed.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that recent cohorts of adolescent girls are experiencing increases in internalizing symptoms compared to previous cohorts. Approaches for prevention and early intervention should be explored.

AB  - Light has profoundly influenced the evolution of life on earth. As widely appreciated, light enables us to generate images of our environment. However, light-through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)-also influences behaviours that are essential for our health and quality of life but are independent of image formation. These include the synchronization of the circadian clock to the solar day, tracking of seasonal changes and the regulation of sleep. Irregular light environments lead to problems in circadian rhythms and sleep, which eventually cause mood and learning deficits. Recently, it was found that irregular light can also directly affect mood and learning without producing major disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep. In this Review, we discuss the indirect and direct influence of light on mood and learning, and provide a model for how Light, the circadian clock and sleep interact to influence mood and cognitive functions.

AB  - Purpose of review
   In the field of global mental health, an enormous gap between what we know and what we do exists in the delivery of clinical care. Creative and effective strategies that surmount the barriers to provision of mental healthcare are essential to improve the lives of millions affected by mental illness. This article provides a review of three classes of innovative strategies currently being developed and implemented to diminish the mental health treatment gap globally.
   Recent findings
   This review provides recent evidence related to the feasibility of implementation and efficacy for the following three classes of innovation that show promise for building clinical capacity and expanding mental health coverage: integration of mental health services into primary care; expansion of human capacity through task sharing and training of nonspecialists; and innovative use of technological platforms to enhance access, cut costs, and reduce stigma.
   Summary
   The strategies outlined in this review hold great potential for enhancing mental health treatment services, and address some of the major barriers globally to accessing mental healthcare, such as scarcity of resources (infrastructure, capacity, and funding) and stigma. Despite much evidence supporting the efficacy of these models, thorough studies that test their feasibility, acceptability, utility, and effectiveness in various contexts, including low-income and middle-income countries, are required. Moreover, these innovations require social support and political will in order to be successfully implemented and scaled-up such that they have a meaningful impact on the burden of disease associated with mental illness worldwide.

AB  - In the last few decades, mental health research has increasingly provided evidence supporting the role of inflammation in pathogenesis, course and treatment of mental disorders. With such a steep incline of research, resulting in a wealth of emerged findings, it has become difficult to follow developments within the field. The present review sets out to present the recent developments and to give an overview of the inflammatory profiles of depression, psychosis and bipolar disorder, as well as variations within these disorders. Moreover, mediating factors such as social environment and childhood experience are discussed, both in terms of their potential in elucidating the complex interface between the inflammation and other closely related biological systems, as well as the possibly confounding impact of various lifestyle factors. Whilst many issues in this fascinating area of research remain to be fully understood and elaborated, all current evidence suggests that inflammation plays a key role in mental disorders and may open up novel avenues for clinical treatment.

AB  - Objective: To review the recent academic literature surrounding the prevalence, aetiopathology, associations and management of depression in chronic kidney disease (CKD), in order to provide a practical and up-to-date resource for clinicians.
   Methods: We conducted electronic searches of the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. The main search terms were: depression, mood disorders, depressive disorder, mental illness, in combination with kidney disease, renal insufficiency, dialysis, kidney failure. Separate searches were conducted regarding antidepressant use in CKD.
   Results: A number of recent, large and well-conducted studies have confirmed markedly raised rates of depression amongst those with CKD, with meta-analysis suggesting the prevalence of interview-defined depression to be approximately 20%. The interactions between depression and CKD are complex, bidirectional and multifactorial. Depression in CKD has been shown to be associated with multiple poor outcomes, including increased mortality and hospitalisation rates, as well as poorer treatment compliance and quality of life. Clinical evaluation of depression in patients with CKD can be challenging; however, once a diagnosis is made, a range of treatment modalities can be considered.
   Conclusions: Depression is common in CKD and is associated with a significant risk of adverse outcomes. Given the importance of this issue, there is now an urgent need for well-conducted randomised trials of interventions for depression in CKD in order to provide information on the safety and efficacy of treatments.

AB  - BackgroundResources for supporting children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders continue to be scarce. Economics research can identify current patterns of expenditure, and help inform allocation of treatment and support resources between competing needs or uses.
   Scope and methodsThe aim was to identify the costs of supporting children and adolescents, the economic impacts of childhood psychiatric disorders in adulthood and any new evidence on the cost-effectiveness of interventions. An electronic search of databases (including PubMed, Medline and Psychinfo) identified peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2005 and 2012.
   FindingsSixty-seven papers provided data on support and treatment costs now or in the future, or cost-effectiveness analyses of services. Half the articles came from the United States. Most articles focussed on autism spectrum disorder (ASD; 23 articles), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n=15), conduct disorder (CD; n=7), and anxiety or depression (n=8).
   ConclusionOnly 14 studies used a cost perspective wider than health care; most included education costs (n=11), but only five included costs to the justice system. The number of studies estimating costs to the family has increased, particularly for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the United Kingdom, support costs for children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) appear to be lower than for those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although for the United States, the opposite may be true. Support costs for children and adolescents with ASD may be higher than both CD and ADHD. However, there were many differences between the samples and the methods employed making comparisons between studies difficult. Outcomes in adulthood include negative impacts on (mental) health, quality of life, public sector services, employment status and income. The evidence base is improving for child and adolescent psychiatric disorders, although only one full cost-effectiveness analysis was identified since the previous review published in 2012. However, we still do not know enough about the economic implications of support and treatment for specific disorders.

   BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, the healthcare system has become increasingly aware of how focus on healthcare environment might affect patient satisfaction. The focus on environmental design has become a field with great potential because of its possible impact on cost control while improving quality of care.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify current and past studies about evidence-based healthcare design. The following databases were searched: Medline/PubMed, Cinahl, and Embase. Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of built environment design interventions such as music, natural murals, and plants in relation to patients' health outcome.
   RESULTS: Built environment design aspects such as audio environment and visual environment had a positive influence on patients' health outcomes. Specifically the studies indicated a decrease in patients' anxiety, pain, and stress levels when exposed to certain built environment design interventions.
   CONCLUSIONS: The built environment, especially specific audio and visual aspects, seems to play an important role in patients' outcomes, making hospitals a better healing environment for patients.

AB  - Background: In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, millions of households have been left with debts that they are unable to manage. Indebtedness may impair the wellbeing of those affected by it for years to come. This systematic review focuses on the long-term consequences of indebtedness on health.
   Methods: The method used in the paper is a systematic review. First, bibliographic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles. Second, the references and citations of the included articles were searched for additional articles.
   Results: The results from our sample of 33 peer-reviewed studies demonstrate serious health effects related to indebtedness. Individuals with unmet loan payments had suicidal ideation and suffered from depression more often than those without such financial problems. Unpaid financial obligations were also related to poorer subjective health and health-related behaviour. Debt counselling and other programmes to mitigate debt-related stress are needed to alleviate the adverse effects of indebtedness on health.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that indebtedness has serious effects on health.

AB  - Severe mental illness (SMI) is a broad category that includes schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe depression. Both genetic disposition and environmental exposures play important roles in the development of SMI. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the roles of genetic and environmental factors depend on each other. Gene-environment interactions may underlie the paradox of strong environmental factors for highly heritable disorders, the low estimates of shared environmental influences in twin studies of SMI, and the heritability gap between twin and molecular heritability estimates. Sons and daughters of parents with SMI are more vulnerable to the effects of prenatal and postnatal environmental exposures, suggesting that the expression of genetic liability depends on environment. In the last decade, gene-environment interactions involving specific molecular variants in candidate genes have been identified. Replicated findings include an interaction between a polymorphism in the AKT1 gene and cannabis use in the development of psychosis and an interaction between the length polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene and childhood maltreatment in the development of persistent depressive disorder. Bipolar disorder has been underinvestigated, with only a single study showing an interaction between a functional polymorphism in the BDNF gene and stressful life events triggering bipolar depressive episodes. The first systematic search for gene-environment interactions has found that a polymorphism in CTNNA3 may sensitize the developing brain to the pathogenic effect of cytomegalovirus in utero, leading to schizophrenia in adulthood. Strategies for genome-wide investigations will likely include coordination between epidemiological and genetic research efforts, systematic assessment of multiple environmental factors in large samples, and prioritization of genetic variants.

AB  - Background
   It is unclear how many children and adolescents develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after trauma.
   Aims
   To determine the incidence of PTSD in trauma-exposed children and adolescents as assessed with well-established diagnostic interviews and to examine potential moderators of the estimate.
   Method
   A systematic literature search identified 72 peer-reviewed articles on 43 independent samples (n=3563). Samples consisting only of participants seeking or receiving mental health treatment were excluded. Main analyses involved pooled incidence estimates and meta-analyses of variance.
   Results
   The overall rate of PTSD was 15.9% (95% CI 11.5-21.5), which varied according to the type of trauma and gender. Least at risk were boys exposed to non-interpersonal trauma (8.4%, 95% Cl 4.7-14.5), whereas girls exposed to interpersonal trauma showed the highest rate (32.9%, 95% CI 19.8-49.3). No significant difference was found for the choice of assessment interview or the informant of the assessment.
   Conclusions
   Research conducted with the best available assessment instruments shows that a significant minority of children and adolescents develop PTSD after trauma exposure, with those exposed to interpersonal trauma and girls at particular risk. The estimates provide a benchmark for DSM-5 and ICD-11.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that has a significant impact not only in the patient but also in the entire family as well. Caregivers assume almost the totality of the patient care. This responsibility exposes caregivers to an intense burden with negative consequences for them and the rest of the family system. This is an updated review of existing literature about burden on families with schizophrenia patients. Method: An electronic search of articles from MEDLINE, EMBASE, APA, EBSCO, and Cochrane databases was conducted for articles published between 2008 and 2013. Results: A systematization of information and frequency analysis revealed the existence of eight factors related to burden that were present in almost all the reviewed literature: Programs of family treatment, Ethnic group, Expressed Emotion, Stress and Burden, Preoccupations of the caregiver, Kind of caregiver, Social networks, Social support, Finances and Coping Strategies. Conclusions: This study supports the statements of different theories reflecting the complexity of schizophrenia caregivers' burden and these, in turn, may be related to the above factors.

AB  - Background: Individuals with serious mental illness are at a higher risk of physical ill health. Mortality rates are at least twice those of the general population with higher levels of cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, diabetes, and respiratory illness. Although genetics may have a role in the physical health problems of these patients, lifestyle and environmental factors such as levels of smoking, obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity also play a prominent part.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of exercise interventions on individuals with serious mental illness. Searches were made in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Biological Abstracts on Ovid, and The Cochrane Library (January 2009, repeated January 2013) through to February 2013.
   Results: Eight RCTs were identified in the systematic search. Six compared exercise versus usual care. One study assessed the effect of a cycling programme versus muscle strengthening and toning exercises. The final study compared the effect of adding specific exercise advice and motivational skills to a simple walking programme. The review found that exercise improved levels of exercise activity (n = 13, standard mean difference [SMD] 1.81, CI 0.44 to 3.18, p = 0.01). No beneficial effect was found on negative (n = 84, SMD = -0.54, CI -1.79 to 0.71, p = 0.40) or positive symptoms of schizophrenia (n = 84, SMD = -1.66, CI -3.78 to 0.45, p = 0.12). No change was found on body mass index compared with usual care (n = 151, SMD = -0.24, CI -0.56 to 0.08, p = 0.14), or body weight (n = 77, SMD = 0.13, CI -0.32 to 0.58, p = 0.57). No beneficial effect was found on anxiety and depressive symptoms (n = 94, SMD = -0.26, CI -0.91 to 0.39, p = 0.43), or quality of life in respect of physical and mental domains.
   Conclusions: This systematic review showed that exercise therapies can lead to a modest increase in levels of exercise activity but overall there was no noticeable change for symptoms of mental health, body mass index, and body weight.

AB  - Objective: Depression and anxiety are common in diabetes and are associated with lower diabetes self-care adherence. How this occurs is unclear. Our systematic review explored the relationship between cognitive illness representations and poor emotional health and their combined association with diabetes self-care.
   Methods: Medline, Psycinfo, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched from inception to June 2013. Data on associations between cognitive illness representations, poor emotional health, and diabetes self-care were extracted. Random effects meta-analysis was used to test the relationship between cognitive illness representations and poor emotional health. Their combined effect on diabetes self-care was narratively evaluated.
   Results: Nine cross-sectional studies were included. Increased timeline cyclical, consequences, and seriousness beliefs were associated with poorer emotional health symptoms. Lower perceived personal control was associated with increased depression and anxiety, but not mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms. Remaining cognitive illness representation domains had mixed statistically significant and non-significant relationships across emotional states or were measured only once. Effect sizes ranged from small to large (r = +/- 0.20 to 0.51). Two studies explored the combined effects of cognitions and emotions on diabetes self-care. Both showed that cognitive illness representations have an independent effect on diabetes self-care, but only one study found that depression has an independent effect also.
   Conclusions: Associations between cognitive illness representations and poor emotional health were in the expected direction negative diabetes perceptions were associated with poorer emotional health. Few studies examined the relative effects of cognitions and emotions on diabetes self-care. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify directional pathways. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To determine whether depression and anxiety in adulthood are associated with abuse exposure in childhood.
   A search of PUBMED, EMBASE and PSYCHINFO databases (2002-2012) was supplemented by hand searches of bibliographies of articles and reviews. We included studies contrasting abuse exposure vs. no-abuse exposure before age 16 years to depression and anxiety after age 16 years. Data on sample and exposure and outcome instruments, covariates and odds ratios (ORs) with the respective 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were extracted. Combined ORs and 95 % CI were calculated using random effects models. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I (2) test.
   Inclusion criteria were met by 19 studies with 115,579 study participants, for assessing depression (n = 14) and anxiety (n = 13). The combined ORs for depression were 2.04 (95 % CI: 1.65-2.53) for sexual abuse and 1.49 (95 % CI: 1.29-1.72) for physical abuse. The combined ORs for anxiety were 2.52 (95 % CI: 2.12-2.98) for sexual abuse and 1.70 (95 % CI: 1.33-2.18) for physical abuse.
   High levels of depression, anxiety and distress are reported in adults exposed to childhood sexual and physical abuse. These findings require increased awareness for the potential needs of adults exposed to child abuse and public health interventions to prevent child abuse.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the article is to examine the hypothesis that cognitive and behavioural processes that maintain various mental disorders are common across these disorders. The practical implication of such an approach to psychopathology will be illuminated in the context of acceptance and commitment therapy. Background: Mental disorders are traditionally perceived and classified as separate diagnostic categories, analogous to somatic disorders. In the field of psychiatry categorical approach faces serious challenges, such as frequent comorbidity. A growing body of empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that common processes may maintain various mental disorders. Studies have shown a strong correlation of experiential avoidance with several measures of psychopathology. These findings single out experiential avoidance as an important transdiagnostic process present in numerous mental health problems. Conclusions: Grouping symptoms into diagnostic categories may be a useful approach as long as separate units are results of separate pathological processes. An alternative way of diagnostic assessment consists in identifying and measuring processes that lead to psychopathology, regardless of how they manifest at the level of symptoms. The authors of the article propose to unite both approaches into one diagnostic system which could provide clinicians with both possibilities to categorize symptoms and to measure transdiagnostic processes. Such a system would facilitate the choice of therapeutic strategies, especially within the area of psychosocial interventions. In this context, experiential avoidance seems to emerge as a promising candidate for the basic functional dimension of psychopathology. (C) 2014 Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology.

AB  - Background Globally, adults aged 65 years or older will increase from 516 million in 2009 to an estimated 1.53 billion in 2050. Due to substance use at earlier ages that may continue into later life, and ageing-related changes in medical conditions, older substance users are at risk for substance-related consequences.
   Methods MEDLINE and PsychInfo databases were searched using keywords: alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, drug misuse, substance use disorder, prescription drug abuse, and substance abuse. Using the related-articles link, additional articles were screened for inclusion. This review focused on original studies published between 2005 and 2013 to reflect recent trends in substance use disorders. Studies on psychiatric comorbidity were also reviewed to inform treatment needs for older adults with a substance use disorder.
   Results Among community non-institutionalized adults aged 50+ years, about 60% used alcohol, 3% used illicit drugs and 1-2% used nonmedical prescription drugs in the past year. Among adults aged 50+, about 5% of men and 1.4% of women had a past-year alcohol use disorder. Among alcohol users, about one in 14 users aged 50-64 had a past-year alcohol use disorder vs one in 30 elder users aged 65+. Among drug users aged 50+, approximately 10-12% had a drug use disorder. Similar to depressive and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders were among the common psychiatric disorders among older adults. Older drug users in methadone maintenance treatment exhibited multiple psychiatric or medical conditions. There have been increases in treatment admissions for illicit and prescription drug problems in the United States.
   Conclusions Substance use in late life requires surveillance and research, including tracking substance use in the racial/ethnic populations and developing effective care models to address comorbid medical and mental health problems.

AB  - The aim of the present review was to examine objective and subjective burdens in primary caregivers (usually family members) of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and to list which symptoms of the patients are considered more burdensome by the caregivers. In order to provide a critical review about caregiver's burden in patients with bipolar disorder, we performed a detailed PubMed, BioMedCentral, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, Elsevier Science Direct and Cochrane Library search to identify all papers and book chapters in English published during the period between 1963 and November 2011. The highest levels of distress were caused by the patient's behavior and the patient's role dysfunction (work, education and social relationships). Furthermore, the caregiving role compromises other social roles occupied by the caregiver, becoming part of the heavy social cost of bipolar affective disorder. There is a need to better understand caregivers' views and personal perceptions of the stresses and demands arising from caring for someone with BD in order to develop practical appropriate interventions and to improve the training of caregivers.

Notwithstanding the need for much additional research with larger and more diverse samples, much has been learned about this unique population. A partial demographic portrait of gay men and lesbians in the second half of life is offered, along with research describing their health behaviors and conditions, concerns about aging, and social support needs and experiences. Gender and age-cohort differences are noted as are the costs and consequences of a lifetime of stigma and discrimination and the potential for further study in this and related fields.

AB  - Objectives: This paper systematically reviews all outcome studies of patients with mood disorders treated prior to the widespread use of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and major tranquillizers. The aim is to estimate recovery and sustained recovery rates and to provide some evidence about the efficacy of modern drug treatments in changing the long-term outcome of mood disorders.
   Methods: MEDLINE and PSYCHINFO searches for studies on mood disorders published prior to 1970 were performed. Most studies were obtained by hand searching and extensive cross referencing. Information was independently extracted by the two authors.
   Results: A total of 29 relevant articles were obtained. The studies reviewed over 14,000 patients in total. Patients were mainly inpatients with a predominance of females. The majority of patients suffered from depression. The cohorts were followed up for 1-30 years. The median rate of recovery was 69% (range 17-91%). The time to recovery was generally several months. The median rate of recovering and remaining well was 51% (range 21-67%).
   Conclusions: The median rate of recovery is less than modern cohorts and the time to recovery longer. However, the rate of recovering and remaining well appears high compared to modern cohorts, although this result may reflect methodological issues. This review provides no support to the belief that pharmacological treatments have resulted in an improvement in the long-term outcome of patients with mood disorders.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs with a high prevalence among mental illnesses. MDD patients experience sadness and hopelessness, with blunted affective reactivity. However, such depressive episodes are also key symptoms in depressive disorders, like Bipolar Disorder (BPD) or Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Moreover, depressive symptoms can also be found in healthy individuals, but are experienced as less severe or for a shorter duration than in patients. Here, it is aimed to summarize studies investigating odor perception in depression, including depressive states in healthy individuals and patient populations. Odor perception in depression has been assessed with psychophysical methods (olfactory sensitivity, odor identification, and discrimination), and odor ratings (intensity, emotional valence, familiarity). In addition, some studies investigated affective reactions to odors, and physiological and anatomical correlates of odor perception in depression. The summary reveals that MDD is associated with reduced olfactory sensitivity. However, odor identification and discrimination scores seem to be unaffected by depression. The reduced olfactory sensitivity might be associated with a reduced ability to encode olfactory information and a reduced volume of the olfactory bulb. While similar processes seem to occur in healthy individuals experiencing depressive states, they have not been observed in BPD or SAD patients. However, in order to conclude that the reduced olfactory sensitivity is directly linked to depression, it is suggested that studies should implement control measures of cognitive performances or perceptual abilities in other stimulus modalities. It is concluded that the reduced olfactory performance in MDD patients seems to be disorder-, modality-, and test-specific, and that the application of an appropriate olfactory and cognitive test-battery might be highly useful in the differential diagnosis of MDD.

AB  - At least 25 - 30% of patients with cancer and an even higher percentage of patients in an advanced phase of illness meet the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, including depression, anxiety, stress-related syndromes, adjustment disorders, sleep disorders and delirium. A number of studies have accumulated over the last 35 years on the use of psychotropic drugs as a pillar in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Major advances in psycho-oncology research have also shown the efficacy of psychotropic drugs as adjuvant treatment of cancer-related symptoms, such as pain, hot flushes, pruritus, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. The knowledge about pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, clinical use, safety, side effects and efficacy of psychotropic drugs in cancer care is essential for an integrated and multidimensional approach to patients treated in different settings, including community-based centres, oncology, and palliative care. A search of the major databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycLIT, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library) was conducted in order to summarize relevant data concerning the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for cancer-related psychiatric disorders in cancer patients across the trajectory of the disease.

AB  - Allopregnanolone, a neuroactive steroid derived from progesterone, is synthesized within the nervous tissue, by means of specific enzymes. Contrary to progesterone and its first metabolite dihydroprogesterone, allopregnanolone is able to interact with GABA-A receptor and not with the classical progesterone receptor. This suggests that the effect of progesterone administration may be due to activation of progesterone receptor, or of GABA-A receptor, or both. However, this is rarely considered in the experimental studies. Here we summarize and discuss the hot topics involving the actions of allopregnanolone within the nervous tissue. One major role of this neuroactive steroid is neuroprotection in case of lesion, ischemia or peripheral neuropathies (i.e., diabetes). In addition, allopregnanolone may reduce the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer, Parkinson, Niemann-Pick type C, multiple sclerosis) in animal models and now translational studies are developed for its therapeutic use. Allopregnanolone may exert a beneficial effect also in case of neuropathic pain and it is also a potential candidate for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. Finally, this neuroactive steroid seems to have important physiological roles in the early differentiation of some neural circuits (in particular at hippocampal level), and to reduce stress during pregnancy. In conclusion, it appears that allopregnanolone is a key regulator of physiological functions and may have interesting therapeutic perspectives for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The hypocretin system is constituted by a small group of hypothalamic neurons with widespread connections within the entire central nervous system producing two neuropeptides involved in several key physiological functions such as the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, motor control, autonomic functions, metabolism, feeding behavior, and reward. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a neurological disorder regarded as a disease model for the selective hypocretin system damage, and also shares several psychopatological traits and comorbidities with psychiatric disorders. We reviewed the available literature on the involvement of the hypocretin system in psychiatric nosography. Different evidences such as cerebrospinal hypocretin-1 levels, genetic polymorphisms of the neuropeptides or their receptors, response to treatments, clinical, experimental and functional data directly or indirectly linked the hypocretin system to schizophrenia, mood, anxiety and eating disorders, as well as to addiction. Future genetic and pharmacological studies will disentangle the hypocretin system role in the field of psychiatry.

AB  - The clinical efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT) has undergone extensive study and review. Recently, researchers have studied the effects of this treatment on brain metabolic or synaptic activity, but the collective findings have never been reviewed. The objective of this review was to describe the findings of all neuroimaging studies of any form of PDT treatment. An extensive literature search through databases along with surveying of research groups were undertaken to acquire all available published studies. Eleven series were included in the final sample, consisting of 2 randomized controlled trials, 5 controlled trials and 4 case series, altogether involving 210 people: 94 healthy controls and 116 people with mood disorders, panic disorder, somatoform disorders and borderline personality disorder. A variety of neuroimaging techniques were used to examine regional metabolic activity and synaptic neurotransmission before and after treatment. The common finding was normalization of synaptic or metabolic activity in limbic, midbrain and prefrontal regions, occurring in association with improved clinical outcomes. PDT has demonstrable effects on brain function in diverse clinical populations as evidenced by a modest group of mixed neuroimaging studies. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Art therapy has been recognized as beneficial and effective since first described by Adrian Hill in 1942. Even before this time, art therapy was utilized for moral reinforcement and psychoanalysis. Art therapy aids patients with, but not limited to, chronic illness, physical challenges, and cancer in both pediatric and adult scenarios. Although effective in patient care, the practice of art therapy is extremely underutilized, especially in suburban areas. While conducting our own study in northeastern Ohio, USA, we found that only one out of the five inpatient institutions in the suburban area of Mahoning County, Ohio, that we contacted provided continuous art therapy to it's patients. In the metropolitan area of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, only eight of the twenty- two inpatient institutions in the area provided art therapy. There could be many reasons as to why art therapy is not frequently used in these areas, and medical institutions in general. The cause of this could be the amount of research done on the practice. Although difficult to conduct formal research on such a broad field, the American Art Therapy Association has succeeded in doing such, with studies showing improvement of the patient groups emotionally and mentally in many case types.

AB  - Background: The identification of the gene mutation causing Huntington disease has raised hopes for new treatments to ease symptoms and slow functional decline. As such, there has been a push towards designing efficient pharmacological trials (i. e., drug trials), especially with regard to selecting outcomes measures that are both brief and sensitive to changes across the course of the disease, from subtle prodromal changes, to more severe end-stage changes.
   Objectives: Recently, to aid in efficient development of newHDresearch studies, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) published recommendations for measurement selection in HD. While these recommendations are helpful, many of the recommended measures have little published data in HD. As such, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify the most common outcomes measures used in HD clinical trials.
   Methods: Major medical databases, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were used to identify peer-reviewed journal articles in English from 2001 through April 2013; 151 pharmacological trials were identified.
   Results: The majority of HD clinical trials employed clinician-reported outcomes measures (93%); patient reported outcome measures (11%) and observer reported outcome measures (3%) were used with much less frequency.
   Conclusions: We provide a review of the most commonly used measures across these trials, compare these measures to the clinical recommendations made by the NINDS working groups, and provide recommendations for selecting measures for future clinical trials that meet the Food and Drug Administration standards.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization estimates that 10-12 million new syphilis infections occur each year. Without treatment, years to decades after initial infection, 30% of affected individuals may develop tertiary syphilis, which can manifest as neurosyphilis. The aim of this review is to evaluate the research literature examining the psychopathological manifestations of psychosis in association with neurosyphilis. Method: The authors performed a systematic electronic search for published studies (1995-2012). The following databases were used: Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library as well as the search engines Scopus and Google Scholar. Results: 61 articles were used for detailed analysis. Psychotic symptoms due to neurosyphilis are numerous and can inform differential diagnosis for many psychotic manifestations according to ICD-10 or DSM-IV. Conclusion: Due to our results, current epidemiological data, and the difficulties in differential diagnosis of neurosyphilis, routine screening tests are still recommended in the psychiatric field. Long-term psychiatric input, with periodic syphilis titre controls, seems indicated in individuals affected by neurosyphilis with psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, individuals with mental health problems may be at higher risk of acquiring syphilis. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent, debilitating, and costly of all illnesses worldwide. Investigators have made considerable progress in elucidating psychological and biological correlates of MDD; however, far less is known about factors that are implicated in risk for depression. Given the high risk for MDD associated with a family history of depression, investigators have worked to understand both the effects of parental depression on offspring and the mechanisms that might underlie familial risk for MDD. In this article, we describe the evolution of investigators' understanding of the psychobiological functioning of children of depressed parents, and we present recent findings concerning cognitive and neural aspects of risk for MDD using our high-risk sample as a context and foundation for this discussion. We integrate these data in a conceptualization of mechanisms underlying risk for depression, focusing on the constructs of emotion dysregulation and stress reactivity. Recognizing the 25-year anniversary of the Association for Psychological Science, we place this presentation in the context of the past 25 years of research on depression. We conclude by discussing the significance of emotion dysregulation and stress reactivity for studying risk for depression, for developing approaches to prevent MDD, and for moving theory and research in this field forward.

AB  - Objectives:There is evidence of baseline respiratory abnormalities in panic disorder (PD), but whether they are specific to PD remains unclear. To investigate this issue, we meta-analyzed results from studies comparing baseline respiratory and hematic variables between subjects with PD and subjects with other anxiety disorders. Methods: A literature search in bibliographic databases was performed. Fixed-effects models were applied. Several moderator analyses and publication bias diagnostics were performed. Results: We found: (1) significantly lower mean end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (et-pCO(2)) in subjects with PD than in those with social phobia (SP) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and (2) higher mean respiratory rate, lower venous et-pCO(2) and HCO3- concentration in subjects with PD than in those with SP. No publication bias was found. Conclusions: Subjects with PD show a condition of baseline hyperventilation when compared to subjects with SP or GAD. Hematic variables suggest that the hyperventilation may be chronic. These results support the idea that baseline respiratory abnormalities are specific to PD pathophysiology. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these abnormalities are related to a malfunction of the respiratory system or to specific cognitive/emotional/behavioral factors in this population.

AB  - Background:The aims of the present study were to explore whether symptoms in different anxiety disorders are associated with Cloninger's model temperament dimensions novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), reward dependence and persistence compared with control subjects in clinical samples of adults or late adolescents. Method: Literature search in the following databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, Psycinfo and PsycArticles. Systematic review, grading the level of evidence and meta-analysis for each disorder by comparing the temperament dimension scores between patient and control samples in single studies. Results: A total of 40 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were conducted on a total of 24 studies focusing on panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The primary finding was a constant and clinically marked positive association between the HA temperament dimension and symptoms of PD, SAD and OCD, with a most marked effect in SAD, and a moderate effect in OCD and PD. Second, less marked and clinically marginal associations between NS score and SAD and OCD (negative associations), but no associations with PD were observed. The meta-analyses revealed heterogeneity between the results of individual studies, especially in the analyses including SAD and OCD. Conclusions: PD, SAD and OCD share a marked and state-dependent avoidant behavioral pattern, which is common for all anxiety disorders. However, PD showed a different pattern of arousal to novel stimuli from that of SAD and OCD. The findings are state dependent and based on cross-sectional studies. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Despite enormous progress in defining, diagnosing and treating mental disorders, EU health systems face a mounting challenge in responding to 'unmet need'. Mental illnesses produce a societal burden that exceeds that for either cancers or cardiovascular conditions. Leveraging advances in science and medicine to make available new innovative medicines is a key component in responding to this challenge. The dominant paradigm has been, is and will continue to be, one of incremental progress. Better medicines for depression, anxiety and psychoses in the working age population would add great value to patients and improve labour productivity. But psychotropic medicines face exceptional challenges in demonstrating their added value, due to uncertainty in patient diagnosis, selecting treatments and ensuring adherence. Also, there are major difficulties in estimating costs.
   Advances in understanding brain processes, identiying biomarkers and neuro-imaging techniques promise far more effective 'diagnostic-therapeutic' treatments and improved patient outcomes in the future. Currently there are valuable incremental innovations in late development, which may well fail to recover their R&D costs, because of very low reimbursed prices. This will send a signal to innovators not to persist with product development in this area.
   Recently several leading companies have withdrawn from R&D in these mental disorders. This is a worrying development since building the capabilities to succeed in any disease sector takes many years and, once dismantled, they cannot easily be re-established.
   Three policy interventions could improve innovation incentives:
   i) Invest more money in research
   ii) Streamline development processes to reduce costs and risks
   iii) Restrain the current trend towards severely limiting market rewards for incremental advances.
   Further 'push' incentives under i) and streamlining under ii) alone will not reverse the decline in investment incentives. An EU consensus, based upon an innovation model which encompasses the Research, Development and Market phases as a single cyclical process, which addresses the weak 'market pull incentives' under iii) is needed. There is a very real risk that without such an integrated approach to policy reforms, innovation in psychotropic medicines will become a 'desert' in the same way that it did for antibiotics in the 1990's.

AB  - Clinical evidence suggests that depression and trauma predispose the subject to panic. Accordingly, here we examined the late effects of uncontrollable stress, a presumptive model of depression and/or traumatic disorder, on panic-like behaviors evoked by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG). Changes in anxiety and depression were also assessed in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and forced-swimming test (FST), respectively. Rats with electrodes in the DPAG were subjected to a 7-day shuttle-box one-way escape yoked training with foot-shocks either escapable (ES) or inescapable (IS). The day after the end of one-way escape training, rats were trained in a two-way escape novel task (test-session) to ascertain the effectiveness of uncontrollable stress. DPAG stimulations were carried out in an open field, both before the escape training and 2 and 7days after it, and EPM and FST were performed on the 8th and 10th days afterwards, respectively. Controls were either trained with fictive shocks (FS) or subjected to intracranial stimulations only. Although the ES rats performed significantly better than the IS group in the two-way escape task, groups did not differ with respect to either the anxiety or depression scores. Unexpectedly, however, IS rats showed a marked attenuation of DPAG-evoked freezing and flight behaviors relative to both the ES and FS groups, 2 and 7days after one-way escape training. The conjoint inhibition of passive (freezing) and active (flight) defensive behaviors suggests that IS inhibits a DPAG in-built motivational system that may be implicated in depressed patients' difficulties in coping with daily-life stress.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThis review examines the conceptualization of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), its epidemiology and efforts to better understand the relationships between OCPD and other conditions.Recent findingsThe alternative Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders conceptualization of OCPD is radically different in that it combines categorical and dimensional diagnostic approaches and introduces a hierarchy of diagnostic criteria. OCPD is one of the most common personality disorders in the general population. The relationship between OCPD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is important, but to a large extent obfuscated by the overlap between their diagnostic criteria. Frequent changes in the OCPD diagnostic criteria make it difficult to ascertain the true' relationship between OCPD and OCD. It is not uncommon for OCPD to occur with anorexia nervosa, depression, hypochondriasis, certain other personality disorders and Parkinson's disease, but further research is necessary to understand the implications of these links.SummaryOCPD is yet to be conceptualized consistently and in the manner that would make a clear and well supported distinction between its core and peripheral features. Future studies need to separate a genuine from overlap-driven co-occurrence of OCPD and other conditions, as that would give a better insight into the way in which OCPD relates to other disorders.

AB  - To date, there is rapidly increasing evidence for host-microbe interaction at virtually all levels of complexity, ranging from direct cell-to-cell communication to extensive systemic signalling, and involving various organs and organ systems, including the central nervous system. As such, the discovery that differential microbial composition is associated with alterations in behaviour and cognition has significantly contributed to establishing the microbiota-gut-brain axis as an extension of the well-accepted gut-brain axis concept. Many efforts have been focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. There is also a growing appreciation of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping brain and behaviour. However, the role of epigenetics in informing host-microbe interactions has received little attention to date. This is despite the fact that there are many plausible routes of interaction between epigenetic mechanisms and the host-microbiota dialogue. From this new perspective we put forward novel, yet testable, hypotheses. Firstly, we suggest that gut-microbial products can affect chromatin plasticity within their host's brain that in turn leads to changes in neuronal transcription and eventually alters host behaviour. Secondly, we argue that the microbiota is an important mediator of gene-environment interactions. Finally, we reason that the microbiota itself may be viewed as an epigenetic entity. In conclusion, the fields of (neuro)epigenetics and microbiology are converging at many levels and more interdisciplinary studies are necessary to unravel the full range of this interaction.

AB  - Objective: To review the current evidence about psychiatric symptoms in Wilson's disease (WD).
   Method: We searched Ovid, PsychInfo, CINHAL and PubMed databases from May 1946 to May 2012 using the key words Wilson('s) disease in combination with psychiatry, psychiatric, psychosis, schizophrenia, depression, mania, bipolar, mood, anxiety, personality and behavior.
   Results: Psychiatric symptoms occur before, concurrent with or after the diagnosis and treatment for WD. Thirty to forty percent of patients have psychiatric manifestations at the time of diagnosis, and 20% had seen a psychiatrist prior to their WD diagnosis. When psychiatric symptoms preceded neurological or hepatic involvement, the average time between the psychiatric symptoms and the diagnosis of WD was 864.3 days. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in WD patients varies wildly (major depressive disorder, 4-47%; psychosis, 1.4-11.3%). Certain gene mutations of ATP7B may correlate with specific personality traits.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric manifestations represent a significant part of the clinical presentation of WD and can present at any point in the course of the illness. Psychiatric manifestations occurring without overt hepatic or neurologic involvement may lead to misdiagnosis. A better understanding of the psychiatric presentations in WD may provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review proposes a critical discussion of the latest studies investigating the presence of alexithymia in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and its relation to other psychological disorders. The focus is on the most relevant literature exploring the relationship between FM, a chronic pain syndrome, and alexithymia, an affective dysregulation, largely observed in psychosomatic diseases. The articles were selected from the Medline/Pubmed database using the search terms "Fibromyalgia," "Alexithymia," and "Psychological Distress." Of the seven studies fulfilling these criteria, one found no differences between FM patients and the control group, four found significant differences, with higher levels of alexithymia in the FM sample, while two showed unclear results. Overall, the majority of findings highlighted the high prevalence of alexithymia in FM patients. Future studies should clarify the role of alexithymia in FM, paying attention to two principal aspects: the use, as a control group, of patients with chronic pain conditions but a low psychosomatic component, and the use of other measures, in addition to the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), to assess alexithymia.

AB  - Objective: An aetiological link between acute infection and major depression has long been hypothesized, and is increasingly gaining recognition within contemporary literature. This review aims to examine the evidence for such a link, specifically between acute, self-limiting infection and major depression, and to summarize the current understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this link.
   Methods: Relevant articles were sourced via an online search of published literature from Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed using a variety of search terms including mood disorder, depression, infection and inflammation. Additionally, a search for articles from the bibliographies of retrieved papers was conducted.
   Results: Findings from retrospective studies suggest an association between infection and subsequent mood disturbance, including major depression. This association has been confirmed by studies employing prospective observational or experimental challenge designs. The available evidence supports a multifactorial basis of vulnerability towards major depression in the context of acute infection. Genetic, neuroendocrine, autonomic and psychosocial factors may interact to potentiate the likelihood of a severe and prolonged depressive response to an immunological stressor in some individuals.
   Conclusion: Mood disturbance is likely to have a host-protective role in the context of an acute sickness response to infection. However, this usually adaptive and reversible response may progress in some vulnerable individuals into a more sustained and severe pattern of behavioural and physiological changes of major depression. Further research is needed to delineate the factors that predispose, precipitate and perpetuate depression in the context of acute infective illness. Such insights will inform effective prevention and treatment strategies.

AB  - Considerable variation is evident in response to psychological therapies for mood and anxiety disorders. Genetic factors alongside environmental variables and gene-environment interactions are implicated in the etiology of these disorders and it is plausible that these same factors may also be important in predicting individual differences in response to psychological treatment. In this article, we review the evidence that genetic variation influences psychological treatment outcomes with a primary focus on mood and anxiety disorders. Unlike most past work, which has considered prediction of response to pharmacotherapy, this article reviews recent work in the field of therapygenetics, namely the role of genes in predicting psychological treatment response. As this is a field in its infancy, methodological recommendations are made and opportunities for future research are identified.

AB  - Objective: The aims of this review article are to present psychophysiological and behavioral pathways for the involvement of worry and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) upon cardiovascular function. The review will focus on persons with and without coronary heart disease (CHD), and encompass etiological and prognostic studies. Methods: Articles (1975-2011) reporting on GAD or worry affecting CHD prognosis or cardiovascular function were found using MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and PsychINFO database searches, and extracted to form a narrative review. Results: Available evidence in experimental and observational studies in CHD free samples consistently showed that worry was associated with diminished heart rate variability (HRV) and elevated heart rate. Worry and GAD were commonly associated with blood pressure and diagnosed hypertension or medication use in both disease-free and established CHD populations. No evidence was found to support worry being beneficial to cardiovascular function or conducive to health promoting behaviors. The literature indicated that measures of worry were associated with fatal and nonfatal CHD in seven etiological studies of initially disease-free individuals; however, females were underrepresented. Three studies reported that GAD was associated with poorer prognosis in establish CHD, independent of depression. The median GAD prevalence was 10.4% in 3266 patients across 15 studies, suggesting that GAD is marginally less common in CHD samples than is depression. Conclusions: A growing literature highlights the association between worry and development of CHD. The association between worry, GAD and CHD risk factors (e.g. blood pressure), and HRV are leading mechanisms of cardiopathogenesis that may affect cardiovascular function. Findings regarding worry and GAD in established CHD are less clear.

AB  - Exposure to natural and human-made disasters is associated with long-term health consequences, including for mental health. Parents who have lost children, particularly their only children, in any circumstances are also at increased risk of developing mental health problems. The aim of this study was to review the available evidence about the psychological and social consequences for parents who had faced these circumstances simultaneously through losing children in a disaster. Systematic searching of the English and Chinese language literatures about the psychological and social functioning of bereaved parents after disasters revealed that a small number of studies met inclusion criteria. The results showed that bereaved parents had more mental health problems than bereaved spouses and non-bereaved parents, and mothers appeared to be more vulnerable to mental health problems than fathers. Potential protective factors for bereaved parents' mental health included having psychological interventions, having adequate social support, seeing their children's bodies and having a subsequent baby. Although the literature was modest and methodologically diverse, there was a consistent finding that parents who have lost children in disasters were at high risk of suffering mental health problems, especially bereaved mothers. As there was little evidence, further studies are needed to understand the best advice and interventions to offer bereaved parents and provide enhanced mental health care of such bereaved populations after disasters.

AB  - Despite having relatively poor spatial and temporal resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has several methodological advantages compared with other non-invasive measurements of neural activation. For instance, the unique characteristics of NIRS give it potential as a tool for investigating the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in emotion processing. However, there are several obstacles in the application of NIRS to emotion research. In this mini-review, we discuss the findings of studies that used NIRS to assess the effects of PFC activation on emotion. Specifically, we address the methodological challenges of NIRS measurement with respect to the field of emotion research, and consider potential strategies for mitigating these problems. In addition, we show that two fields of research, investigating (i) biological predisposition influencing PFC responses to emotional stimuli and (ii) neural mechanisms underlying the bi-directional interaction between emotion and action, have much to gain from the use of NIRS. With the present article, we aim to lay the foundation for the application of NIRS to the above-mentioned fields of emotion research.

AB  - Streams and rivers in mediterranean-climate regions (med-rivers in med-regions) are ecologically unique, with flow regimes reflecting precipitation patterns. Although timing of drying and flooding is predictable, seasonal and annual intensity of these events is not. Sequential flooding and drying, coupled with anthropogenic influences make these med-rivers among the most stressed riverine habitat worldwide. Med-rivers are hotspots for biodiversity in all med-regions. Species in med-rivers require different, often opposing adaptive mechanisms to survive drought and flood conditions or recover from them. Thus, metacommunities undergo seasonal differences, reflecting cycles of river fragmentation and connectivity, which also affect ecosystem functioning. River conservation and management is challenging, and trade-offs between environmental and human uses are complex, especially under future climate change scenarios. This overview of a Special Issue on med-rivers synthesizes information presented in 21 articles covering the five med-regions worldwide: Mediterranean Basin, coastal California, central Chile, Cape region of South Africa, and southwest and southern Australia. Research programs to increase basic knowledge in less-developed med-regions should be prioritized to achieve increased abilities to better manage med-rivers.

AB  - Background: Bipolar disorder prevalence in primary care patients' with depression or other psychiatric complaints has been measured in, several studies but has not been systematically reviewed. Objective: To systematically review studies measuring bipolar disorder prevalence in primary care patients with depression or other psychiatric complaints'. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method in January 2013. We searched 7 databases using a comprehensive list of search terms. Included articles had a sample sire of 200 patients or more and assessed bipolar disorder using a structured clinical interview or bipolar screening questionnaire in adult primary care patients with a prior diagnosis of depression or had an alternate psychiatric complaint. Results: Our search yielded 5595 unique records, Seven cross-sectional studies met our inclusion criteria. The percentage of primary care patients' with bipolar disorder was measured in 4 studies of patients with depression, I study of patients with trauma exposure, I study of patients with any psychiatric complaint, and I study of patients with medically unexplained,symptoms. The percentage of patients with bipolar disorder ranged from 3.4%-9% in studies using structured clinical interviews and from 20.9%-30.8% A in studies using screening measures. Conclusions: Bipolar disorder likely occurs in 3%-9% of primary care patients with depression, a trauma exposure, medically unexplained symptoms, or a psychiatric complaint. Screening measures used for bipolar disorder detection overestimate the occurrence of bipolar disorder in primary care owing to,false positives.

AB  - Rivers in mediterranean regions are subject to hydrological extremes. They range from highly stable, perennial ground- or snow-fed systems to highly ephemeral, unpredictable ones in semi-arid environments. Spatial and temporal complexity inherent in these systems presents challenges for ecological status assessment and defining reference conditions, particularly as many areas have been extensively transformed through anthropogenic activities. Temporal variability driven by sequential and predictable, seasonal events of flooding and drying accentuates the need to take season and/or hydrological period into account. Intermittent streams, which are common in mediterranean regions (med-regions) and which have aquatic communities distinct from perennial streams, are often not incorporated in bioassessment and present distinct challenges. Med-regions are also known for their high biodiversity and rates of endemism, as well as large numbers of introduced species. Med-regions are expected to be among the most affected by global climate change and, in these systems, climate change is an additional driver influencing ecosystems that are already stressed. From this review it is evident that an understanding of responses of indices, metrics, and models to climate change in comparison to existing stresses, and the development of thermally specific bioassessment tools are needed for this region.

AB  - Streams and rivers in mediterranean-climate regions (med-rivers) are subjected to sequential, yet contrasting hydrologic disturbances of drying and flooding. Although seasonally predictable, these disturbances can vary in intensity and duration within and among mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions). Consequently, med-rivers differ in the permanence of their aquatic habitats. To persist, species have acquired matched resistance and resilience adaptations. They gain resistance either by enduring the stress or avoiding it. Community recovery (or resilience) is achieved with cessation of hydrologic stress that permits maximization of re-colonization and reproduction. Endurance strategies are usually disturbance-specific, but avoidance enables organisms to cope with both drying and flooding, and is the prevalent resistance strategy. Correspondingly, community persistence depends to a large extent on the integrity of refuges, an aspect that has so far been little explored. Existing information suggests that seasonal community succession becomes more pronounced with increasing aridity and declining water permanence. The invertebrate community in semi-arid med-rivers can therefore undergo succession through three to four identifiable assemblages, whereas in perennial streams the difference between wet and dry period assemblages is smaller. Community turnover is influenced by the intensity of the hydrologic disturbances and varies between wet and drought years.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed an explosion of evidence suggesting that many neurodegenerative diseases can be detected years, if not decades, earlier than previously thought. To date, these scientific advances have not provoked any parallel translational or clinical improvements. There is an urgency to capitalize on this momentum so earlier detection of disease can be more readily translated into improved health-related quality of life for families at risk for, or suffering with, neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measurement in neurodegenerative diseases and the importance of these "patient reported outcomes" for all clinical research. Next, we address HRQOL following early identification or predictive genetic testing in some neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, prion diseases, hereditary ataxias, Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and Wilson's disease. After a brief report of available direct-to-consumer genetic tests, we address the juxtaposition of earlier disease identification with assumed reluctance toward predictive genetic testing. Forty-one studies examining health-related outcomes following predictive genetic testing for neurodegenerative disease suggested that (a) extreme or catastrophic outcomes are rare; (b) consequences commonly include transiently increased anxiety and/or depression; (c) most participants report no regret; (d) many persons report extensive benefits to receiving genetic information; and (e) stigmatization and discrimination for genetic diseases are poorly understood and policy and laws are needed. Caution is appropriate for earlier identification of neurodegenerative diseases but findings suggest further progress is safe, feasible and likely to advance clinical care. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - River food webs are subject to two regimes of longitudinally varying ecological control: productivity and disturbance. Light-limited productivity increases as channels widen downstream. Time windows for growth, however, shrink as discharge increases, substrate particle size decreases, and the frequency of flood-driven bed mobilization increases downstream. Mediterranean rivers are periodically reset by hydrologic events with somewhat predictable timing. Typically, a rainy winter with high river discharge is followed by summer drought with little or no rainfall and slowly declining river flow. The magnitude and timing of winter floods and severity of subsequent summer drought can vary considerably from year to year, however. Episodic scouring floods or prolonged periods of drought are experienced as disturbances, stressors, or opportunities by river biota. The timing, duration, and intensity of these hydrologic controls affect performances of individuals, distribution and abundances of populations, and outcomes and consequences of species interactions. These interactions in turn determine how river food webs will assemble, develop, and reconfigure after disturbance. We discuss how spatial variation in solar radiation and spatial and temporal variations in disturbance affects river food webs under Mediterranean climate seasonality, focusing primarily on long-term observations in the Eel River of northwestern California, USA.

AB  - River and stream biofilms in mediterranean fluvial ecosystems face both extreme seasonality as well as arrhythmic fluctuations. The hydrological extremes (droughts and floods) impose direct changes in water availability but also in the quantity and quality of organic matter and nutrients that sustain the microbial growth. This review analyzes how these ecological pulses might determine unique properties of biofilms developing in mediterranean streams. The paper brings together data from heterotrophic and autotrophic community structure, and extracellular enzyme activities in biofilms in mediterranean streams. Mediterranean stream biofilms show higher use of peptides during the favorable period for epilithic algae development (spring), and preferential use of cellulose and hemicellulose in autumn as a response to allochthonous input. The drying process causes the reduction in bacterial production and chlorophyll biomass, but the rapid recovery of both autotrophs and heterotrophs with rewetting indicates their adaptability to fluctuations. Bacteria surviving the drought are mainly associated with sediment and leaf litter which serve as "humid refuges". Some algae and cyanobacteria show resistant strategies to cope with the drought stress. The resistance to these fluctuations is strongly linked to the streambed characteristics (e.g., sediment grain size, organic matter accumulation, nutrient content).

AB  - Riparian corridors in Mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions) are resource-rich habitats within water-limited, larger landscapes. However, little is known about how their plant communities compare functionally and compositionally across med-regions. In recent decades, research on these ecosystems has expanded in both geographic scope and disciplinary depth. We reviewed 286 riparian-vegetation studies across the five med-regions, and identified common themes, including: (1) high levels of plant biodiversity, structural complexity, and cross-region species introductions; (2) strong physical controls on plant demographics and community structure; and (3) intensive human impacts. European and Californian ecosystems were the most represented among the studies reviewed, but Australia, South Africa, and Chile had the greatest proportional increases in articles published since 2000. All med-regions support distinct riparian flora, although many genera have invaded across regions. Plant species in all regions are adapted to multiple abiotic stressors, including dynamic flooding and sediment regimes, seasonal water shortage, and fire. The most severe human impacts are from land-use conversion to agriculture, streamflow regulation, nutrient enrichment, and climate change. Current knowledge gaps and subjects for future research include cumulative impacts to small, ephemeral streams and large, regulated rivers, as well as understudied ecosystems in North Africa, the western Mediterranean basin, and Chile.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to review longitudinal and intervention studies examining the association between psychosocial work characteristics (eg, job demands, job control, and social support) and sleep quality. Our main research aims were to examine whether (i) psychosocial work characteristics are a predictor of sleep quality, and (ii) sleep quality, in turn, is a predictor of psychosocial work characteristics.
   Methods A systematic literature search resulted in 20 relevant papers, of which 16 were longitudinal studies and 3 were intervention studies (1 study was discussed in separate papers). To quantify results, we assessed the strength of evidence of all examined associations and subsequently evaluated the studies' research quality based on predefined quality criteria.
   Results One intervention and three longitudinal studies were categorized as being of high-quality. In longitudinal studies, we found consistent and strong evidence for a negative relation between job demands and sleep quality as well as evidence for a positive relation between job control and sleep quality. Other psychosocial work characteristics were examined in an insufficient number of (high-quality) studies. Moreover, both intervention studies as well as studies investigating reversed and reciprocal relations are rare, which further limits the possibility of drawing conclusions on causality.
   Conclusions Based on the current literature, it can be concluded that high job demands and low job control are predictors of poor sleep quality. More high-quality research is needed to examine the possible causal relationship between these and other psychosocial work characteristics with sleep quality, in addition to research focusing on reversed and reciprocal relations.

AB  - Relapse in patients with schizophrenia has devastating repercussions, including worsening symptoms, impaired functioning, cognitive deterioration and reduced quality of life. This progressive decline exacerbates the burden of illness on patients and their families. Relapse prevention is identified as a key therapeutic aim; however, the absence of widely accepted relapse definition criteria considerably hampers achieving this goal. We conducted a literature review in order to investigate the reporting of relapses and the validity of hospitalization as a proxy for relapse in patients with schizophrenia. The primary aim was to assess the range and validity of methods used to define relapse in observational or naturalistic settings. The secondary aim was to capture information on factors that predicted or influenced the risk of relapse. A structured search of the PubMed database identified articles that discussed relapse, and hospitalization as a proxy of relapse, in patients with schizophrenia. National and international guidelines were also reviewed. Of the 150 publications and guidelines identified, 87 defined relapse and 62% of these discussed hospitalization. Where hospitalization was discussed, this was as a proxy for, or a component of, relapse in the majority of cases. However, hospitalization duration and type varied and were not always well defined. Scales were used to define relapse in 53 instances; 10 different scales were used and multiple scales often appeared within the same definition. There were 95 references to factors that may drive relapse, including non-adherence to antipsychotic medication (21/95), stress/depression (11/95) and substance abuse (9/95). Twenty-five publications discussed the potential of antipsychotic therapy to reduce relapse rates-continuous antipsychotic therapy was associated with reduced frequency and duration of hospitalization. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as psychoeducation and cognitive behavioural therapy, were also commonly reported as factors that may reduce relapse. In conclusion, this review identified numerous factors used to define relapse. Hospitalization was the factor most frequently used and represents a useful proxy for relapse when reporting in a naturalistic setting. Several factors were reported to increase the risk of relapse, and observation of these may aid the identification of at-risk patients.

AB  - Suicidality is exceedingly prevalent in pain patients. Although the pathophysiology of this link remains unclear, it may be potentially related to the partial congruence of physical and emotional pain systems. The latter system's role in suicide is also conspicuous during setbacks and losses sustained in the context of social attachments. Here we propose a model based on the neural pathways mediating reward and anti-reward (i.e., allostatic adjustment to recurrent activation of the reward circuitry); both are relevant etiologic factors in pain, suicide and social attachments. A comprehensive literature search on neurobiology of pain and suicidality was performed. The collected articles were critically reviewed and relevant data were extracted and summarized within four key areas: (1) physical and emotional pain, (2) emotional pain and social attachments, (3) pain-and suicide-related alterations of the reward and anti-reward circuits as compared to addiction, which is the premier probe for dysfunction of these circuits and (4) mechanistically informed treatments of co-occurring pain and suicidality. Pain-, stress- and analgesic drugs-induced opponent and proponent states of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways may render reward and anti-reward systems vulnerable to sensitization, cross-sensitization and aberrant learning of contents and contexts associated with suicidal acts and behaviors. These findings suggest that pain patients exhibit alterations in the brain circuits mediating reward (depressed function) and anti-reward (sensitized function) that may affect their proclivity for suicide and support pain and suicidality classification among other "reward deficiency syndromes" and a new proposal for "enhanced anti-reward syndromes". We suggest that interventions aimed at restoring the balance between the reward and anti-reward networks in patients with chronic pain may help decreasing their suicide risk.

AB  - Objective Prevention strategies have made a major contribution to the considerable successes in reductions in cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality seen in recent decades. However, in the field of psychiatry, similar population-level initiatives in the prevention of common mental disorders, depression and anxiety, are noticeably lacking. This paper aims to provide a brief overview of the existing literature on the topic of the prevention of common mental disorders and a commentary regarding the way forward for prevention research and implementation.
   Methods This commentary considers what we currently know, what we might learn from the successes and failures of those working in prevention of other high prevalence health conditions, and where we might go from here. Taking cognisance of previous preventive models, this commentary additionally explores new opportunities for preventive approaches to the common mental disorders.
   Results The consensus from a large body of evidence supports the contention that interventions to prevent mental disorders across the lifespan can be both effective and cost-effective. However, funding for research in the area of prevention of common mental disorders is considerably lower than that for research in the areas of treatment, epidemiology and neurobiology. Thus, there is a clear imperative to direct funding towards prevention research to redress this imbalance. Future prevention interventions need to be methodologically rigorous, scalable to the population level and include economic evaluation. Evidence-based knowledge translation strategies should be developed to ensure that all stakeholders recognise preventing mental disorders as an imperative, with appropriate resources directed to this objective.
   Conclusion There has been a recent expansion of research into potentially modifiable risk factors for depression, and it is now timely to make a concerted effort to advance the field of prevention of common mental disorders.

Searchable questions were structured using the PICO format (acronym for "patient" [or population], "intervention" [or exposure], "comparison" [or control], and "outcome").
   Results: We present data on clinical manifestations and implications of panic disorder and its association with depression, drug abuse, dependence and anxiety disorders. In addition, discussions were held on the main psychiatric and clinical differential diagnoses.
   Conclusions: The guidelines are proposed to serve as a reference for the general practitioner and specialist to assist in and facilitate the diagnosis of panic disorder.

AB  - Anxiety and depression are the most prevalent of the psychiatric disorders. The average age of onset of these disorders is in adolescence, and stressful experiences are recognized as an important pathway to such dysfunction. Until recently, however, most animal models of these disorders involved adult males. We provide a brief overview of anxiety and depression and the extent to which adolescent rodents are a valid model for their investigation, and briefly review the main measures of anxiety-like and depressive behaviour in rodents. The focus of the review is investigations in which adolescent rodents were exposed to chronic stressors, describing our research using social instability stress and that of other researchers using various social and non-social stressors. The evidence to date suggests stress in adolescence alters the trajectory of brain development, and particularly that of the hippocampus, increasing anxiety and depressive behaviour in adulthood.

AB  - Withdrawal from opiates, such as heroin or oral narcotics, is characterized by a host of aversive physical and emotional symptoms. High rates of relapse and limited treatment success rates for opiate addiction have prompted a search for new approaches. For many opiate addicts, achieving abstinence may be further complicated by poly-drug use and comorbid mental disorders. Research over the past decade has shed light on the influence of endocannabinoids (ECs) on the opioid system. Evidence from both animal and clinical studies point toward an interaction between these two systems, and suggest that targeting the EC system may provide novel interventions for managing opiate dependence and withdrawal. This review will summarize the literature surrounding the molecular effects of cannabinoids and opioids on the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system, a key circuit implicated in the negative sequelae of opiate addiction. A consideration of the trends and effects of marijuana use in those seeking treatment to abstain from opiates in the clinical setting will also be presented. In summary, the present review details how cannabinoid-opioid interactions may inform novel interventions in the management of opiate dependence and withdrawal. (C) 2013 IBRO.

AB  - Background: A major feature of personality disorders is significant impairment in interpersonal functioning, which may create challenges in close relationships. This article aims to systematically review the experience of carers of persons with personality disorders.
   Method: The PRISMA systematic review method was followed, and empirical studies written in English, published between 1996 and 2011, and cited in major electronic databases were searched. Studies meeting the following selection criteria were included: (1) carers or families of persons with personality disorders; (2) intervention involving the carers or families; (3) burden or related construct used. Studies were required to meet either criteria 1 and 3 or criteria 2 and 3. Reference lists were scanned, and experts were consulted for further studies.
   Results: Six studies met inclusion criteria, representing data on 465 carers. Five of the six studies focused on carers of persons with borderline personality disorder. The findings indicated that carers experience elevated objective and subjective burden, grief, impaired empowerment, and mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. Scores on objective and subjective burden were half a standard deviation above the mean compared to carers of inpatients with other serious mental illnesses.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to report data on a large, aggregated sample of carers of persons with personality disorders. Significant gaps in the literature remain, and it is recommended that future research focus on the burden and support needs of carers of persons across different personality disorders, that attention be paid to the gender balance of patients, and that data be reported in a way to allow meta-analysis.

AB  - Objective: To examine published literature investigating the relationship between illness perceptions, mood and quality of life (QoL) in coronary heart disease (CHD) populations.
   Methods: Key databases were systematically searched (CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science) for studies matching the inclusion criteria between November 2011 and February 2012. References of included studies were examined and key authors contacted. Studies were subject to a quality control check.
   Results: 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. A synthesis of the results found that illness perceptions were correlated to and predicted QoL and mood across CHD diagnoses. Specific illness perceptions (control, coherence and timeline) were found to be important for patients that had experienced an unexpected medical event, such as myocardial infarction.
   Conclusion: The results of this study provide support that illness perceptions are related to outcomes across CHD populations and disease progression, however the results do not selectively support one particular model. Recommendations are consistent with cardiac rehabilitation guidelines. Further research should focus on the systemic impact of illness perceptions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Individuals with mental health problems are at significantly increased risk of chronic physical health problems, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as well as reduced life expectancy. The excess costs of co-morbid physical and mental health problems are substantial. Potentially, measures to reduce the risk of co-morbid physical health problems may represent excellent value for money.
   Methods: To conduct a systematic review to determine what is known about economic evaluations of actions to promote better physical health in individuals identified as having a clinically diagnosed mental disorder, but no physical co-morbidity. Systematic searches of databases were supplemented by hand searches of relevant journals and websites.
   Results: Of 1970 studies originally assessed, 11 met our inclusion criteria. In addition, five protocols for other studies were also identified. Studies looked at exercise programmes, nutritional advice, smoking, alcohol and drug cessation, and reducing the risk of blood borne infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. All of the lifestyle and smoking cessation studies focused on people with depression and anxiety disorders. Substance abuse and infectious disease prevention studies focused on people with psychoses and bipolar disorder.
   Conclusions: There is a very small, albeit growing, literature on the cost effectiveness of interventions to promote the physical health of people with mental health problems. Most studies suggest that value for money actions in specific contexts and settings are available. Given that the success or failure of health promoting interventions can be very context specific, more studies are needed in more settings, focused on different population groups with different mental health problems and reporting intermediate and long term outcomes. There is a need to better distinguish between resource use and costs in a transparent manner, including impacts outside of the health care system. Issues such as programme fidelity, uptake and adherence should also be accounted for in economic analysis. The role of behavioural psychological techniques to influence health behaviours might also be considered.

AB  - Objective To assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve the mental health of women in the perinatal period and to evaluate any effect on the health, growth and development of their offspring, in low- and middle-income (LAMI) countries.
   Methods Seven electronic bibliographic databases were systematically searched for papers published up to May 2012 describing controlled trials of interventions designed to improve mental health outcomes in women who were pregnant or had recently given birth. The main outcomes of interest were rates of common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs), primarily postpartum depression or anxiety; measures of the quality of the mother infant relationship; and measures of infant or child health, growth and cognitive development. Meta-analysis was conducted to obtain a summary measure of the clinical effectiveness of the interventions.
   Findings Thirteen trials representing 20 092 participants were identified. In all studies, supervised, non-specialist health and community workers delivered the interventions, which proved more beneficial than routine care for both mothers and children. The pooled effect size for maternal depression was -0.38 (95% confidence interval: -0.56 to -0.21; I-2=79.9%). Where assessed, benefits to the child included improved mother infant interaction, better cognitive development and growth, reduced diarrhoeal episodes and increased immunization rates.
   Conclusion In LAMI countries, the burden of CPMDs can be reduced through mental health interventions delivered by supervised non-specialists. Such interventions benefit both women and their children, but further studies are needed to understand how they can be scaled up in the highly diverse settings that exist in LAMI countries.

AB  - A few empirically supported principles can account for much of the thematic content of waking thought, including rumination, and dreams. (1) A individual's commitments to particular goals sensitize the individual to respond to cues associated with those goals. The cues may be external or internal in the person's own mental activity. The responses may take the form of noticing the cues, storing them in memory, having thoughts or dream segments related to them, and/or taking action. Noticing may be conscious or not. Goals may be any desired endpoint of a behavioral sequence, including finding out more about something, i.e., exploring possible goals, such as job possibilities or personal relationships. (2) such responses are accompanied and perhaps preceded by protoemotional activity or full emotional arousal, the amplitude of which determines the likelihood of response and is related to the value placed on the goal. (3) When the individual is in a situation conducive to making progress towards attaining the goal, the response to goal cues takes the form of actions or operant mental acts that advance the goal pursuit. (4) When circumstances are unfavorable for goal-directed operant behavior, the response remains purely mental, as in mind-wandering and dreaming, but still reflects the content of the goal pursuit or associated content. (5) Respondent responses such as mind-wandering are more likely when the individual is mentally unoccupied with ongoing tasks and less likely the more that is at stake in the ongoing task. The probability of respondent thought is highest during relaxed periods, when the brain's default-mode network dominates, or during sleep. The article briefly summarizes neurocognitive findings that relate to mind-wandering and evidence regarding adverse effects of mind-wandering on task performance as well as evidence suggesting adaptive functions. in regard to creative problem-solving, planning resisting delay discounting, and memory consolidation.

AB  - The existence of seasonal or circannual effects on laboratory rodent behavior has been the subject of much debate in recent conversations with colleagues. If such effects are real, they could explain poor replicability or hinder the detection of treatment effects. Here, we review the literature in which seasonal or circannual rhythms were examined under typical 12:12 h photoperiods and present our historical data of locomotor activity of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats across several seasons and years. In general, there was little evidence to indicate significant effects on the locomotor activity of rats or mice, while studies of depression behaviors were somewhat inconsistent in their findings. Results of the few anxiety behavior assessments were fairly consistent, at least in rat studies. Two studies of pain-related behaviors indicated decreased responses during spring or summer testing. If such seasonal effects are real, this would imply that laboratory rodents have a type of internal Type 2 circannual clock or endogenous oscillator. However, photoperiod, temperature, or humidity cannot be the zeitgeber. Further, the need for a circannual clock in a short-lived rodent is debatable. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Considering the pivotal role of negative emotional experiences in the development and persistence of mental disorders, interfering with the consolidation/reconsolidation of such experiences would open the door to a novel treatment approach in psychiatry. We conducted a meta-analysis on the experimental evidence regarding the capacity of the beta-blocker propranolol to block the consolidation/reconsolidation of emotional memories in healthy adults. Methods: Selected studies consisted of randomized, double-blind experiments assessing long-term memory for emotional material in healthy adults and involved at least 1 propranolol and 1 placebo condition. We searched PsycInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, PILOTS, Google Scholar and clinicaltrials.org for eligible studies from the period 1995-2012. Ten consolidation (n = 259) and 8 reconsolidation (n = 308) experiments met the inclusion criteria. We calculated effect sizes (Hedges g) using a random effects model. Results: Compared with placebo, propranolol given before memory consolidation reduced subsequent recall for negatively valenced stories, pictures and word lists (Hedges g = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14-0.74). Propranolol before reconsolidation also reduced subsequent recall for negatively valenced emotional words and the expression of cue-elicited fear responses (Hedges g = 0.56, 95% CI 0.13-1.00). Limitations: Limitations include the moderate number of studies examining the influence of propranolol on emotional memory consolidation and reconsolidation in healthy adults and the fact that most samples consisted entirely of young adults, which may limit the ecological validity of results. Conclusion: Propranolol shows promise in reducing subsequent memory for new or recalled emotional material in healthy adults. However, future studies will need to investigate whether more powerful idiosyncratic emotional memories can also be weakened and whether this weakening can bring about long-lasting symptomatic relief in clinical populations, such as patients with posttraumatic stress or other event-related disorders.

AB  - Background: Recent evidence suggests that diet modifies key biological factors associated with the development of depression; however, associations between diet quality and depression are not fully understood. We performed a systematic review to evaluate existing evidence regarding the association between diet quality and depression.
   Method: A computer-aided literature search was conducted using Medline, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, January 1965 to October 2011, and a best-evidence analysis performed.
   Results: Twenty-five studies from nine countries met eligibility criteria. Our best-evidence analyses found limited evidence to support an association between traditional diets (Mediterranean or Norwegian diets) and depression. We also observed a conflicting level of evidence for associations between (i) a traditional Japanese diet and depression, (ii) a "healthy" diet and depression, (iii) a Western diet and depression, and (iv) individuals with depression and the likelihood of eating a less healthy diet.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first review to synthesize and critically analyze evidence regarding diet quality, dietary patterns and depression. Further studies are urgently required to elucidate whether a true causal association exists.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin abundantly expressed in several areas of the central nervous system (CNS) and is known to induce a lasting potentiation of synaptic efficacy, to enhance specific learning and memory processes. BDNF is one of the key molecules modulating brain plasticity and it affects cognitive deficit associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. Several studies have shown an altered BDNF production and secretion in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases but also in mood disorders like depression, eating disorders and schizophrenia. Plasma BDNF is also a biomarker of impaired memory and general cognitive function in aging women. Gonadal steroids are involved in the regulation of several CNS processes, specifically mood, affective and cognitive functions during fertile life and reproductive aging. These observations lead many scientists to investigate a putative co-regulation between BDNF and gonadal and/or adrenal steroids and their relationship with gender difference in the incidence of mental diseases. This overview aims to summarize the current knowledge on the correlation between BDNF expression/function and both gonadal (progesterone, estrogens, and testosterone) and adrenal hormones (mainly cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)) with relevance in clinical application.

AB  - People with major depressive disorder (MDD) are more prone to experiencing moral emotions related to self-blame, such as guilt and shame. DSM-IV-TR recognizes excessive or inappropriate guilt as one of the core symptoms of current MDD, whereas excessive shame is not part of the criteria for MDD. However, previous studies specifically assessing shame suggested its involvement in MDD. In the first part of this review, we will consider literature discussing the role of self-blaming moral emotions in MDD. These self-blaming moral emotions have been purported to influence people when they make social and financial decisions in cognitive studies, particularly those using neuroeconomical paradigms. Such paradigms aim to predict social behavior in activities of daily living, by using important resource tangibles (especially money) in laboratory conditions. Previous literature suggests that guilt promotes altruistic behavior via acting out reparative tendencies, whereas shame reduces altruism by means of increasing social and interpersonal distance. In the second part of this review, we will discuss the potential influence of self-blaming moral emotions on overt behavior in MDD, reviewing clinical and experimental studies in social and financial decision-making, in which guilt, and shame were manipulated. This is not a well-established area in the depression literature, however in this opinion paper we will argue that studies of moral emotions and their impact on behavioral decision-making are of potential importance in the clinical field, by linking specific symptoms of a disorder to a behavioral outcome which may lead to stratification of clinical diagnoses in the future.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this literature review was to assess the effects of Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) on elderly patients with dementia or various psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using the online PubMed network of the US National Library of Medicine & National Institutes of Health, Embase, PsycINFO, with the purpose of investigating AAI effects on cognitive functions, mood, and behaviour.
   Results: A total of 18 articles on dementia and 5 on psychiatric disorders were included in the present review. AAI were found to have positive influences on demented patients by reducing degree of agitation and by improving degree and quality of social interaction. Few studies have assessed the effects of AAI on mood, and even fewer have assessed its consequences on cognitive functions. The results that are available indicate a positive effect on communication and coping ability, but none on cognitive performance. A substitute pet robot yielded encouraging results, but its use requires further investigation. The few studies conducted for elderly patients presenting a variety of psychiatric diagnoses produced controversial findings.
   Conclusions: In spite of the encouraging results of AAI, much more research examining the issue of optimal AAI duration, frequency of sessions, and suitable target group is needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   BACKGROUND: Using a team of cross-disciplinary researchers, this review builds upon previous reviews on general and geriatric healthcare design in order to focus on research undertaken for mental health care facility design.
   METHODS: Sources were gathered in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 a broad search was undertaken across health and architecture; in 2011, using keywords and 13 databases, researchers conducted a systematic search of peer reviewed literature addressing mental health care and architectural design published between 2005 to 2012, as well as a systematic search for academic theses for the period 2000 to 2012. Recurrent themes and subthemes were identified and numerical data that emerged from quantitative studies was tabulated.
   RESULTS: Key themes that emerged were nursing stations, light, therapeutic milieu, security, privacy, designing for the adolescent, forensic facilities, interior detail, patients' rooms, art, dementia, model of care, gardens, post-occupancy evaluation, and user engagement in design process. Of the 165 articles (including conference proceedings, books, and theses), 25 contained numerical data from empirical studies and 7 were review articles.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the review results, especially the growing evidence of the benefits of therapeutic design on patient and staff well-being and client length of stay, additional research questions are suggested concerning optimal design considerations, designs to be avoided, and the involvement of major stakeholders in the design process.

AB  - Objective
   The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the self-report and interview-based instruments to assess mania/hypomania symptoms and related features, with a focus on 7 selected instruments in widespread use to illustrate their psychometric properties, comparative performance and pros and cons.
   Methods
   A systematic search strategy was devised and queried on Medline from 1973 to 2012 using the terms mania, hypomania, instrument, scale, questionnaire, interview, validity, reliability, psychometric properties and adults, elderly, aged. To be included, a study had to be published in a peer-reviewed journal or book in English or Italian.
   Results
   Of the 17 self-report instruments identified, two (the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Checklist-32 (HCL-32), received the most research attention. Although the psychometric properties of these instruments are good, their use as screening instruments to detect hypomania in the community or in patients with depression is partially limited by their low positive predictive value, related to the low prevalence of this condition. Nonetheless, they can be efficiently used to rule out the presence of hypomania. The Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale is increasingly being used to monitor mania symptoms over time by phone or email in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder because it consists of only 5 items. When the aim is early detection of manic/hypomanic symptoms that a patient may have experienced during their lifetime, the 33-item subset of the MOODS-SR seems promising because it includes the key psychopathology dimensions that better discriminate bipolar from unipolar disorder.
   Of the interview-based instruments, the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale are the most widely used outcome measures in clinical trials. Although they were developed more than 30 years ago, they continue to be the gold standard for research purposes. The two instruments have a similar coverage, although the YMRS is preferred over the BRMAS because it includes an item on insight.
   Conclusions
   Although no instrument can replace the need for accurate clinical diagnosis based on patient history, we argue that the increasing use of self-report instruments to screen bipolar disorder in patients presenting with depression or to monitor mania/hypomania symptoms over time may contribute to increasing the use of routine standardized assessment. Measurement-based care as the standard of care has the potential to transform psychiatric practice, move psychiatry into the mainstream of medicine, and ultimately improve the quality of care for patients with psychiatric illness.

AB  - Depression is among the most common psychiatric conditions in primary health care, and constitutes an important part of the global disease burden. However, it is difficult to obtain comparable data on depression worldwide and models for treatment and intervention need to be locally adapted. We conducted a narrative review of research literature on factors that influence depression screening, diagnosis and treatment among the Vietnamese population. This explorative approach included studies describing: a) culturally or contextually specific risk-factors for depression; b) any depression treatment seeking or treatment acceptability/adherence aspects or; c) depression screening among Vietnamese patients. We searched the PubMed and Cinahl databases, as well as relevant Vietnamese peer-reviewed journals and this produced 20 articles that were included in the review. Our findings indicate the importance of considering somatic symptoms when screening for depression in Vietnam as well as the use of culturally adapted and dimensional screening instruments. Our study confirms that depression reflects chronic social adversity, and thus an approach to mental health management that focuses solely on individual pathology will fail to address its important social causes. Further studies should elucidate whether neurasthenia is a commonly used illness label among Vietnamese patients that coincides with depression. The tendency among Vietnamese to seek traditional Vietnamese medicine and meditation practice when experiencing emotional distress was supported by our findings.

To provide clinically relevant recommendations for lifestyle modifications in depression, derived from a literature review. Method A search of pertinent literature was conducted up to August 2012 in the area of lifestyle factors and depression. A narrative review was then conducted. Results There is evidence that level of physical activity plays a role in the risk of depression, and there is a large and validated evidence base for exercise as a therapeutic modality. Smoking and alcohol and substance misuse appear to be independent risk factors for depression, while the new epidemiological evidence supports the contention that diet is a risk factor for depression; good quality diets appear protective and poor diets increase risk. Conclusion Lifestyle modification, with a focus on exercise, diet, smoking and alcohol, may be of substantial value in reducing the burden of depression in individuals and the community.

AB  - Objective: To provide a review of published literature regarding the pharmacology of memantine and potential benefits for use in child and adolescent psychiatry. Method: A literature search of several databases (Medline, Psychinfo, CINAHL, PsycARTICLES) was conducted with the search terms: 'memantine' with limits: English language, Human trials, all child (aged 0-18 years). The search was later expanded to include 'Adults' and relevant articles were also selected from reference lists. Result: The search did not find any well-controlled studies in children and adolescents except for open label trials, as monotherapy in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as an augmenting agent in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). No study was found in anxiety disorders (AD), the most common psychiatric disorder in children or in mood disorders, both major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Studies in adults for those disorders with onset in childhood or adolescence, were also mostly open-label and as an add-on therapy. All the studies reported that memantine is a safe drug with minimal drug interactions and a very acceptable adverse effect profile comparable to placebo. Conclusion: Memantine has demonstrated beneficial effects in some childhood disorders but the evidence is too limited at present and does not provide enough support of its efficacy to advocate for its regular use in those conditions. Such use remains off-label until further validation of efficacy comes from blinded, randomized, placebo controlled studies.

AB  - Psychiatric epidemiology has made significant contributions to the identification of risk factors for mental disorders. Available evidence underscores the complexity of the interactions between risk and disease and highlights conceptual and methodological challenges particularly in examining risk and disease relations beyond the level of simple associations. We propose that a life course approach in the study of risk factors for mental disorders, combined with fast developing analytical statistical tools, is the most promising avenue towards shifting the focus of the field from associations to generating and testing aetiological hypotheses. This review presents the basic tenants of life course risk modelling, highlighting key examples in the available literature that demonstrate the potential of this approach to advance our understanding of the trajectories from risk to disease and discusses priorities for future research.

AB  - Background: There has been an 8-fold increase in use of the term resilience within scientific and scholar literature over the last twenty years. The arena of public policy has also seen increasing use made of the concept, both with respect to child well-being and development and wider issues. Method: A focal sample of literature comprising 108 papers addressing public policy implications of work on child resilience was identified by a structured bibliographic search. Results: This literature suggests that current work: is characterized by a breadth of sectoral engagement across the fields of education, social work, and health; demonstrates diversity with regard to the systemic levels individual (biological and psychological), communal (including systems of faith and cultural identity), institutional and societal with which it engages; but is based more upon conceptual rather than empirical analysis. Major themes of policy recommendation target strengthened family dynamics, increased capacity for counseling and mental health services, supportive school environments, development of community programs, promotion of socioeconomic improvement and adoption of a more comprehensive conception of resilience. Evaluations of resiliency-informed policy initiatives are limited in number, with greatest rigor in design associated with more discrete programmatic interventions. Conclusion: A number of strategies to strengthen research-policy linkages are identified. These include greater commitment to operationalize indicators of resilience at all levels of analysis; more coherent engagement with the policy making process through explicit knowledge translation initiatives; and developing complex adaptive systems models amenable to exploring policy scenarios.

AB  - Although the etiology of bipolar disorder remains uncertain, multiple studies examining neuroimaging, peripheral markers and genetics have provided important insights into the pathophysiologic processes underlying bipolar disorder. Neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated loss of gray matter, as well as altered activation of subcortical, anterior temporal and ventral prefrontal regions in response to emotional stimuli in bipolar disorder. Genetics studies have identified several potential candidate genes associated with increased risk for developing bipolar disorder that involve circadian rhythm, neuronal development and calcium metabolism. Notably, several groups have found decreased levels of neurotrophic factors and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers. Together these findings provide the background for the identification of potential biomarkers for vulnerability, disease expression and to help understand the course of illness and treatment response. In other areas of medicine, validated biomarkers now inform clinical decision-making. Although the findings reviewed herein hold promise, further research involving large collaborative studies is needed to validate these potential biomarkers prior to employing them for clinical purposes. Therefore, in this positional paper from the ISBD-BIONET (biomarkers network from the International Society for Bipolar Disorders), we will discuss our view of biomarkers for these three areas: neuroimaging, peripheral measurements and genetics; and conclude the paper with our position for the next steps in the search for biomarkers for bipolar disorder.

AB  - Comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other mental health conditions are common. However, the recognition and study of this clinical issue is of recent origin. It has recently emerged that certain disorders are more likely to occur with ASD, such as ADHD, depression, anxiety and conduct disorder/challenging behaviors. Developmental factors are significant in that, while ASD presents at a very early age, this is not often the case with the co-occurring disorders noted above. The clinician should be aware of and plan for these potential concerns. Tests that are specifically designed to assess for comorbid mental health issues among persons with ASD are being developed. These methods are recommended given what we know about high rates of comorbidity in this emerging field.

AB  - The emotion of anxiety represents one of the most studied topics in the neurosciences, in part due to its relevance for understanding the evolutionary development of the human brain and its role in the pathogenesis of psychopathological conditions. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has enabled mapping of the anxious human brain and has contributed substantially to the understanding of anxiety. Alongside the fields of clinical psychology/psychiatry, personality psychology aims to support the research endeavor of mapping the anxious brain and has found that individual differences in anxiety-related personality dimensions such as Neuroticism or Harm Avoidance (measured by self-report) are correlated with gray and white matter volumes in different areas of the human brain. This review reveals that structures including parts of the frontal cortex (e. g., the orbitofrontal cortex) and the temporal lobe (e. g., the hippocampus) are often associated with trait anxiety, and it points out the inconsistencies that exist in the personality-sMRI literature on human anxiety. Consequently, we suggest new research strategies to overcome the inconsistencies. This review outlines how results from animal research can guide scientists in developing testable hypotheses in search of the anxious brain. Moreover, genetic imaging is presented as an interesting approach to mapping the anxious brain.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common health problem, ranking third after cardiac and respiratory diseases as a major cause of disability. There is evidence to suggest that university students are at higher risk of depression, despite being a socially advantaged population, but the reported rates have shown wide variability across settings.
   Purpose: To explore the prevalence of depression in university students.
   Method: PubMed, PsycINFO, BioMed Central and Medline were searched to identify studies published between 1990 and 2010 reporting on depression prevalence among university students. Searches used a combination of the terms depression, depressive symptoms, depressive disorders, prevalence, university students, college students, undergraduate students, adolescents and/or young adults. Studies were evaluated with a quality rating.
   Results: Twenty-four articles were identified that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reported prevalence rates ranged from 10% to 85% with a weighted mean prevalence of 30.6%.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that university students experience rates of depression that are substantially higher than those found in the general population. Study quality has not improved since 1990. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Methods. PsycInfo (1967 to November 2011) and Medline (1985 to November 2011) databases, systematic bibliography hand-searches, personal communication with a leading expert, and gray literature searching were applied in a systematic literature search of the prevalence of mental-health issues in polygynous women compared to monogamous women. Twenty-two studies meeting eligibility criteria were identified. Study characteristics, methods and findings were systematically extracted and appraised for quality.
   Results. The identified studies are of mixed methodological quality, but generally suggest a more significant prevalence of mental-health issues in polygynous women compared to monogamous women. Individual studies report a higher prevalence of somatization, depression, anxiety, hostility, psychoticism and psychiatric disorder in polygynous wives as well as reduced life and marital satisfaction, problematic family functioning and low self-esteem.
   Conclusions. The current state of the research reveals with moderate confidence, a more significant prevalence of mental-health issues in polygynous women as compared to monogamous women. Implications for practice and research are indicated.

AB  - Models describing the neural correlates of biased emotion processing in depression have focused on increased activation of anterior cingulate and amygdala and decreased activation of striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, neuroimaging studies investigating emotion processing in depression have reported inconsistent results. This meta-analysis integrates these findings and examines whether emotional valence modulates such abnormalities. A systematic literature search identified 26 whole-brain and 18 region-of-interest studies. Peak coordinates and effect sizes were combined in an innovative parametric meta-analysis. Opposing effects were observed in the amygdala, striatum, parahippocampal, cerebellar, fusiform and anterior cingulate cortex, with depressed subjects displaying hyperactivation for negative stimuli and hypoactivation for positive stimuli. Anterior cingulate activity was also modulated by facial versus non-facial stimuli, in addition to emotional valence. Depressed subjects also showed reduced activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for negative stimuli and increased activity in orbitofrontal cortex for positive stimuli. Emotional valence is a moderator of neural abnormalities in depression, and therefore a critical feature to consider in models of emotional dysfunction in depression. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Various trials have been conducted evaluating depression management programs for patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). However, to date, the most effective way to manage this co-morbidity in the real world setting remains unclear. To better understand the past successes and failures of previous trials and subsequently develop suitable interventions that target key components of health related quality of life (HRQOL) such as mental, physical and vocational functioning, we first need to understand the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between the two conditions. This paper will draw on the key literature in this field as identified by psychiatric, medical and social sciences databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, OVID, Medline) available up to January 2012, with the aim to conduct a narrative review which explores: the aetiological relationship between depression and CHD; its association with HRQOL; the relationship between CHD, depression and vocational functioning; and the impact of depression treatment on these outcomes. Key recommendations are made regarding the management of this prevalent co-morbidity in clinical settings.

AB  - Research into the role of the HPA system in mental disorders has recently increased. It has been found that hormones involved in regulation of the HPA system play an important role in stress-related disorders. In the past, baseline alterations were mainly inspected in patients with anxiety disorders. In order to assess changes concerning the acute stress reaction in these subjects, many studies also applied stress protocols such as pharmacological or nonpharmacological challenges. This review aims to provide an overview of the results regarding HPA function in various anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. A PubMed-based literature search revealed 59 studies that met the inclusion criteria (i.e., double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial; diagnosis based on DSM-III or -IV; and appropriate sample size - n >= 20 in the verum group). Results are presented and integrated with regard to baseline HPA system activation and response to a challenge. Markers of interest reporting on HPA system functioning were cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. In addition, suggested explanations regarding pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these findings are discussed. The majority of current data do not point to an alteration of the HPA system in anxiety disorders. There is some evidence for an association between the magnitude of mental stress and a change in cortisol levels. Nevertheless, pharmacotherapeutical interventions affecting stress hormones might be promising, not only in augmentation of psychotherapy in a specific phobia, but also for secondary prevention in post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Objectives: Anxiety has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes in people with diabetes. However, there has been little research which has specifically examined whether diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased likelihood of co-morbid anxiety. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether people with diabetes are more likely to have anxiety disorders or elevated anxiety symptoms than people who do not have diabetes.
   Methods: A systematic review was performed by three independent reviewers who searched for articles that examined the association between anxiety and diabetes in adults 16 or older. Those studies that met eligibility criteria were put forward for meta-analysis using a random-effects model.
   Results: A total of twelve studies with data for 12,626 people with diabetes were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Significant and positive associations were found for diabetes with both anxiety disorders, 1.20 (1.10-131), and elevated anxiety symptoms, 1.48 (1.02-1.93). The pooled OR for all studies that assessed anxiety was 1.25 (1.10-1.39).
   Conclusions: Results from this meta-analysis provide support that diabetes is associated with an increased likelihood of having anxiety disorders and elevated anxiety symptoms. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   Depression after stroke is a distressing problem that may be associated with other negative health outcomes.
   Aims
   To estimate the natural history, predictors and outcomes of depression after stroke.
   Method
   Studies published up to 31 August 2011 were searched and reviewed according to accepted criteria.
   Results
   Out of 13 558 references initially found, 50 studies were included. Prevalence of depression was 29% (95% CI 25-32), and remains stable up to 10 years after stroke, with a cumulative incidence of 39-52% within 5 years of stroke. The rate of recovery from depression among patients depressed a few months after stroke ranged from 15 to 57% 1 year after stroke. Major predictors of depression are disability, depression pre-stroke, cognitive impairment, stroke severity and anxiety. Lower quality of life, mortality and disability are independent outcomes of depression after stroke.
   Conclusion
   Interventions for depression and its potential outcomes are required.

AB  - Purpose - Definition-problems concerning the terms "migrant" and "Health-Related Quality of Life"(HRQoL) have a negative impact on the operationalization and measurement of the multidimensional and subjective construct of HRQoL. The aims of this systematic literature review are to address the following questions: How can the instruments used within the research field "migration and HRQoL"be described or categorized? Which dimensions (psychological, physical and social) and associated sub-dimensions have been used concerning measuring HRQoL when measures are applied to migrants?
   Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review was conducted. Three databases (Medline, Embase and Cinahl) were systematically searched for the investigation on HRQoL of migrants. Articles written in English, German and Polish, published since 2003 and meeting other inclusion criteria, were included in the final analysis.
   Findings - In the first stage a total of 4,062 studies were identified. However, very few studies were found to focus on HRQoL among migrants. Finally, 28 studies were included in the analysis. The results confirm that the terms "migrant"and "Quality of Life"and "Health-Related Quality of Life"are neither congruently used nor defined, respectively, within these studies, which consequently impacts deleteriously on the application and measurement of the concept in these groups. The majority of the studies reported to measure HRQoL with a well-known and validated HRQoL instrument. The physical dimensions (symptoms/pain/vitality, energy/vitality/sleep and the objective/subjective health status) are predominantly represented in the reviewed literature. The psychological dimension mostly includes sub-dimensions such as psychological stress and depressive symptoms; the social dimension was predominantly considered as the sub-dimension social relationships/networking.
   Originality/value - This paper highlights profound issues in the accurate assessment of HRQoL in migrants. This may have a significant impact on delivery of appropriate evidenced-based care for migrants in need of healthcare intervention.

AB  - Concerns regarding a drought in psychopharmacology have risen from many quarters. From one perspective, the wellspring of bedrock medications for anxiety disorders, depression, and schizophrenia was serendipitously discovered over 30 year ago, the swell of pharmaceutical investment in drug discovery has receded, and the pipeline's flow of medications with unique mechanisms of action (Le., glutamatergic agents, CRF antagonists) has slowed to a trickle. Might oxytocin (01)-based therapeutics be an oasis? Though a large basic science literature and a slowly increasing number of studies in human diseases support this hope, the bulk of extant OT studies in humans are single-dose studies on normals, and do not directly relate to improvements in human brain-based diseases. Instead, these studies have left us with a field pregnant with therapeutic possibilities, but barren of definitive treatments. In this clinically oriented review, we discuss the extant OT literature with an eye toward helping OT deliver on its promise as a therapeutic agent. To this end, we identify 10 key questions that we believe future OT research should address. From this overview, several conclusions are clear: (1) the OT system represents an extremely promising target for novel CNS drug development; (2) there is a pressing need for rigorous, randomized controlled clinical trials targeting actual patients; and (3) in order to inform the design and execution of these vital trials, we need further translational studies addressing the questions posed in this review. Looking forward, we extend a cautious hope that the next decade of OT research will birth 01 targeted treatments that can truly deliver on this system's therapeutic potential.

AB  - The neuroscience of exercise is a growing research area that is dedicated to furthering our understanding of the effects that exercise has on mental health and athletic performance. The present study examined three specific topics: (1) the relationship between exercise and mental disorders (e.g. major depressive disorder, dementia and Parkinson's disease), (2) the effects of exercise on the mood and mental health of athletes, and (3) the possible neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the effects of exercise. Positive responses to regular physical exercise, such as enhanced functional capacity, increased autonomy and improved self-esteem, are frequently described in the recent literature, and these responses are all good reasons for recommending regular exercise. In addition, physical exercise may improve both mood and adherence to an exercise program in healthy individuals and might modulate both the performance and mental health of athletes. Exercise is associated with the increased synthesis and release of both neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, and these increases may be associated with neurogenesis, angiogenesis and neuroplasticity. This review is a call-to-action that urges researchers to consider the importance of understanding the neuroscience of physical exercise and its contributions to sports science. Copyright (c) 2013 S.

AB  - Background: A reciprocal association exists between Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). A quantitative evaluation of this association is necessary to identify potential areas of clinical intervention. However, the association is unclear because of methodological differences and confounders across studies. This review examines the impact of methodology and confounding variables on the magnitude of the relationship between MDD and CHD.
   Methods: The search terms "major depression AND coronary heart disease" were entered into an electronic multiple database search engine. Abstracts were screened for relevance and individually selected articles were collated.
   Results: Nine methodological issues and three confounders are identified, which have contributed to uncertainty in the quantitative relationship between MDD and CHD. More quantitative, prospective longitudinal studies are needed, which use standard definitions for MDD and CHD and define clear outcomes. Studies should clearly establish the temporal relationship between the onset of depressed mood and one or more adverse cardiac events, should use quantitative measures of depression which are treated as continuous data, and have frequent measures of mental state over time, correlated with measures of cardiac health. Study design should avoid confounding by considering demographic factors, cardiac risk factors and management of MDD in CHD patients.
   Conclusions: This review raises the need for a standardised methodology in future research, taking into account the biases and confounders listed. Adopting a consensus approach to methodology will facilitate the quantitative exploration of the causal network linking MDD and CHD.

AB  - Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) involves multiple complex factors that make the evaluation of therapeutic interventions especially complicated. PTSD prevalence rates of CSA are approximately 37 % -53 %. Several other psychiatric sequelae of CSA exist. CSA appears to disrupt brain and body physiology. One co-located service delivery model reported a 52 % linkage rate of CSA survivors with mental health treatment. This article reviews current literature on the treatment of CSA, including psychosocial interventions, pharmacotherapy, and early preventative interventions. It also provides an update on the short- and long-term sequelae of CSA and implications for future research directions. A literature search of papers published in the last 3 years was conducted using the keywords treatment, sexual abuse, childhood, epigenetics, resilience and review, and searching the following databases: PsycInfo, PubMed, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and Centers for Disease Control.

AB  - Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic and impairing subtype of bipolar disorder, largely neglected in pediatric research. Consequently, it is rarely diagnosed clinically despite potentially being the most prevalent form of bipolar disorder. Lack of attention has added to confusion about the diagnosis and clinical presentation of cyclothymic disorder. In pediatric studies, cyclothymic disorder is commonly grouped with 'subthreshold' presentations of bipolar disorder under the undifferentiated label 'bipolar disorder not otherwise specified'. However, research indicates that cyclothymic disorder can be reliably distinguished from the other forms of bipolar disorder and from other childhood disorders. Importantly, cyclothymic disorder may be a diathesis for more acute presentations of bipolar disorder, warranting a prominent role in dimensional models of mood and psychopathology. Current evidence suggests that cyclothymic disorder has the potential to make unique contributions to our understanding of the risk factors and outcomes associated with bipolar disorder. This potential has yet to be fully realized, limiting our knowledge and ability to intervene in a meaningful way with youth who are exhibiting symptoms of a major mood disorder. Including cyclothymic disorder in future research studies of children particularly longitudinal outcome studies is essential for understanding the developmental trajectory of bipolar spectrum disorders and learning how to accurately diagnosis and treat the full spectrum of bipolar disorders.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a significantly disabling disease that affects all major areas of life. There is a lack of comprehensive synthesis of research findings on the full extent of psychosocial difficulties (PSDs) experienced by people living with schizophrenia. This paper provides a systematic review of the literature concerning PSDs and their associated factors in schizophrenia. PSDs were conceptualized in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as disabilities, in particular impairments of mental functions, activity limitations and participation restrictions.
   Methods: An electronic search using MEDLINE and PsychINFO plus a manual search of the literature was performed for qualitative and longitudinal studies published in English between 2005 and 2010 that examined PSDs in persons with schizophrenia. The ICF was used as a conceptual framework.
   Results: A total of 104 papers were included. The most frequent PSDs addressed in the literature were not specific ones, directly linkable to the ICF categories of mental functions, activity limitations or participation restrictions, but broad areas of psychosocial functioning, such as psychopathological symptoms (53% of papers) or global disability and functioning (37%). Among mental functions, the most extensively studied were cognitive functions (27%) and emotional functions (27%). Within the domain of activities and participation, the most widely investigated were difficulties in relationships with others (31%) and employment (20%). Of the factors associated with the intensity or course of PSDs, the most commonly identified were treatment modalities (56%), psychopathological symptoms (26%), and socio-demographic variables (24%). Medication tended to improve the most relevant PSD, but at the same time was the only consistently reported determinant of onset of PSDs (emerging as unwanted side-effects).
   Conclusions: The present review illustrates the remarkably broad scope and diversity of psychosocial areas affected in schizophrenia and shows how these areas are interconnected and how they interact with contextual factors. The need for a shift in focus of schizophrenia research is suggested - from an excessive reliance on global measures of psychopathology and disability for defining outcomes to the creation of profiles of specific PSDs that have a more direct bearing on the disabling experience and real-world functioning of patients and can serve to guide interventions and monitoring over time.

AB  - Objective To give an overview of the evidence on the cost-effectiveness (CE) and financial return of worksite mental health interventions.
   Methods A systematic search was conducted in relevant databases. Included economic evaluations were classified into two groups based on type of intervention: (1) aimed at prevention or treatment of mental health problems among workers or (2) aimed at return to work (RTW) for workers sick-listed from mental health problems. The quality of the included economic evaluations was assessed using the Consensus Health Economic Criteria list (CHEC-list).
   Results Ten economic evaluations were included in this systematic review. All four economic evaluations on the prevention or treatment of mental health problems found a positive cost-benefit ratio, although three of these studies had low to moderate methodological quality. In five out of six economic evaluation studies on RTW interventions, no favourable CE or cost-benefit balance was found. One study of moderate methodological quality reported on a positive CE balance.
   Conclusions Due to a limited number of economic evaluations on worksite mental health interventions of which a majority was lacking methodological quality or lacking evidence, only a tentative conclusion can be drawn from the results of this systematic review. Worksite interventions to prevent or treat mental health problems might be cost-effective, while those RTW interventions that included a full economic evaluation aimed at depressed employees do not seem to be cost-beneficial. More high-quality economic evaluation studies of effective worksite mental health interventions are needed to get more insight into the economic impact of worksite mental health interventions.

AB  - Aim: Early intervention in eating disorders (EDs) has been a neglected area. Peak onset is in adolescence, suggesting that early intervention should include parents. We synthesize findings from five key theoretical domains, and present pilot data from a phase-specific early intervention for new onset EDs in young people.
   Methods: From literature searches, we reviewed current knowledge on risk factors for EDs; ED prevention in young people; the evidence base for treatment for young people with EDs; early intervention in other mental health fields; and parenting interventions. Based on these findings, we devised and piloted a parent group intervention.
   Results: Presenting features are typically parental concern about changes in eating behaviour and/or weight loss. There is a delay between symptom onset and help seeking, by which time the illness is well established. Early intervention should therefore target parents and be delivered at secondary rather than primary care. Effective treatments favour family-focused interventions with parental responsibility for symptom management. We hypothesized that a parents' group might be effective for addressing the specific emotional experience of parents in the early stages and their relative lack of knowledge and understanding. Pilot data show significant improvements in knowledge, skills, confidence, understanding and their child's adherence to meal plans as a result of a 6-week parent group intervention.
   Conclusion: A parent group intervention addressing themes identified from risk factor, prevention and treatment research is a potentially promising approach to early intervention for EDs. The impact of the intervention on patient outcome needs evaluation.

AB  - Soeiro-de-Souza MG, Dias VV, Figueira ML, Forlenza OV, Gattaz WF, Zarate Jr CA, Machado-Vieira R. Translating neurotrophic and cellular plasticity: from pathophysiology to improved therapeutics for bipolar disorder. Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) likely involves, at a molecular and cellular level, dysfunctions of critical neurotrophic, cellular plasticity and resilience pathways and neuroprotective processes. Therapeutic properties of mood stabilizers are presumed to result from a restoration of the function of these altered pathways and processes through a wide range of biochemical and molecular effects. We aimed to review the altered pathways and processes implicated in BD, such as neurotrophic factors, mitogen-activated protein kinases, Bcl-2, phosphoinositol signaling, intracellular calcium and glycogen synthase kinase-3. Methods: We undertook a literature search of recent relevant journal articles, book chapter and reviews on neurodegeneration and neuroprotection in BD. Search words entered were brain-derived neurotrophic factor,Bcl-2,mitogen-activated protein kinases,neuroprotection,calcium,bipolar disorder,mania, and depression. Results: The most consistent and replicated findings in the pathophysiology of BD may be classified as follows: i) calcium dysregulation, ii) mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, iii) glial and neuronal death/atrophy and iv) loss of neurotrophic/plasticity effects in brain areas critically involved in mood regulation. In addition, the evidence supports that treatment with mood stabilizers; in particular, lithium restores these pathophysiological changes. Conclusion: Bipolar disorder is associated with impairments in neurotrophic, cellular plasticity and resilience pathways as well as in neuroprotective processes. The evidence supports that treatment with mood stabilizers, in particular lithium, restores these pathophysiological changes. Studies that attempt to prevent (intervene before the onset of the molecular and cellular changes), treat (minimize severity of these deficits over time), and rectify (reverse molecular and cellular deficits) are promising therapeutic strategies for developing improved treatments for bipolar disorder.

AB  - Objective To critically assess the research quality of studies examining self-concept in adolescents with epilepsy (AWE) and, based on the evidence of these studies, to determine whether AWE have compromised self-concept, to identify correlates of self-concept, and to evaluate interventions aimed at improving self-concept. Method MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for relevant publications. The modified Quality Index was used to evaluate study quality. Results 20 studies were reviewed and 8 studies were included in a meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in self-concept between AWE versus healthy control subjects. Self-concept was associated with a number of sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral variables. Conclusion The limited number and modest quality of the studies available for review suggest that the negative findings should be interpreted with caution. In addition to addressing the limitations of existing studies, future research should focus on exploring the potential role of self-concept in the development of mental health problems in AWE.

AB  - Objective: Taken in isolation, depression, anxiety, and hostility/anger have been shown to predict obesity. It is unknown whether these negative emotional factors are associated with adiposity, independently of each other. The objective of this review was to determine whether negative emotional factors have independent associations with adiposity.
   Methods: We searched for observational studies examining adiposity and two or more negative emotional factors. Studies which examined a negative emotional factor using analyses which controlled for other emotional factor(s) were selected for the review.
   Results: Three prospective and 11 cross-sectional studies met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of these investigations, 64% indicated that depression had positive associations with adiposity, independent of anxiety or hostility, and 56% indicated that anxiety had independent associations with adiposity. Only 33% of studies found independent associations for hostility and adiposity: however, far fewer studies were available.
   Conclusion: Depression and anxiety have independent associations with excess adiposity when controlling for other emotional factors. Additional studies are needed to determine whether hostility/anger is independently associated with excess adiposity. These results have implications for the design of effective obesity prevention programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present review with focus on the last decade (2000-2010) aims to (i) collecting the major hypotheses explaining freshwater biodiversity patterns, (ii) identifying the main stressors affecting freshwater biodiversity, and (iii) revealing information gaps regarding ecosystem types, organism groups, spatial and temporal scales to highlight research needs to better propose sound conservation measures. The comparative analysis addresses six organism groups ranging from microorganisms to fish in basins, rivers, lakes, wetlands, ponds and groundwater. Short-term studies at ecoregion and catchment scale focusing on invertebrates, macrophytes and fish in Palaearctic and Nearctic regions dominated. The most frequent hypotheses tested were the landscape filter concept, the species-area relationship, the metacommunity concept. Dominating natural drivers were area, heterogeneity and disturbance. Land use, eutrophication and habitat destruction were identified as most important stressors. Generally, freshwater biodiversity declined in response to these stressors in contrast to increasing biodiversity determined by natural drivers across all ecosystems. Preferred organism groups were fish and invertebrates, most frequently studied in rivers, in contrast to smaller organisms (e.g. bacteria) and, e.g. groundwater being underrepresented. Hypotheses originating from the last century are still tested in freshwater research, while novel concepts are either missing or untested. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is the ultimate challenge since it supports valuable ecosystems services ensuring perpetuation of mankind. For that, comprehensive large-scale studies with holistic approaches are urgently needed.

AB  - Objective: Of the 34 million adult Americans (17%) using mind-body medicine therapies, 8 million (24%) have anxiety/depression. The evidence for using mindbody therapies to address varying depressive symptoms in populations with and without other chronic comorbidities is reviewed. Methods: Systematic literature searches of PubMed (Medline), Embase, CINAHL, and the seven databases encompassed by Current Contents, Web of Science, and Web of Knowledge were conducted. Studies designed as prospective control-comparison, adult population, English, at least 2 weeks long, sample size > 30, and with primary or secondary outcome as depression measured on an established scale were included. Methodologic quality was evaluated using the modified Scale for Assessing Scientific Quality of Investigations (SASQI) for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Results: Ninety papers of about 2900 met both inclusion and exclusion criteria; 60% of them scored a SASQI > 9 and were deemed of sufficient quality to be included in the review; 74% of these selected quality papers demonstrated positive effects on the improvement of depressive symptoms. All mind-body modalities included in the study had at least one positive study. For cancer patients, several studies noted the positive effects of yoga and combination therapies on depression severity. For both diagnosed depression and fibromyalgia, several studies noted the positive effects of mindfulness on depression severity. Conclusion: The use of evidence-based mindbody therapies can alleviate depression severity. They could be used with established psychiatric treatments of therapy and medications. The likely long-term increased cost-effectiveness of integrating these therapies deserves further investigation.

AB  - Objective: To assess the extent to which ceasing the use of cannabis or other substances reduces the symptoms and social disability associated with psychotic illness. Methods: The electronic databases CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed publications in English that report data about the characteristics of current and former substance-using patients diagnosed with psychotic illnesses. The searches yielded 328 articles, of which 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. Four key outcome variables; positive symptoms, negative symptoms, ratings of depression and global function, and five other measures of outcome that were reported in five or more studies were examined using meta-analysis. Results: Current substance-using patients were significantly younger than former substance-using patients (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.38), but did not differ in age at onset of psychosis, sex, level of education or marital status. Current substance users had higher scores on rating scales of positive symptoms (SMD = 0.29) and depression (SMD = 0.36), and lower scores on global function (SMD = -0.26) when compared with former substance users. There was a significant improvement in the ratings of positive symptoms, mood and global function among patients who stopped using substances during the first episode of psychosis, while improvements in the symptoms of patients with a more established psychotic illness did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: The results suggest that substance use contributes to both the symptoms and the burden of disability experienced by patients with psychosis. Patients in the early stages of psychotic illness should be informed about the benefits of giving up substances earlier, rather than later in the illness. Psychiatric services should regard the treatment of substance use as an integral part of the treatment of psychotic disorders.

AB  - Although limited evidence is available, organisational change is often cited as the cause of mental health problems. This paper provides an overview of the current literature regarding the impact of organisational change on mental health. A systematic search in PUBMED, PsychInfo and Web of Knowledge combining MeSH search terms for exposure and outcome. The criterion for inclusion was original data on exposure to organisational change with mental health problems as outcome. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were included. We found in 11 out of 17 studies, an association between organisational change and elevated risk of mental health problems was observed, with a less provident association in the longitudinal studies. Based on the current research, this review cannot provide sufficient evidence of an association between organisational change and elevated risk of mental health problems. More studies of long-term effects are required including relevant analyses of confounders.

AB  - Objective: Direct inpatient and outpatient healthcare costs as well as indirect costs (e.g. productivity losses) are hypothesized to be increased in chronic back pain (CBP) patients with mental disorders. The aim of this systematic review is to examine this hypothesis by comparing costs in CBP patients with and without mental disorders.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Psyndex, EconLit, IBSS) was conducted. All studies were included which allowed for a comparison of direct and indirect costs between CBP patients with and without mental disorders.
   Results: Of 2283 potentially relevant articles, 10 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Total healthcare costs (SMD = 0.16 [SE = 0.06]; n = 1), CBP-related healthcare costs (SMD = 0.21 [0.06]; n = 1), CBP-related primary care visits (OR = 1.6 [95%-CI:1.2-2.3]; n = 1), CBP-related specialty care visits (OR = 1.4 [1.0-2.0];n = 1), CBP-related radiologic procedures (OR = 1.6 [1.0-2.5]; n = 1) and mental health visits (OR = 8.1 [7.3-9.1]; n = 2) were increased in CBP patients with depression. The incidence of new surgeries was increased in CBP patients with PTSD (OR = 4.2 [1.6-10.8]; n = 1). Pain-related healthcare use (n = 1) in CBP patients with both depression and anxiety and CBP-related hospital admissions (n = 1) in CBP patients with depression were not increased. Regarding indirect costs results were inconsistent for both return to work rates (n = 3) and work absence (n = 2).
   Conclusion: The results indicate increased direct but not indirect costs in CBP patients with mental disorders. However, the evidence is limited due to the low number of studies per outcome. This is all the more problematic, since the adequate allocation of healthcare resources will become a major topic of health care policy due to limited resources. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Depression and anxiety are treatable disorders, yet many people do not seek professional help. Interventions designed to improve help-seeking attitudes and increase help-seeking intentions and behaviour have been evaluated in recent times. However, there have been no systematic reviews of the efficacy or effectiveness of these interventions in promoting help-seeking. Therefore, this paper reports a systematic review of published randomised controlled trials targeting help-seeking attitudes, intentions or behaviours for depression, anxiety, and general psychological distress.
   Methods: Studies were identified through searches of PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane database in November 2011. Studies were included if they included a randomised controlled trial of at least one intervention targeting help-seeking for depression or anxiety or general psychological distress, and contained extractable data on help-seeking attitudes or intentions or behaviour. Studies were excluded if they focused on problems or conditions other than the target (e.g., substance use, eating disorder).
   Results: Six published studies of randomised controlled trials investigating eight different interventions for help-seeking were identified. The majority of trials targeted young adults. Mental health literacy content was effective (d =-.12 to.53) in improving help-seeking attitudes in the majority of studies at post-intervention, but had no effect on help-seeking behaviour ( d=-.01,.02). There was less evidence for other intervention types such as efforts to destigmatise or provide help-seeking source information.
   Conclusions: Mental health literacy interventions are a promising method for promoting positive help-seeking attitudes, but there is no evidence that it leads to help-seeking behaviour. Further research investigating the effects of interventions on attitudes, intentions, and behaviour is required.

AB  - Prenatal stress exerts a strong impact on fetal brain development in rats impairing adaptation to stressful conditions, subsequent vulnerability to anxiety, altered sexual function, and enhanced propensity to self-administer drugs. Most of these alterations have been attributed to changes in the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). In humans; dysfunction of dopaminergic system is associated with development of several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. Evidences provided by animal research, as well as retrospective studies in humans, pointed out that exposure to adverse events in early life can alter adult behaviors and neurochemical indicators of midbrain DA activity, suggesting that the development of the DA system is sensitive to disruption by exposure to early stressors. The purpose of this article is to provide a general overview of published studies and our own study related to the effect of prenatal insults on the development of DA metabolism and biology, focusing mainly in articles involving prenatal-restraint stress protocols in rats. We will also attempt to make a correlation between theses alterations and DA-related pathological processes in humans.

AB  - Background: Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom after stroke. Stroke survivors and health professionals need to know whether fatigue is likely to improve, or get worse over time; and whether there is a temporal association with depression or anxiety, which might provide a target for treatment.
   Aims and objectives: To systematically review all longitudinal observational studies which have assessed fatigue on at least two separate time points after stroke onset to determine its frequency, natural history and temporal relationship with anxiety and/or depression.
   Method: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsychInfo using the keywords "fatigue" and "stroke" and their associated terms or synonyms. Data were extracted regarding time points after stroke where fatigue was assessed, frequency of fatigue at each time point and any reported associations with anxiety and/or depression.
   Results: 101 full texts were retrieved after scrutinising the titles and abstracts. Nine fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Fatigue was assessed at a variety of time points after stroke (from admission to 36 months). The frequency of fatigue ranged from 35%-92% at the first time point. Frequency of fatigue declined across time points in seven of the studies (n = 764) and increased in two studies (n = 195). Three papers found significant associations between fatigue and mood at the same time point. The single study investigating temporal associations between fatigue and mood disorders reported that depression predicted subsequent fatigue.
   Conclusions: Fatigue is present soon after stroke onset and remains common in the longer term. There is little evidence regarding the temporal relationship between fatigue and mood: this is an area where further research is needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   The 'ethnic density hypothesis' is a proposition that members of ethnic minority groups may have better mental health when they live in areas with higher proportions of people of the same ethnicity. Investigations into this hypothesis have resulted in a complex and sometimes disparate literature.
   Aims
   To systematically identify relevant studies, summarise their findings and discuss potential explanations of the associations found between ethnic density and mental disorders.
   Method
   A narrative review of studies published up to January 2011, identified through a systematic search strategy. Studies included have a defined ethnic minority sample; some measure of ethnic density defined at a geographical scale smaller than a nation or a US state; and a measure ascertaining mental health or disorder.
   Results
   A total of 34 papers from 29 data-sets were identified. Protective associations between ethnic density and diagnosis of mental disorders were most consistent in older US ecological studies of admission rates. Among more recent multilevel studies, there was some evidence of ethnic density being protective against depression and anxiety for African American people and Hispanic adults in the USA. However, Hispanic, Asian-American and Canadian 'visible minority' adolescents have higher levels of depression at higher ethnic densities. Studies in the UK showed mixed results, with evidence for protective associations most consistent for psychoses.
   Conclusions
   The most consistent associations with ethnic density are found for psychoses. Ethnic density may also protect against other mental disorders, but presently, as most studies of ethnic density have limited statistical power, and given the heterogeneity of their study designs, our conclusions can only be tentative.

AB  - Parkinson disease (PD) is a systemic disease with variegated non-motor deficits and neurological symptoms, including impaired olfaction, autonomic failure, cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms, in addition to the classical motor symptoms. Many non-motor symptoms appear before or in parallel with motor deficits and then worsen with disease progression. Although there is a relationship, albeit not causal, between motor symptoms and the presence of Lewy bodies (LBs) and neurites filled with abnormal alpha-synuclein, other neurological alterations are independent of the amount of alpha-synuclein inclusions in neurons and neurites, thereby indicating that different mechanisms probably converge in the degenerative process. This may apply to complex alterations interfering with olfactory and autonomic nervous system functions, emotions, sleep regulation, and behavioral, cognitive and mental performance. Involvement of the cerebral cortex leading to impaired behavior and cognition is related to several convergent altered factors including: a. dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic cortical innervation; b. synapses; c. cortical metabolism; d. mitochondrial function and energy production; e. oxidative damage; f. transcription; g. protein expression; h. lipid composition; and i. ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, among others. This complex situation indicates that multiple subcellular failure in selected cell populations is difficult to reconcile with a reductionistic scenario of a single causative cascade of events leading to non-motor symptoms in PD. Furthermore, these alterations may appear at early stages of the disease and may precede the appearance of substantial irreversible cell loss by years. These observations have important implications in the design of therapeutic approaches geared to prevention and treatment of PD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Although childhood abuse is a recognised risk factor for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance misuse, its role in the aetiology of psychotic disorder remained controversial. This is in part because the putative effect of childhood trauma on psychosis has been mostly evaluated by small, cross sectional, uncontrolled studies that raised methodological issues.
   Methods Papers concerning the association between childhood trauma and psychotic disorders (to November, 2011) were identified using a comprehensive search of PubMed, Psychinfo, and Scopus and analysing reference list of relevant papers. A narrative synthesis was used to summarise results.
   Results An association between childhood abuse and psychotic symptoms was consistently reported by large cross sectional surveys with an effect ranging from 1.7 to 15. However, we cannot conclude that the relationship is causal as lack of longitudinal studies prevent us from fully excluding alternative explanations such as reverse causality. Gender, cannabis use, and depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms appear to moderate the effect of childhood trauma on psychotic disorders. However, specificity of childhood abuse in psychotic disorders and, particularly, in schizophrenia has not been demonstrated.
   Conclusion Although the association between childhood abuse and psychosis has been replicated, the etiological role of such early adversity has yet to be fully clarified. So far none of the studies reported support the hypothesis that childhood abuse is either sufficient or necessary to develop a psychotic disorder. It seems likely that any effect of childhood abuse on schizophrenia needs to be understood in terms of genetic susceptibility and interaction with other environmental risk factors.

AB  - Considering the central role of the concept of blood pressure reactivity to explanations of the influence of life stress in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, it is important that the underlying psychophysiological determinants of blood pressure change are elucidated. Empirical evidence is reviewed concerning the utility of the Hemodynamic Profile-Compensation Deficit (HP-CD) Model (Gregg et al., 2002), which draws on physiological theory that explains blood pressure regulation as a dynamic compensatory relation between cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Core constructs and quantitative features of the Model are explained, accompanied by a focussed review of the Model's application in reactivity studies of stress, lifestyle behaviours, laboratory-to-field generalisability, and personality differences. Although the available studies are relatively few in number, evidence of the Model's utility is promising. Application of the Model in further research could help to elucidate cardiovascular pathogenesis in ways not achievable through the study of blood pressure reactivity alone. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Children of cancer patients have an increased risk of developing psychosocial problems. But not all children are alike vulnerable to this stressful event. Thus, knowledge of risk and protective factors is required to design specific diagnostic tools and interventions for this vulnerable population. This study aims to provide a review and methodological evaluation of current studies examining factors associated with children's psychosocial adjustment when a parent has cancer.
   Methods: Four databases were systematically searched for quantitative research articles examining associative factors of children's adjustment. Study characteristics were analyzed and methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers.
   Results: 28 studies examining associative factors in 2896 families were identified. The included studies used a broad range of instruments assessing children's adjustment. Most patients were female breast cancer patients with middle to high socio-economic status. The majority of included studies used correlational approaches and cross-sectional designs. None of the studies examined toddlers or assessed children's quality of life. Across studies with low to high quality, we found no evidence of illness-related factors, except worse disease status that was related to lower adjustment. Evidence from moderate to high quality studies suggest that better family functioning indicates better adjustment, whereas parent's depressive mood indicates worse adjustment of the children. Child-related factors were inconsistent.
   Conclusion: Health professionals should pay attention to cancer patients' dependent children. In order to identify this at-risk population, parent's depressive mood and poor family functioning should be considered. Future studies should also assess children's quality of life and child-related factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Optogenetic tools have provided a new way to establish causal relationships between brain activity and behaviour in health and disease. Although no animal model captures human disease precisely, behaviours that recapitulate disease symptoms may be elicited and modulated by optogenetic methods, including behaviours that are relevant to anxiety, fear, depression, addiction, autism and parkinsonism. The rapid proliferation of optogenetic reagents together with the swift advancement of strategies for implementation has created new opportunities for causal and precise dissection of the circuits underlying brain diseases in animal models.

AB  - Objective: To examine the evidence for maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (M-ECT) to help determine who, when, and how long ECT should be continued.
   Method: A review of published literature on the use of maintenance ECT (M-ECT) was conducted. It focused primarily on trials published since 1997, meeting the following additional criteria: randomized controlled trial or cohort study with a comparison (matched group or before and after), and at least 10 patients receiving M-/continuation ECT. Where such data are not available, recent case series were reviewed.
   Results: Relapse rates after discontinuation of ECT are very high. Maintenance ECT is an underused treatment option that can substantially reduce risks of relapse in patients with major depressive disorder and likely in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as well. Little data are available for the use of M-ECT in neurological disorders, and no cost-effectiveness analyses in the maintenance setting were found.
   Conclusions: Whereas no clear answers emerge from the literature, there is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that for those who have not responded well to medications but have responded to ECT, M-ECT must be presented as an option to the patient and the family for consideration. Clear consensus guidelines for the use of M-ECT are needed.

AB  - Aims. Personalised support services assist patients with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) to live with functional deficits by providing living skills, emotional support, community access and advocacy. This paper aims to systematically review the evidence for personalised support.
   Methods. Systematic searches of Medline, PsycINFO and Google Scholar (inception to March 2011) identified studies investigating patient outcomes for personalised support services. The quality of the selected studies was assessed. The strength of evidence for the three categories of patient outcomes (illness acuity, personal functioning and patient satisfaction) was graded.
   Results. Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria with most rated as having moderate or weak study designs. The selected studies evaluated programs for outpatients with SPMI. There was moderate strength of evidence for reducing illness acuity and improving patient satisfaction with services, and weak strength of evidence for improving personal functioning in studies published to date. Most programs delivered multiple service types, and no clear pattern of service types leading to specific patient outcomes could be discerned.
   Conclusions. Although evidence published to date for personalised support is of variable quality, it suggests that services may be effective. More research on the effects of personalised support subtypes on patient outcomes is required.

AB  - Primary care plays a key role in the detection and management of depression and anxiety. At present it is not clear if the prevalence of depression and anxiety in primary care differs between migrants and ethnic minorities (MI) and natives and ethnic majorities (MA). A systematic review and a meta-analysis of studies comparing the prevalence of depression and anxiety in MI and MA in primary care were performed. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE and through hand-search. We included 25 studies, most of which had a relatively small sample size. Significant variations were found in the prevalence of anxiety and depression across studies. Pooled analyses were carried out for 23 studies, based on random-effects models. Pooled RR of depression and anxiety in MI were 1.21(95% CI 1.04-1.40, p = 0.012) and 1.01 (95% CI 0.76-1.32, p = 0.971), with high heterogeneity (I-2=87.2% and I-2=73%). Differences in prevalence rates among studies can be accounted for by inclusion criteria, sampling methods, diagnostic instruments and study design. Further research on larger samples and with culturally adapted instruments is needed to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety in MI seeking help for these disorders.

AB  - Objective To review the evidence about the prevalence and determinants of non-psychotic common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs) in World Bank categorized low- and lower-middle-income countries.
   Methods Major databases were searched systematically for English-language publications on the prevalence of non-psychotic CPMDs and on their risk factors and determinants. All study designs were included.
   Findings Thirteen papers covering 17 low- and lower-middle-income countries provided findings for pregnant women, and 34, for women who had just given birth. Data on disorders in the antenatal period were available for 9 (8%) countries, and on disorders in the postnatal period, for 17 (15%). Weighted mean prevalence was 15.6% (95% confidence interval, Cl: 15.4-15.9) antenatally and 19.8% (19.5-20.0) postnatally. Risk factors were: socioeconomic disadvantage (odds ratio [OR] range: 2.1-13.2); unintended pregnancy (1.6-8.8); being younger (2.1-5.4); being unmarried (3.4-5.8); lacking intimate partner empathy and support (2.0-9.4); having hostile in-laws (2.1-4.4); experiencing intimate partner violence (2.11-6.75); having insufficient emotional and practical support (2.8-6.1); in some settings, giving birth to a female (1.8-2.6), and having a history of mental health problems (5.1-5.6). Protective factors were: having more education (relative risk: 0.5; P=0.03); having a permanent job (OR: 0.64; 95% Cl: 0.4-1.0); being of the ethnic majority (OR: 0.2; 95% Cl: 0.1-0.8) and having a kind, trustworthy intimate partner (OR: 0.52; 95% Cl: 0.3-0.9).
   Conclusion CPMDs are more prevalent in low- and lower-middle-income countries, particularly among poorer women with gender-based risks or a psychiatric history.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One goal of the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) is to develop evidence-based and best practice educational programs and recommendations. Our group conducted a comprehensive literature review to provide evidence-based recommendations for treating metabolic comorbidity in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD).
   METHODS: We searched PubMed for all English-language articles published January 1966 to November 2010 using BD and MDD cross-referenced with metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. That search was augmented by a review of articles reporting outcomes of an intervention targeting components of metabolic syndrome in individuals with MDD or BD.
   RESULTS: Consensus exists for the recommendation that individuals with MDD and BD should be routinely screened for risk factors that increase risk for metabolic syndrome. For excess weight, the best-studied pharmacologic approaches are metformin and topiramate, with emerging evidence for liraglutide and modafinil. For binge eating disorder, the best evidence in mood disorders was for cognitive-behavioral therapy as well as topiramate, zonisamide, and in select cases selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. For dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, evidence supports cognitive-behavioral interventions and anti-diabetic, antilipidemic, and antihypertensive treatments.
   CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive care of individuals with mood disorders should include routine evaluation of the risk and presence of metabolic syndrome and its components. Systematic evaluation of preventative and targeted treatments of metabolic syndrome in mood disorder populations is insufficient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between mood disorders and personality disorders (PDs) is complicated clinically, conceptually, and neurobiologically. There is a need for recommendations to assist clinicians in treating these frequently encountered patients.
   METHODS: The literature was reviewed with the purpose of identifying clinically relevant themes. MedLine searches were supplemented with manual review of the references in relevant papers. From the extant evidence, consensus-based recommendations for clinical practice were developed.
   RESULTS: Key issues were identified with regards to the overlap of PDs and mood disorders, including whether certain personality features predispose to mood disorders, whether PDs can reliably be recognized if there is an Axis I disorder present, whether personality disturbances arise as a consequence or are a forme fruste of mood disorders, and whether personality traits or disorders modify treatment responsiveness and outcome of mood disorders.
   CONCLUSION: This paper describes consensus-based clinical recommendations that arise from a consideration of how signals from the literature can impact clinical practice in the treatment of patients with comorbid mood and personality pathology. Additional treatment studies of patients with the comorbid conditions are required to further inform clinical practice.

AB  - Research interest in psychophysiological detection of deception has significantly increased since the September 11 terror attack in the USA. In particular, the concealed information test (CIT), designed to detect memory traces that can connect suspects to a certain crime, has been extensively studied. In this paper I will briefly review several psychophysiological detection paradigms that have been studied, with a focus on the CIT. The theoretical background of the CIT, its strength and weaknesses, its potential applications as well as research finings related to its validity (based on a recent meta-analytic study), will be discussed. Several novel research directions, with a focus on factors that may affect CIT detection in realistic settings (e.g., memory for crime details; the effect of emotional stress during crime execution) will be described. Additionally, research focusing on mal-intentions and attempts to detect terror networks using information gathered from groups of suspects using both the standard CIT and the searching CIT will be reviewed. Finally, implications of current research to the actual application of the CIT will be discussed and several recommendations that can enhance the use of the CIT will be made.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to systematically review the association of comorbid mental disorders with indirect health care costs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
   A comprehensive database search was conducted for studies investigating persons with CAD and comorbid mental disorders (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Psyndex, EconLit, IBSS). All studies were included, which allowed for a comparison of indirect health care costs between CAD patients with comorbid mental disorders and CAD patients without mental disorders.
   The literature search revealed 4962 potentially relevant studies, out of which 13 primary studies met the inclusion criteria. Depression was investigated most often (N = 10), followed by anxiety disorders (N = 3) and any mental disorder not further specified (N = 3). All studies focused on return to work as indirect cost outcome. CAD patients with depression showed diminished odds for return to work, compared to CAD patients without depression (OR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.27-0.51). The findings for comorbid anxiety and any mental disorder were inconsistent. Indirect health care costs were exclusively assessed by a patient self-report (N = 13).
   There is strong evidence for diminished odds of return to work in CAD patients with comorbid depression, highlighting the need for integrated CAD and depression care. With regard to other comorbid mental disorders, however, the evidence is sparse and inconclusive.

AB  - Objective: To review cost-of-illness studies (COI) and economic evaluations (EE) conducted for medically unexplained symptoms and to analyze their methods and results. Methods: We searched the databases PubMed, PsycINFO and National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database of the University of York. Cost data were inflated to 2006 using country-specific gross domestic product inflators and converted to 2006 USD purchasing power parities. Results: We identified 5 COI and 8 EE, of which 6 were cost-minimization analyses and 2 were cost-effectiveness analyses. All studies used patient level data collected between 1980 and 2004 and were predominantly conducted in the USA (n = 10). COI found annual excess health care costs of somatizing patients between 432 and 5,353 USD in 2006 values. Indirect costs were estimated by only one EE and added up to about 18,000 USD per year. In EE, educational interventions for physicians as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy approaches for patients were evaluated. For both types of interventions, effectiveness was either shown within EE or by previous studies. Most EE found (often insignificant) cost reductions resulting from the interventions, but only two studies explicitly combined changes in costs with data on effectiveness to cost-effectiveness ratios (ratio of additional costs to additional effects). Conclusions: Medically unexplained symptoms cause relevant annual excess costs in health care that are comparable to mental health problems like depression or anxiety disorders and which may be reduced by interventions targeting physicians as well as patients. More extensive research on indirect costs and cost-effectiveness is needed. Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Purpose-This paper seeks to discuss the need and scope for application of psychological therapeutic techniques in work with problems of chaotic or dysfunctional behaviour, as found among users of homelessness resettlement services.
   Design/methodology/approach-The paper summarises recent research and UK policy guidance on the mental health needs encountered by frontline homelessness service resettlement staff on a daily basis. It goes on to discuss the impact of these experiences, and the value of training to help staff manage such encounters with greater awareness and skills. In particular, the paper considers the ethical dimension for staff, in responding to users' histories of emotional distress.
   Findings-There is a relative dearth of studies providing evidence on stress and burn-out amongst resettlement staff, compared to healthcare staff; nevertheless they face the same or similar pressures in their day-to-day work with clients. When asked to consider psychological techniques, some staff may initially fear being expected to be a psychotherapist; but research from clinical practice and recent training workshop experience suggest that training, especially where complemented by supervision or reflective practice, leaves staff feeling more confident.
   Originality/value-The application of formal psychological thinking in homelessness resettlement is a relatively new field. This is the first paper to explore issues arising from the perspective of the ethical dilemmas faced by frontline staff in the work of relating to clients' distressed or distressing experiences.

AB  - Background/objectives: Many people with schizophrenia face stigmatisation. Several methods have been produced to simulate the auditory and visual hallucinations experienced by people with schizophrenia in order to increase empathy and understanding about the condition. However, there has been no review of such methods. This systematic review aims to determine whether and how simulated hallucinations are effective in reducing stigma, and if simulated hallucinations are safe and acceptable.
   Methods: Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Worldcat Dissertations and Theses, were searched from 1980 to September 2010. Reference checking, hand-searching, and contacting of experts in the field were also performed. A narrative synthesis of quantitative studies was conducted, and qualitative studies were synthesised using meta-ethnography.
   Results: Ten studies were included. Simulation tools varied in context, but consistently increased both empathy towards, and desire for social distance from, people with schizophrenia whilst findings for other attitudes were inconsistent. Participants reported physical, cognitive and emotional discomfort. Qualitative data suggest that these discomforts give participants an 'insider's perspective' which produced empathy and respect. Simulated hallucinations sometimes produced concurrent negative affect, and physical and emotional distress, but were considered a highly acceptable learning tool.
   Discussion/conclusions: Simulated hallucinations have contradictory effects on stigma, increasing empathy but also the desire for social distance. They should therefore be used with caution. Further research is required to discover if there is a way of using simulated hallucination interventions that increases empathy without increasing the desire for social distance from people with mental illness.

AB  - Religion and spirituality (RS) as a coping resource for facing stressful life events is encountered with increasing frequency in the medical literature. RS is associated with more favourable outcomes among people suffering from mental disorders. Detention is a stressful situation and the prevalence of mental disorders in places of detention is increased compared with the community. This literature review examined the association between RS and the mental health of detainees. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and the Internet were systematically searched from inception of each data base to August 1st 2010. Peer reviewed articles that reported primary empirical data about the impact of spirituality on the mental health and behaviour of detained persons were selected. Qualitative studies are also discussed. Twelve empirical studies including a total of 4,823 individuals met our inclusion criteria. RS is associated with lower frequency and severity of depressive episodes. The strongest reported effect of RS on prison life is a reduction of incidents and disciplinary sanctions. Prospective targeted studies are needed in order verify the hypothesis that RS reduces suicide among detainees.

AB  - Background: Cognitive models of depression suggest that major depression is characterized by biased facial emotion processing, making facial stimuli particularly valuable for neuroimaging research on the neurobiological correlates of depression. The present review provides an overview of functional neuroimaging studies on abnormal facial emotion processing in major depression. Our main objective was to describe neurobiological differences between depressed patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HCs) regarding brain responsiveness to facial expressions and, furthermore, to delineate altered neural activation patterns associated with mood-congruent processing bias and to integrate these data with recent functional connectivity results. We further discuss methodological aspects potentially explaining the heterogeneity of results.
   Methods: A Medline search was performed up to August 2011 in order to identify studies on emotional face processing in acutely depressed patients compared with HCs. A total of 25 studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed.
   Results: The analysis of neural activation data showed abnormalities in MDD patients in a common face processing network, pointing to mood-congruent processing bias (hyperactivation to negative and hypoactivation to positive stimuli) particularly in the amygdala, insula, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform face area, and putamen. Furthermore, abnormal activation patterns were repeatedly found in parts of the cingulate gyrus and the orbitofrontal cortex, which are extended by investigations implementing functional connectivity analysis. However, despite several converging findings, some inconsistencies are observed, particularly in prefrontal areas, probably caused by heterogeneities in paradigms and patient samples.
   Conclusions: Further studies in remitted patients and high-risk samples are required to discern whether the described abnormalities represent state or trait characteristics of depression.

AB  - Appetitive motivation and incentive states are essential functions sustained by a common emotional brain process, the SEEKING disposition, which drives explorative and approach behaviors, sustains goal-directed activity, promotes anticipatory cognitions. and evokes feelings of positive excitement which control reward-learning. All such functions are orchestrated by the same "archetypical" neural processes. activated in ancient subcortical areas and transported to the forebrain by the mesolimbic dopamine (ML-DA) system. In mammals, the neurophysiology of the SEEKING urge is expressed by DA-promoted high-frequency oscillations, in the form of transient and synchronized gamma waves (>30 Hz) emerging in limbic forebrain and diffusing throughout basal ganglia-thalamocortical (BG-T-C) circuits. These patterns may be considered basic "SEEKING neurodynamic impulses" which represent the primary-process exploratory disposition getting integrated with information relative to the external and the internal environment.
   Abnormal manifestation of SEEKING and its neural substrates are evident in clinical depression and addiction. Specifically, depression is characterized by reduced recruitment of SEEKING, while addictions reflect re-organizations of the SEEKING disposition around ultra-specific appetitive memories and compulsive activities.

AB  - Major depression (MD) might be conceptualized as pathological under-arousal of positive affective systems as parts of a network of brain regions assessing, reconciling and storing emotional stimuli versus an over-arousal of parts of the same network promoting separation-distress/GRIEF. In this context depression can be explained as an emotional pain state that is the result of a disregulation of several sub-systems that under physiological conditions are concerned with bodily or emotional homeostasis of the human organism in a social context. Physiologically, homeostasis is maintained by influences of the SEEKING system represented - amongst others - by the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). Neuroimaging studies show that the MFB has a proven access to the GRIEF/Sadness system. A functional decoupling of these systems with a dysfunctional GRIEF pathway might result in MD. Therewith GRIEF and SEEKING/PLEASURE systems play important roles as opponents in maintenance of emotional homeostasis. Chronic electrical modulation of the reward SEEKING pathways with deep brain stimulation might show anti-depressive effects in humans suffering from MD by re-initiating an emotional equilibrium (of higher or lower activity) between these opposing systems.

AB  - The general aim of this study was to review the scientific literature concerning the Internet and suicidality and to examine the different pathways by which suicidal risks and prevention efforts are facilitated through the Internet. An online literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases. The main themes that were investigated included pathological Internet use and suicidality, pro-suicide websites, suicide pacts on the Internet, and suicide prevention via the Internet. Articles were screened based on the titles and abstracts reporting on the themes of interest. Thereafter, articles were selected based on scientific relevance of the study, and included for full text assessment. The results illustrated that specific Internet pathways increased the risk for suicidal behaviours, particularly in adolescents and young people. Several studies found significant correlations between pathological Internet use and suicidal ideation and non-suicidal self-injury. Pro-suicide websites and online suicide pacts were observed as high-risk factors for facilitating suicidal behaviours, particularly among isolated and susceptible individuals. Conversely, the evidence also showed that the Internet could be an effective tool for suicide prevention, especially for socially-isolated and vulnerable individuals, who might otherwise be unreachable. It is this paradox that accentuates the need for further research in this field.

AB  - Studies in experimental animals have revealed important roles of neuroactive steroids in the control of central nervous system functions during physiological and pathological conditions, suggesting that they may represent good candidates for the development of neuroprotective strategies for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Even if the characterization of the roles played by neuroactive steroids in humans is still at the beginning, several data are already available showing that they may be synthesized within the human CNS. Among the different enzymes, a prominent role is dedicated to aromatase that synthesizes estradiol whose neuroprotective effects have been described in experimental animals. Neuroactive steroid levels are modified by neurodegenerative conditions (i.e. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis) or in other mental diseases (i.e. schizophrenia), and may have an important role in physiological conditions, as the reorganization of grey and white matter during human puberty and adolescence or as a consequence of emotional responses. The interaction of some neuroactive steroids (i.e., allopregnanolone and isopregnanolone) with GABA-A receptor is particularly important in mood disorders. The presumptive role of estradiol and progesterone in neuroprotection is here discussed by comparing contradictory data that have been collected in humans. In conclusion, the state of the art of our knowledge of the role of neuroactive steroids in the normal and pathological human brain suggests several lines of future therapeutic developments in the treatments of neurological, neurodegenerative and affective disorders.

AB  - Background: Wind power has been harnessed as a source of power around the world. Debate is ongoing with respect to the relationship between reported health effects and wind turbines, specifically in terms of audible and inaudible noise. As a result, minimum setback distances have been established world-wide to reduce or avoid potential complaints from, or potential effects to, people living in proximity to wind turbines. People interested in this debate turn to two sources of information to make informed decisions: scientific peer-reviewed studies published in scientific journals and the popular literature and internet.
   Methods: The purpose of this paper is to review the peer-reviewed scientific literature, government agency reports, and the most prominent information found in the popular literature. Combinations of key words were entered into the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge(SM) and the internet search engine Google. The review was conducted in the spirit of the evaluation process outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
   Results: Conclusions of the peer reviewed literature differ in some ways from those in the popular literature. In peer reviewed studies, wind turbine annoyance has been statistically associated with wind turbine noise, but found to be more strongly related to visual impact, attitude to wind turbines and sensitivity to noise. To date, no peer reviewed articles demonstrate a direct causal link between people living in proximity to modern wind turbines, the noise they emit and resulting physiological health effects. If anything, reported health effects are likely attributed to a number of environmental stressors that result in an annoyed/stressed state in a segment of the population. In the popular literature, self-reported health outcomes are related to distance from turbines and the claim is made that infrasound is the causative factor for the reported effects, even though sound pressure levels are not measured.
   Conclusions: What both types of studies have in common is the conclusion that wind turbines can be a source of annoyance for some people. The difference between both types is the reason for annoyance. While it is acknowledged that noise from wind turbines can be annoying to some and associated with some reported health effects (e.g., sleep disturbance), especially when found at sound pressure levels greater than 40 db(A), given that annoyance appears to be more strongly related to visual cues and attitude than to noise itself, self reported health effects of people living near wind turbines are more likely attributed to physical manifestation from an annoyed state than from wind turbines themselves. In other words, it appears that it is the change in the environment that is associated with reported health effects and not a turbine-specific variable like audible noise or infrasound. Regardless of its cause, a certain level of annoyance in a population can be expected (as with any number of projects that change the local environment) and the acceptable level is a policy decision to be made by elected officials and their government representatives where the benefits of wind power are weighted against their cons. Assessing the effects of wind turbines on human health is an emerging field and conducting further research into the effects of wind turbines (and environmental changes) on human health, emotional and physical, is warranted.

AB  - The provision of environmental enrichment (EE) for laboratory rats is recommended in European guidelines governing laboratory animal welfare. It is believed the EE implementation can improve animals' well-being and EE has been used to demonstrate learning and plasticity of the brain in response to the environment. This review suggests that the definition and duration of EE varies considerably across laboratories. Notwithstanding this, some EE protocols have revealed profound effects on brain neurochemistry and resulting behaviour, suggesting that EE can have the potential to significantly modify these parameters in rats. For this review, a literature search was conducted using PubMed and the search terms "Environmental Enrichment" and "rats". From the results of this search the most important variables for consideration in the implementation of EE are identified and summarised, and include cage size and housing density; rat age, sex and strain; duration of EE; the EE protocol and enrichment items employed; and the use of appropriate controls. The effects of EE in a number of behavioural tests and its effects on neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, stress hormones and neurogenesis and proliferation are outlined. The findings summarised in the present review show the range of EE protocols employed and their effects in tests of activity, learning and affect, as well neurochemical effects which mediate enhanced plasticity in the brain. EE, as is provided in many laboratories, may be of benefit to the animals, however it is important that future work aims to provide a better understanding of EE effects on research outcomes.

AB  - A considerable body of literature has reported on emotion perception deficits and the relevance of these impairments in persons with depression and bipolar disorder. Fifty-one studies published between 1981-February 2009 were examined regarding emotion perception abilities between patient and control groups, and potential methodological, demographic and clinical moderators. Studies were identified through a computerized literature search of the MEDLINE, PsychINFO. and PubMed databases. The Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) standard (Stroup et al., 2000) was followed in the extraction of relevant studies and data. Data on emotion perception, methodology, demographic and clinical characteristics were compiled and analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 2.0 (Biostat, 2005). The meta-analysis revealed a moderate deficit in emotion perception in both bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, irrespective of task type, diagnosis, age of onset/duration of illness, sex, and hospitalization status. Several factors that moderated the observed impairment include self-reported depression, age at time of testing, and years of education. Emotion perception impairment in bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder represents a moderate and stable deficit that appears to be moderated by a limited number of demographic and clinical factors.

AB  - Objective: In North America, the prevalence of nonmedical prescription opioid use (NMPOU), and morbidity and mortality related to prescription opioid analgesics (POAs) has risen sharply. Epidemiologic studies have suggested a high prevalence of mental health and pain comorbidities in NMPOU samples. Given the potential importance for interventions, a narrative review was conducted on studies reporting data on the co-occurrence of NMPOU with mental health problems and pain symptoms in general, treatment, or special populations.
   Method: A search of MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science using defined search terms yielded 74 studies on NMPOU and mental health and (or) pain. Thirty-nine studies published between 1997 and 2009 were included in the review-based on the data they provided on NMPOU and mental health and pain comorbidities.
   Results: Our review found strong associations between NMPOU and the comorbidities of interest. Associations between NMPOU and mental health were strongest for depression (OR range 1.2 to 4.3) followed by anxiety disorders (OR range 1.2 to 3.0) in general and treatment populations. The prevalence of pain ranged from 14.5% to 61.5% in general, treatment, and street drug user samples reporting NMPOU.
   Conclusions: The extensive associations observed between NMPOU and mental health and pain comorbidities suggest that effective preventive or treatment interventions for NMPOU must consider and attend to these comorbidities. As POAs are widely available and used in North America, POAs may increasingly be used in nonmedical ways for pain or mental health problems not effectively diagnosed or treated.

AB  - Objectives. We aimed at reviewing studies exploring dysfunctional cognitive processes, and their neuroanatomical basis, in suicidal behaviour, and to develop a neurocognitive working model. Methods. A literature search was conducted. Results. Several limitations were found. The main reported neuropsychological findings are a higher attention to specific negative emotional stimuli, impaired decision-making, lower problem-solving abilities, reduced verbal fluency, and possible reduced non-specific attention and reversal learning in suicide attempters. Neuroimaging studies mainly showed the involvement of ventrolateral orbital, dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and, to a lesser extent, the amygdala. In addition, alterations in white matter connections are suggested. Conclusions. These studies support the concept of alterations in suicidal behaviour distinct from those of comorbid disorders. We propose that a series of neurocognitive dysfunctions, some with trait-like characteristics, may facilitate the development of a suicidal crisis during stressful circumstances: (1) an altered modulation of value attribution, (2) an inadequate regulation of emotional and cognitive responses, and (3) a facilitation of acts in an emotional context. This preliminary model may represent a framework for the design of future studies on the pathophysiology, prediction and prevention of these complex human behaviours.

AB  - Background: In the past years, cumulative evidence has convincingly demonstrated that the work environment is a critical determinant of workers' mental health. Nevertheless, much less attention has been dedicated towards understanding the pathways through which other pivotal life environments might also concomitantly intervene, along with the work environment, to bring about mental health outcomes in the workforce. The aim of this study consisted in conducting a systematic review examining the relative contribution of non-work determinants to the prediction of workers' mental health in order to bridge that gap in knowledge.
   Methods: We searched electronic databases and bibliographies up to 2008 for observational longitudinal studies jointly investigating work and non-work determinants of workers' mental health. A narrative synthesis (MOOSE) was performed to synthesize data and provide an assessment of study conceptual and methodological quality.
   Results: Thirteen studies were selected for evaluation. Seven of these were of relatively high methodological quality. Assessment of study conceptual quality yielded modest analytical breadth and depth in the ways studies conceptualized the non-work domain as defined by family, network and community/society-level indicators. We found evidence of moderate strength supporting a causal association between social support from the networks and workers' mental health, but insufficient evidence of specific indicator involvement for other analytical levels considered (i.e., family, community/society).
   Conclusions: Largely underinvestigated, non-work determinants are important to the prediction of workers' mental health. More longitudinal studies concomitantly investigating work and non-work determinants of workers' mental health are warranted to better inform healthy workplace research, intervention, and policy.

KW  - Depression
AB  - Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has played an important role in the fields of psychiatry, neurology and neuroscience, since its emergence in the mid-1980s; and several high quality reviews have been produced since then. Most high quality reviews serve as powerful tools in the evaluation of predefined tendencies, but they cannot actually uncover new trends within the literature. However, special statistical procedures to 'mine' the literature have been developed which aid in achieving such a goal.
   Objectives: This paper aims to uncover patterns within the literature on TMS as a whole, as well as specific trends in the recent literature on TMS for the treatment of depression.
   Methods: Data mining and text mining.
   Results: Currently there are 7299 publications, which can be clustered in four essential themes. Considering the frequency of the core psychiatric concepts within the indexed literature, the main results are: depression is present in 13.5% of the publications; Parkinson's disease in 2.94%; schizophrenia in 2.76%; bipolar disorder in 0.158%; and anxiety disorder in 0.142% of all the publications indexed in PubMed. Several other perspectives are discussed in the article. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Terrorist attacks are traumatic events that may result in a wide range of psychological disorders for people exposed. This review aimed to systematically assess the current evidence on major depressive disorder (MDD) after terrorist attacks.
   Methods: A systematic review was performed. Studies included assessed the impact of human-made, intentional, terrorist attacks in direct victims and/or persons in general population and evaluated MDD based on diagnostic criteria.
   Results: A total of 567 reports were identified, 11 of which were eligible for this review: 6 carried out with direct victims, 4 with persons in general population, and 1 with victims and general population. The reviewed literature suggests that the risk of MDD ranges between 20 and 30% in direct victims and between 4 and 10% in the general population in the first few months after terrorist attacks. Characteristics that tend to increase risk of MDD after a terrorist attack are female gender, having experienced more stressful situations before or after the attack, peritraumatic reactions during the attack, loss of psychosocial resources, and low social support. The course of MDD after terrorist attacks is less clear due to the scarcity of longitudinal studies.
   Conclusions: Methodological limitations in the literature of this field are considered and potentially important areas for future research such as the assessment of the course of MDD, the study of correlates of MDD or the comorbidity between MDD and other mental health problems are discussed.

AB  - Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a meditation program based on an integration of Cognitive behavioural therapy and Mindfulness-based stress reduction. The aim of the present work is to review and conduct a meta-analysis of the current findings about the efficacy of MBCT for psychiatric patients. A literature search was undertaken using five electronic databases and references of retrieved articles. Main findings included the following: 1) MBCT in adjunct to usual care was significantly better than usual care alone for reducing major depression (MD) relapses in patients with three or more prior depressive episodes (4 studies), 2) MBCT plus gradual discontinuation of maintenance ADs was associated to similar relapse rates at 1 year as compared with continuation of maintenance antidepressants (1 study), 3) the augmentation of MBCT could be useful for reducing residual depressive symptoms in patients with MD (2 studies) and for reducing anxiety symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder in remission (1 study) and in patients with some anxiety disorders (2 studies). However, several methodological shortcomings including small sample sizes, non-randomized design of some studies and the absence of studies comparing MBCT to control groups designed to distinguish specific from non-specific effects of such practice underscore the necessity for further research.

AB  - Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) are both clinically important public health problems. Depression is linked with a higher incidence of ischaemic cardiac events and MDD is more prevalent in patients with CHD. No single comprehensive model has yet described the causal mechanisms linking MDD to CHD. Several key mechanisms have been put forward, comprising behavioural mechanisms, genetic mechanisms, dysregulation of immune mechanisms, coagulation abnormalities and vascular endothelial dysfunction, polyunsaturated omega-3 free fatty acid deficiency, and autonomic mechanisms. It has been suggested that these mechanisms form a network, which links MDD and CHD. The aim of this review is to examine the causal mechanisms underlying the relationship between MDD and CHD, with the aim of constructing a topological map of the causal network which describes the relationship between MDD and CHD.
   Methods: The search term 'depression and heart disease' was entered into an electronic multiple database search engine. Abstracts were screened for relevance and individually selected articles were collated.
   Results: This review introduces the first topological map of the causal network which describes the relationship between MDD and CHD.
   Conclusions: Viewing the causal pathways as an interdependent network presents a new paradigm in this field and provides fertile ground for further research. The causal network can be studied using the methodology of systems biology, which is briefly introduced. Future research should focus on the creation of a more comprehensive topological map of the causal network and the quantification of the activity between each node of the causal network.

AB  - Quality of mothering relies on the integrity of multiple physiological and behavioral systems and on two maternal factors, one proximal and one distal, that have a great impact on how a mother mothers: postpartum depression and early experiences. To mother appropriately requires the action of systems that regulate sensation, perception, affect, reward, executive function, motor output and learning. When a mother is at risk to engage in less than optimal mothering, such as when she is depressed or has experienced adversity in childhood, the function of many or all of maternal and related systems may be affected. In this paper, we will review what is currently known about the biological basis of mothering, with attention to literature on hormones but with a particular focus on recent advances in the fields of functional neuroimaging. Instead of discussing strictly 'maternal' brain imaging studies, we instead use a systems approach to survey important findings relevant to brain systems integral to and/or strongly related to the mothering experience: (a) social behavior; (b) reward and affect; (c) executive function; and (d) maternal behavior. We find that there are many commonalities in terms of the brain regions identified across these systems and, as we would expect, all are sensitive to the influence of, or function differently in the context of, depression and adverse early experience. It is likely that the similarity and cross-talk between maternal, affect and stress systems, observed behaviorally, hormonally and in the context of brain function, allows for mood disturbance and early adverse experiences to have a significant impact on the quality of mothering and the motivation to mother.

AB  - The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM) is an evolving document that serves the many mental health care disciplines as the primary reference guide for classifying mental disorders. While the successive framers of the DSM have attempted to base it on scientific evidence, political and economic factors have also shaped the conceptualization of mental illness. These economic and institutional forces have reinforced the DSM's use of a medical model in understanding psychopathology. Though the scientific evidence for a medical model is mixed and evidence for other types of conceptualizations have been given less attention, the medical model provides for reliable diagnoses that allot diverse benefits to treatment providers and researchers, as well as to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. This article will outline the development of a medical model of mental illness, highlighting connections between this model and corporate and political interests, and will show how this model relates to the various revisions of, and developments within, the DSM. Such an analysis is especially relevant today as the field looks towards the publication of the newest revision of the DSM and attempts to understand and integrate its proposed changes into current treatment, theory, and research.

AB  - Recent literature considers duration of illness (DI) and duration of untreated illness (DUI) as important factors influencing outcome in many psychiatric conditions. The aim of the present article is to analyze the relationship between DI and DUI, and pharmacological response in the different psychiatric disorders with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative aspects. An updated review of the current literature was conducted through PubMed in order to compare different studies focused on DI and DUI, and treatment response in major psychoses and in depressive/anxiety disorders. A significant body of evidence shows that a prolonged DI and DUI is associated with brain abnormalities and poor treatment response, particularly in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies point toward a similar conclusion in mood and anxiety disorders as well, even though fewer studies have been published in this field. Given the relationship between a longer DI and DUI, and poor treatment response not only in schizophrenia but also in mood and anxiety disorders - specific intervention programs aimed to reduce the latency to treatment are definitely envisaged.

AB  - Postnatal depression (PND) is recognised as a common maternal health problem, but little evidence examines PND among refugee, asylum seeker and immigrant women in developed country settings. This review aimed to identify the rates of PND and highlight common risk factors among this group of women. An iterative and dynamic literature search was conducted across ten databases to identify published articles on PND among immigrant, asylum-seeking and refugee women in developed country settings. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and 'free text' search terms, as well as thesaurus terms, acronyms and truncation were used where appropriate. Findings suggest that PND may affect up to 42% of migrant women, compared to around 10-15% of native-born women. Common risk factors for PND among migrant women include history of stressful life events, lack of social support and cultural factors. With a growing number of babies born to immigrant mothers, greater awareness of PND among this group is needed in order to respond to their particular maternal mental health needs. Maternity care providers should regard all recent immigrants as at high risk of PND and give closer observation and support as necessary.

AB  - Aging of the human brain is associated with "normal" functional, structural, and molecular changes that underlie alterations in cognition, memory, mood and motor function, amongst other processes. Normal aging also imposes a robust constraint on the onset of many neurological diseases, ranging from late onset neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD), to early onset psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). The molecular mechanisms and genetic underpinnings of age-related changes in the brain are understudied, and, while they share some overlap with peripheral mechanisms of aging, many are unique to the largely non-mitotic brain. Hence, understanding mechanisms of brain aging and identifying associated modulators may have profound consequences for the prevention and treatment of age-related impairments and diseases. Here we review current knowledge on age-related functional and structural changes, their molecular and genetic underpinnings, and discuss how these pathways may contribute to the vulnerability to develop age-related neurological diseases. We highlight recent findings from human post-mortem brain microarray studies, which we hypothesize, point to a potential genetically controlled transcriptional program underlying molecular changes and age-gating of neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for understanding basic mechanisms of brain aging and for the future investigation of therapeutic approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Many trials of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have used small samples and, therefore, lack power. Here we present an up-to-date meta-analysis of TMS in the treatment of depression. Methods: We searched Medline and Embase from 1996 until 2008 for randomized sham-controlled trials, with patients and investigators blinded to treatment, and outcome measured using a version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (or similar). We identified 1,789 studies. Thirty-one were suitable for inclusion, with a cumulative sample of 815 active and 716 sham TMS courses. Results: We found a moderately sized effect in favour of TMS [Random Effects Model Hedges' g = 0.64, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.50-0.79]. The corresponding Pooled Peto Odds Ratio for treatment response (<= 50% reduction in depression scores) was 4.1 (95% CI = 2.9-5.9). There was significant variability between study effect sizes. Meta-regressions with relevant study variables did not reveal any predictors of treatment efficacy. Nine studies included follow-up data with an average follow-up time of 4.3 weeks; there was no mean change in depression severity between the end of treatment and follow-up (Hedges'g = -0.02, 95% CI = -0.22 to +0.18) and no heterogeneity in outcome. Discussion: TMS appears to be an effective treatment; however, at 4 weeks' follow-up after TMS, there had been no further change in depression severity. Problems with finding a suitably blind and ineffective placebo condition may have confounded the published effect sizes. If the TMS effect is specific, only further large double-blind randomized controlled designs with systematic exploration of treatment and patient parameters will help to define optimum treatment indications and regimen.

AB  - Background: This systematic review aims to investigate the association between comorbid mental disorders and quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic medical diseases. Methods: Studies investigating adults with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, asthma, chronic back pain and colorectal cancer were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological criteria. Effect sizes for QoL scores were analyzed in random-effects meta-analyses. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The database search identified 7,291 references and 65 primary studies were included. Medically ill persons with comorbid mental disorders showed a significantly decreased overall (d = -1.10; 95% CI = -1.34 to -0.86), physical (d = -0.64; 95% CI = -0.74 to -0.53) and psychosocial (d = -1.18; 95% CI = -1.42 to -0.95) QoL compared to persons without mental disorders. Subgroup analyses did not reveal significant differences between the examined medical diseases or mental disorders. Conclusion: The review provides evidence of a substantially reduced psychosocial and physical QoL in medically ill patients with comorbid mental disorders. This patient-reported outcome highlights the importance of recognizing and treating comorbid mental disorders in the medically ill. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Monoamine oxidase (MAO) isoenzymes A and B are mitochondrial-bound proteins, catalyzing the oxidative deamination of monoamine neurotransmitters as well as xenobiotic amines. Although they derive from a common ancestral progenitor gene, are located at X-chromosome and display 70% structural identity, their substrate preference, regional distribution, and physiological role are divergent. In fact, while MAO-A has high affinity for serotonin and norepinephrine, MAO-B primarily serves the catabolism of 2-phenylethylamine (PEA) and contributes to the degradation of other trace amines and dopamine. Convergent lines of preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that variations in MAO enzymatic activity-due to either genetic or environmental factors-can exert a profound influence on behavioral regulation and play a role in the pathophysiology of a large spectrum of mental and neurodegenerative disorders, ranging from antisocial personality disorder to Parkinson's disease. Over the past few years, numerous advances have been made in our understanding of the phenotypical variations associated with genetic polymorphisms and mutations of the genes encoding for both isoenzymes. In particular, novel findings on the phenotypes of MAO-deficient mice are highlighting novel potential implications of both isoenzymes in a broad spectrum of mental disorders, ranging from autism and anxiety to impulse-control disorders and ADHD. These studies will lay the foundation for future research on the neurobiological and neurochemical bases of these pathological conditions, as well as the role of gene x environment interactions in the vulnerability to several mental disorders.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the evidence on the extent to which personal debt impacts on mental health, and mental health on personal debt.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper systematically reviews the English-language, peer-reviewed literature, 1980-2009, drawing on 14 databases across the medical, business, legal, and social science fields.
   Findings - From 39,333 potential papers identified, 39,283 were excluded, and 50 were reviewed using a narrative analysis approach. Among nine longitudinal studies, three controlled for psychiatric morbidity or psychological wellbeing at baseline, income/wealth, and other socio-economic variables. From these, two reported indebtedness or an increase in debt levels associated with subsequently poorer mental health, while one study found no such relationship. While methodological limitations make it difficult to definitively demonstrate whether indebtedness causes poorer mental health, plausible data exist which indicate that indebtedness may contribute to the development of mental health problems, and mediate accepted relationships between poverty, low income, and mental disorder.
   Research limitations/implications - Existing research either uses definitions of "debt'' which lack specificity, or definitions of "mental health'' which are too broad-brushed. A more sensitive set of core questions is needed. Further longitudinal research is also a key priority.
   Practical implications - Those working with people with debt problems need to be aware of the potential risk of reduced mental wellbeing or mental disorder.
   Originality/value - The mental health of individuals living with indebtedness has become a recent concern for the health and financial services sectors. However, no systematic reviews have so far been conducted.

AB  - Medications, psychotherapy, and other treatments are effective for many patients with psychiatric disorders. However, with currently available interventions, a substantial number of patients experience incomplete resolution of symptoms, and relapse rates are high. In the search for better treatments, increasing interest has focused on focal neuromodulation. This focus has been driven by improved neuroanatomical models of mood, thought, and behavior regulation, as well as by more advanced strategies for directly and focally altering neural activity. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most invasive focal neuromodulation techniques available; data have supported its safety and efficacy in a number of movement disorders. Investigators have produced preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of DBS for several psychiatric disorders, as well. In this review, we describe the development and justification for testing DBS for various psychiatric disorders, carefully consider the available clinical data, and briefly discuss potential mechanisms of action.

Rev. xx (x), XXX-XXX - the significance of socio-emotional factors in development and maintenance of Anorexia Nervosa (AN) has been noted, but the literature is poorly integrated without clear models guiding research or treatment. This systematic review retrieved experimental studies of social-cognitive or affective processing in AN and categorised them using Ochsner's "Social-Emotional Processing Stream." Ochsner's "Processing Stream", based on healthy data, comprises five constructs: (1) acquisition of and (2) recognition and response to social-affective stimuli, (3) low-level and (4) high-level mental state inference and (5) context-sensitive emotion regulation.
   Thirty-seven experimental studies in Anorexia Nervosa were identified, mapping on to four of the five constructs (not Construct 3). A meta-analysis of nine affect recognition studies was conducted. AN patients demonstrated impairments in each of the four domains with preliminary reports that some difficulties are trait-like, and others ameliorate following recovery.
   Socio-emotional data was integrated with previous reports of neural abnormalities to generate an AN specific model of socio-emotional processing. Additional research is required for further definition and to translate experimental findings into clinical practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for mood disorders. Continuation ECT (C-ECT) and maintenance ECT (M-ECT) are required for many patients suffering from severe and recurrent forms of mood disorders. This is a review of the literature regarding C- and M-ECT. Methods: We conducted a computerized search using the words continuation ECT, maintenance ECT, depression, mania, bipolar disorder and mood disorders. We report on all articles published in the English language from 1998 to 2009. Results: We identified 32 reports. There were 24 case reports and retrospective reviews on 284 patients. Two of these reports included comparison groups, and 1 had a prospective follow-up in a subset of subjects. There were 6 prospective naturalistic studies and 2 randomized controlled trials. Conclusions: C-ECT and M-ECT are valuable treatment modalities to prevent relapse and recurrence of mood disorders in patients who have responded to an index course of ECT. C-ECT and M-ECT are underused and insufficiently studied despite positive clinical experience of more than 70 years. Studies which are currently under way should allow more definitive recommendations regarding the choice, frequency and duration of C-ECT and M-ECT following acute ECT. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

AB  - The phenomenon of post-traumatic stress has been well documented in the literature as a lasting mental health condition associated with exposure to traumatic life events. The diagnosis and experience of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease may be such a trauma. On the other hand, the phenomenon of post-traumatic growth (PTG) has been described, whereby people show positive mental health growth in the face of such trauma. This systematic review was set out to explore post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PTG in people with HIV to monitor prevalence, measurement and efficacy of interventions to reduce stress and/or promote growth. Standardised review techniques were used to track reports on both PTSD and PTG. A total of 206 papers were retrieved from the PTSD and HIV searches, and 13 from the PTG and HIV searches. After reviewing the papers for inclusion according to adequacy and relevance criteria and to remove duplicates, 33 PTSD papers and three PTG were available for full coding. Prevalence of PTSD in HIV ranged from 5% to 74%, which were much greater than the 7-10% in the general population. Seven studies showed a relation between trauma and PTSD, while six showed a link between PTSD diagnosis and reduced antiretroviral treatment adherence. Women were more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD. Only three intervention reports were identified that fitted our inclusion criteria. All of these reported on psychological interventions for HIV+ individuals with trauma. The interventions utilised HIV education, training in coping techniques and support groups. Only coping interventions were shown to be effective. PTG was under researched but showed a promising avenue of study. There needs to be harmonised measurement and the evidence base would need strengthening in order to build on the understanding of the impact of PTSD and PTG over the course of HIV disease. There is good evidence to associate HIV diagnosis and experiences during the course of illness as traumatic. PTSD has been shown to be prevalent and there seems to be good evidence to incorporate standardised measures to track the course of the disorder. There is extremely limited evidence that interventions may affect the course of symptom experience. The evidence and insight into PTG show promise but is currently inadequate.

AB  - Anxiety disorders, depression, and alcohol use disorder are common neuropsychiatric diseases that often occur together. Oxidative stress has been suggested to contribute to their etiology. Oxidative stress is a consequence of either increased generation of reactive oxygen species or impaired enzymatic or nonenzymatic defense against it. When excessive it leads to damage of all major classes of macromolecules, and therefore affects several fundamentally important cellular functions. Consequences that are especially detrimental to the proper functioning of the brain include mitochondrial dysfunction, altered neuronal signaling, and inhibition of neurogenesis. Each of these can further contribute to increased oxidative stress, leading to additional burden to the brain. In this review, we will provide an overview of recent work on oxidative stress markers in human patients with anxiety, depressive, or alcohol use disorders, and in relevant animal models. In addition, putative oxidative stress-related mechanisms important for neuropsychiatric diseases are discussed. Despite the considerable interest this field has obtained, the detailed mechanisms that link oxidative stress to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases remain largely unknown. Since this pathway may be amenable to pharmacological intervention, further studies are warranted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Quality of life (QoL) is known to be indicative of the level of social functioning in mental health patients. However, the research on QoL, in the field of psychiatry, is not as comprehensive as it is in other domains of medicine. The aim of this study was to review the research evidence on QoL in psychiatric patients, published in Serbian medical journals during the last decade.
   Material and methods: The research data from studies on quality of life in psychiatric patients, published in Serbian medical journals from 2000 to 2009, were obtained by searching the databases Kobson and Medline.
   Results: We found eight studies on QoL in psychiatric patients published in Serbian medical journals from 2000 to 2009. The reviewed articles were focused on the comparison of QoL between psychiatric patients and healthy controls, or somatic patients, the research on the relationship of QoL and general psychopathology, and the research on QoL and medical treatment.
   Conclusions: QoL in patients suffering from mental disorders, as the outcome variable, is of a paramount interest in the follow-up treatment studies in psychiatry targeting critical issues of mental illness management strategies. QoL of psychiatric patients in Serbia is still under-researched, and it would be important to measure QoL from both a patient's and observer's (i.e. family members, friends, nursing staff mental health professionals, etc.) perspective, in the context of social, economic, and cultural background of the patient. In the future, the studies on QoL in psychiatric patients in Serbia should also rely on "disease specific" assessment scales, which would consider particular aspects of psychopathology, and eventually follow up longitudinal course of mental illness, treatment outcome, and recovery.

AB  - Objective: To undertake a systematic review of the effects of exposure to mood stabilizer medication in pregnancy, evaluating teratogenicity and other outcomes for mother and child. This was one of three concurrent systematic reviews of psychotropic medication exposure in pregnancy.
   Method: A systematic search was carried out of electronic databases, reference books and other sources for original research studies which examined the effects of commonly used mood stabilizers (sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and lithium carbonate) on pregnancy outcomes. These included malformations, pregnancy complications, neonatal complications and longer term developmental outcomes for children exposed.
   Results: All mood stabilizers were found to be associated with a risk of malformation and perinatal complications. Studies which examined longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes found poorer outcomes for those children exposed to sodium valproate or polytherapy in pregnancy than for other individual AEDs. The data available for longer term child outcomes with lithium exposure is too limited to draw any conclusions.
   Conclusions: This review found that exposure in pregnancy to all four commonly used mood stabilizers may be teratogenic, and is associated with increased rates of pregnancy and neonatal complications. There was also more limited information that sodium valproate may be associated with poorer longer term child developmental outcomes. These findings must be balanced with the risk of relapse and poor pregnancy and child outcomes with untreated maternal bipolar disorder. The information obtained from these reviews of psychotropic medications will assist clinicians in managing women with mental illness in pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: Over the past 25 years, attachment research has extended beyond infant parent bonds to examine dyadic relationships in children, adolescents, and adults. Attachment has been shown to influence a wide array of biopsychosocial phenomena, including social functioning, coping, stress response, psychological well-being, health behavior, and morbidity, and has thus emerged as an important focus of psychosomatic research. This article reviews the measurement of adult attachment, highlighting instruments of relevance to-or with potential use in psychosomatic research. Methods: Following a literature search of articles that were related to the scales and measurement methods of attachment in adult populations, 29 instruments were examined with respect to their utility for psychosomatic researchers. Results: Validity, reliability, and feasibility were tabulated on 29 instruments. Eleven of the instruments with strong psychometric properties, wide use, or use in psychosomatic research are described. These include the following: Adult Attachment Interview (George, Kaplan, and Main); Adult Attachment Projective (George and West); Adult Attachment Questionnaire (Simpson, Rholes, and Phillips); Adult Attachment Scale (and Revised Adult Attachment Scale) (Collins and Read); Attachment Style Questionnaire (Feeney); Current Relationship Interview (Crowell and Owens); Experiences in Close Relationships (Brennan, Clark, and Shaver) and Revised Experiences in Close Relationships (Fraley, Waller, and Brennan); Parental Bonding Instrument (Parker, Tupling, and Brown); Reciprocal Attachment Questionnaire (West and Sheldon-Keller); Relationship Questionnaire (Bartholomew and Horowitz); and Relationship Scales Questionnaire (Griffin and Bartholomew). Conclusion: In addition to reliability and validity, investigators need to consider relationship focus, attachment constructs, dimensions or categories of interest, and the time required for training, administration, and scoring. Further considerations regarding attachment measurement in the context of psychosomatic research are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Methods: Peer-reviewed English publications were found through key word searches in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Embase, and by contacting authors in the field. Sixty-eight articles were included in this review.
   Results: Some studies have found higher levels of postdeployment distress and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Most studies have not shown an increased risk of suicide in former peacekeepers. Correlates of distress and PTSD symptoms included level of exposure to traumatic events during deployment, number of deployments, predeployment personality traits or disorder, and postdeployment stressors. Perceived meaningfulness of the mission, postdeployment social supports, and positive perception of homecoming were associated with lower likelihood of distress.
   Conclusions: Most peacekeepers do not develop high levels of distress or symptoms of PTSD. As postdeployment distress is consistently shown to be associated with high levels of exposure to combat during deployment, targeted interventions for peacekeepers who have been exposed to high levels of combat should be considered.

AB  - This article reviews evidence that researchers and mental health service providers need to take into account four modifiable factors that affect the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in people with schizophrenia: (a) physical activity as part of a health-related lifestyle, (b) physical fitness, (c) mental health status and (d) antipsychotic medication. The implementation of physical activity in order to prevent and treat cardiometabolic risk factors in people with schizophrenia is discussed. English language articles published until July 2009 were identified by PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search terms schizophrenia and metabolic syndrome, physical activity, health, fitness, and lifestyle were used. Physical activity interventions result in positive effects on metabolic outcomes, physical fitness, health-related behavior and mental health. Considering present knowledge, physical therapists should take into account the emotional (negative symptoms, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and stress) and physiological (cardiometabolic parameters) components of mental illness when offering physical activity interventions. The physical activity stimulus should be adapted to the individual's physical fitness level and the side effects of the antipsychotic medications. More research is needed to assist in the practical development of effective evidence-based preventive and curative strategies in psychiatric services for metabolic syndrome in persons with schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: The age at which most young people are in higher education is also the age of peak onset for mental and substance use disorders, with these having their first onset before age 24 in 75% of cases. In most developed countries, over 50% of young people are in higher education.
   Aims: To review the evidence for prevention and early intervention in mental health problems in higher education students. The review was limited to interventions targeted to anxiety, depression and alcohol misuse.
   Methods: Interventions to review were identified by searching PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Interventions were included if they were designed to specifically prevent or intervene early in the general (nonhealth professional) higher education student population, in one or more of the following areas: anxiety, depression or alcohol misuse symptoms, mental health literacy, stigma and one or more behavioural outcomes.
   Results: For interventions to prevent or intervene early for alcohol misuse, evidence of effectiveness is strongest for brief motivational interventions and for personalized normative interventions delivered using computers or in individual face-to-face sessions. Few interventions to prevent or intervene early with depression or anxiety were identified. These were mostly face-to-face, cognitive-behavioural/skill-based interventions. One social marketing intervention to raise awareness of depression and treatments showed some evidence of effectiveness.
   Conclusions: There is very limited evidence that interventions are effective in preventing or intervening early with depression and anxiety disorders in higher education students. Further studies, possibly involving interventions that have shown promise in other populations, are needed.

AB  - Objective To review the results of any published research study examining the psychosocial functioning of children who have recently completed cancer treatment. Methods Five electronic databases were searched (from 1978 to 2008). Of 1,734 identified articles, 19 met all inclusion criteria. Four articles utilized a qualitative methodology, thirteen utilized a quantitative methodology, and two used mixed methods. Results Children may experience positive psychosocial outcomes on treatment completion, including high self-worth, good behavioral conduct, and improved mental health and social behavior. However, they may also experience significant negative outcomes, including lower levels of psychological well-being, mood, liveliness, self-esteem, and motor and physical functioning, as well as increased anxiety, problem behaviors, and sleeping difficulties. Conclusions Completing treatment can be a psychologically complex time for children as they wait to make the transition from "cancer patient" to long-term "cancer survivor." Further high-quality research targeting the needs of these children is warranted.

AB  - This study investigated the fish fauna of a stream in southeastern Brazil that runs through sugar cane-growing and urban areas that are subject to sewage discharge. It aimed to determine the importance of spatial and environmental factors on fish distributions and to assess the use of fish as indicators of the environmental conditions. A longitudinal pattern of chemical water quality was observed, with more disturbed conditions at the urban sites. Several opportunistic or tolerant and omnivorous species such as Astyanax altiparanae, Poecilia reticulata, and Astyanax fasciatus were numerically abundant at these urban sites, which resulted in a consistent increase in species density and biomass along the stream. Redundancy analysis extracted three axes, identifying a nutrient-productivity gradient associated with different species composition patterns, as also detected by the indicator species analysis. No species could be considered a potential indicator of the agricultural area in the dry season, whereas four different species were judged potential indicators of three urban sites. In order to explain species distribution, variation in species abundance was partitioned into spatial and environmental components. The latter was more important, explaining 25.4% of the variation. We concluded that the fish assemblage of the Guamium stream is undergoing the initial stages of disturbance, with pronounced effects at the urbanized area, but no detectable changes at the sugar cane sites. Therefore, fish assemblages might be used as ecological indicators to detect urban impacts in similar rivers. However, the potential use of fish to diagnose stressors in areas of sugar cane plantations should be complementary to more comprehensive studies aimed at understanding the influence of this crop on freshwater resources.

AB  - Objective: To review the overall clinical research findings from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), the world's largest study of BD.
   Methods: STEP-BD was conducted from 1998 to 2005, enrolling participants (n = 4361) across 22 clinical sites in the United States. Each individual was followed for up to 2 years in naturalistic practice with blinded research assessments, while subgroups participated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for bipolar depression. The naturalistic database was used to examine the course of BD, comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, and suicidality. Relevant studies in English, published from January 1, 1994, to May 31, 2009, were identified using computerized searches of electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials), inspection of bibliographies, and review of other major reports.
   Results: One large RCT involving the addition of either paroxetine or bupropion to mood stabilizers in acute depression found neither more effective than placebo in achieving sustained recovery (8 weeks of euthymia). A second large RCT found intensive psychosocial interventions superior to a brief psychosocial intervention as an adjunct to medication in acute depression. A third small RCT found minimal effects of lamotrigine, risperidone, or inositol in refractory depression. Recovery was difficult to achieve, with subsyndromal symptoms or full relapse very common. Anxiety disorders and smoking in particular were treatable conditions that adversely affected the course of BD.
   Conclusions: STEP-BD yielded numerous clinical and systems observations that provide fresh direction for research and treatment of BD, including setting new benchmarks for outcome and demonstrating the viability of large BD networks.

AB  - Sex differences and gonadal hormone influences are well known for diverse aspects of forebrain amine and indolamine neurotransmitter systems, the cognitive and affective functions they govern and their malfunction in mental illness. This study explored whether hormone regulation/dysregulation of these systems could be related to gonadal steroid effects on catechol-O-methyltransferase and monoamine oxidase which are principal enzymatic controllers of forebrain dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine levels. Driven by male over female differences in cortical enzyme activities, by male-specific associations between monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase gene polymorphisms and cognitive and dysfunction in disease and by male-specific consequences of gene knockouts in mice, the question of hormone sensitivity was addressed here using a male rat model where prefrontal dopamine levels and related behaviors are also known to be affected. Specifically, quantitative O-methylation and oxidative deamination assays were used to compare the activities of catechol-O-methyltransferase's soluble and membrane-bound isoforms and of monoamine oxidase's A and B isoforms in the pregenual medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum of male rats that were sham operated, gonadectomized or gonadectomized and supplemented with testosterone propionate or with estradiol for 28 days. These studies revealed significant effects of hormone replacement but not gonadectomy on the soluble but not the membrane-bound isorfom of catechol-O-methyltransferase in both striatum and cortex. A significant, cortex-specific testosterone-but not estradiol-attenuated effect (increase) of gonadectomy on monoamine oxidase's A but not B isoform was also observed. Although none of these actions suggest potential roles in the reguation/dysregulation of prefrontal dopamine, the suppressive effects of testosterone on cortical monoamine oxidase-A that were observed could have bearing on the increased incidence of cognitive deficits and symptoms of depression and anxiety that are repeatedly observed in males in conditions of hypogonadalism related to aging, other biological factors or in prostate cancer where androgen deprivation is used as a neoadjuvant treatment.

AB  - The present literature review conceptualises landscape as a health resource that promotes physical, mental, and social well-being. Different health-promoting landscape characteristics are discussed.
   This article is based on a scoping study which represents a special kind of qualitative literature review. Over 120 studies have been reviewed in a five-step-procedure, resulting in a heuristic device.
   A set of meaningful pathways that link landscape and health have been identified. Landscapes have the potential to promote mental well-being through attention restoration, stress reduction, and the evocation of positive emotions; physical well-being through the promotion of physical activity in daily life as well as leisure time and through walkable environments; and social well-being through social integration, social engagement and participation, and through social support and security.
   This scoping study allows us to systematically describe the potential of landscape as a resource for physical, mental and social well-being. A heuristic framework is presented that can be applied in future studies, facilitating systematic and focused research approaches and informing practical public health interventions.

AB  - Tobacco smoking is an extremely addictive and harmful form of nicotine (NIC) consumption, but unfortunately also the most prevalent. Although disproportionately high frequencies of smoking and its health consequences among psychiatric patients are widely known, the neurobiological background of this epidemiological association is still obscure. The diverse neuroactive effects of NIC and some other major tobacco smoke constituents in the central nervous system may underlie this association. This present paper summarizes the pharmacology of NIC and its receptors (nAChR) based on a systematic review of the literature. The role of the brain's reward system(s) in NIC addiction and the results of functional and structural neuroimaging studies on smoking-related states and behaviors (i.e. dependence, craving, withdrawal) are also discussed. In addition, the epidemiological, neurobiological, and genetic aspects of smoking in several specific neuropsychiatric disorders are reviewed and the clinical relevance of smoking in these disease states addressed.

AB  - This multiwave longitudinal study investigated potential transactional and accumulating influences among corumination, interpersonal stressors, and internalizing symptoms among a sample of early and middle adolescents (N= 350: 6th-10th graders). Youth completed self-report measures of corumination at Times 1, 2, and 4, and negative life events. internalizing symptoms (general depressive. specific anhedonic depressive, anxious arousal, general internalizing), and externalizing problems at all four time points (5 weeks between each assessment across 4 months). Results Supported hypotheses. First. baseline corumination predicted prospective trajectories of all forms of internalizing symptoms but not externalizing problems. Second, baseline corumination predicted generation of interpersonal-dependent, but not interpersonal-independent or noninterpersonal stressors. Third, interpersonal-dependent events partially mediated the longitudinal association between baseline corumination and prospective internalizing symptoms. Fourth, a transactional. bidirectional set of associations was Supported in that initial internalizing symptoms and stressors predicted later elevations in corumination, and in turn. corumination predicted later symptoms through the mediating role of interpersonal stressors to complete both streams in the transactional chain Of influence. Fifth, girls and older adolescents exhibited higher corumination, but neither age nor sex moderated any associations. These findings are discussed within a transactional. developmental cascade model.

AB  - In this paper, we examine whether affect influences higher level cognitive processes. We review research on the effect of emotion on interpretation, judgement, decision making, and reasoning. In all cases, we ask first whether there is evidence that emotion affects each of these processes, and second what mechanisms might underlie these effects. Our review highlights the fact that interpretive biases are primarily linked with anxiety, while more general mood-congruent effects may be seen in judgement. Risk perception is also affected by negative and positive affect. Research shows complex effects of emotion on decision making and reasoning, with emotion sometimes hindering normatively correct thinking and sometimes promoting it. There are also important effects of emotion on reasoning style. We discuss key differences between the effects of incidental affect (feeling states not related to the semantic contents of the cognitive task) and integral affect (where the feeling state is caused by or linked to the contents of the cognitive task). In the conclusion, we suggest that focusing on some of the constituent mechanisms involved in interpretation, judgement, decision making and reasoning provides a way to link some of the diverse findings in the field. We also highlight important areas for future research.

AB  - The field of research and practice in psychotherapy has been deeply influenced by two different approaches: the empirically supported treatments (ESTs) movement, linked with the evidence-based medicine (EBM) perspective and the "Common Factors" approach, typically connected with the "Dodo Bird Verdict". About the first perspective, since 1998 a list of ESTs has been established in mental health field. Criterions for "well-established" and "probably efficacious" treatments have arisen. The development of these kinds of paradigms was motivated by the emergence of a "managerial" approach and related systems for remuneration also for mental health providers and for insurance companies. In this article ESTs will be presented underlining also some possible criticisms. Finally complementary approaches, that could add different evidence in the psychotherapy research in comparison with traditional EBM approach, are presented.

AB  - Background: Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an efficacious treatment for social phobia (SP), many patients drop out or achieve little or no benefit from treatment. This fact is-generally considered an argument for the importance of studies of predictor variables. Aims: This paper systematically reviews pre-treatment patient variables as predictors of drop-out from and outcome of CBT for SP. Method: A structured literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, Embase and Pub Med. Results: 28 published studies with n >= 60 were located. No pre-treatment patient variables were found to predict drop-out. Consistently across studies, higher levels of pre-treatment symptomatic severity predicted higher levels of end-state symptomatic severity, but not degree of improvement. There was some evidence that comorbid depression and avoidant personality disorder before treatment negatively influenced post-treatment end-state functioning, but not consistently improvement. No other patient variables consistently predicted outcome across studies. Conclusions: Generally, the results are in line with the conclusion that more disturbed patients with SP both begin and end treatment at a higher symptomatic level but with a similar degree of improvement. There is, however, little clinically or theoretically relevant knowledge to be gained from existing studies of pre-treatment patient variables as predictors of drop-out and treatment outcome in CBT for patients with SP. The field is in need of conceptual and methodological improvements if more solid findings should be hoped for.

AB  - Lithium has long been used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of manic-depressive (bipolar) disorder. Recent studies suggest that lithium has neuroprotective properties and may be useful in the treatment of acute brain injuries such as ischemia and chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One of the most important neuroprotective properties of lithium is its anti-apoptotic action. Ethanol is a neuroteratogen and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are caused by maternal ethanol exposure during pregnancy. FASD is the leading cause of mental retardation. Ethanol exposure causes neuroapoptosis in the developing brain. Ethanol-induced loss of neurons in the central nervous system underlies many of the behavioral deficits observed in FASD. Excessive alcohol consumption is also associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and neurodegeneration in the adult brain. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that lithium is able to ameliorate ethanol-induced neuroapoptosis. Lithium is an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) which has recently been identified as a mediator of ethanol neurotoxicity. Lithium's neuroprotection may be mediated by its inhibition of GSK3. In addition, lithium also affects many other signaling proteins and pathways that regulate neuronal survival and differentiation. This review discusses the recent evidence of lithium-mediated protection against ethanol neurotoxicity and potential underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), one of the possible consequences of sexual abuse of children and adolescents, may be found in about 40% to 50% of the cases. Objective: Conduct a systematic review of studies investigating the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of sexually abused children and adolescents with PTSD. Methods: A search for randomized clinical trials that evaluated PTSD in children and adolescents from 1980 to February 1, 2006 was conducted in the following databases: MedLine, EMBASE, LILACS, PsycLIT, PsycINFO, Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Database of Trials, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Science Citation Index (SciSearch), and PILOTS. References in all clinical trials selected were hand-searched. Results: Of the 43 studies initially selected, only three met inclusion criteria. The following comparisons were found in the studies: CBT to treat child and family member versus no treatment (waiting list); CBT to treat only child, only parents, or both versus community care; and trauma-focused CBT versus child-centered therapy (CCT). Results for CBT treatment of PTSD were better than no treatment (waiting list) (p < 0.05), community care (p < 0.01) and CCT (p < 0.01). The comparison of child-only CBT and family CBT (parents or caretakers and children) did not reveal any significant differences in efficacy, and both showed significant improvement of symptoms. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the efficacy of CBT (child-only and family) versus no treatment (waiting list and community care) in the remission of patients who completed treatment. Remission rates in treatment and control groups were 60% and 20%, and this difference in favor of CBT was statistically significant (RR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.29-0.88; p = 0.02). No controlled studies were found that compared CBT and pharmacotherapy. Discussion: Treatment with CBT reduces PTSD symptoms in sexually abused children and adolescents, with no differences between therapy with only the victim or with the victim and a family member. No studies compared CBT and pharmacotherapy or the efficacy of combined treatments.

KW  - CHILDHOOD
AB  - Due to social transformation in China, more than 100,000,000 people are migrating within the country. Many parents are forced to leave their children behind when they migrate. In 2008, 58,000,000 children were living as left-behind children, mainly in the rural parts of China (Zhang, 2009).
   Migration and its accompanying stressors may affect the mental health of the left-behind children. This unique literature review of Chinese literature summarises the present state of knowledge and reviews the influential factors. Possible approaches to intervention and system reforms are discussed.
   A literature review was performed of published studies between 2001 and 2008. Databases used were Fujian Medical University Library Interface, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and VIP Information. The Chinese word for 'left-behind' was used as a key word. Books, book chapters, monographs and studies on caring were searched electronically and by hand. Altogether, 53 items were found, discussed and grouped together. Migration affected the mental health of the left-behind children in a passive way, especially their emotions and social behaviour.
   There is still controversy over how serious mental health problems are among children who have been left behind. Life events, personality, coping strategies and social support can be regarded as four main factors that are predictive of mental health, which provides theoretical guidance for intervention. Support and prevention of mental health problems in schools, in families and in primary care should be developed and studied.

AB  - Adjuvant use of nutritional and herbal medicines has potential to increase the efficacy of synthetic pharmaceuticals, and perhaps also decrease their side-effects by allowing lower doses to be prescribed. We evaluated current evidence for adjuvant use of nutritional and herbal medicines with antidepressants, mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines; and explored novel future areas of research. The paper also critiques current evidence for co-administration of St. John's wort with synthetic antidepressants. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Cochrane database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Chinese Science Citation Database. Search results were supplemented by a review of reference lists and a forward search using the Web of Science. Where possible we calculated effect sizes. Encouraging evidence exists for the use of omega-3 fatty acids, SAMe, folic acid and L-tryptophan adjuvantly with antidepressants to enhance response and improve efficacy. Various nutrients also have emerging evidence as effective adjuncts with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. While some evidence supports nutritional adjuvancy with various psychopharmacotherapies, adjuvant use of herbal therapies has not been sufficiently studied to warrant standard clinical application. This remains a promising area of research via robust, safety-conscious studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: This review aimed to find relevant published studies on the co-morbidity of autism and Asperger's syndrome with psychotic, anxiety and/or mood disorders, assess them, synthesize the findings, present an overview and make recommendations for future research. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed using several databases. Selected articles had to describe an original study that provided prevalence and/or incidence estimates on autism and/or Asperger's syndrome co-morbidity with psychotic, anxiety and/or mood disorders. Results and Conclusion: There is conflicting evidence regarding the frequency of schizophrenia in this population. Depression appears to be common, although most individuals with autism do not have sufficient language skills to verbalize changes in mood. Anxiety disorders represent the most common psychiatric co-morbidity in this population. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The Clean Water Act mandates that the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of our nation's waters be maintained and restored. Physical integrity has often been defined as physical habitat integrity, and as such, data collected during biological monitoring programs focus primarily on habitat quality. However, we argue that channel stability is a more appropriate measure of physical integrity and that channel stability is a foundational element of physical habitat integrity in low-gradient alluvial streams. We highlight assessment tools that could supplement stream assessments and the Total Maximum Daily Load stressor identification process: field surveys of bankfull cross-sections; longitudinal thalweg profiles; particle size distribution; and regionally calibrated, visual, stream stability assessments. Benefits of measuring channel stability include a more informed selection of reference or best attainable stream condition for an Index of Biotic Integrity, establishment of a baseline for monitoring changes in present and future condition, and indication of channel stability for investigations of chemical and biological impairments associated with sediment discontinuity and loss of habitat quality.

AB  - Objectives: In many cultures, postpartum rituals are observed because they are believed to have beneficial mental health effects. Our systematic review examines the research literature investigating the effects of postpartum rituals on postpartum depression (PPD) to determine if the rituals protect against PPD.
   Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched (from 1966 to October 3 1, 2008). Reference lists of relevant articles and links to related articles were also examined. Both qualitative and quantitative studies that focused on traditional practices and rituals in the postpartum period (that is, within the first year following childbirth) and their relation to PPD or mood were included.
   Results: Seventy-two studies were considered, with 12 meeting the inclusion criteria. The data were summarized according to the type of ritual including: organized support, diet, and other or multiple postpartum practices, and evidence for or against a protective effect on PPD. Although limited, not all studies suggested that the rituals prevent PPD. Overall, there is some evidence that postpartum rituals dictating appropriate and wanted social support may be of some protective value, depending on numerous contextual factors.
   Conclusions: This area needs more culturally sensitive and systematic research. Current studies suggest that the key protective element may be the presence of welcome support rather than the specific ritual.

AB  - Following my article on Vaslav Nijinsky's L'Apres-midi d'un Faune (1912), I turn my attention to Jeux, the first of Ninsky's two choreographies for the 1913 season of the Ballets Russes. Made to a commissioned score by Claude Debussy, Jeux (Games) dealt with the chance meeting of three sporty young people in a twilit garden or park. Based on contemporary responses and the choreographer's notations to Debusg"s manuscript score, I discuss how Jeux addressed modern life and what In this disconcerted the audiences of the Ballets Russes. Although the work disappeared after only one season, I argue it brings to the fore questions of canonistly and success that are still relevant Ill our discourse of art, today.

AB  - This study examined trace-element concentrations in 39 sediment samples collected in the vicinity of the abandoned Coval da Mo mine. and evaluated the anthropogenic contaminant effects and other environmental variables in the taxonomic composition. structure and morphological changes of benthic diatom communities.
   The results show the existence of extremely high contamination in Pb, Zn and Cd (the mean values exceed the background values 376, 96 and 19 times, respectively) on the first 2.5 km in the water flow direction. Also Co, Cu, Mn and Ni are present in high concentrations. Dilution by relatively uncontaminated sediment reduces metal concentrations downstream, but Zn concentrations increase downstream Filvida stream, as a result of several factors such as sewage and agriculture.
   To evaluate the biological effects caused by Pb, Cd and Zn, three sites were selected. In the stressed environment near the mining area (C232), diatoms were extremely rare. however there was a slight recovery at site C79 located 2 km downstream. Fragilaria capucina var. rumpens, Fragilaria cf. crotonensis and Achnanthidium minutissimum showed abnormal valves which may be related to high levels of metals.
   Six km downstream. in Filvida stream (C85), an increase in species richness and diversity was registered while the relative percentage of valve teratologies was lower. In the absence of OM, nutrients and low pH the diatom community patterns must be attributed to the metal concentration at some sites. Considering that community diversity can be affected by abiotic and biotic variables and valve deformations are caused by a small number of variables, basically metals, and acid conditions, we consider the presence of teratologies as an indication of the presence of metals.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally regarded as a movement disorder. In recent years, however, non-motor symptoms have been considered significant factors of disability at all stages of the illness. Behavioral and psychological symptoms or neuropsychiatric syndromes associated with PD are frequent and may represent a challenge in the management of these patients. They include anxiety, depression, psychosis, sleep, sexual and impulse control disorders, apathy and cognitive dysfunction. Their pathogenesis in PD is complex, involving neurodegenerative, drug-related and psychological mechanisms. We will review the current knowledge of this growing field, also focusing on the management of theses syndromes.

AB  - The repertoire of biochemicals (or small molecules) present in cells, tissue, and body fluids is known as the metabolome. Today, clinicians utilize only a very small part of the information contained in the metabolome, as revealed by the quantification of a limited set of analytes to gain information on human health. Examples include measuring glucose or cholesterol to monitor diabetes and cardiovascular health, respectively. With a focus on comprehensively studying the metabolome, the rapidly growing field of metabolomics captures the metabolic state of organisms at the global or "-omics" level. Given that the overall health status of an individual is captured by his or her metabolic state, which is a reflection of what has been encoded by the genome and modified by environmental factors, metabolomics has the potential to have a great impact upon medical practice by providing a wealth of relevant biochemical data. Metabolomics promises to improve current, single metabolites-based clinical assessments by identifying metabolic signatures (biomarkers) that embody global biochemical changes in disease, predict responses to treatment or medication side effects (pharmachometabolomics). State of the art metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools are being used to map potential biomarkers for a multitude of disorders including those of the central nervous system (CNS). Indeed, CNS disorders are linked to disturbances in metabolic pathways related to neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, serotonin, GABA and glutamate); fatty acids such as arachidonic acid-cascade; oxidative stress and mitochondrial function. Metabolomics tools are enabling us to map in greater detail perturbations in many biochemical pathways and links among these pathways this information is key for development of biomarkers that are disease-specific. In this review, we elaborate on some of the concepts and technologies used in metabolomics and its promise for biomarker discovery. We also highlight early findings from metabolomic studies in CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

AB  - Anxiety has always been part of the human condition, with accounts of its various manifestations, including acute shyness and stage fright, dating back to classical antiquity. Nonetheless, since the end of the Second World War, reported levels of anxiety have risen alarmingly. At the beginning of the 21st century, anxiety disorders constitute the most prevalent mental health problem around the globe, afflicting millions of people. What social factors account for this stunning development in the mental health field during the past half century? Some observers target the ever increasing pace and demands of modem life. Nonetheless, a larger body of evidence suggests that the prevalence of anxiety is due less to these pressures themselves than to a prevailing social ethos that teaches people that anxiety-related symptoms are a socially and medically legitimate response to life in the modem age.

AB  - Insomnia and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with significant impairment and disability. There is evidence that insomnia and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur, in addition to both being highly comorbid with major depressive disorder. Thus, it is important for health care providers to be familiar with the literature in this area. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine the empirical literature on the co-occurrence of insomnia and anxiety disorders, as well as discuss the clinical and research implications of the findings. Studies were identified through PubMed and PsycINFO searches (1975-2007) and a bibliographic review of published articles. The results from this literature review suggest that certain anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, are clearly associated with symptoms of insomnia (eg, delayed sleep onset, restless sleep). Although there are some discrepancies in the literature, the findings suggest that individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder also experience significant sleep problems (eg, middle-of-the-night insomnia, poor sleep quality, nightmares), and the presence of such problems during the early posttrauma period predicts later development of the disorder. Few empirical studies examine sleep in other anxiety disorders, and the majority of studies on insomnia and anxiety disorders in general have not examined the effects of comorbid major depressive disorder, indicating a need for additional research. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of screening for and treating anxiety symptoms when a patient presents with symptoms of insomnia and vice versa. Clearly, treatment development work on interventions that address co-occurring insomnia and anxiety disorders is greatly needed.

AB  - As the field of attachment has expanded over the past four decades, the perturbations in the relational context which give rise to disturbances of attachment are increasingly, though by no means conclusively, understood. In Part 1, this article reviews the historical and current state of research regarding normative attachment classification, the diagnosis of Reactive Attachment Disorder, and the proposed categories of Secure Base Distortions and Disrupted Attachment Disorder. In Part 11, the article explores the role of parental psychopathology and the manner in which disturbed caregiver self-regulation leads to disturbances in the mutual regulation between caregiver and infant. The question of the relationship between particular types of maternal pathology and particular forms of attachment disturbance is examined through recent research on the association between maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Atypical Maternal Behavior, and child scores on the Disturbances of Attachment Interview (DAI). The authors present original research findings to support that the presence and severity of maternal violence-related PTSD were significantly associated with secure base distortion in a community pediatrics sample of 76 mothers and preschool-age children. Clinical implications and recommendations for treatment of attachment disturbances conclude the article.

KW  - animal evolution
AB  - Anxiety is an instinct that may have developed to promote adaptive survival by evading unnecessary danger. However, excessive anxiety is disruptive and can be a basic disorder of other psychiatric diseases such as depression. The KF-1, a ubiquitin ligase located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), may prevent excessive anxiety; kf-1(-/-) mice exhibit selectively elevated anxiety-like behavior against light or heights. It is surmised that KF-1 degrades some target proteins, responsible for promoting anxiety, through the ER-associated degradation pathway, similar to Parkin in Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin, another ER-ubiquitin ligase, prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by degrading the target proteins responsible for PD. Molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that the prototype of kf-1 appeared in the very early phase of animal evolution but was lost, unlike parkin, in the lineage leading up to Drosophila. Therefore, kf-1(-/-) mice may be a powerful tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in emotional regulation, and for screening novel anxiolytic/antidepressant compounds.

AB  - Motor imagery is viewed as a window to cognitive motor processes and particularly to motor control. Mental simulation theory [Jeannerod, M., 2001. Neural simulation of action: a unifying mechanism for motor cognition. NeuroImage 14, 103-109] stresses that cognitive motor processes such as motor imagery and action observation share the same representations as motor execution. This article presents an overview of motor imagery studies in cognitive psychology and neuroscience that support and extend predictions from mental simulation theory. In general, behavioral data as well as fMRI and TMS data demonstrate that motor areas in the brain play an important role in motor imagery. After discussing results on a close overlap between mental and actual performance durations, the review focuses specifically on studies reporting an activation of primary motor cortex during motor imagery. This focus is extended to studies on motor imagery in patients. Motor imagery is also analyzed in more applied fields such as mental training procedures in patients and athletes. These findings support the notion that mental training procedures can be applied as a therapeutic tool in rehabilitation and in applications for power training. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Context: Wisdom is a unique psychological trait noted since antiquity, long discussed in humanities disciplines, recently operationalized by psychology and sociology researchers, but largely unexamined in psychiatry or biology.
   Objective: To discuss recent neurobiological studies related to subcomponents of wisdom identified from several published definitions/descriptions of wisdom by clinical investigators in the field, ie, prosocial attitudes/behaviors, social decision making/pragmatic knowledge of life, emotional homeostasis, reflection/self-understanding, value relativism/tolerance, and acknowledgment of and dealing effectively with uncertainty.
   Data Sources: Literature focusing primarily on neuroimaging/brain localization and secondarily on neuro-transmitters, including their genetic determinants.
   Study Selection: Studies involving functional neuroimaging or neurotransmitter functioning, examining human ( rather than animal) subjects, and identified via a PubMed search using keywords from any of the 6 proposed subcomponents of wisdom were included.
   Data Extraction: Studies were reviewed by both of us, and data considered to be potentially relevant to the neurobiology of wisdom were extracted.
   Data Synthesis: Functional neuroimaging permits exploration of neural correlates of complex psychological attributes such as those proposed to comprise wisdom. The prefrontal cortex figures prominently in several wisdom sub-components (eg, emotional regulation, decision making, value relativism), primarily via top-down regulation of limbic and striatal regions. The lateral prefrontal cortex facilitates calculated, reason-based decision making, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex is implicated in emotional valence and prosocial attitudes/behaviors. Reward neurocircuitry (ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens) also appears important for promoting prosocial attitudes/behaviors. Monoaminergic activity (especially dopaminergic and serotonergic), influenced by several genetic polymorphisms, is critical to certain subcomponents of wisdom such as emotional regulation (including impulse control), decision making, and prosocial behaviors.
   Conclusions: We have proposed a speculative model of the neurobiology of wisdom involving frontostriatal and frontolimbic circuits and monoaminergic pathways. Wisdom may involve optimal balance between functions of phylogenetically more primitive brain regions (limbic system) and newer ones (prefrontal cortex). Limitations of the putative model are stressed. It is hoped that this review will stimulate further research in characterization, assessment, neurobiology, and interventions related to wisdom.

AB  - In this review we are concerned specifically with the putative role of the default-mode network (DMN) in the pathophysiology of mental disorders. First, we define the DMN concept with regard to its neuroanatomy, its functional organisation through low frequency neuronal oscillations, its relation to other recently discovered low frequency resting state networks, and the cognitive functions it is thought to serve. Second, we introduce methodological and analytical issues and challenges. Third, we describe putative mechanisms proposed to link DMN abnormalities and mental disorders. These include interference by network activity during task performance, altered patterns of antagonism between task specific and non-specific elements, altered connectively and integrity of the DMN, and altered psychological functions served by the network DMN.

AB  - Psychiatric comorbidities are common among patients with schizophrenia. Substance abuse comorbidity predominates. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are also very common throughout the course of illness, with an estimated prevalence of 15% for panic disorder, 29% for posttraumatic stress disorder, and 23% for obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is estimated that comorbid depression occurs in 50% of patients, and perhaps (conservatively) 47% of patients also have a lifetime diagnosis of comorbid substance abuse. This article chronicles these associations, examining whether these comorbidities are "more than chance" and might represent (distinct) phenotypes of schizophrenia. Among the anxiety disorders, the evidence at present is most abundant for an association with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additional studies in newly diagnosed antipsychotic-naive patients and their first-degree relatives and searches for genetic and environmental risk factors are needed to replicate preliminary findings and further investigate these associations.

AB  - To estimate the prevalence of criminal victimization among people with severe mental illness and to explore risk factors.
   Four databases (MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, ERIC, and AMED) were searched for articles published between January 1966 and August 2007, supplemented with hand-search of reference lists from retrieved papers. The author and a Medical Doctor independently abstracted data and assessed study quality. Disagreements were resolved by consensus after review of the article and the review protocol.
   Nine studies, including 5195 patients, were identified. Prevalence estimates of criminal victimization ranged from 4.3% to 35.04%. Rates of victimization among severely mentally ill persons were 2.3-140.4 times higher than those in the general population. Criminal victimization was most frequently associated with alcohol and/or illicit drug use/abuse, homelessness, more severe symptomatology, and engagement in criminal activity.
   Prevention and intervention programs should target high-risk groups and improve patients' mental health and quality of life.

AB  - In childhood, mental health problems primarily consist of behaviour and emotional problems. These affect one in every seven children (i.e. 200 000 in Australia). Left untreated, up to 50% of preschool problems continue through the childhood years. Because of their high prevalence, population-based approaches will be needed to reduce their associated burden. The aim of the present study was therefore to identify evidence-based preventive interventions for behavioural and emotional problems of children aged 0-8 years. Randomized controlled trials of preventive interventions for behavioural and emotional problems were located by searching standard clinical databases and systematic reviews. The authors determined which programmes were effective and ineffective, dividing the effective programmes into those with high or low risk of trial bias. Among effective programmes, the most promising for delivery in Australian contexts were identified, selected for their strength of evidence, sample comparability to Australia's population, and programme compatibility with Australia's service system. Around 50 preventive interventions have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. Most targeted children's behavioural problems, and a few targeted emotional problems. Three US programmes have the best balance of evidence: in infancy, the individual Nurse Home Visitation Programme; at preschool age, the individual Family Check Up; at school age, the Good Behaviour Game class programme. Three parenting programmes in England and Australia are also worthy of highlight: the Incredible Years group format, Triple P individual format, and Parent Education Programme group format. Effective preventive interventions exist primarily for behaviour and, to a lesser extent, emotional problems, and could be disseminated from research to mainstream in Australia, ensuring fidelity to original programmes. Future research should develop programmes targeting emotional problems, and replicate effective programmes for behaviour problems in quality population translation trials. Randomized trial methods in staged roll-outs can determine population cost-benefits for children's mental health without delaying dissemination.

AB  - The relationship between physical activity and mental health has been widely investigated, and several hypotheses have been formulated about it. Specifically, during the aging process, physical exercise might represent a potential adjunctive treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment, helping delay the onset of neurodegenerative processes. Even though exercise itself might act as a stressor, it has been demonstrated that it reduces the harmful effects of other stressors when performed at moderate intensities. Neurotransmitter release, neurotrophic factor and neurogenesis, and cerebral blood flow alteration are some of the concepts involved. In this review, the potential effects of exercise on the aging process and on mental health are discussed, concerning some of the recent findings on animal and human research. The overwhelming evidence present in the literature today suggests that exercise ensures successful brain functioning. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Nutrition disorders arise from various interacting factors: cultural, environmental, genetic, physiological, and psychological. Excessive consumption of highly processed food, sugar, salt, alcohol, and saturated fats is a problem nowadays, and consumption of fish, vegetables, and fruit is insufficient. Overeating and an unbalanced diet are often accompanied by stress and a lack of physical activity. This is intensified by easy access to "comfort food", "fast food", and "junk food". The number of people suffering from overweight and obesity, so-called diseases of civilization, is increasing. Not only is being overweight a risk factor for the development many other metabolic diseases, but it also significantly worsens the quality of life. This also concerns people working at sea. Obesity is favoured by emotional eating disorders (EED), uncontrolled/compulsive eating - binge eating disorders ( BED), and night eating disorders (NED). Most frequently, eating is a reaction to stress or boredom. It alleviates tension and improves the mood, also of seafarers.

AB  - Several lines of evidence have shown that traumatic events during the early postnatal period precipitate long-lasting alterations in the functional properties underlying emotional expression that are attributable to the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders. In this chapter, we summarize our recent work elucidating whether early postnatal stress alters the neural circuits underlying emotional regulation. Rats exposed to footshock stress (FS) during the second (2W) or the third (3W) postnatal week were subjected to unconditioned and conditioned stresses at the postadolescent period (10-12 weeks). No differences in locomotor activity or hippocampal synaptic changes were observed between the FS-groups and non-FS controls during exposure to open field stress. Fear-related freezing behavior during exposure to contextual fear conditioning (CFC) was markedly attenuated in the 2W-FS group, presumably due to disturbance of the retention for fear memory, an effect that was attributable to synaptic changes in the hippocampal CA1 field. The 3W-FS group exhibited attenuation of the decreases in freezing behavior induced by CFC extinction trials. The deficits in extinction was abolished by repeated treatment with the partial N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist D-cycloserine, suggesting that aversive stress exposure during the third postnatal week impaired extinction of context-dependent fear memory. Taken together, the altered behavior observed in adulthood is likely the result of neurodevelopmental perturbations elicited by early life stress. Thus, a "critical period" exists for neural circuits involved in emotional expression that may contribute to lifelong susceptibility to stress.

AB  - Introduction: Although anxiety is a common psychiatric complication of Parkinson's disease (PD), it has received little attention compared to depression in PD, being still an under-recognized and under-diagnosed condition in clinical practice. Objective: To review general aspects of the association between anxiety and PD concerning prevalence, etiopathogenesis, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and treatment. Method: The basic and clinical literature on anxiety and PD was reviewed via the Pubmed, Lilacs and Scielo indexing services, using the keywords anxiety, etiology, prevalence, treatment, Parkinson, and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, complementary information was extracted from the reference lists of the articles found in the search. Results: Up to 67% of PD patients present clinically significant anxiety levels. Oscillations in anxious symptoms may be related to the use of anti-Parkinson drugs and motor fluctuations. The association between anxiety in PD and depressive disorders sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment has also been proposed as a possible explanation for this psychiatric complication. Thus far, few data on the treatment of anxiety disorders in PD are available. Conclusions: More studies investigating aspects such as prevalence, etiopathogenesis, comorbidities, impact on life quality, and treatment are necessary and opportune in order to facilitate the recognition and diagnosis of anxiety disorders in PD.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BP) is among the top ten most disabling illnesses worldwide. This review includes findings from recent studies employing functional neuroimaging to examine functional abnormalities in neural systems underlying core domains of the psychopathology in BP: emotion processing, emotion regulation and executive control, and common comorbid features of BP, that are relevant to the wide spectrum of BP rather than focused on the more traditional BPI subtype, and that may facilitate future identification of diagnostically-relevant biomarkers of the disorder. In addition, an emerging number of studies are reviewed that demonstrate the use of neuroimaging to elucidate biomarkers whose identification may help to (1) identify at-risk individuals who will subsequently develop the illness to facilitate early intervention, (2) identify targets for treatment and markers of treatment response. The use of newer neuroimaging techniques and potential confounds of psychotropic medication upon neuroimaging findings in BP are also examined. These approaches will help to improve diagnosis and the mental well-being of all individuals with BP.

AB  - This review article summarizes the potential role of circadian rhythmicity and melatonin in psychiatric disorders. The melatonin rhythm, with high blood levels at night and low values during the day, is a reflection of the biological clock, i.e., the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receive information about the prevailing light: dark conditions from specialized ganglion cells (only 1-2% of the total ganglion cells) in the retina. These unique cells contain a newly-discovered photopigment, melanopsin, which responds to a rather narrow band width of light that peaks at roughly 480 nm. The axons of these ganglion cells project via the retinohypothalamic tract through the optic nerve to the SCN, located just above the optic chiasm in the anterior hypothalamus. Via this pathway, light defected by the retina synchronizes the circadian clock to precisely 24 hours. In the absence of light, i.e., darkness, the SCN signals the pineal gland to produce melatonin via a complex neural pathway that involves fibers that project from the hypothalamus to the preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the infermediolaterol cell column of the upper thoracic cord. Axons of these neurons exit the spinal cord to eventually synapse on neurons in the superior cervical ganglia. Then, postganglionic fibers convey the information to the pineal gland mediating the nighttime rise in melatonin synthesis. Because melatonin is only elevated at night, it is referred to as the,chemical expression of darkness,,. Disturbances in the rhythmicity of the biological clock and/or the melatonin rhythm likely contribute to psychophysiological disturbances and mood disorders.
   Major disturbances occur in circadian rhythmicity when light, which activates the SCN and inhibits melafonin production, is imposed during the normal dark period. Thus, even brief periods of light at night are readily detected by the specialized ganglion cells mentioned above; this sets off a chain of events that alter biological clock physiology and depresses nighttime melatonin levels when they should be elevated. Depressed circulating melatonin levels at night provide misinformation to all cells that can,read the message. This misinformation contributes to alterations in mood and negative psychological feelings of well-being. Melatonin has several major functions which probably assist in protecting humans from psychiatric illnesses. This indoleamine is widely known as a sleep-promoting factor. As such, it reduces the latency to sleep onset and improves sleep hygiene.
   Melatonin has been tested for its beneficial effects on sleep in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, in individuals with delayed sleep phase syndrome and in elderly patients with insomnia. In each of these situations, melatonin has proven to be beneficial. Sleep disturbances are often associated with and probably contribute to psychiatric illness.
   Melatonin is also a potent free radical scavenger and antioxidant. It, as well as several of its metabolites, are powerful protectors against oxidative stress and free radical-mediate', mitochondrial-dependent cellular apoptosis. Melalonin seems to be particularly effective in protecting the brain from oxidative mutilation and loss of cells resulting from apoptosis. Given that a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Alzheimer disease, parkinsonism', amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have a free radical component, it is assumed that melatonin may be useful in forestalling the consequences of these debilitating conditions and improving the psychological makeup of these patients. Preliminary clinical trials suggest melatonin will be useful in this regard.
   A major action of melatonin in the Central Nervous System is protection of the neuronal cyloskeleton from oxidative damage. Structural damage to the cyfoskeleton is consequential in the function of neurons and is not uncommonly associated with psychological illness and with neurodegenerative diseases. For example, tauopathies (tai is an important cytoskeletal protein) contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. Damage to the tai protein, resulting from the hyperphosphorylation of this important molecule, disrupts intraneuronal microtubules and alters synaptic physiology.
   The destruction of normal cytoskeletal function is often a result of excessive free radial generation. The free radical-mediated changes result in loss of neuronal polarization and cells die of apoptosis leading to neurobehavioral disorders and dementia. Given that melatonin is an antioxidant, it has been tested for its efficacy in reducing damage to the cytoskeleton as well as limiting the behavioral effects. In this capacity melatonin has been found highly effective in reducing damage to essential cyfoskeletal elements and improving neurobehavioral outcomes.
   Overall, melatonin may well find utility in reducing neural deterioration with age as well as improving the psychological wellbeing of individuals. Melatonin is an inexpensive non-toxic molecule which should be considered for use in a number of psychiatric diseases and circadian rhythm disorders.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to review the ways in which contemporary medicine addresses physical/psychiatric multimorbidity, to review the underlying concepts and methodologies used, and to propose a novel approach that may help consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) position itself better in the health-care field. A Medline search of the terms 'consultation-liaison psychiatry', 'integrated care', 'quality assurance' and 'qualitative methodology', was complemented by study of the literature on complexity theory and by discussions with colleagues in both the health science and sociology fields. There is a growing realization that presentation with multimorbidity of both physical and psychiatric disorders is the norm. Other health-care disciplines have responded quickly to meeting the multiple and complex needs of such patients, attracting funding to an extent that CLP has been unable to achieve. Uncritical application, however, of integrated care technology based on evidence from randomized controlled trials has produced disappointing results. There is a growing realization that such quantitative methods need to be complemented by in-depth exploration using non-traditional methods including qualitative ones, and drawing on complexity theory. The Cochrane Collaboration is exploring this. As CLP and other medical and health-care disciplines face the challenge of patients with multimorbidity, they need to find acceptable answers to the question of what works for whom in what context for patients with multiple and complex needs. CLP can contribute its rich experience in the qualitative approaches that will be needed in research addressing this question, but needs help from other disciplines to refine its techniques so that its contributions are considered valid. The context for implementing effective interventions derived from such studies will in future be that of transdisciplinary teams whose mode of working is empirically based and transparent. CLP is well placed by dint of its psychodynamic and systems theory roots to provide leadership in this transformation in health-care delivery.

AB  - A hill range of psychological processes has been put into play to explain judgment and choice phenomena. Complementing work on attention, information integration, and learning, decision research over the past 10 years has also examined the effects of goals, mental representation, and memory processes. In addition to deliberative processes, automatic processes have gotten closer attention, and the emotions revolution has put affective processes on a footing equal to cognitive ones. Psychological process models provide natural predictions about individual differences and Hespan changes and integrate across judgment and decision making (JDM) phenomena. "Mindful" JDM research leverages our knowledge about psychological processes into causal explanations for important judgment and choice regularities, emphasizing the adaptive use of an abundance of processing alternatives. Such explanations supplement and support existing mathematical descriptions of phenomena such as loss aversion or hyperbolic discounting. Unlike such descriptions, they. also provide entry points for interventions designed to help people overcome judgments or choices considered undesirable.

AB  - Objectives: Most of the neuroanatomical models of bipolar disorder (BD) propose a key role for the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We provide here a review of currently available data regarding the CC neuroimaging and neuropathological alterations in BD.
   Materials and methods: After an exploratory search of the MEDLINE, we first identified all English-written articles that provide separate data for BD patients and report original experimental data on cingulate gyrus. Subsequently, we selected those including neuroimaging or neuropathological data, Among the 161 articles updated through June 2007, 81 articles were retained using this procedure.
   Results: The review of in vivo volumetric imaging data, as well as ex vivo morphometric and histological studies indicates that BD patients show volume changes of the subgenual ACC (sgACC-BA 25 and part of 24) during the early stages of the disease. Whether this phenomenon is due to neuronal and glial depletion or damage of corticocortical connections is still a matter of debate. The resting state activity in the left BA 25 appears to be state dependent showing significant increase during mania and decrease during, depressive phases. The presence of a deficient GABAergic activity in ACC is also documented. Pharmacological treatment partly restores BD-related functional imaging changes.
   Conclusion: The present review reveals the striking discrepancies of the experimental results present both for functional and structural imaging studies but also for neuropathological analyses. Methodological and conceptual limitations are addressed with particular reference to the heterogeneity of BD clinical patterns. We also critically discuss the validity of CC changes as possible trait- or state-markers of the disease. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

   Method: A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify articles on neuroimaging genetics in major depression (MD).
   Results: Hippocampal volumes were found to be associated with polymorphisms in the promotor region of the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) in patients with MD. Met-allele carriers of the BDNF (val66met) polymorphism had smaller hippocampal volumes in both patients and healthy controls when compared with homozygous val-allele carriers. Polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) and 5-HT1a receptor are associated with increased amygdala activation investigated with functional MRI in patients with MD.
   Conclusion: Genetic variants seem to modulate the effects of stress on hippocampal volumes as well as amygdala activity as well as the development of the brain.

AB  - A review of published observational studies of neighbourhoods and depression/depressive symptoms was conducted to inform future directions for the field. Forty-five English-language cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that analysed the effect of at least one neighbourhood-level variable on either depression or depressive symptoms were analysed. Of the 45 studies, 37 reported associations of at least one neighbourhood characteristic with depression/depressive symptoms. Seven of the 10 longitudinal studies reported associations of at least one neighbourhood characteristic with incident depression. Socioeconomic composition was the most common neighbourhood characteristic investigated. The associations of depressive symptoms/depression with structural features (socioeconomic and racial composition, stability and built environment) were less consistent than with social processes (disorder, social interactions, violence). Among the structural features, measures of the built environment were the most consistently associated with depression but the number of studies was small. The extent to which these associations reflect causal processes remains to be determined. The large variability in studies across neighbourhood definitions and measures, adjustment variables and study populations makes it difficult to draw more than a few general qualitative conclusions. Improving the quality of observational work through improved measurement of neighbourhood attributes, more sophisticated consideration of spatial scale, longitudinal designs and evaluation of natural experiments will strengthen inferences regarding causal effects of area attributes on depression.

AB  - This review is based on a literature search made in January 2007 on request by the Danish National Board of Industrial Injuries. The search in PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO resulted in more than 1,000 publications. This was reduced to 14 after the titles, abstracts, and papers were evaluated by using the following criteria: 1) a longitudinal study, 2) exposure to work-related psychosocial factors, 3) the outcome a measure of depression, 4) relevant statistical estimates, and 5) nonduplicated publication. Of the 14 studies, seven used standardized diagnostic instruments as measures of depression, whereas the other seven studies used self-administered questionnaires. The authors found moderate evidence for a relation between the psychological demands of the job and the development of depression, with relative risks of approximately 2.0. However, indication of publication bias weakens the evidence. Social support at work was associated with a decrease in risk for future depression, as all four studies dealing with this exposure showed associations with relative risks of about 0.6. Even if this literature study has identified work-related psychosocial factors that in high-quality epidemiologic studies predict depression, studies are still needed that assess in more detail the duration and intensity of exposure necessary for developing depression.

AB  - Aims: Relatives of heart patients experience anxiety, uncertainty, and low quality of life, and the hospitalization of a heart patient is associated with increased risk of death for the partner. Relatives' physical and mental problems may be rectified by activities established by the health services to support relatives and to enable them to handle the situation. This study systematically reviewed the literature on the latest health service interventions targeting relatives of heart patients. Methods: The literature about interventions targeting relatives of heart patients has been systematically reviewed to clarify what the health services do for relatives of heart patients and to assess the effects of interventions. We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL database, CSA and the Cochrane Library from January 2000 to March 2006. Results: Only six scientific articles reported on interventions testing health service activities for relatives of heart patients, and one literature review scrutinized earlier studies within the field. All the interventions indicate positive effects on patients' and/or relatives' health and well-being, in accordance with nurses' assessments. Nevertheless, the few studies and their questionable quality means that full evidence on the effects of the interventions is lacking. Conclusions: Future research should clarify the evidence for health service interventions and draw up guidelines for activities for the relatives of heart patients.

AB  - The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the forebrain shows sexual dimorphism in its neuroanatomical connectivity and neurochemical characteristics. The structure is involved in many behavioral and motivational phenomena particularly related to coping with stress. Female rats differ from males in responding to stressful situations such as forced swimming and navigational learning in the water maze. It was previously shown that bilateral damage to the BNST in male Wistar rats aggravated depression as measured by forced swim tests, but did not impair navigational learning in the water maze. The present study extended the findings to female rats demonstrating that bilateral electrolytic lesions of the BNST increased immobility and decreased climbing compared to sham-operated controls, but failed to affect performance in them water maze. Additionally, lesions did not alter behavior in the open field and the elevated plus-maze tests suggesting not only that the modulation of depression by BNST lesions is specific, but also providing support for the view that the BNST may not necessarily be critically involved in anxiety.

AB  - Background: Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people may be at higher risk of mental disorders than heterosexual people.
   Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of mental disorder, substance misuse, suicide, suicidal ideation and deliberate self harm in LGB people. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cinahl, the Cochrane Library Database, the Web of Knowledge, the Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Sociological Abstracts, the Campbell Collaboration and grey literature databases for articles published January 1966 to April 2005. We also used Google and Google Scholar and contacted authors where necessary. We searched all terms related to homosexual, lesbian and bisexual people and all terms related to mental disorders, suicide, and deliberate self harm. We included papers on population based studies which contained concurrent heterosexual comparison groups and valid definition of sexual orientation and mental health outcomes.
   Results: Of 13706 papers identified, 476 were initially selected and 28 (25 studies) met inclusion criteria. Only one study met all our four quality criteria and seven met three of these criteria. Data was extracted on 214,344 heterosexual and 11,971 non heterosexual people. Meta-analyses revealed a two fold excess in suicide attempts in lesbian, gay and bisexual people [ pooled risk ratio for lifetime risk 2.47 (CI 1.87, 3.28)]. The risk for depression and anxiety disorders (over a period of 12 months or a lifetime) on meta-analyses were at least 1.5 times higher in lesbian, gay and bisexual people (RR range 1.54-2.58) and alcohol and other substance dependence over 12 months was also 1.5 times higher (RR range 1.51-4.00). Results were similar in both sexes but meta analyses revealed that lesbian and bisexual women were particularly at risk of substance dependence (alcohol 12 months: RR 4.00, CI 2.85, 5.61; drug dependence: RR 3.50, CI 1.87, 6.53; any substance use disorder RR 3.42, CI 1.97-5.92), while lifetime prevalence of suicide attempt was especially high in gay and bisexual men (RR 4.28, CI 2.32, 7.88).
   Conclusion: LGB people are at higher risk of mental disorder, suicidal ideation, substance misuse, and deliberate self harm than heterosexual people.

AB  - Objectives: To identify psychosocial predictors of failure to return to work in non-chronic (lasting less than 3 months) non-specific low back pain (NSLBP).
   Methods: A systematic review of prognostic studies was carried out. Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and PEDro electronic bibliographic databases up to April 2006 were searched. Included studies took baseline measures in the non-chronic phase of NSLBP (ie, within 3 months of onset), included at least one psychosocial variable and studied a sample in which at least 75% of participants had NSLBP. Baseline measures had to be used to predict at least one work-specific outcome.
   Results: The search identified 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. From these studies there is strong evidence that recovery expectation is predictive of work outcome and that depression, job satisfaction and stress/psychological strain are not predictive of work outcome. There is moderate evidence that fear avoidance beliefs are predictive of work outcome and that anxiety is not predictive of work outcome. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether compensation or locus of control are predictive of work outcome.
   Conclusions: To predict work outcome in non-chronic NSLBP, psychosocial assessment should focus on recovery expectation and fear avoidance. More research is needed to determine the best method of measuring these constructs and to determine how to intervene when a worker has low recovery expectations.

AB  - Environmental stimulation throughout development adjusts the neurobehavioral systems involved in learning, memory and defensive responses. Environment-mediated phenotypic plasticity can be considered from two different, yet complementary, viewpoints. On one hand, the possibility that environmental interventions protect against the effects of genetic and/or acquired vulnerabilities, offers unprecedented avenues towards the elaboration and refinement of therapeutic strategies. On the other hand, an accurate understanding of the adaptive mechanisms regulating the interaction between an experimental subject and its environment may substantially benefit the quality of experimental data. Here we review experimental evidence showing that enriched environment can be beneficial in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders implicating the monoamine systems where it can (i) compensate for impairments in animal models of schizophrenia, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases; (ii) increase resistance to the addictive properties of psychostimulant drugs; (iii) level-out the consequences of prenatal stress in animal models of depression. Additionally we discuss why some of the effects of environmental enrichment question the validity Of Current animal models of mental disorders. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The effects of psychosocial risk factors on population health and health inequalities has featured prominently in epidemiological research literature as well as public health policy strategies. We have conducted a meta-review (a review of reviews) exploring how psychosocial factors may relate to population health in home and community settings.
   Methods: Systematic review (QUORUM) of literature reviews (published in any language or country) on the health associations of psychosocial risk factors in community settings. The literature search included electronic and manual searches. Two reviewers appraised included reviews using criteria for assessing systematic reviews. Data from the more robust reviews were extracted, tabulated and synthesised.
   Results: Thirty-one reviews met our inclusion criteria. These explored a variety of psychosocial factors including social support and networks, social capital, social cohesion, collective efficacy, participation in local organisations - and less favourable psychosocial risk factors such as demands, exposure to community violence or anti-social behaviour, exposure to discrimination, and stress related to acculturation to western society. Most of the reviews focused on associations between social networks/support and physical or mental health. We identified some evidence of favourable psychosocial environments associated with better health. Reviews also found evidence of unfavourable psychosocial risk factors linked to poorer health, particularly among socially disadvantaged groups. However, the more robust reviews each identified studies with inconclusive findings, as well as studies finding evidence of associations. We also identified some evidence of apparently favourable psychosocial risk factors associated with poorer health.
   Conclusion: From the review literature we have synthesised, where associations have been identified, they generally support the view that favourable psychosocial environments go hand in hand with better health. Poor psychosocial environments may be health damaging and contribute to health inequalities. The evidence that underpins our understanding of these associations is of variable quality and consistency. Future research should seek to improve this evidence base, with more longitudinal analysis (and intervention evaluations) of the effects of apparently under-researched psychosocial factors such as control and participation within communities. Future policy interventions relevant to this field should be developed in partnership with researchers to enable a better understanding of psychosocial mechanisms and the effects of psychosocial interventions.

AB  - Objectives: Major depression is a leading cause of psychiatric morbidity and may be influenced by psychosocial factors in the workplace, although evidence so far remains circumstantial. This paper reviews follow-up studies addressing the risk of major depression and depressive symptoms relative to psychosocial stressors in the working environment and evaluates the evidence for causality.
   Method: Follow-up studies were identified by a systematic Medline search combining search terms for the outcome and measures of job-related psychosocial factors. The quality of the studies was evaluated using 22 criteria related to their potential for bias and confounding.
   Results: Sixteen company or population-based studies including some 63 000 employees were identified. Validated multi-item scales were used to measure perceived psychosocial stressors in most of the studies. Major depression was defined by clinical criteria in seven studies and by symptom scales in another seven. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 13 years. The prevalence of depressive disorder varied substantially, suggesting a high degree of study heterogeneity. The adjusted relative risk for onset of a major depressive episode according to job stressors ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 in 44 of 61 reported associations with various psychosocial factor dimensions. Associations were strongest and most consistent for job strain defined as high demand and low decision latitude among men. Most studies shared common limitations such as lack of independent measures of exposure and outcome and potential confounding. Although a meta-analysis would technically be possible, heterogeneity across studies evidenced by variation in the prevalence of depression made this unfeasible.
   Conclusion: This review provides consistent findings that perception of adverse psychosocial factors in the workplace is related to an elevated risk of subsequent depressive symptoms or major depressive episode; however, methodological limitations preclude causal inference. Studies implementing objective measures of job stressors or independent outcome ascertainment are warranted.

AB  - Objective: Various studies have tested psychological therapies in the treatment of depression in primary care. Yet, concerns over their clinical effectiveness, as compared to usual general practitioner (GP) care or treatment with antidepressants, have been raised. The present meta-analysis was aimed at assessing currently available evidence on the topic.
   Method: A systematic search of electronic databases identified 10 randomized controlled trials comparing psychological forms of intervention with either usual GP care or antidepressant medication for major depression. Meta-analytical procedures were used to examine the impact of psychological intervention in primary care on depression, as compared to usual GP care and antidepressant treatment.
   Results: The main analyses showed greater effectiveness of psychological intervention over usual GP care in both the short term [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.59 to -0.26, n=408] and long term (SMD=-0.30, 95% CI=-0.45 to -0.14, n=433). The heterogeneity test was not significant in the short term at the P <.05 level (df=5, P=.57, I-2=0%), but it was significant in the long term (df=5, P=.004, I-2=70.9%). The comparison between psychological forms of intervention and antidepressant medication yielded no effectiveness differences, for either the short term or the long term.
   Conclusions: Psychological forms of intervention are significantly linked to clinical improvement in depressive symptomatology and may be useful for supplementing usual GP care. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Some basic questions about the epidemiology of major depression (MD) remain open to debate and interpretation. Prevalence is a case in point. There have been claims that prevalence has been both over and underestimated. This review is an attempt to reconcile this apparent contradiction.
   Method: A literature search was carried out using MEDLINE. Articles were screened for relevance in 2 stages and bibliographies were examined to identify additional relevant publications.
   Results: The claim that prevalence has been overestimated appears to hinge on a concern that current diagnostic criteria fail to adequately differentiate between pathological and nonpathological mood disturbances. These arguments pertain to the validity of diagnostic criteria rather than to the prevalence of the syndrome that the criteria define. Conversely, the claim that prevalence has been underestimated is based on studies providing evidence of recall bias. If DSM-IV criteria are accepted as a diagnostic definition, MD prevalence is considerably higher than usually cited figures. However, the same literature indicates that the spectrum of severity is much broader than is usually acknowledged. The DSM-IV criteria appear to be a poor proxy for treatment need in community populations.
   Conclusions: Increasing evidence suggests that MD is very common but also that DSM-IV and ICD-10 definitions capture such a broad spectrum of morbidity that they should not be regarded as de facto indicators of need, at least not in community populations.

AB  - Psychosocial stress is known to enhance anxiety levels in rodents. The present study evaluated the effect of long-term ingestion of ethanol (EtOH) on anxiety levels of male Long Evans rats housed either singly or in triads (three/cage). Based on measures of offensive and defensive behaviors, triad-housed rats were designated as being dominant, subdominant or subordinate. The effect of chronic ingestion of a 6% EtOH solution was assessed on behaviors in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and on air-puffs elicited 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USV). EtOH naive dominant rats showed less anxiogenic-like (open arms time) and displacement behavior (grooming), but more risk assessment behavior (stretch-attend postures) than their cage-mates or the single-housed rats. Intake of EtOH prior to the EPM test was lower in dominant and single-housed rats compared to subdominant and subordinate rats. Triad-housed rats, but not the single-housed rats, decreased their intake of EtOH after the EPM test. Overall, EtOH intake had an anxiolytic effect in all rats, but the effect was most prominent in single-housed rats. Furthermore, EtOH intake decreased air-puff induced USVs of triad-housed rats, but increased USVs of single-housed rats. These data indicate that housing condition and rank status influence the emotional state of male rats. Furthermore, the anxiolytic effect of voluntarily ingested EtOH was depended on these variables.

AB  - Objectives This study evaluated the effectiveness of interventions in reducing stress at work among health care workers.
   Methods A systematic search was conducted of the literature on reducing stress or burnout in health care workers. The quality of the studies found was then appraised and the results combined. A meta-analysis was performed when appropriate.
   Results Altogether 14 randomized controlled trials, three cluster-randomized trials, and two crossover trials, comprising 2812 participants, were included. Only two trials were of high quality. The following comparisons were possible: person-directed interventions versus no intervention, person-work interface interventions versus no intervention, and organizational interventions versus no intervention. Person-directed interventions can reduce stress [standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.85, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -1.21--0.49] and burnout, measured as emotional exhaustion [weighted mean difference (WMD) -5.82, 95% CI -11.02--0.63) and lack of personal accomplishment (WMD -3.61; 95% CI -4.65--2.58). They also reduce anxiety, measured as state anxiety (WMD -9.42, 95% CI -16.92--1.93) and trait anxiety (WMD -6.91, 95% CI -12.80--1.01). Person-work interface interventions can reduce burnout, measured as depersonalization [mean difference (MD) -1.14, 95% CI -2.18--0.10]. Organizational interventions can also reduce stress symptoms (MD -0.34; 95% CI -0.62--0.06) and general symptoms (MD -2.90,95% CI -5.16--0.64). No harmful effects were reported. Conclusions Limited evidence is available for a small, but probably relevant reduction in stress levels from person-directed, person-work interface, and organizational interventions among health care workers. This finding should lead to a more-active stress management policy in health care institutions. Before large-scale implementation can be advised, larger and better quality trials are needed.

AB  - There is controversy over whether childhood trauma (CT) is a causal factor in the development of psychosis. This review aims to identify and critically analyze the association between CT and psychotic disorders. Studies investigating CT and psychotic disorder were identified by searches of electronic databases and manual searches of references lists, and 46 studies were identified. Forty studies had no control group, only psychiatric control groups, or unmatched, nonpopulation control groups and thus had methodologies that were inadequate to determine the relationship between CT and psychosis. Six studies used appropriate control groups. Three studies found an association between CT and psychosis, 2 found potentially real associations that failed to reach statistical significance, and 1 found no association, tentatively suggesting a relationship between CT and psychotic disorders. Several methodological problems were found in the studies in the review, including the highest quality studies, which limit the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from them. These were lack of statistical power, lack of attention to moderating or mediating variables, the way in which CT was measured, and the use of cross-sectional research designs. These problems, some of which may be unavoidable in CT research, suggest the need for new and innovative methodologies in the investigation of CT and psychosis. Directions for further research are explored.

AB  - Genetic and environmental factors play a key role in psychiatric disorders. While some disorders display exceptionally high heritability, others show gene x experience x personality interactions, contributing complexity to psychiatric phenotypes. As some brain disorders frequently overlap and co-occur (representing a continuum Or spectrum of phenomena), modern psychiatry is shifting front "artificial" heterogeneity to the recognition of common elements in the pathogenesis of emotional, personality and behavioral disorders. Genetic animal models of these disorders represent an important direction of research, and are widely used to explore the role of different genes in brain mechanisms. Several concepts (such as endophenotypes, gene x environment interactions, and cross-species trait genetics) have been suggested for animal experimentation in this field. Here we develop a new concept based on targeting the complex interplay between different behavioral domains, meant to foster high-throughput phenotyping and integrative modeling of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Objective: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive in vivo method used to quantify metabolites that are relevant to a wide range of brain processes. This paper briefly describes neuroimaging using MRS and provides a systematic review of its application to anxiety disorders.
   Method: A literature review was performed in the PubMed, Lilacs and Scielo databases using the keywords spectroscopy and anxiety disorder. References of selected articles were also hand-searched for additional citations.
   Results: Recent studies have shown that there are significant metabolic differences between patients with anxiety disorders and healthy controls in various regions of the brain. Changes were mainly found in N-acetylaspartate, which is associated with neuronal viability, but some of them were also seen in creatine, a substance that is thought to be relatively constant among individuals with different pathological conditions.
   Conclusions: MRS is a sophisticated neuroimaging technique that has provided useful insights into the biochemical and neurobiological basis of many anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, its utilization in some anxiety disorders is still modest, particularly social phobia and generalised anxiety. Although it is an extremely useful advance in neuroimaging, further research in other brain areas and patient populations is highly advisable.

AB  - Objective: Neuroimaging of psychiatric disorders has increased exponentially in the last decade; however, much of the uptake thus far has been in the realm of research. We anticipate that clinical use of neuroimaging modalities in psychiatry will increase dramatically in the near future and suggest that clinicians need to be aware of the potential applications.
   Method: The authors conducted an extensive MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMED and PsychInfo search of the published literature (1965-2007) using a variety of search terms to find relevant articles. Bibliographies of retrieved papers were further scrutinised for publications of interest, as were indices of books. Articles that reported clinically significant findings and research reports conducted using pertinent neuroimaging modalities were reviewed in detail.
   Results: The review suggests that exciting neuroimaging advances are being made that have relevance to psychiatry. Novel neuroimaging applications with potential clinical utility are rapidly emerging and the accessibility and use of these technologies will increase in coming years. Clinically meaningful findings have begun to emerge in mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and dementia. Coupling multimodal imaging with genetics and pharmacotherapeutic studies will further assist in understanding the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.
   Conclusion: It is important that clinicians understand the benefits and limitations of modern neuroimaging techniques and are also suitably equipped to appraise future developments. The use of neuroimaging in evaluating psychopathology is likely to impact upon the future nosology of psychiatric disorders, and assist in diagnosis and clinical management. The integrated use of neuroimaging in conjunction with clinical assessments promises to improve clinical care and markedly alter psychiatric practice.

AB  - Vasopressin (Avp) is mainly synthesized in the magnocellular cells of the hypothalamic supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) whose axons project to the posterior pituitary. Avp is then released into the blood stream upon appropriate stimulation (e.g., hemorrhage or dehydration) to act at the kidneys and blood vessels. The brain also contains several populations of smaller, parvocellular neurons whose projections remain within the brain. These populations are located within the PVN, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), medial amygdala (MeA) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
   Since the 1950s, research examining the roles of Avp in the brain and periphery has intensified. The development of specific agonists and antagonists for Avp receptors has allowed for a better elucidation of its contributions to physiology and behavior. Anatomical, pharmacological and transgenic, including "knockout," animal studies have implicated Avp in the regulation of various social behaviors across species.
   Avp plays a prominent role in the regulation of aggression, generally of facilitating or promoting it. Affiliation and certain aspects of pair-bonding are also influenced by Avp. Memory, one of the first brain functions of Avp that was investigated, has been implicated especially strongly in social recognition. The roles of Avp in stress, anxiety, and depressive states are areas of active exploration. In this review, we concentrate on the scientific progress that has been made in understanding the role of Avp in regulating these and other behaviors across species. We also discuss the implications for human behavior. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It has been suggested that the recent rapid developments in the fields of neuroscience and psychopharmacology have increased the possibilities for pharmacological enhancement of mental functioning. Here, evidence is reviewed which shows that drugs acting on a variety of neurotransmitter systems can indeed enhance cognition, and to a lesser extent mood and pro-social behavior. Moreover, it seems possible to interfere with the (re)consolidation of traumatic memories. There are, however, a number of caveats: first, as cognition-enhancing drugs can simultaneously exert both linear and quadratic (U-shaped) effects, doses most effective in facilitating one behavior could at the same time exert null or even detrimental effects on other cognitive domains. Second, individuals with a 'low memory span' might benefit from cognition-enhancing drugs, whereas 'high span subjects' are 'overdosed'. And finally, evidence suggests that a number of trade-offs could occur. For example, increases of cognitive stability might come at the cost of a decreased capacity to flexibly alter behavior. A short overview of ethical issues raised by the use of cognition and mood enhancing drugs demonstrates the tremendous variety in views and opinions regarding the subject. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity has often been argued to play an important role in learning and memory. The discovery of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), the two most widely cited cellular models of synaptic plasticity, significantly spurred research in this field. Although correlative evidence suggesting a role for synaptic changes such as those seen in LTP and LTD in learning and memory has been gained in a number of studies, definitive demonstrations of a specific role for either LTP or LTD in learning and memory are lacking. In this review, we discuss a number of recent advancements in the understanding of the mechanisms that mediate LTP and LTD in the rodent hippocampus and focus on the use of subunit-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists and interference peptides as potential tools to study the role of synaptic plasticity in learning and memory. By using the modulation of synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory by acute stress as an example, we review a large body of convincing evidence indicating that alterations in synaptic plasticity underlie the changes in learning and memory produced by acute stress.

AB  - Current literature on the effects of chronic stress in general health converges to the concept of allostatic load (AL). AL is the bodily 'wear and tear' that emerges with sustained allostatic states. In the field of bipolar disorder (131)), AL offers an important clue as to why patients who undergo recurrent mood episodes are clinically perceived as less resilient. In addition, AL helps explaining the cumulative disruptive health effects of intermittent episodes and stressors. Stress- and episode-induced changes in brain regions involved in the emotional circuitry may lead to dysfunctional processing of information, which would render BD patients more vulnerable to subsequent environmental stressors, episodes, and drugs of abuse. Mood stabilizing agents exert opposite effects than chronic stress in neurons, increasing neuroprotective factors what may help to quench the cycle of affective episode recurrence and neural and bodily deterioration. Therefore, AL provides an explanatory link to apparently unrelated findings such as cognitive impairment and higher rates of physical comorbidity and mortality that are observed in the course of 1313 and further highlight the importance of effective long-term prophylaxis.

AB  - Background: The impending revisions of DSM- IV and ICD- 10 provide an excellent opportunity to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the current somatoform disorder classification. To prepare for these revisions, this study systematically investigates the validity of the current classification of somatoform disorders. Methods: We searched Medline, Psycinfo and reference lists to investigate convergent, divergent, criterion and predictive validity of the current somatoform disorder classification. Results: Substantial associations of somatoform disorders with functional impairment and elevated health care costs give evidence for the clinical and societal importance of somatoform disorders and for the convergent validity of the current operationalization. The specificity of the current somatoform disorder classification, i. e. their divergent validity, is demonstrated by the fact that functional somatic syndromes and their consequences are only partially explained by association with anxiety and depression. However, the imprecision of the diagnostic criteria, which are not based on positive criteria but on the exclusion of organic disease, largely limits the criterion validity of the current classification systems. Finally, studies investigating the predictive potential of somatoform disorders are lacking, and to date predictive validity has to be considered as low. Conclusions: The insufficient criterion and predictive validity of the present somatoform classification underlines the need to revise the diagnostic criteria. However, an abolishment of the whole category of somatoform disorders would ignore the substantial convergent and divergent validity of the current classification and would exclude patients with somatoform symptoms from the current health care system. A careful revision of the current somatoform disorder diagnoses, based on positive criteria of psychological, biological and social features, has the potential to substantially improve the reproducibility and clinical utility of the existing classification system.

AB  - Terrorism creates a ripple of fear and uncertainty. Although most individuals are resilient and recover over time, a minority remains functionally and psychologically impaired. In this paper, we examine research on coping strategies employed in the aftermath of terrorist events, theories and empirical findings related to appraisal processes that influence individuals' primary attributions of risk, and normative processes that shape secondary appraisals, which predict specific coping behaviors. We also describe individual diatheses and factors promoting resilience that may influence coping and functioning in the face of terrorism. Finally, we offer suggestions for future research.

AB  - Stress-related mood deterioration and affective disorders. such as depression, are among the leading causes of disease burden throughout the world, and are associated with severe medical consequences and mortality. Research has shown the involvement of dysfunctional brain serotonin (5-HT) biochemistry as a vulnerable biological factor in the onset of mood disturbances. Since the production of brain serotonin is limited by the availability of its plasma dietary amino acid precursor tryptophan, different foods and dietary amino acids that influence tryptophan availability are thought to after affective behavior by changing brain 5-HT synthesis. Most dietary manipulation Studies, however, reveal only modest affective changes, and note that these particularly occur in stress-prone or affected (sub-clinical) Subjects. The current paper briefly summarizes evidence for the involvement of diminished brain serotonin function in affective disorders, discusses how this can be assessed and influenced by dietary manipulation procedures, and also notes how beneficial effects of dietary brain serotonin manipulation on affective behavior may be mediated by stress-induced brain serotonin vulnerability.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to inform the development of policies and programmes to support children and young people's emotional wellbeing and mental health. It seeks to bring together findings both from recent systematic reviews, and from individual evaluation studies which have adopted a relatively rigorous methodology but whose findings have not to date been included in such analyses. Research undertaken in England is to be prioritised, to complement an existing evidence base comprised largely of findings from US-based research.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using five key search strategies, studies were categorised into three main categories - "demonstrably effective approaches", "promising approaches" and "approaches for which there is little or no supporting evidence" - according to robustness of evidence. Overall, 171 potentially relevant studies were identified, with 20 of these being robust enough for inclusion in the final review.
   Findings - In schools, sustained broad-based mental health promotion programmes combined with more targeted behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for those children with identifiable emotional wellbeing and mental health needs, offer evidence of a demonstrably effective approach. Early and brief intervention programmes which reduce waiting times for services appear promising approaches and seem to reduce the number of sessions a family require. There is a reasonably strong evidence base to support targeted work with both parents and children.
   Practical implications - By providing a detailed description of the successful initiatives reviewed, this paper should help policy-makers and practitioners to develop their work.
   Originality/value - By complementing the relatively narrow evidence base offered by systematic reviews, this more broadly based review offers policy-makers and practitioners in England an up-to-date, context-relevant guide for programme development within this field.

AB  - Objective: To review recent findings by DNA microarray in bipolar disorder (BD).
   Method: A literature search was performed.
   Results: Comprehensive gene expression analysis in the brain, peripheral blood cells, and olfactory neuroepithelium would be a promising strategy for the research of BD. To date, alterations in glutamate receptors (GR), mitochondria-related genes, chaperone genes, oligodendrocyte genes, and markers of gamma amino butyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons in postmortem brains are replicated by several different strategies. However, alterations in mitochondria-related genes are associated with agonal factors, sample pH, and effects of drugs. Analysis of blood cells showed altered endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway and other molecular cascades. Analysis of olfactory epithelium showed altered expression of genes associated with apoptosis.
   Conclusions: These findings warrant that comprehensive gene expression analysis by DNA microarray will be useful to identify the molecular cascades responsible for BD.

AB  - In this review, we report on studies that have assessed the effects of exogenous and endogenous increases in stress hormones on human cognitive performance. We first describe the history of the studies on the effects of using exogenous stress hormones such as glucocorticoids as anti-inflammatory medications on human cognition and mental health. Here, we summarize the cases that led to the diagnosis of glucocorticoid-induced 'steroid psychosis' in human populations and which demonstrated that these stress hormones could thus cross the blood-brain barrier and access the brain where they could influence cognition and mental health. We then summarize studies that assessed the effects of the exogenous administration of glucocorticoids on cognitive performance supported by the hippocampus, the frontal lobes and amygdala. In the second section of the paper, we summarize the effects of the endogenous release of glucocorticoids induced by exposure to a stressful situation on human cognition and we further dissociate the effects of emotion from those of stress on human learning and memory. Finally, in the last section of the paper, we discuss the potential impact that the environmental context to which we expose participants when assessing their memory could have on their reactivity to stress and subsequent cognitive performance. In order to make our point, we discuss the field of memory and aging and we suggest that some of the 'age-related memory impairments' observed in the literature could be partly due to increased stress reactivity in older adults to the environmental context of testing. We also discuss the inverse negative correlations reported between hippocampal volume and memory for young and older adults and suggest that these inverse correlations could be partly due to the effects of contextual stress in young and older adults, as a function of age-related differences in hippocampal volume.

AB  - Between 50 and 80% of the patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have been shown to be partially or totally lacking insight into the presence of their mental disorder. Although a causal chain connecting poor insight with poor treatment adherence and thus with poorer outcome and functioning is straight forward, numerous studies investigating correlates and long-term impact of insight have provided differing results. In addition, higher levels of insight in schizophrenia have been associated with depression and hopelessness, but the causal direction of the relationship is unclear and the data are inconclusive. The current study provides a critical review of 88 studies on the assessment of insight and its impact on symptoms and functioning. Studies published by June 2006 were selected using a keyword search for English peer-reviewed articles in the databases PsycINFO and MEDLINE. The majority of studies support the assumption that insight is associated with adherence during treatment phase, but the association with long-term adherence remains unclear. Insight correlates with better long-term functioning, but this might be explained by its association with symptoms. There is a positive cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between insight and depression, but the underlying processes need further clarification. In the concluding discussion, the problems relating to definition and study designs are considered responsible for many of the inconclusive findings. Suggestions for further research are derived.

AB  - Objective: The study of human anxiety disorders has benefited greatly from functional neuroimaging approaches. Individual studies, however, vary greatly in their findings. The authors searched for common and disorder-specific functional neurobiological deficits in several anxiety disorders. The authors also compared these deficits to the neural systems engaged during anticipatory anxiety in healthy subjects.
   Method: Functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and fear conditioning in healthy individuals were compared by quantitative meta-analysis. Included studies compared negative emotional processing to baseline, neutral, or positive emotion conditions.
   Results. Patients with any of the three disorders consistently showed greater activity than matched comparison subjects in the amygdala and insula, structures linked to negative emotional responses. A similar pattern was observed during fear conditioning in healthy subjects. Hyperactivation in the amygdala and insula were, of interest, more frequently observed in social anxiety disorder and specific phobia than in PTSD. By contrast, only patients with PTSD showed hypoactivation in the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex-structures linked to the experience and regulation of emotion.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis allowed us to synthesize often disparate findings from individual studies and thereby provide neuroimaging evidence for common brain mechanisms in anxiety disorders and normal fear. Effects unique to PTSD furthermore suggested a mechanism for the emotional dysregulation symptoms in PTSD that extend beyond an exaggerated fear response. Therefore, these findings help refine our understanding of anxiety disorders and their interrelationships.

AB  - Rats incorporate circa 22 kHz ultrasonic alarm cries into their defense pattern in response to a predator threat. These calls are dependent on conspecific presence, show gender differences, and tend to be emitted from a place of relative safety. Rats emit sonic defensive threat vocalizations when approached by a potential threat. These are emitted regardless of conspecific presence, and increase as a function of threat proximity, eventually culminating in defensive attack at close distances. Ample data from field studies suggest a similar division of vocalizations into alarm or warning cries, and defensive threat vocalizations, although both are often subsumed under the rubric of "alarm cries". A clear distinction between these types of calls is necessary for proper analysis of the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance of each of them. Furthermore, the integration of data from field studies and laboratory experiments may prove useful in evaluation of the relationship between each type of cry and emotional (fear or anxiety-like) states in mammals.

AB  - Background Post-traumatic stress disorder has had a substantial impact on employer liability for workplace psychological injury. The emergency services are an example of high-risk workforces that demand clear policies and procedures within an organization. The challenge is to minimize the injury to individuals and lessen the cost to organizations through the optimal application of preventative strategies.
   Methods This field is not well represented in standard keyword searches and Medline was examined with linked fields of practice and research. Consensus guidelines that refer to this domain were also utilized. Few conclusions can be reached from the literature which directly examined occupational settings.
   Results Organizations need to anticipate the possible traumatic exposures that may affect the workforce and have strategies to deal with the effects in the workplace, particularly the negative mental health outcomes in some personnel. This domain is relevant to all employers as accidents and violence are possible in most workplaces. Screening should be considered for high-risk individuals, particularly following a major traumatic event or cumulative exposure, such as in the emergency services. While psychological debriefing has no demonstrated benefit, the benefits of early intervention necessitate ready access to evidence-based treatments that have minimum barriers to care. Employers should be aware that distress may present indirectly in a similar way as conflict with management, poor performance and poor general health.
   Conclusion The knowledge about the impact of traumatic events obliges employers to have an active strategy to anticipate and manage the aftermath of such events as well as cumulative traumatic exposures.

AB  - Involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED) is underrecognized by clinicians, misdiagnosed as depression or bipolar disorder and undertreated, because clinicians are unfamiliar with the disorder. An important clinical consideration for IEED is that of distinguishing mood from affect. IEED describes a syndrome of relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and/or laughing, resulting from lesions of multiple types, in multiple brain regions, without an apparent stimulus to trigger such responses. This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD).

AB  - Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) family peptides play key roles in integrating neural responses to stress. Both major CRF receptors have been pharmacologically identified in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a stress sensitive and internally heterogeneous nucleus supplying many forebrain regions with serotonergic input. Despite the involvement of chronic stress and serotonergic dysfunction in human mood and anxiety disorders, little is known about the effects of chronic CRF receptor activation on the DRN. We infused ovine CRF (1 ng/h), urocortin II (UCNII, 1 ng/h), or vehicle alone into rat DRN over 6 days. During infusion, animals were allowed to freely explore an open field for 15 min on each of 2 days, with the addition of a novel object on the second day. Following behavioral testing, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT transporter (SERT), and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2) expression was examined through the DRN by in situ hybridization. Ovine CRF infusion resulted in significantly decreased novel object touches, climbs, as well as increased latency to first novel object contact. UCNII had a similar but less dramatic effect, decreasing only climbing behavior. Both ovine CRF and UCNII blunted the decrease in corner time expected on re-exposure to the open field. Both peptides also produced regionally specific changes in gene expression: 5-HT1A expression was increased 30% in the mid-rostral ventromedial DRN, while SERT was decreased by 30% in the mid-caudal shell dorsomedial DRN. There also appeared to be a shift in the relative level of Tph2 expression between the ventromedial and core dorsomedial DRN at the mid-rostral level. Changes in 5-HT1A, SERT, and relative Tph2 mRNA abundance were correlated with novel object exploration. These findings suggest chronic intra-DRN administration of CRF agonists decreases exploratory behavior, while producing subregionally limited changes in serotonergic gene expression. These studies may be relevant to mechanisms underlying behavioral changes after chronic stress. (C) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nuclei (STN) can result in depression despite the obvious motor improvement.
   Case presentations: Two patients with serious life-threatening depressive episodes are described. In the first case, the trigger for depression was a slight adjustment of the left stimulating electrode's contact. In the second case, reducing both the dopaminergic therapy and the voltage of DBS resulted in the manifestation of depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: DBS-induced depression possibly has pathogenetic differences from ordinary Parkinson's disease depression. The STN region seems to be a sensitive zone that influences emotions.

AB  - Background: There has been a growing interest in the effect that comorbid mental and somatic disorders may have on each other. Metabolic syndrome is an important risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and premature mortality.
   Objectives: To examine the association between various mental disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and other mental disorders) and metabolic syndrome and discuss the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms that may link specific mental disorders and metabolic syndrome.
   Method: A MEDLINE search, citing articles from 1966 onward, supplemented by a review of bibliographies, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Criteria used to identify studies included (1) English language, (2) published studies with original data in peer-reviewed journals.
   Results: Clinical investigation of the metabolic syndrome in patients with mental disorders, except schizophrenia, has been surprisingly scarce. Metabolic syndrome was reported in 19-63% of schizophrenic patients, in 42.4% of patients with schizo-affective disorder, in 24.6-50% of bipolar patients, in 12-36% of the patients with recurrent depression and in 31.9-35% of patients with combat posttraumatic stress disorder.
   Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome can contribute to significant morbidity and premature mortality and should be accounted for in the treatment of mental disorders. No definite or reliable insight into the pathophysiological link between metabolic syndrome and mental disorders is available.

AB  - Background: Monitoring brain processes in real time requires genuine subsecond resolution to follow the typical timing and frequency of neural events. Non-invasive recordings of electric (EEG/ERP) and magnetic (MEG) fields provide this time resolution. They directly measure neural activations associated with a wide variety of brain states and processes, even during sleep or in infants. Mapping and source estimation can localise these time-varying activation patterns inside the brain. Methods: Recent EEG/ERP research on brain functions in the domains of attention and executive functioning, perception, memory, language, emotion and motor processing in ADHD, autism, childhood-onset schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, specific language disorder and developmental dyslexia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression is reviewed. Results: Over the past two decades, electrophysiology has substantially contributed to the understanding of brain functions during normal development, and psychiatric conditions of children and adolescents. Its time resolution has been important to measure covert processes, and to distinguish cause and effect. Conclusions: In the future, EEG/ERP parameters will increasingly characterise the interplay of neural states and information processing. They are particularly promising tools for multilevel investigations of etiological pathways and potential predictors of clinical treatment response.

AB  - Aim: The emerging phase of psychotic disorders is pleomorphic and fluctuates in presentation. Hence, from a clinical perspective, treatment modalities are often unclear. This paper investigates the rational and potential use of neuroprotective agents in emerging psychotic disorders.
   Methods: Medline databases were searched from 1966 to 2006 followed by the cross-checking of references using following keywords: neuroprotection, apoptosis, natural cell death, neurodevelopment, plasticity, neurogenesis, combined with brain and schizophrenia.
   Results: Agents such as atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, omega-3 fatty acids, modulators of glutamateric neurotransmission (e. g. ampakines, glycine, memantine), erythropoietin, N-acetylcysteine, COX-2 inhibitors or antioxidants have neuroprotective (anti-apoptotic) properties and may therefore be able to protect brain maturational processes disturbed in emerging psychotic disorders. Clinical trials suggest that atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, omega-3 fatty acids and low-dose lithium as sole treatments were able to improve symptoms and functioning, and delay or in some cases even prevent the onset of frank psychosis. Initially these substances have been chosen because they have been used either as sole or augmentation treatments in established psychotic disorders. However, chronicity and already effective treatments may overshadow their potential clinical use in emerging (prodromal) psychosis.
   Conclusion: Neuroprotection as a new treatment paradigm for at-risk mental states seems to be promising and pilot data are suggestive that more benign interventions may already be sufficient to delay or even prevent the onset of frank psychosis. A coordinated research effort will be necessary to address the question which agents should be used under which circumstances.

AB  - Anxiety and depressive disorders are major public health problems, and desirable changes in lifestyle, such as exercise and proper nutrition, can be of great potential for prevention and treatment. There is growing evidence that physically active people are at a reduced risk of developing depression and that exercise interventions are associated with significant benefits for patients with mild to moderate forms of depression as well as in reducing anxiety. These findings have led to the proposal that exercise may serve as an alternative or a supplement to traditional forms of therapy. The prevalence of depression is lower in countries where the consumption of seafood is high, and omega-3 fatty acids seem to be beneficial in the management of mood disorders. Stimulants are often used as forms of self-medication in patients with anxiety or depressive disorders. Although providing short-term relief, they may have long-term adverse effects. This article presents a broad overview of research involving the efficacy of exercise as a means to treat depression and anxiety, as well as related issues regarding dosage and compliance. Research on the influence of nutrition and selected dietary supplements on depression and anxiety also are presented.

AB  - in a cyclical and recurring illness such as bipolar disorder, prodrome detection is of vital importance. This paper describes manic and depressive prodromal symptoms to relapse, methods used in their detection, problems inherent in their assessment, and patients' coping strategies. A review of the literature on the issue was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (1965-May 2006). 'Bipolar disorder', 'prodromes', 'early symptoms', 'coping', 'manic' and 'depression' were entered as key words. A hand search was conducted simultaneously and the references of the articles found were used to locate additional articles. The most common depressive prodromes are mood changes, psychornotor symptoms and increased anxiety; the most frequent manic prodromes are sleep disturbances, psychotic symptoms and mood changes. The manic prodromes also last longer. Certain psychological interventions, both at the individual and psychoeducational group level, have proven effective, especially in preventing manic episodes. Bipolar patients are highly capable of detecting prodromal symptoms to relapse, although they do find the depressive ones harder to identify. Learning detection, coping strategies and idiosyncratic prodromes are elements that should be incorporated into daily clinical practice with bipolar patients.

AB  - Stress plays a key role in pathogenesis of anxiety and depression. Animal models of these disorders are widely used in behavioral neuroscience to explore stress-evoked brain abnormalities, screen anxiolytic/antidepressant drugs and establish behavioral phenotypes of gene-targeted or transgenic animals. Here we discuss the current situation with these experimental models, and critically evaluate the state of the art in this field. Noting a deficit of fresh ideas and especially new paradigms for animal anxiety and depression models, we review existing challenges and outline important directions for further research in this field.

AB  - Objective: To provide a comprehensive review and evaluation of the psychological and neurophysiological literature pertaining to mindfulness meditation.
   Methods: A search for papers in English was undertaken using PsycINFO (from 1804 onward), MedLine (from 1966 onward) and the Cochrane Library with the following search terms: Vipassana, Mindfulness, Meditation, Zen, Insight, EEG, ERP, fMRI, neuroimaging and intervention. In addition, retrieved papers and reports known to the authors were also reviewed for additional relevant literature.
   Results: Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions appear to be effective in the treatment of depression, anxiety, psychosis, borderline personality disorder and suicidal/self-harm behaviour. Mindfulness meditation per se is effective in reducing substance use and recidivism rates in incarcerated populations but has not been specifically investigated in populations with psychiatric disorders. Electroencephalography research suggests increased alpha, theta and beta activity in frontal and posterior regions, some gamma band effects, with theta activity strongly related to level of experience of meditation; however, these findings have not been consistent. The few neuroimaging studies that have been conducted suggest volumetric and functional change in key brain regions.
   Conclusions: Preliminary findings from treatment outcome studies provide support for the application of mindfulness-based interventions in the treatment of affective, anxiety and personality disorders. However, direct evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation per se in the treatment of psychiatric disorders is needed. Current neurophysiological and imaging research findings have identified neural changes in association with meditation and provide a potentially promising avenue for future research.

AB  - Synchrony, a construct used across multiple fields to denote the temporal relationship between events, is applied to the study of parent-infant interactions and suggested as a model for intersubjectivity. Three types of timed relationships between the parent and child's affective behavior are assessed: concurrent, sequential, and organized in an ongoing patterned format, and the development of each is charted across the first year. Viewed as a formative experience for the maturation of the social brain, synchrony impacts the development of self-regulation, symbol use, and empathy across childhood and adolescence. Different patterns of synchrony with mother, father, and the family and across cultures describe relationship-specific modes of coordination. The capacity to engage in temporally-matched interactions is based on physiological mechanisms, in particular oscillator systems, such as the biological clock and cardiac pacemaker, and attachment-related hormones, such as oxytocin. Specific patterns of synchrony are described in a range of child-, parent- and context-related risk conditions, pointing to its ecological relevance and usefulness for the study of developmental psychopathology. A perspective that underscores the organization of discrete relational behaviors into emergent patterns and considers time a central parameter of emotion and communication systems may be useful to the study of interpersonal intimacy and its potential for personal transformation across the lifespan.

AB  - Evidence suggests that the early course of psychosis might be important in the long term outcome of the disease. Moreover, pharmacological treatment has important limitations in this population which has increased the interest in the combination of psychological and biological treatments. Recently, cognitive therapy has been modified and applied to the field of psychosis. For decades several studies have shown its effectiveness in the treatment of psychotic symptoms which has led to formulate new and more comprehensive cognitive treatments for early psychosis. These new cognitive approaches have been assessed in clinical trials. In the same way, the study of the pre-psychotic phase and prevention of illness is becoming important. Two aspects are especially relevant in this regards: the possibility of prospective detection of patients at risk of developing psychosis and the search for adequate treatments in this phase. Recent Studies concerning early and pre-onset psychosis cognitive treatment are reviewed by the authors.

AB  - Background: Psychiatric epidemiologic surveys since 1980 have relied heavily on a small number of survey diagnostic instruments for case ascertainment, which encode reports of respondents to highly structured interview questions delivered by interviewers without clinical training. Many validations of these survey diagnostic instruments have been carried out.
   Objective: This paper reviews the success of the survey diagnostic instruments, for eight diagnostic categories, in validations with a psychiatrist examination as the gold standard.
   Method: Public databases were searched for potentially relevant publications, of which more than 1000 were located. Tables show sensitivity, specificity, Kappa, sample source and size, survey instrument and validation method.
   Results: The number of validation studies relevant to the eight disorders ranged from 8 for schizophrenia to 29 for major depressive disorder. Reported sensitivities ranged from zero to 100%, and specificities from 22% to 100%.
   Conclusion: Results for common mental disorders such as major depressive disorder, alcohol disorder, drug disorder, and agoraphobic disorder are better than for panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The validity of case ascertainment in psychiatric epidemiology is still in question.

AB  - This article critically reviewed the research addressing the epidemiology and phenomenology of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents. Articles were identified through a search of Medline and Psychinfo. Findings indicate a lifetime prevalence of NSSI ranging from 13.0% to 23.2%. Reasons for engaging in NSSI include to regulate emotion and to elicit attention. Correlates of NSSI include a history of sexual abuse, depression, anxiety, alexithymia, hostility, smoking, dissociation, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behaviors. Suggested areas of future research include identifying the psychiatric diagnoses associated with NSSI among adolescents, determining the temporal link between NSSI and suicide attempts, learning more about the course of NSSI, understanding the biological underpinnings of NSSI, and identifying effective treatments for NSSI in adolescents.

AB  - One of the largest wetlands along the Gulf Coast of North America (ca. 150 000 ha) occurs around the shorelines of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas in southeastern Louisiana, just north and west of New Orleans. We provide an introduction to the environmental history of the marshes and swamps in the upper Lake Pontchartrain basin, a review of the existing vegetation patterns and their possible causes, and a discussion of restoration targets and priorities. The Mississippi River produced the St. Bernard Delta 3000-4000 years ago, trapping fresh water to produce both Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain (Frazier 1967). The natural vegetation of much of the region remains fresh or brackish marshes, mixed with swamps dominated by bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and tupelo (Nyssa aquatica). Yearly flooding by the Mississippi River was once a major factor controlling vegetation patterns, but these processes have been greatly impaired by the construction of artificial levees for flood control. Humans also removed most of the cypress swamps in a pulse of logging between 1876 and 1956. Continued subsidence of the land, slowly rising sea levels, salinity pulses from hurricanes, and canals from the Gulf of Mexico, add further stress to these wetlands. Over the past century there has been a steady loss of wetland area, and a gradual conversion of fresh water to salt water vegetation types. Biotic processes are also important. An exotic species of mammal, nutria (Myocastor coypus), consumes both aboveground and belowground parts of wetland plants. Reforestation is strictly limited by the combination of salt pulses, competition, and nutria. Alligators are the top predator in this system, but their potential for reducing the impacts of nutria has received minimal attention from biologists. There are many potential future states for this ecosystem. In the extreme case of rising sea level and warmer climate, the area may become a salt and brackish embayment fringed with mangroves. The state closest to historical conditions would be large areas of bald cypress swamp. Two important priorities are to increase flow of freshwater into the system from multiple pulsed fresh water diversions, and to decrease saltwater intrusions by closing canals such as the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet.

AB  - Stress is one of the most significant influences on behaviour and performance. The classical account is that stress mainly affects functions of the limbic system, such as learning, memory and emotion. Recent evidence, however, suggests that stress also modulates motor system function and influences the pathology of movement disorders. Most parts of the motor system show the presence of glucocorticoid receptors that render their circuits susceptible to the influence of stress hormones. Stress and glucocorticoids have been shown to modulate temporal and spatial aspects of motor performance. Skilled movements seem to be most prone to stress-induced disturbances, but locomotion and posture can also be affected. Stress can modulate movement through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and via stress-associated emotional changes. The dopaminergic system seems to play a central role in mediating the effects of stress on motor function. This route might also account for the finding that stress influences the pathology of dopamine-related diseases of the motor system, such as Parkinson's disease. Clinical observations have indicated that stress might lead to the onset of Parkinsonian symptoms or accelerate their progression. Glucocorticoids are modulators of neuronal plasticity, thus determining the degree of structural and functional compensation of the damaged motor system. This may particularly affect slowly progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. That stress represents a significant modulator of motor system function in both the healthy and the damaged brain should be recognized when developing future therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Objectives To clarify the associations between psychosocial work stressors and mental ill health, a meta-analysis of psychosocial work stressors and common mental disorders was undertaken using longitudinal studies identified through a systematic literature review.
   Methods The review used a standardized search strategy and strict inclusion and quality criteria in seven databases in 1994-2005. Papers were identified from 24 939 citations covering social determinants of health, 50 relevant papers were identified, 38 fulfilled inclusion criteria, and 11 were suitable for a meta-analysis. The Comprehensive Meta-analysis Programme was used for decision authority, decision latitude, psychological demands, and work social support, components of the job-strain and iso-strain models, and the combination of effort and reward that makes up the effort-reward imbalance model and job insecurity. Cochran's Q statistic assessed the heterogeneity of the results, and the I-2 statistic determined any inconsistency between studies.
   Results Job strain, low decision latitude, low social support, high psychological demands, effort-reward imbalance, and high job insecurity predicted common mental disorders despite the heterogeneity for psychological demands and social support among men. The strongest effects were found for job strain and effort-reward imbalance.
   Conclusions This meta-analysis provides robust consistent evidence that (combinations of) high demands and low decision latitude and (combinations of) high efforts and low rewards are prospective risk factors for common mental disorders and suggests that the psychosocial work environment is important for mental health. The associations are not merely explained by response bias. The impact of work stressors on common mental disorders differs for women and men.

AB  - The present report describes the emotional responses of different strains of mice to exposure to a novel open space model of anxiety using a 3D spatial navigation task. The 3D maze is modification of the radial maze with flexible arms that can be raised above or lowered below the horizontal level of a central platform. To access the arms animals need to cross a bridge linking the arms to the central platform. In this model, mice are exposed to novelty in an unfamiliar open space setting with no safe alternative. Fear from novelty is compounded with the need to explore. The drive to escape and the drive to approach are intermingled making this open space model radically different from the current models of anxiety which provide animals with the choice between safe and anxiogenic spaces.
   In a series of experiments, we examined the behaviour of different groups of mice from C57, C3H, CD1 and Balb/c strains. In the first experiment, different groups of C57 mice were tested in one of the three arms configurations. In the second experiment, C57 mice were compared to OH mice. In the third experiment, C57 mice were compared to CD1 and Balb/c mice in the raised arm configuration over three successive sessions. In the fourth experiment, we examined the behaviour of C57 mice in the lowered arm configuration with an open and an enclosed central. In the final experiment, we examined the difference between C57 and C3H mice of both genders.
   Using several spatio-temporal parameters of the transition responses between central platform, bridges and arms, we have been able to show consistent results demonstrating significant differences between C57 and OH mice, and between Balb/c and both C57 and CD I mice. OH appear more anxious than C57 mice, and Balb/c mice seem more anxious than C57 and CD I mice. We also observed significant differences between sexes in C3H mice but not in C57 mice. OH male mice appear more anxious than C3H female mice and than both C57 male and female mice. In the lowered arm configuration with an enclosed central platform, C57 mice took longer time to make a first entry to an arm, made more visits to bridges before first entry to an arm and required longer time between re-entries to arms, spent longer time on the central platform and shorter time on arms compared to mice in the other arm configurations. They also made frequent entries to the centre and bridges compared to mice in the lowered arm with an open central platform.
   These results demonstrate not only the sensitivity of the parameters of the test but also the consistencies and concordances of the results which make this 3D maze a valuable new tool in the study of the underlying neural mechanisms of anxiety responses in addition to learning and memory, and in assessing the effects of potential anxiolytic drugs. In this report we examine methodological issues related to the design of animal behavioural paradigms and question the value and the construct validity of the current models of human anxiety.

AB  - Psychotherapeutic interventions utilizing cognitive-behavioral strategies have been used widely with older adults. To appropriately adapt these techniques, characteristics unique to older adults must be taken into account. These factors include aspects of the social environment, cohort effects, cognitive changes with aging, personality, and emotional development, which have been described in an emerging body of research literature from the field of gerontology, In addition, clinical studies have examined the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral interventions in treating older clients for anxiety, depression, insomnia, and other disorders. This review describes current empirical evidence in gerontology and treatment outcome research that informs the practice of psychotherapy in this population and provides recommendations for conducting therapy with older adults.

AB  - In the developing field of biological psychiatry, DISC1 stands out by virtue of there being credible evidence, both genetic and biological, for a role in determining susceptibility to schizophrenia and related disorders. We highlight the methodological paradigm that led to identification of DISC1 and review the supporting genetic and biological evidence. The original finding of DISC1 as a gene disrupted by a balanced translocation on chromosome 1q42 that segregates with, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression has sparked a number of confirmatory linkage and association studies. These indicate that DISC1 is a generalizable genetic risk factor for psychiatric illness that also influences cognition in healthy subjects. DISC1 has also been shown to interact with a number of proteins with neurobiological pedigrees, including Ndel1 (NUDEL), a key regulator of neuronal migration with endo-oligopeptidase activity, and PDE4B, a phosphodiesterase that is critical for cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling and that is directly linked to learning, memory, and mood. Both are potential "drug" targets. DISC1 has thus emerged as a key molecular player in the etiology of major mental illness and in normal brain processes.

AB  - Background: Mirtazapine is an antidepressant first approved in the Netherlands in 1994 for the treatment of major depressive disorder. However, evidence suggests its effectiveness in a variety of other psychiatric disorders and non-psychiatric medical conditions.
   Objective: The present paper reviews the published literature on the off-label indications of Mirtazapine.
   Methods: A search of the relevant literature from MEDLINE, PsycLIT and EMBASE databases, included in the Science Citation Index and available up to March 2006, was conducted using the terms mirtazapine, case-reports, open-label trials and randomized controlled trials. Only articles referring to conditions other than major depression were included in this present review.
   Results: Off-label use of mirtazapine has been reported in panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dysthymia, menopausal depression, poststroke depression, depression as a result of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, elderly depression, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced depression, hot flashes, alcohol and other substance use disorders, sleep disorders, sexual disorders, tension-type headaches, cancer pain, fibromyalgia, schizophrenia and other less frequent conditions.
   Conclusions: So far, data on the off-label usefulness of mirtazapine are limited and mainly based on observations from case reports or open-label studies. However, positive cues suggest that confirmation of these preliminary data with randomized controlled trials may give sufficient evidence to warrant the use of mirtazapine in a broad range of disorders.

AB  - Objective: This paper, composed by an interest group of clinicians and researchers based in Melbourne, presents some background to the practice of mindfulness-based therapies as relevant to the general professional reader. We address the empirical evidence for these therapies, the principles through which they might operate, some practical questions facing those wishing to commence practice in this area or to refer patients into mindfulness-based therapies, and some considerations relevant to the conduct and interpretation of research into the therapeutic application of mindfulness.
   Method: Databases ( e. g. PsycINFO, MEDLINE) were searched for literature on the impact of mindfulness interventions, and the psychological and biological mechanisms that underpin the effects of mindfulness practice. This paper also draws upon the clinical experience of the author group.
   Results: Mindfulness practice and principles have their origins in many contemplative and philosophical traditions but individuals can effectively adopt the training and practice of mindfulness in the absence of such traditions or vocabulary. A recent surge of interest regarding mindfulness in therapeutic techniques can be attributed to the publication of some well-designed empirical evaluations of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Arising from this as well as a broader history of clinical integration of mindfulness and Western psychotherapies, a growing number of clinicians have interest and enthusiasm to learn the techniques of mindfulness and to integrate them into their therapeutic work. This review highlights the importance of accurate professional awareness and understanding of mindfulness and its therapeutic applications.
   Conclusions: The theoretical and empirical literatures on therapeutic applications of mindfulness are in states of significant growth and development. This group suggests, based on this review, that the combination of some well-developed conceptual models for the therapeutic action of mindfulness and a developing empirical base, justifies a degree of optimism that mindfulness-based approaches will become helpful strategies to offer in the care of patients with a wide range of mental and physical health problems.

AB  - Though Kraepelin's century-old division of major mental illness into mood disorder and schizophrenia remains in place, debate abounds over the most appropriate classification. Although these arguments previously rested solely on clinical grounds, they now are rooted in genetics and neurobiology. This article reviews evidence from the fields of genetic epidemiology, linkage, association, cytogenetics, and gene expression. Taken together, these data suggest some overlap in the genes that predispose to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. One gene, DAOA (D-amino acid oxidase activator, also known as G72), has been repeatedly implicated as an overlap gene, while DISC1 and others may constitute additional shared susceptibility genes. Further, some evidence implicates syndromes of co-occurring mood and psychotic symptoms in association with the putative risk alleles in overlap genes. From a nosologic perspective, the existence of overlap genes, coupled with the genotype-phenotype correlations discovered to date, supports the reality of the much debated schizoaffective disorder. Potential non-overlap syndromes-such as nonpsychotic bipolar disorder or cyclothymic temperament, on the one hand, and negative symptoms or the deficit syndrome, on the other-could turn out to have their own unique genetic determinants. If genotypes are to be the anchor points of a clinically useful system of classification, they must ultimately be shown to inform prognosis, treatment, and prevention. No gene variants have yet met these tests in bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.

AB  - Objective: To present the results of a systematic review of literature published between 1980 and 2004 reporting findings of the prevalence and incidence of anxiety disorders in the general population.
   Method: A literature search of epidemiologic studies of anxiety disorders was conducted, using Medline and HealthSTAR databases, canvassing English-language publications. Eligible publications were restricted to studies that examined age ranges covering the adult population. A set of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify relevant studies. Prevalence and incidence data were extracted and analyzed for heterogeneity.
   Results: A total of 41 prevalence and 5 incidence studies met eligibility criteria. We found heterogeneity across 1 -year and lifetime prevalence rates of all anxiety disorder categories. Pooled 1-year and lifetime prevalence rates for total anxiety disorders were 10.6% and 16.6%. Pooled rates for individual disorders varied widely. Women had generally higher prevalence rates across all anxiety disorder categories, compared with men, but the magnitude of this difference varied.
   Conclusion: The international prevalence of anxiety disorders varies greatly between published epidemiologic reports. The variability associated with all anxiety disorders is considerably smaller than the variability associated with individual disorders. Women report higher rates of anxiety disorders than men. Several factors were found to be associated with heterogeneity among rates, including diagnostic criteria, diagnostic instrument, sample size, country studied, and response rate.

TI  - Catatonia in individuals with autism spectrum disorders in adolescence and early adulthood: A long-term prospective study
KW  - OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SCALE
KW  - INFANTILE-AUTISM
AB  - The objective is to cast light on diagnosis and catastasis, course, and comorbidity as concerned with catatonia in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) with respect to long-term prospective follow-up. Eleven patients (all male) were enrolled. The mean age and the mean follow-up duration were 27.6 years (standard deviation (SD) 5.5) and 18.7 ycars (SD 8.7), respectively. The mean IQ was 27 (SD 16.4). Information was garnered from medical case records; current examination and observation of patients, interview of parents, and questionnaires completed by parents or other caretakers. Informed consent was obtained from the parents. Criteria for catatonia in this study were: (1) abrupt stop of movements and maintenance of immobility or bizarre posture beginning in adolescence and early adult life, (2) such a cataleptic state had continued for at least several minutes and appeared many times a day to the point of interfering with daily activities. We described two typical catatonic cases of ASDs. The average onset age was 19 years (SD 6). In all cases, our diagnostic criteria of catatonia evaluating at worse are fully compatible with those of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV). In 8 out of 11, the onset of catatonia was clearly preceded by the appearance of slowness in movements accompanying the exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Catatonia was also found to have some connection with Tourette syndrome (3 cases), adjustment disorders (N = 1), and depressive mood disorders (N = 1). In one case, the manifestations of catatonia had to be distinguished from parkinsonism caused by antipsychotics.
   Catatonia in ASDs seems to be a chronic condition in most cases. However, there were also a few cases in which catatonia repeatedly aggravated over short spans of time. Catatonia in ASDs may be considered an epiphenomenon of ASDs or a manifestation of comorbidity in adolescence or early adulthood.

AB  - Objective: Employers provide most American mental health benefits and are increasingly cost conscious. However, commonplace anxiety and depressive disorders have enormous economic and workplace performance costs. Methods: We performed multiple literature searches on several areas of pertinent research (and on key articles) covering the past 5 years. Results: Substantial research exists about anxiety and depression costs, such as performance and productivity, absenteeism, presenteeism, disability, physical disability exacerbation, mental health treatment, increased medical care costs, exacerbating of physical illness, and studies of mental health care limitations and cost-offset. Research addressing the potential value of higher quality mental health care is limited. Conclusions: Commonplace anxiety and depressive disorders are costly in the workplace. Employers and researchers remain largely unaware of the value of quality care and psychiatric skills. Effective solutions involve the increased use of psychiatric skills and appropriate treatment.

AB  - Objective: Observational studies suggest that long-term lithium treatment has a strong antisuicidal effect in mood disorders, but it is uncertain whether this association is a genuine therapeutic effect or is due to confounding factors in nonrandomized studies. The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials to investigate the effect of lithium, compared to placebo and other active treatments, on the risk of suicide, deliberate self-harm, and all-cause mortality in patients with mood disorder.
   Method: The data source was the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, incorporating results of searches of MEDLINE (1966-June 2002), EMBASE (1980-June 2002), CINAHL (1982-March 2001), PsycLIT (1974-June 2002), PSYNDEX (1977-October 1999), and LILACS (1982-March 2001). The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was searched with the term "lithium" for new records entered into the database from 1999 to 2003. Studies selected included randomized, controlled trials comparing lithium with placebo or all other compounds used in long-term treatment for mood disorders (unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, dysthymia, and rapid cycling, diagnosed according to DSM or ICD criteria). Of 727 references identified in the search, 52 articles were marked as possibly relevant on the basis of the abstract, and 32 randomized, controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. Two independent reviewers extracted the data, and disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Methodological quality was assessed according to the criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration. When the outcomes of interest were not reported, an attempt was made to obtain the required data from the original authors.
   Results: In 32 trials, 1,389 patients were randomly assigned to receive lithium and 2,069 to receive other compounds. Patients who received lithium were less likely to die by suicide (data from seven trials; two versus 11 suicides; odds ratio=0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.09-0.77). The composite measure of suicide plus deliberate self-harm was also lower in patients who received lithium (odds ratio=0.21; 95% CI=0.08-0.50). There were fewer deaths overall in patients who received lithium (data from 11 trials; nine versus 22 deaths; odds ratio=0.42, 95% CI=0.21-0.87).
   Conclusions: Lithium is effective in the prevention of suicide, deliberate self-harm, and death from all causes in patients with mood disorders.

AB  - Background: Recognition has grown over recent years of the need for economic information on the impacts of child and adolescent mental health problems and the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Methods: A range of electronic databases were examined using a predefined search strategy to identify economic studies which focused on services, pharmacological interventions and other treatments for children and adolescents with a diagnosed mental health problem or identified as at risk of mental illness. Published studies were included in the review if they assessed both costs and outcomes, with cost-effectiveness being the primary interest. Studies meeting the criteria for inclusion were assessed for quality. Results: There are still relatively few economic evaluations in this field. Behavioural disorders have been given relatively greater attention in economic evaluations of child and adolescent mental health. These studies tentatively suggest child behavioural gains and parent satisfaction from parent and child training programmes, although the cost-effectiveness of the location of delivery for behavioural therapies is less clear. In general, the quality of economic evaluations was limited by small sample sizes, constrained measurement of costs, narrow perspectives and over-simple statistical and econometric methods. Conclusions: Economic evaluations in the field of child and adolescent mental health interventions are few in number and generally poor in quality, although the number of studies being undertaken now appears to be rising.

AB  - Background: There is increasing recognition that patients after a cardiac event may be at risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present article reviews studies looking at PTSD as a sequel of heart disease with a focus on prevalence, risk factors, and future research directions. Methods: We conducted a search on PsychInfo and MEDLINE from 1980 to the present. Studies were included in the review if they looked at PTSD after a cardiac event, reported on the number of cases with PTSD, and had been published in English. Results: We identified 25 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 7 reported on the follow-up of previously published studies. The prevalence of PTSD after heart disease varied from 0% to 38% across studies. PTSD has been most rigorously researched after myocardial infarction with the best-powered studies finding a prevalence rate of 15%. Studies including control groups showed that cardiac patients were at risk of developing PTSD. Risk factors included sociodemographic and psychological characteristics and aspects related to the cardiac event. Conclusion: Despite substantial heterogeneity in the methodology of studies and differences in prevalence across studies, this review indicates that subgroups of patients are at risk of PTSD after a cardiac event. Future studies investigating PTSD as a sequel of heart disease should be more systematic, use a prospective study design with multiple assessments, and include sufficiently large samples. PTSD should not be ignored as a sequel of heart disease, given preliminary evidence that PTSD may be associated with nonadherence with medication and an increased risk of clinical adverse events.

AB  - In-situ observations of near-bed flow and sediment transport have been carried out for approximately 50 years. The observational technique employs a benthic tripod which can remain submerged on the seafloor for an extended period of time upon which are mounted various oceanographic instruments. The instruments transmit their signals to shipboard via connecting cable or more frequently record their output in accompanying data loggers. During the early years of benthic tripod work, measurements emphasized nearbed current velocity and associated suspended sediment profiles over periods of tidal cycles. The objectives of these studies were to evaluate existing boundary-layer flow and sediment transport theories under natural marine conditions. More recently, instrument capabilities and tripod deployment times have increased dramatically. Research objectives have expanded to include documentation of the physical processes active in the coastal ocean and their contribution to along-and across-margin sediment transport. Tripod-based studies continue to be a significant component of many comprehensive field programs. These long-term studies provide a way to document seabed physical processes and sediment transport over the full range of environmental conditions and continue to shape our concepts of sediment transport on continental shelves. Additionally, these boundary-layer studies have provided critical input for boundary-layer-numerical model development. Benthic tripods and self-contained instrumentation also represent a base of expertise that will help with design and implementation of coastal observatories in the future.

AB  - Depressive disorders a e among the most frequent forms of mental illness. Both genetic and environmental factors, such as stress, are involved in the etiology of depression. Therefore, chronic stress paradigms in laboratory animals constitute an important tool for research in this field. The molecular bases of chronic stress/depression are largely unknown, although a large amount of information has been accumulated during recent years. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as well as structural and physiological alterations in the hippocampus and neocortex are known to occur. Modifications in the expression level of some genes, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cAMP-response-element binding protein, serotonin receptors and HPA axis components were consistently associated in a number of experimental models. However, recent results suggest that several synaptic proteins, transcription factors and proteins involved in neuronal growth/differentiation, are also modified in their expression in experimental models of chronic stress. In general, these alterations can be reversed by treatment with antidepressants. Thus, a complex pattern of gene expression leading to stress/depression is starting to emerge. We summarize here recent findings on the alterations of gene expression in the hippocampus of chronically stressed and antidepressant treated animals.

AB  - Objectives: This review summarizes the literature on psychiatric and medical comorbidities in bipolar disorder. The coexistence of other Axis I disorders with bipolar disorder complicates psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. Conversely, symptom overlap in DSM-IV diagnoses hinders definition and recognition of true comorbidity. Psychiatric comorbidity is often associated with earlier onset of bipolar symptoms, more severe course, poorer treatment compliance, and worse outcomes related to suicide and other complications. Medical comorbidity may be exacerbated or caused by pharmacotherapy of bipolar symptoms. Methods: Articles were obtained by searching MEDLINE from 1970 to present with the following search words: bipolar disorder AND, comorbidity, anxiety disorders, eating disorder, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, ADHD, personality disorders, borderline personality disorder, medical disorders, hypothyroidism, obesity, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, lithium, valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, atypical antipsychotics. Articles were prioritized for inclusion based on the following considerations: sample size, use of standardized diagnostic criteria and validated methods of assessment, sequencing of disorders, quality of presentation. Results: Although the literature establishes a strong association between bipolar disorder and substance abuse, the direction of causality is uncertain. An association is also seen with anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and eating disorders, as well as cyclothymia and other axis II personality disorders. Medical disorders accompany bipolar disorder at rates greater than predicted by chance. However, it is often unclear whether a medical disorder is truly comorbid, a consequence of treatment, or a combination of both. Conclusion: To ensure prompt, appropriate intervention while avoiding iatrogenic complications, the clinician must evaluate and monitor patients with bipolar disorder for the presence and the development of comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions. Conversely, physicians should have a high index of suspicion for underlying bipolar disorder when evaluating individuals with other psychiatric diagnoses (not just unipolar depression) that often coexist with bipolar disorder, such as alcohol and substance abuse or anxiety disorders. Anticonvulsants and other mood stabilizers may be especially helpful in treating bipolar disorder with significant comorbidity.

AB  - Over the past four decades, researchers have produced extensive evidence on psychotherapy for youth mental health problems and disorders. The evidence often has been evaluated through narrative reviews and through meta-analyses assessing the magnitude of treatment effects, but methodological analysis addressing the character and quality of the evidence base itself is an important complement, needed to place treatment effects in perspective and to suggest directions for future research. We carried out such an analysis, focusing on all the methodologically acceptable published randomized trials our search identified involving treatment of anxiety, depression, ADHD and related conditions, and conduct-related problems and disorders. The 236 studies tested 383 treatments and included 427 treatment-control comparisons, spanning the years 1962 through 2002. The analysis revealed considerable breadth, diversity, and rigor in the measurement approaches used to assess participant characteristics and treatment outcomes. However, reporting on important sample characteristics (e.g., ethnicity) showed major gaps, and more than half the studies failed to use well-standardized procedures to ensure appropriate sample selection. Because sample sizes left most studies underpowered, and procedures to enhance treatment fidelity were generally weak, many of the treatments investigated may not have received fair tests. Studies were particularly weak in clinical representativeness of their samples, therapists, and settings, suggesting a need for increased emphasis on external validity in youth treatment research.

AB  - Epidemiological, neuropathological, radiological, and clinical features of Parkinsonian neurodegenerative diseases are reviewed, including synucleinopathies and four-repeat tauopathies. Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with dementia, depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and dopamine agonist-related psychosis and mania. Delirium may result from secondary complications of PD, drug treatment, or withdrawal of dopamine agonists. Psychosis is a key factor in nursing home placement, while depression and cognitive impairment are critical predictors of quality of life. Clozapine is effective against psychotic features, but optimal antidepressant therapy awaits definition. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) presents with early frontal dementia, cognitive fluctuations, and well-formed visual hallucinations, often attended by falls, syncope, systematized delusions, neuroleptic intolerance, depression, and rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder (RBD). Early evidence suggests the utility of rivastigmine, donepezil, and low-dose olanzapine and quetiapine in DLB. Multiple system atrophies (including striatonigral degeneration, Shy-Drager syndrome, and olivopontocerebellar atrophy) are typified by poor levodopa response, dysautonomia, ataxia, frontal cognitive impairments, RBD, sleep apnea, and depression. Progressive supranuclear palsy is associated with early backward falls, slow vertical saccades, impaired downgaze, subcortical dementia, apathy, pathological emotionality, mild depression and anxiety, and poor response to dopamine agonists and donepezil. Cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration presents with multiple unilateral movement disorders, early frontal dementia, apraxias, alien limb, personality changes, and depression. FTDP-17 presents with frontotemporal dementia, Parkinsonism, personality changes, and sometimes hyperorality or psychosis.
   Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of a number of neurodegenerative disorders in which abnormal proteins are found. Among neurodegenerative proteinopathies in which Parkinsonism occurs are the alpha-synucleinopathies and tauopathies. alpha-synucleinopathies include PD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and the multiple system atrophies (MSA), diseases in which alpha-synuclein is found in intraneuronal or intraglial inclusions. Tauopathies involve the elaboration of abnormal tau protein and include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is another tauopathy, but unlike the aforementioned, it also involves the production of abnormal P-amyloid protein. Parkinsonian features also may be observed in conjunction with other neurodegenerative proteinopathies, including prion proteinopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Gerstmann-Straussler-Sheinker disease, in which rigidity occurs; the superoxide dismutase proteinopathy amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), wherein ALS may be associated with Parkinsonism and dementia, as on the island of Guam; and the childhood form of the polyglutamine expansion proteinopathy Huntington's disease, where Parkinsonian features including rigidity are associated with psychosis and bipolar disorders. This article considers the neuropsychiatric manifestations occurring in Parkinsonian disorders. Because Parkinsonian features are incidental to the primary disease, or the neuropsychiatry remains in need of definition in some of these illnesses, this article focuses on the neuropsychiatry of PD, DLB, MSA, PSP, CBD, and FTDP-17.

AB  - Objective: This study reviewed the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression.
   Method: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials. They searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety, and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, incorporating results of searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, PSYNDEX, and LILACS. The main outcome measures were the proportion of patients who clinically responded to treatment and the rate of switching to mania.
   Results: Twelve randomized trials were included, with a total of 1,088 randomly assigned patients. Five trials compared one or more antidepressants with placebo: 75% of these patients were receiving a concurrent mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic. Antidepressants were more effective than placebo. Antidepressants did not induce more switching to mania (the event rate for antidepressants was 3.8% and for placebo, it was 4.7%). Six trials allowed comparison between two antidepressants. The rate of switching for tricyclic antidepressants was 10%, and for all other antidepressants combined, it was 3.2%.
   Conclusions: Antidepressants are effective in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. The trial data do not suggest that switching is a common early complication of treatment with antidepressants. It may be prudent to use a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor rather than a tricyclic antidepressant as first-line treatment. Given the limited evidence, there is a compelling need for further studies with longer follow-up periods and careful definition and follow-up of emerging mania and partial remission.

AB  - Extending recent research efforts on the effects of personality and moods at work, this study examined the impact of personality traits and mood states in job burnout. Specifically, the field study examined the role of 2 personality traits and positive and negative moods (states) in burnout among nurses working at 2 hospitals. Results indicate that extraversion significantly predicted the diminished accomplishment component of burnout, and neuroticism significantly predicted the exhaustion and depersonalization components. Thus, the findings indicate that personality dimensions predict burnout components differentially. Further, positive moods mediated the relationship between extraversion and accomplishment, while negative moods partially mediated between neuroticism and exhaustion. Thus, moods exhibited both direct and mediating effects. Implications for management and suggestions for future research are offered.

AB  - Objective: Migration and its accompanying stressors affect migrating individuals and their families. The process of migration is not simple or straightforward. The aim of this review is to distil existing information on how migration influences individuals' mental state and how it determines help seeking as well as pathways to care.
   Method: The review relies on published studies in both MEDLINE and non-MEDLINE journals as well as relevant monographs. The search was employed using migration, ethnic communities, stress and other relevant words for purposes of the review.
   Results: The review provides a background on the typology of migration, its impact on communities as well as individuals. Furthermore, the relationship of mental illness to migration is explored and described. Future research plans are advocated in relationship with these findings.
   Conclusion: Migration is and can be a very stress-inducing phenomenon. Yet not all migrants go through the same process. The clinician needs to be aware of coping strategies as well as resilience among migrants.

AB  - Objective: To present the results of a systematic review of literature published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2000, that reports findings on the prevalence and incidence of mood disorders in both general population and primary care settings.
   Method: We conducted a literature search of epidemiologic studies of mood disorders, using Medline and HealthSTAR databases and canvassing English-language publications. Eligible publications were restricted to studies that examined subjects aged at least 15 years and over. We used a set of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify relevant studies. We extracted and analyzed prevalence and incidence data for heterogeneity.
   Results: Of general population studies, a total of 18 prevalence and 5 incidence studies met eligibility criteria. We found heterogeneity across 1-year and lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymic disorder, and bipolar I disorder. The corresponding pooled rates for 1-year prevalence were 4.1 per 100, 2.0 per 100, and 0.72 per 100, respectively. For lifetime prevalence, the corresponding pooled rates were 6.7 per 100, 3.6 per 100, and 0. 8 per 100, respectively. Significant variation was observed among 1-year incidence rates of MDD, with a corresponding pooled rate of 2.9 per 100.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of mood disorders reported in high-quality studies is generally lower than rates commonly reported in the general psychiatric literature. When controlled for common methodological confounds, variation in prevalence rates persists across studies and deserves continued study. Methodological variation among studies that have examined the prevalence of depression in primary health care services is so large that comparative analyses cannot be achieved.

   Method: Controlled studies of new treatments for bipolar disorders were identified by computerized searches and reviews of scientific meeting proceedings, and were compiled by drug category.
   Results: Two main categories of medications, newer anticonvulsants and newer antipsychotics, are yielding emerging new treatment for bipolar disorders. Newer anticonvulsants have diverse profiles, and although not generally effective for acute mania, may have utility for other aspects of bipolar disorders (e.g. lamotrigine maintenance or acute bipolar depression), or for comorbid (e.g. gabapentin for anxiety or pain, topiramate for obesity, bulimia, alcohol dependence, or migraine, and zonisamide for obesity). In contrast, newer antipsychotics generally appear effective for acute mania, and some may ultimately prove effective in acute depression (e.g. olanzapine combined with fluoxetine, quetiapine) and maintenance (e.g. olanzapine).
   Conclusion: Emerging research is yielding new treatment options for bipolar disorders and comorbid conditions.

AB  - Objective: To estimate 6-month prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders among juvenile detainees by demographic subgroups (sex, race/ethnicity, and age).
   Design: Epidemiologic study of juvenile detainees. Master's level clinical research interviewers administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version 2.3 to randomly selected detainees.
   Setting: A large temporary detention center for juveniles in Cook County, Illinois (which includes Chicago and surrounding suburbs).
   Participants: Randomly selected, stratified sample of 1829 African American, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic youth (172 males, 657 females, aged 10-18 years) arrested and newly detained. Main Outcome Measure: Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children.
   Results: Significantly more females (56.5%) than males (45.9%) met criteria for 2 or more of the following disorders: major depressive, dysthymic, manic, psychotic, panic, separation anxiety, overanxious, generalized anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, con-duct, oppositional defiant, alcohol, marijuana, and other substance; 17.3% of females and 20.4% of males had only one disorder. We also examined types of disorder: affective, anxiety, substance use, and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity or behavioral. The odds of having comorbid disorders were higher than expected by chance for most demographic subgroups, except when base rates of disorders, were already high or when cell sizes were small. Nearly 14% of females and 11% of males had both a major mental disorder (psychosis, manic episode, or major depressive episode) and a substance use disorder. Compared with participants with no major mental disorder (the residual category), those with a major mental disorder had significantly greater odds (1.8-4.1) of having substance use disorders. Nearly 30% of females and more than 20% of males with substance use disorders had major mental disorders. Rates of some types of comorbidity were higher among non-Hispanic whites and older adolescents.
   Conclusions: Comorbid psychiatric disorders are a major health problem among detained youth. We recommend directions for research and discuss how to improve treatment and reduce health disparities in the juvenile justice and mental health systems.

AB  - Psychoneuroendocrinology is a branch of neuroscience that has been developing since the beginning of the last century, used as a methodological approach for the investigation of neurotransmitter function, on the basis of the observation that neurotransmitters regulate neurohormone and peripheral hormone secretions and that hormones and peptides have been identified as neuromodulators with transmitter-like actions. A psychoneuroendocrine field that should be developed further is that Of hormonal or antihormonal therapies, as single or multidrug treatments Of psychopathologies. The rationale for this therapeutic approach is based, on one hand, on the observation that multiple hormonal impairments occur during mental disorders, and, on the other, that hormones may act as neurotransmitters or as modulators Of neurotransmitter functions in the CNS-in both cases, being possibly involved in the pathogenesis of mental disorders. In the past, hormonal therapies have been used as single treatments Of mental disorder with very poor results. This was due to the scarce and approximate knowledge of the biochemical background of psychopathologies, the effects of hormones on CNS activity, and also the lack of pure hormonal preparations. Recently, hormonal therapies have been tried again, but most of the therapeutic trials were not blind and controlled by placebo, and therefore their validity is still questionable. This field, however, is worth further investigation with protocols that should take into consideration:
   1. the specific neurohormone, neuropeptide, neurosteroid alterations Of each type of mental pathology taken into consideration; and
   2. the effects that hormones can exert not only at the level of neurotransmitter secretions and receptor sensitivities but also on second-messenger function and intracellular component in general.

AB  - An electronic database search identified 15 studies of psychosocial factors affecting survival after bone marrow transplantation. The studies were assessed for methodological quality by two reviewers using the procedures of Bland and colleagues. Although some studies found that psychological variables affect survival after bone marrow transplantation, the reviewers' analysis of the methodologically sound studies suggested that survival after bone marrow transplantation is not substantively affected by depressed mood or other psychopathology in adults or by social support in adults or children. Longer survival may be related to lower "anxious preoccupation," higher "fighting spirit," and better quality of life ratings before and soon after transplant in adults. Overall, however the literature is insufficiently developed to provide definitive evidence for a relationship between psychological variables and survival after bone marrow transplantation. Future primary studies in this area should be designed to maximize replicability and generalizability.

AB  - Researchers and clinicians are increasingly recognizing that psychological and psychiatric disorders are often developmentally progressive, and that diagnosis often represents a point along that progression that is defined largely by our abilities to detect symptoms. As a result, strategies that guide our searches for the root causes and etiologies of these disorders are beginning to change. This review describes interactions between genetics and experience that influence the development of psychopathologies. Following a discussion of normal brain development that highlights how specific cellular processes may be targeted by genetic or environmental factors, we focus on four disorders whose origins range from genetic (fragile X syndrome) to environmental (fetal alcohol syndrome) or a mixture of both factors (depression and schizophrenia). C.H. Waddington's canalization model (slightly modified) is used as a tool to conceptualize the interactive influences of genetics and experience in the development of these psychopathologies. Although this model was originally proposed to describe the 'canalizing' role of genetics in promoting normative development, it serves here to help visualize, for example, the effects of adverse (stressful) experience in the kindling model of depression, and the multiple etiologies that may underlie the development of schizophrenia. Waddington's model is also useful in understanding the canalizing influence of experience-based therapeutic approaches, which also likely bring about 'organic' changes in the brain. Finally, in light of increased evidence for the role of experience in the development and treatment of psychopathologies, we suggest that future strategies for identifying the underlying causes of these disorders be based less on the mechanisms of action of effective pharmacological treatments, and more on increased knowledge of the brain's cellular mechanisms of plastic change.

AB  - Background: Anxiety is associated with decreased functioning and quality of life. It may have added importance in diabetes for its potential adverse effects on regimen adherence and glycemic control. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety in adults with diabetes. Research Design and Methods: MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases and published reference lists were searched to identify studies that determined the prevalence of anxiety in diabetes from threshold scores on self-report measures or from diagnostic interviews. Prevalence was calculated as an aggregate mean weighted by the combined number of subjects in the included studies. Results: Eighteen studies having a combined population (N) of 4076 (2584 diabetic subjects, 1492 controls) satisfied the inclusion criteria. Most did not adjust for the effects of moderator variables such as gender, and only one was community-based. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was present in 14% of patients with diabetes. The subsyndromal presentation of anxiety disorder not otherwise specified and of elevated anxiety symptoms were found in 27% and 40%, respectively, of patients with diabetes. The prevalence of elevated symptoms was significantly higher in women compared to men (55.3% vs. 32.9%, P<.0001) and similar in patients with Type 1 vs. Type 2 diabetes (41.3% vs. 42.2%, P=.80). Conclusion: GAD is present in 14% and elevated symptoms of anxiety in 40% of patients with diabetes who participate in clinical studies. Additional epidemiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence of anxiety in the broader population of persons with diabetes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chrono-epidemiology is the study of the distribution of health events according to time. The time intervals taken into account have cyclic patterns and include cireadian, weekly, seasonal, and circannual rhythms. In the behavioural field, chrono-epidemiology can be and has been applied to studies concerning the causes of death (suicide and homicide), clinical events such as admissions to and contacts with mental healthcare services, and the seasonal distribution of crime involving the use of violence. Frequently reported findings include clear circadian and seasonal rhythms present in the phenomenon of suicide (rhythms more evident in the case of violent suicide); seasonal rhythms in the expression of aggression by patients hospitalised for mental illness; and a circannual recurrence of crimes with a violent component. The intrinsic circadian and seasonal rhythms of some neuronal systems, particularly those of serotonin, involved in the control of mood and impulses, are thought to favour the behavioural rhythms observed, although the contribution of socio-environmental factors, such as the fluctuation of supportive networks according to time, is also acknowledged. By demonstrating non-casual recurrence of certain behaviour and by exploring the socio-biological basis of the rhythms beneath these recurrences, chrono-epidemiology may offer important etiologic and preventive clues to the understanding of the biological and environmental correlates of aggressive behaviour.

AB  - Objectives: The goal is to review the plasticity and vulnerability of the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in episodic, declarative, contextual and spatial learning and memory, as well as its being a component in the control of autonomic and vegetative functions such as ACTH secretion. It discusses its possible role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, and the need of hippocampal neurons for glucose because of their high metabolic activity. The hippocampus is also vulnerable to damage by stroke and head trauma and susceptible to damage during aging and repeated stress, and is sensitive to the effects of diabetes. Methods: A summary of recent work in the authors' laboratory and related work in the field using citations of literature based, in part, on Medline searches. Conclusions: In addition to its vulnerability, the hippocampus is also a plastic and adaptable brain region that is capable of considerable structural reorganization, including remodeling of dendrites and neurogenesis of dentate gyrus granule neurons in response to repeated stress. Animal models of Type I diabetes show accelerated remodeling of dendrites, and Type 2 diabetes remains to be studied in this regard. This is relevant to major depressive illness, in which a progressive atrophy of the hippocampal formation is reported and is accompanied by impairment of cognitive function in those subjects with hippocampal shrinkage. Therefore, hippocampal atrophy in depression, as well as in diabetes, may reflect either damage or plasticity involving structural reorganization that is potentially treatable.

AB  - The common frog (Rana temporaria) spends the coldest months of each year overwintering in ice-covered ponds where temperatures can vary from 0.5 to 4.0degreesC. Over the course of a winter season, the animals enter progressively into a state of metabolic depression that relies almost exclusively on aerobic production of ATP. However, if aerobic metabolism is threatened, for example by increasingly hypoxic conditions, decreases in the animal's metabolic rate can reach upwards of 75 % compared with the 50 % decrease seen during normoxia. Under these conditions, the major proportion of the overall reduction in whole-animal metabolic rate can be accounted for by metabolic suppression of the skeletal muscle (which makes up approximately 40 % of body mass). Little is known about the properties of mitochondria during prolonged periods of metabolic depression, so we have examined several aspects of mitochondrial metabolism in the skeletal muscle of frogs over periods of hibernation of up to 4 months. Mitochondria isolated from the skeletal muscle of frogs hibernating in hypoxic water show a considerable reorganisation of function compared with those isolated from normoxic submerged animals at the same temperature (3degreesC). Both the active (state 3) and resting (state 4) respiration rates of mitochondria decrease during hypoxic, but not normoxic, hibernation. In addition, the affinity of mitochondria for oxygen increases during periods of acute hypoxic stress during normoxic hibernation as well as during long-term hibernation in hypoxic water. The decrease in mitochondrial state 4 respiration rates during hypoxic hibernation evidently occurs through a reduction in electron-transport chain activity, not through a lowered proton conductance of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The reduced aerobic capacity of frog skeletal muscle during hypoxic hibernation is accompanied by lowered activities of key enzymes of mitochondrial metabolism caused by changes in the intrinsic properties of the mitochondria. In the absence of oxygen, the mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATPase (the ATP synthase) begins to run backwards as it actively pumps protons from the matrix in an attempt to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential. At this time, the ATP synthase functions as an ATPase to preserve a certain proton-motive force. Frogs limit ATP wastage during anoxia by a profound inhibition of the ATP synthase. Taken together, our studies show that proton-motive force is lowered aerobically by restricting electron supply and during anoxia by restricting mitochondrial ATPase activity.

   Aims To determine whether neuroimaging studies had identified structural and functional changes specific to PTSD.
   Method A review of all functional and structural neuroimaging studies of subjects with PTSD was carried out. Studies were identified using general medical and specific traumatic stress databases and paper searches of current contents and other secondary sources.
   Results The most replicated structural finding is hippocampal volume reduction, which may limit the proper evaluation and categorisation of experience. Replicated localised functional changes include increased activation of the amygdala after symptom provocation (which may reflect its role in emotional memory) and decreased activity of Broca's area at the same time (which may explain the difficulty patients have in labelling their experiences).
   Conclusions Evidence from neuroimaging studies has suggested areas of the brain that may be damaged by psychological trauma. The clinical implications of these neuroimaging findings need to be investigated further because they challenge traditional therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Background De-institutionalization has led to the provision of various forms of housing with or without support for people with mental illness in the community. In this paper, we review the conceptual issues related to the provision of supported housing schemes, the characteristics of residents, research methods and outcomes, and the factors influencing the quality of care provided. Methods A Medline and hand search of published literature was complemented by information derived from contacting expert researchers in the field. Findings There is considerable diversity of models of supported housing and inconsistent use of terminology to describe them. This makes it difficult to compare schemes, processes, and outcomes. Patients in supported housing are characterized by deficits in self-care and general functioning, whilst behavioral problems such as violence, drug abuse and extreme antisocial habits predict exclusion from supported housing. Most evaluative studies are merely descriptive. In terms of outcomes, it seems that functioning can improve, social integration can be facilitated, and residents are generally more satisfied in supported housing compared with conventional hospital care. Further evidence suggests that most patients prefer regimes with low restrictiveness and more independent living arrangements, although loneliness and isolation have occasionally been reported to be a problem. Little information is available on the factors that mediate outcomes and on skills required by staff. Conclusion Research in supported housing for psychiatric patients has so far been neglected. Large scale surveys on structure, process, and outcomes across a variety of housing schemes may be useful in the future to identify some of the key variables influencing outcomes. The use of direct observation methods in conjunction with other more conventional, standardized instruments may also highlight areas for improvement. In conducting research, structure and process, as well as outcomes, need to be considered. Thus, we need to know not just what to provide, but how to provide it in such a way that it will maximize beneficial outcomes. This represents a considerable research agenda.

AB  - Objectives: To outline the cognitive understanding of symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, and emotional withdrawal, and to review the cognitive therapy approach to ameliorating these symptoms.
   Method: We identified studies examining cognitive factors associated with symptoms of schizophrenia by electronic search (using Medline and Psycinfo). This paper integrates experimental findings and clinical treatment.
   Results: Recent studies focusing on the psychological aspects of schizophrenia demonstrate the importance of common cognitive biases and distortions that are functionally related to the maintenance of symptoms. Understanding the disorder in cognitive terms provides a framework for psychotherapeutic intervention. Adapting cognitive strategies successfully used in cognitive therapy of depression and anxiety provides an important adjunct to standard treatment of schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: Given that the outcome of current treatment for schizophrenia remains poor, attention to therapist training in psychological approaches is essential.

AB  - The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) plays important roles in many basic functions: mood, feeding, anxiety, sleep, emesis, sexual function, thermoregulation, and cardiovascular tone. Over the past 10 years, tryptophan depletion (TD) studies of 5-HT function have emerged as an important clinical tool for studying brain serotonergic systems, and their relevance to practising psychiatrists has grown steadily. In this review, we discuss the evolution of TD studies and their continuing utility in understanding the role of 5-HT in psychiatric disorders and the development of more effective treatments.

AB  - Retrospective research shows that close to 90 percent of suicides have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder; however, only a small proportion of individuals with psychopathology take their own fives. This article reviews the empirical literature on pychological vulnerability to completed suicide. A search of the MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases yielded 46 cohort or case-control studies that used standardized or structured assessments of psychological dimensions. Five constructs have been consistently associated with completed suicide: impulsivity/aggression, depression, anxiety, hopelessness, and self-consciousness/social disengagement. Current knowledge of psychological vulnerability to completed suicide could inform social and neurobiological research, and thereby deepen understanding of suicide while potentially bridging these areas of study.

Subjects examined include the generalizability of heritability estimates, the impact of sex on patterns of familial transmission, gene-environment interaction, twin studies of anxiety and eating disorders, the so-called family environment, special issues raised by twin studies of drug use and abuse, and gene-environment correlation. The studies reviewed suggest that (1) the heritability of many behavioral traits may be greater in permissive than in restrictive environments and, (2) for psychiatric and drug abuse disorders, genes probably work through both traditional within-the-skin physiological pathways and outside-the-skin behavioral pathways. In the latter, genes affect aspects of the social environment, such as exposure to stressful life events and levels of social support, which in turn feed back on risk of illness. Twin studies remain a vibrant part of the field of psychiatric genetics and an important complement to and context for current efforts to localize individual susceptibility genes.

AB  - Background: The Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments partnered to produce clinical guidelines for psychiatrists for the treatment of depressive disorders.
   Methods: A standard guidelines development process was followed. Relevant literature was identified using a computerized Medline search supplemented by review of bibliographies. Operational criteria was used to rate the quality of scientific evidence, and the line of treatment recommendations included consensus clinical opinion. This section, "Medications and Other Biological Treatments," is 1 of 7 articles that were drafted and reviewed by clinicians. Revised drafts underwent national and international expert peer review.
   Results: Evidence-based recommendations are presented for 1) choosing an antidepressant, based on efficacy, tolerability and safety, 2) the optimal use of antidepressants, including augmentation, combination, and switching strategies; 3) maintenance treatment, and 4) electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), light therapy, and additional somatic treatments. Evidence from metaanalyses is presented first, followed by conclusions from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and if appropriate, open-label data.
   Conclusions: There is significant evidence to support the role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), novel agents, and classic agents in the treatment of major depressive disorders (MDD). There is also evidence to support the use of somatic treatments, including ECT and light therapy for some patients with MDD. There is limited evidence for the use of specific medications to treat subtypes of MDD. There is emerging evidence to support augmentation and combination strategies for patients previously nonresponsive to medication.

AB  - Objective: Despite numerous case reports on "psychogenic fever," it remains uncertain how psychological stress raises core temperature and whether the rise in core temperature is a real fever or a hyperthermia. This article reviews studies on the psychological stress-induced rise in core temperature (PSRCT) in animals with the aim to facilitate studies on the mechanisms of so-called psychogenic fever in humans. Methods: To address this question, we reviewed the mechanisms and mediators of the PSRCT and classic conditioning of the fever response in animals. Results: The PSRCT is not due to the increased locomotor activity during stress, and the magnitude of the PSRCT is the same in warm and cold environments, indicating that it is a centrally regulated rise in temperature due to an elevated thermoregulatory "set point." The PSRCT caused by conventional psychological stress models, such as open-field stress, is attenuated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, which block prostaglandin synthesis. On the other hand, the PSRCT elicited by an "anticipatory anxiety stress" is not inhibited by cyclooxygenase inhibitors but by benzodiazepines and serotonin Type 1A receptor agonists. The febrile response can be conditioned to neutral stimuli after paired presentation with unconditioned stimuli such as injection of lipopolysaccharide, a typical pyrogen, Conclusions: Most findings indicate that the PSRCT is a fever, a rise in the thermoregulatory set point. The PSRCT may occur through prostaglandin E(2)-dependent mechanisms and prostaglandin E(2)-independent, 5-HT-mediated mechanisms. The febrile response can be conditioned. Thus, these mechanisms might be involved in psychogenic fever in humans.

AB  - Neuroimaging technology has provided unprecedented opportunities for elucidating the anatomical correlates of major depression. The knowledge gained from imaging research and from the postmortem studies that have been guided by imaging data is catalyzing a paradigm shift in which primary mood disorders are conceptualized as illnesses that involve abnormalities of brain structure, as well as of brain function. These data suggest specific hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms underlying pathological emotional processing in mood disorders. They particularly support a role for dysfunction within the prefrontal cortical and striatal systems that normally modulate limbic and brainstem structures involved in mediating emotional behavior in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms.

AB  - A primary interest of the field of infant mental health is in the early conditions that place infants at risk for less than optimal development. The fundamental problem of what constitutes normal and abnormal development is now a focus of developmental psychology, infant psychiatry, and developmental neuroscience. In the second part of this sequential work, I present interdisciplinary data to more deeply forge the theoretical links between severe attachment failures, impairments of the early development of the right brain's stress coping systems, and maladaptive infant mental health. In the following, I offer thoughts on the negative impact of traumatic attachments on brain development and infant mental health, the neurobiology of infant trauma, the neuropsychology of a disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern associated with abuse and neglect, trauma-induced impairments of a regulatory system in the orbitofrontal cortex, the links between orbitofrontal dysfunction and a predisposition to posttraumatic stress disorders, the neurobiology of the dissociative defense, the etiology of dissociation and body-mind psychopathology, the effects of early relational trauma on enduring right hemispheric function, and some implications for models of early intervention. These findings suggest direct connections between traumatic attachment, inefficient right brain regulatory functions, and both maladaptive infant and adult mental health.

AB  - The hypothesis of the evolutionary origin of Bipolar Disorder (EOBD) attempts to make sense of ED by placing it in evolutionary perspective. The hypothesis emerges from ideas about the importance of the organism's biological clock and energy-regulating mechanism (Wehr, Goodwin, Rosenthal), and theorising that ED descends from a pyknic (compact, cold-adapted) group (Kretschmer). It suggests that ED behaviors evolved as highly derived adaptations to the selective pressures of extreme climatic conditions (long, severe winters and short summers). The EOBD hypothesis integrates existing observations, economically explains puzzling aspects of ED, yields testable predictions, and suggests new research directions.

AB  - The end of the last millennium witnessed an unprecedented degree of public awareness regarding mental disorder as well as motivation for policy change. Like Sartorius, we contend that the continued stigmatization of mental illness may well be the central issue facing the field, as nearly all attendant issues (e.g., standards of care, funding for basic and applied research efforts) emanate from professional, societal, and personal attitudes towards persons with aberrant behavior. We discuss empirical and narrative evidence for stigmatization as well as historical trends regarding conceptualizations of mental illness, including the field's increasing focus on genetic and neurobiological causes and determinants of mental disorder. We next define stigma explicitly, noting both the multiple levels (community, societal, familial, individual) through which stigma operates to dehumanize and delegitimize individuals with mental disorders and the impact of stigma across development. Key developmental psychopathology principles are salient in this regard. We express concern over the recent oversimplification of mental illness as "brain disorder," supporting instead transactional models which account for the dynamic interplay of genes, neurobiology, environment, and self across development and which are consistent with both compassion and societal responsibility. Finally, we consider educational and policy-related initiatives regarding the destigmatization of mental disorder. We conclude that attitudes and policy regarding mental disorder reflect, in microcosmic form, two crucial issues for the next century and millennium: (a) tolerance for diversity (vs. pressure for conformity) and (b) intentional direction of our species' evolution, given fast-breaking genetic advances.

   Method: A Medline search was conducted in September 1999.
   Results: Five papers have investigated omega-3 fatty acids levels in depression. One study used omega-3 fatty acids as an adjunctive therapy in bipolar disorder. Four studies used fatty acids as an adjunctive therapy in schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: There is a great deal of current research in this field. While omega-3 fatty acids levels may be lowered in depression, there are no data suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids are effective. One paper indicates that omega-3 fatty acids are effective in bipolar disorders. The data on schizophrenia are conflicting. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids have proved effective. Most of the evidence suggests that the main effect is an improvement in negative symptoms. One recent study showed that omega-3 fatty acids had no effect on negative symptoms.

AB  - Objective: To critically review existing literature examining the relationship between panic disorder (PD) and coronary artery disease (CAD). We specifically sought answers to the following questions: (1) What is the prevalence of PD in CAD patients? (2) What is the directionality of the relationship between PD and CAD? (3) What mechanisms may mediate the link between PD and CAD? Methods: Medline and Psych-lit searches were conducted using the following search titles: "panic disorder and coronary artery disease", "panic disorder and coronary heart disease", and "panic disorder and cardiovascular disease" for the years 1980-1998. The above search was also repeated replacing "panic disorder" with "panic attacks" for the same period. Results: The prevalence of PD in both cardiology out-patients and patients with documented CAD ranges from 10% to 50%. The association between PD and CAD appeared strongest in patients with atypical chest pain or symptoms that could not be fully explained by coronary status. There is some evidence linking phobic anxiety but not PD per sc to CAD risk, but little evidence linking CAD to PD risk. Studies of the mechanisms linking PD to CAD are still in their infancy, but there is preliminary evidence linking PD to reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and myocardial ischemia, two pathophysiological mechanisms related to CAD. Conclusion: PD is prevalent in CAD patients, but it is unclear the extent to which PD confers risk for and/or exacerbates CAD. Prospective research is needed to more firmly establish PD as a distinct risk factor for the development and progression of CAD. However, because many of the symptoms of PD mimic those of CAD, differentiating these disorders and learning how they may influence each other is imperative for clinical practice.

The studies were classified into retrospective and prospective population surveys, surveys of patient populations and studies of seasonal variations in psychiatric illnesses other than mood disorders.
   Results: The prevalence estimates of SAD across 20 retrospective studies varied from 0% to 9.7%. All prospective population studies, except one, find seasonal variations in mood, depressive symptoms usually peaking in winter. SAD was more prevalent at higher northern latitudes, but the prevalence varied across ethnic groups. SAD has also been identified in children and adolescents. Seasonal exacerbations and remissions are not limited to mood disorders, it has also been found in bulimia nervosa, anxiety disorders and other psychiatric illnesses.
   Conclusion: The actuality of seasonal variation in mood has been documented thoroughly by both retrospective and prospective studies. In the general population, depressive symptoms peak in winter, and the most extreme form of this disposition, SAD, appears to be a relatively common disorder.

AB  - The 'centrepiece' of international human rights law in the field of mental health is often said to be the United Nations Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness of 1991. Some observers appreciate the symbolic importance of these principles in providing visibility to the needs of the mentally ill, in stressing the right Of access to adequate mental health care and in establishing the principle equivalence between psychiatry and the rest of medicine. However, the Principles appear basically flawed in several respects.
   (1) they do no have the status of a formal international treaty;
   (2) States are not required to adopt the Principles as 'minimum standards' for the protection of mentally ill persons;
   (3) in some respects, notably on the issue of consent to treatment, the Principles remove patients' rights rather than reinforce them;
   (4) the Principles do not provide for redress nor far any form of monitoring, inspection or supervision by an independent international body.
   Thus, it appears that even at an international level the deep-seated societal ambivalence towards the mentally ill has taken root and that so called 'human rights' principles have little material effect on the lives of psychiatric patients and create double standards in the exercise of choice.

AB  - For nearly a century, bereavement theorists have assumed that recovery from loss requires a period of grief work in which the ultimate goal is the severing of the attachment bond to the deceased. Reviews appearing in the 1980s noted a surprising absence of empirical support for this view, thus leaving the bereavement field without a guiding theoretical base. In this article, the authors consider alternative perspectives on bereavement that are based on cognitive stress theory, attachment theory, the social-functional account of emotion, and trauma theory. They then elaborate on the most promising features of each theory in an attempt to develop an integrative framework to guide future research. The authors elucidate 4 fundamental components of the grieving process-context, meaning, representations of the lost relationship, and coping and emotion-regulation processes-and suggest ways in which these components may interact over the course of bereavement.

AB  - Alternative therapies are widely used by consumers. A number of herbs and dietary supplements have demonstrable effects on mood, memory, and insomnia. There is a significant amount of evidence supporting the use of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) for depression and Ginkgo biloba for dementia. Results of randomized, controlled trials also support the use of kava for anxiety and valerian for insomnia. Although evidence for the use of vitamins and amino acids as sole agents for psychiatric symptoms is not strong, there is intriguing preliminary evidence for the use of folate, tryptophan, and phenylalanine as adjuncts to enhance the effectiveness of conventional antidepressants. S-adenosylmethionine seems to have antidepressant effects, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid, may have mood-stabilizing effects. More research should be conducted on these and other natural products for the prevention and treatment of various psychiatric disorders.

Among these disorders are Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain syndromes, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, addiction disorders, major depression, and anxiety disorders. This review will examine pathophysiological and therapeutic hypotheses generated or supported by clinical studies employing NMDA antagonists and glycine-B agonists and partial agonists. It will also consider ethical issues related to human psychopharmacological studies employing glutamatergic probes.

AB  - Winter depressions in seasonal affective disorder (SAD) are associated with central serotonergic (5-HT) dysfunction. SAD patients demonstrate rather specific, state-dependent, abnormal increases in 'activation-euphoria' ratings following intravenous infusion of the 5-HT receptor agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). Several studies are also consistent with abnormal serotonergic regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in SAD. Here, we investigated the effects of the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist ipsapirone, which produces behavioral effects and HPA-axis activation, to further characterize the 5-HT receptor subtype-specificity of these disturbances in SAD. Eighteen SAD patients and 18 control subjects completed two drug challenges (ipsapirone 0.3 mg/kg and placebo) separated by 3-5 days in randomized order. We measured behavioral responses with the NIMH self-rating scale, and plasma ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin concentrations. Compared with placebo, ipsapirone was associated with significant increases in self-rated 'functional deficit' and 'altered self-reality', and in each of the hormones. There were no differences between groups on any measures. The level of depression in SAD patients was inversely correlated with their ipsapirone-induced cortisol responses. There were significant drug x order effects on baseline 'anxiety' scores, ACTH and cortisol concentrations, such that subjects were significantly more stressed (higher 'anxiety', ACTH and cortisol) prior to their first challenge compared with their second. In conclusion, post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors appear to function normally in SAD. The previously observed m-CPP-induced behavioral abnormality may be mediated by either 5-HT2C or 5-HT7 receptors.

AB  - DSM-IV's strong empirical base has yielded an instrument with good to excellent reliability and improved validity. Diagnostic reliability depends on both the clarity and validity of diagnostic criteria and the changeability of disorders over time: The reliability of schizophrenic spectrum disorders, personality disorders, and some childhood and adolescent disorders remains problematic. Findings on diagnostic validity appear paradoxical: Attempts to validate schizophrenic spectrum disorders with neurobiological and genetic-familial validators have been only modestly successful, whereas the tripartite personality trait model has differentiated a range of depressive and anxiety disorders. Research on comorbidity has identified several highly comorbid disorders (substance-related disorders, personality disorders, depression, and anxiety) as well as some adverse consequences of comorbidity. The advantages of dimensional approaches to diagnosis have largely been demonstrated conceptually; ultimate conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of dimensional and syndromal methods await substantial additional empirical research.

AB  - Objective: To review the clinical management of the psychiatric aspects of Huntington's disease (HD), namely the mood disorders, psychotic disorders, anxiety symptoms, sleep disorders, disorders of sexuality, and the behavioural changes of apathy, irritability, and aggression. Emphasis is on pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic intervention strategies. In addition, the role of psychiatric intervention in presymptomatic testing is explored.
   Method: English language literature on the pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic management of the psychiatric manifestations of HD between 1976 and 1996 was critically reviewed.
   Results: Few sound studies address the clinical management of the psychiatric aspects of HD; thus, only the broadest conclusions can be drawn. Pharmacologic strategies for the treatment of psychiatric aspects of HD were organized according to the therapeutic agent and class, and psychotherapeutic strategies were discussed.
   Conclusion: The clinical management of the psychiatric manifestations of HD requires much more complete and systematic study before any definite conclusions as to efficacy of various approaches can be drawn.

AB  - In recent years, the North Sea oil and gas industry has been exposed to widespread change, including organizational restructuring, "down-sizing", and increased safety regulation. This article reviews the literature on psychosocial stress, health, and safety among offshore personnel in the light of these developments. Few studies directly compare onshore and offshore populations; the available data suggest that, relative to their onshore counterparts, offshore personnel experience greater anxiety, more sleep problems, and higher work load. Within the offshore population, objective factors leg, size, age, type of installation, work patterns, and occupational differences), subjective work perceptions, individual differences (age and personality), and health behavior, all play significant roles in relation to health and safety outcomes. However, much of the research in stress and health offshore has methodological limitations and does not allow causal interpretation. The need for prospective studies of the longterm mental and physical health of offshore personnel, and for research in several specific areas, is noted.

AB  - High levels of psychological disturbance amongst adolescents have been linked to behaviours which can damage physical health, and with mental health, problems in adulthood. The aim of this review was to see if published literature supports the hypothesis that primary care is a suitable setting in which mental health problems in adolescents can be prevented by early detection and treatment.
   Medline, BIDS, SIGLE and Psychlit databases (January 1990-February 1997) were systematically searched for English language studies on adolescent health promotion and mental health in primary care; reference sections were checked for earlier work.
   When offered, adolescent health checks and clinics have been well received with attendance rates of 73% and 83% reported, respectively. Primary care offers a setting for the prevention and detection of mental health problems in adolescents. Further research is needed to determine cost effective ways of using these opportunities.

AB  - Background We describe the increased risk of premature death from natural and from unnatural causes for the common mental disorders.
   Method With a Medline search (1966- 1995) we found 152 English language reports on the mortality of mental disorder which met our inclusion criteria. From these reports, covering 27 mental disorder categories and eight treatment categories, we calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) for all causes of death, ail natural causes and ail unnatural causes; and for most, SMRs for suicide, other violent causes and specific natural causes,
   Results Highest risks of premature death, from both natural and unnatural causes, are for substance abuse and eating disorders. Risk of death from unnatural causes is especially high for the functional disorders, particularly schizophrenia and major depression. Deaths from natural causes are markedly increased for organic mental disorders, mental retardation and epilepsy.
   Conclusion Ali mental disorders have an increased risk of premature death.

AB  - Psychoanalysis as a profession is in difficulty because changes in the mental health field have exposed vulnerabilities inherent in psychoanalytic traditions. In this setting, scientific outcome studies of psychoanalytic treatment are a necessity. To enable such studies, certain preliminary research is required. In particular, a set of reliable diagnoses that recognize psychodynamic factors, in addition to "descriptive" criteria, must be developed. This paper outlines the rationale, significance, and design of a pilot study in the area of anxiety disorders, agoraphobia in particular, intended to provide a basis for recategorization of the currently predominant DSM system.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that social contexts in early life have important and complex effects on childhood psychopathology. Spurred by the lack of an explicit operational definition that could guide the study of such effects, we define a social context operationally as "a set of interpersonal conditions, relevant to a particular behavior or disorder and external to, but shaped and interpreted by, the individual child." Building on this definition, we offer a series of recommendations for future research, based on five theoretically derived propositions: (a) Contexts are nested and multidimensional; (b) contexts broaden, differentiate, and deepen with age, becoming more specific in their effects; (c) contexts and children are mutually determining; (d) a context's meaning to the child determines its effects on the child and arises from the context's ability to provide for fundamental needs; and (e) contexts should be selected for assessment in light of specific questions or outcomes. As reflected in an increasingly rich legacy of literature on child development and psychopathology, social contexts appear to influence emerging mental disorders through dynamic, bidirectional interactions with individual children. Future research will benefit from examining not only statistical interactions between child-and context-specific factors, but also the actual transactions between children and contexts and the transduction of contextual influences into pathways of biological mediation. Because adverse contexts exert powerful effects on the mental health of children, it is important for the field to generate new, more theoretically grounded research addressing the contextual determinants of psychological well-being and disorder.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an efficacious treatment for a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions including major depression, mania, catatonia, Parkinson's disease, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, ECT-induced memory dysfunction complicates the treatment and is a major concern for both patients and providers. We briefly review ECT-induced memory dysfunction and propose a glutamatergic model for it. (Articles examined were retrieved by a Medline search on the terms electroconvulsion and glutamate, with language limited to English.) Specifically, we hypothesize that ECT-induced memory dysfunction results from neuronal insults due to excessive release of excitatory amino acids and activation of their receptors, which produce cation and water flux and reversible oxidative stress. This model offers multiple testable hypotheses; exploring them may help to identify the risk factors for this significant side effect of ECT treatment and may thus yield effective agents for its prevention and treatment.

AB  - This review summarizes the published literature on suicide by jumping, in particular focusing on the social and psychological characteristics of people who have chosen this method of suicide, and the opportunities for prevention. Suicide by jumping accounts for 5% of suicides in England and Wales, and there are marked variations in the use of this method world-wide. A number of locations have gained notoriety as popular places from which to jump. Such sites include The Golden Gate Bridge and Niagara Falls in the USA, and Beachy Head and the Clifton Suspension Bridge in the UK. There is no consistent evidence that those who commit suicide by jumping differ sociodemographically or in their psychopathology from those who use other methods of suicide, although this method is more often used for in-patient suicides, possibly due to lack of access to other means. Survivors of suicidal jumps experience higher subsequent rates of suicide and mental ill health, but the majority do not go on to kill themselves, suggesting that preventive efforts may be worthwhile. This view is supported by other evidence that restricting access to the means of suicide may prevent some would-be suicides. Such measures may also reduce the emotional trauma suffered by those who witness these acts. Health authorities and coroners should consider reviewing local patterns of suicide by jumping, and if necessary institute preventive measures.

AB  - Background: Many patients with major psychiatric disorders who are severely ill, medication-resistant, or medication-intolerant respond more reliably and quickly to a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The management of such patients after successful treatment with ECT is of significant importance given the high rate of relapse and recurrence of these disorders. The unmet clinical need to maintain the mental health of these seriously ill patients at an optimal level has revived the interest in ECT as an alternative prophylactic treatment.
   Method: We review the historical background of ECT and the literature that supports its use as a prophylactic treatment in various disorders and special populations. A clinical summary outlining its efficacy, acceptability, risks, cost-effectiveness, and medicolegal aspects is followed by a guide for prescribing ECT for prophylactic reasons.
   Results: Continuation and maintenance ECT(C/MECT) has been found to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, and cost-effective. Its greatest impact has been in reducing relapse, recurrence and rehospitalization, particularly in the management of recurrent mood disorders in the elderly. The elderly are usually refractory or intolerant to pharmacotherapy but have a good response to ECT during the index episode. Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as affective disorders coexisting with dementia, neurological disorder, or mental retardation, have also been reported to respond to C/MECT. The outcome depends greatly on rate of compliance. Cognitive risks of C/MECT need to be further studied because the literature to date consists mostly of case reports and anecdotal evidence. Controlled studies with well-defined outcome measurements are needed.
   Conclusions: When planning a rational approach to the care of patients with major psychiatric disorders,clinicians should carefully consider ECT along with other alternatives.

AB  - Objective: In a review of the literature from 1980 to 1994 on psychological and psychiatric problems in patients with cancer, the prevalence, severity, and the course of these problems (ie, depression, anxiety, and general psychological distress) were studied with the help of meta-analyses and qualitative analyses. Apart from this, qualitative analyses were also applied with respect to other relevant variables. Method: A literature search in MEDLINE was conducted and cross-references of articles identified via MEDLINE. Meta-analysis was applied when possible. Results: There seemed to be a wide variation across studies in psychological and psychiatric problems. Meta-analysis showed no significant differences between cancer patients and the normal population with respect to anxiety and psychological distress. However, cancer patients seemed to be significantly more depressed than normals. Compared with psychiatric patients, cancer patients were significantly less depressed, anxious, or distressed. Compared with a sample of other medical patients, cancer patients showed significantly less anxiety. With respect to course, a significant decrease was found in the meta-analysis for anxiety, but not for depression. Further meta-analyses showed significant differences among groups of cancer patients with regard to tumor site, sex, age, design of the study, and year of publication. From the qualitative analyses, it seemed that medical, sociodemographic, and psychological variables were related inconsistently to psychological and psychiatric problems. Conclusion: With the exception of depression, the amount of psychological and psychiatric problems in patients with cancer does not differ from the normal population. The amount of psychological and psychiatric problems is significantly less in cancer patients than in psychiatric patients. The amount of anxiety is significantly less in cancer patients than in other groups of medical patients with mixed diagnoses, whereas depression is not. Future studies should aim at exploring possible causes for the sometimes impressive differences in psychological or psychiatric problems among patients with cancer.

AB  - Background Mental disorders have a strong association with suicide. This metaanalysis, or statistical overview, of the literature gives an estimate of the suicide risk of the common mental disorders.
   Method We searched the medical literature to find reports on the mortality of mental disorders. English language reports were located on MEDUNE (1966-1993) with the search terms 'mental disorders','brain injury', 'eating disorders', 'epilepsy','suicide attempt','psychosurgery', with 'mortality' and 'follow-up studies', and from the reference lists of these reports. We abstracted 249 reports with two years or more follow-up and less than 10% loss of subjects, and compared observed numbers of suicides with those expected. A standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated for each disorder.
   Results Of 44 disorders considered, 36 have a significantly raised SMR for suicide, live have a raised SMR which fails to reach significance, one SMR is not raised and for two entries the SMR could not be calculated.
   Conclusions If these results can be generalised then virtually all mental disorders have an increased risk of suicide excepting mental retardation and dementia. The suicide risk is highest for functional and lowest for organic disorders with substance misuse disorders lying between. However, within these broad groupings the suicide risk varies widely.

AB  - Background: Certain drugs may contribute to the etiology of depressive symptoms and depressive disorders. The objective of this review is to critically appraise the literature concerned with these potential etiological associations. Method: The review was based on papers uncovered in electronic literature searches using Medline, Psychlit and Psychological Abstracts. Statistical power calculations were used to assist in the interpretation of negative results. Results: A large number of publications were uncovered, but most of these were case reports. There were relatively few empirical studies. Corticosteroids, certain calcium channel blockers and digoxin have been associated with depression by replicated, well conducted studies. Psychostimulant withdrawal is also associated with prominent depressive symptoms. Preliminary evidence suggests that antihyperlipidemic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, sedative hypnotics, psychostimulants and certain hormonal agents may also cause depression. Despite an extensive literature, the potential association between P-blockers and depressive symptoms remains controversial. There is no substantial evidence that I-dopa or histamine-2-receptor blockers cause depression and the literature is relatively conclusive in determining that thiazide diuretics are not associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: A small, but growing, literature confirms that certain drug exposures can contribute to the biopsychosocial etiology of depressive symptoms and disorders. Current beliefs and diagnostic conventions classify drug-induced depression into a distinct category (Substance-Induced Mood Disorder): but this approach is not specifically supported by the existing literature.

AB  - A 74 year old retired building inspector with a 15 year history of Parkinson's disease (PD) presented with severe resting tremor in the right hand, generalized bradykinesia, difficulties with the initiation of gait with freezing, mental depression and generalized cognitive impairment despite being fully medicated, Testing of constructional abilities employing various drawing tasks demonstrated drawing impairment compatible with severe left hemispheric dysfunction. After receiving two successive transcranial applications, each of 20 minutes duration, with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 7.5 picotesla flux density and frequencies of 5Hz and 7Hz respectively, his tremor remitted and there was dramatic improvement in his drawing performance. Additional striking improve improvements in his drawing performance occurred over the following two days after he continued to receive daily treatments with EMFs. The patient's drawings were subjected to a Reliability Test in which 10 raters reported 100% correct assessment of pre-and post drawings with all possible comparisons (X-2 = 5.0; p < .05). This case demonstrates in PD rapid reversal of drawing impairment related to left hemispheric dysfunction by brief transcranial applications of AC pulsed picotesla flux density EMFs and suggests that cognitive deficits associated with Parkinsonism, which usually are progressive and unaffected by dopamine replacement therapy, may be partly reversed by administration of these EMFs. Treatment with picotesla EMFs reflects a ''cutting edge'' approach to the management of cognitive impairment in Parkinsonism.

AB  - Behavioural disorders in Parkinson's disease can grossly be subdivided in primary disturbances and those which are related to drug treatment.
   Depression and anxiety are a common feature in parkinsonian patients. Both occur independently of drug treatment. In general, most current antidepressive and anxiolytic drugs could be administered in Parkinson's disease with the same precautions as in the normal population. However, in single case reports modern serotonin reuptake blockers in Parkinson's disease have been accused to worsen parkinsonian motor condition. Combinations of serotonin reuptake inhibitors with MAO-inhibitors like selegiline should be used with caution.
   In the case of cognitive decline firstly an underlying depression should be disclosed or if existent be treated. Depression seems to be the single most important factor associated with the severity of dementia and early antidepressant treatment seems to decrease cognitive decline in depressed parkinsonian patients. Anticholinergic medications should be discontinued since they may cause mental side effects.
   Sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease are mainly caused by nocturnal akinesia, which causes sleep fragmentation or altered dreaming and nightmares, which might be a side-effect of dopaminergic treatment. In the first case the administration of a controlled release preparation of levodopa at bedtime may be indicated. If the sleep disorder is considered to be due to dopaminergic medication, a reduction of long-term acting agents like modern dopamine agonists and controlled-release levodopa should be considered.
   In severe psychotic states related to drug treatment antiparkinsonian therapy must be carefully analysed and, if possible, reduced. If motor condition worsens and/or psychiatric symptoms do not improve, initiation with "atypical" neuroleptics like clozapine is indicated. The pharmacological and clinical properties of new antipsychotic drugs that can be used in Parkinson's disease are revised.

AB  - This article is a sketch of the historical development of the field of behavioral and nonbehavioral therapy research. Four phases are characterized: (1) establishing scientific research (1927-1954), (2) searching for scientific rigor (1955-1969), (3) expansion and organization (1970-1983), and (4) consolidation and reformulation (1984-present). Continuities between and key developments within successive phases are outlined, with emphasis given to methodological innovations. The corroboration of select findings about process and outcome and the development of several critical discourses within the third and fourth phases have implications for the provision of mental health care and for policy discussions.

AB  - The occurrence of movement disorders and particularly Parkinsonian symptoms is uncommon in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) despite the rather frequent presence of demyelinating plaques in the basal ganglia. This disparity between the occurrence of clinical symptoms in MS and the distribution of demyelinating plaques suggests that impairment of neurotransmitter functions rather than demyelination may be critical to the clinical manifestations of the disease. A 48 year old woman with remitting-progressive MS developed a bilateral Parkinsonian syndrome in association with acute emotional stress which resolved after she received two brief successive extracerebral applications of low frequency picotesla flux density electromagnetic fields (EMFs). It is believed that in this patient Parkinsonism may have existed in a subclinical form and that acute stress, which previously has been shown to precipitate symptoms of Parkinson's disease, triggered the onset of Parkinsonism by further reducing dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia. The rapid reversal of the Parkinsonian syndrome by EMFs was related to a presumed augmentation of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission which, on the basis of CSF studies, is reduced in chronic MS patients. The efficacy of EMFs in the treatment of Parkinson's disease had been documented previously but this report demonstrates that this treatment modality is beneficial also for the treatment of Parkinsonism developing in the setting of other neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Purpose. Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Hmong refugee populations in the United States face serious physical and psychosocial health issues. Literature on these populations is largely descriptive of illnesses and of cultural beliefs or behavior patterns related to illness. There is minimal literature linking beliefs and behaviors to the underlying cultural themes. The purpose of this paper was to search the literature for cultural themes from which culturally relevant health promotion strategies could be designed.
   Search Methods. Literature was reviewed from the fields of health, social, and political science, history, and Southeast Asian folklore. Search methods included review of 147 writings from library and MEDLINE search and 123 interviews with refugees and key professionals in the field. This manuscript includes 106 selections as well as content from 93 interviews.
   Findings and Conclusions. From the literature emerged two cultural themes common to these populations, kinship solidarity and the search for equilibrium. The use of these cultural themes as carriers of health messages is suggested. Examples of ways to link the message with the cultural theme are presented, including the use of folklore, recognition of cultural illnesses, and use of cultural knowledge in addressing new situations such as inner city urban survival. Cultural themes are a means of conveying health messages addressing such issues as transition in family structure, depression, and substance abuse.

AB  - Drug-induced depressive disorders are classified in the DSM-III-R as organic mood syndrome, depressed type. The ability of certain drugs to cause depression is of clinical relevance because organic mood syndrome is a component of the differential diagnosis of depressive symptoms. Consequently, psychiatric textbooks often provide different lists of drugs thought to be capable of causing depression. Strong evidence supporting the existence of causal associations is often lacking. There is no specific drug for which there is definitive evidence of a causal association with depressive symptoms or depressive disorders. Nevertheless, for a number of drugs, the evidence is suggestive, although not conclusively, of a causal association. Despite this, rational decisions about the continuation or discontinuation of drugs can often be made. In this paper, the literature is reviewed and guidelines are suggested for the management of patients with depressive symptoms which may be related to drugs.

AB  - The problem of emotional tension is usually discussed only with regard to its negative (maladaptive) aspects.  The positive (adaptive) function of emotional tension, however, is as important as its negative function.  In this article, we have examined psychophysiological outcomes of adaptive versus maladaptive emotional tension with respect to opposite forms of behavior (search activity and renunciation of search) that have an opposite outcome on body resistance and performance. Some traditional psychophysiological problems,  for example, the law of initial values (Wilder, 1931), the difference between orienting and defensive reaction, or between anxiety and panic behavior, are revised on the basis of the assumption of adaptive and maladaptive emotional tension.

AB  - The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia and the emphasis on other neurotransmitters, most notably norepinephirne, serotonin, and acetylcholine, in the pathogenesis of depression, have focused attention away from substantial evidence implicating dopamine in affective disorders. The clinical evidence includes alterations in depressive symptoms with aging (concomitant with possible changes in dopamine metabolism), potential dopaminergic involvement in several subtypes of depression, similarities between some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and those of depression (including psychomotor retardation and diminished motivation), and potential dopaminergic abnormalities in seasonal mood disorder. The biochemical evidence in patients with deprission derives from studies of homovanillic acid, a dopamine metabolite, indicating diminished dopamine turnover. In addition, there is a considerable amount of pharmacologic evidence regarding the efficacy of antidepressants with dopaminergic effects in the treatment of depression. We conclude that dopamine likely contributes significantly to the pathophysiology of depression. However, the role of dopamine in this syndrome must be understood in the context of existing theories involving other neurotransmitters which may act independently, and interact with dopamine and other neurochemicals, to contribute to depression.

AB  - Environmental events, both physical and emotional, can produce stress reactions to widely varying degrees. Stress can affect many aspects of physiology, and levels of stress, emotional status, and means of coping with stress can influence health and disease. The stress system consists of brain elements, of which the main components are the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and locus ceruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE)/autonomic systems, as well as their peripheral effectors, the pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic system, which function to coordinate the stress response. Activation of the stress system results in behavioral and physical changes which allow the organism to adapt. This system is closely integrated with other central nervous system elements involved in the regulation of behavior and emotion, in addition to the axes responsible for reproduction, growth and immunity. With current trends in stress research which focus on understanding the mechanisms through which the stress-response is adaptive or becomes maladaptive, there is a growing association of stress system dysfunction, characterized by hyperactivity and/or hypoactivity to various pathophysiological states. The purpose of this review is to 1) define the concepts of stress and the stress response from a historical perspective, 2) present a dynamic overview of the biobehavioral mechanisms that participate in the stress response, and 3) examine the consequences of stress on the physiologic and behavioral well-being of the organism by integrating knowledge from apparently disparate fields of science.

KW  - DAYTIME SLEEPINESS
KW  - DIAGNOSIS
KW  - MOOD
AB  - Objective:  The authors review the usefulness, reliability, and validity of recently proposed subtypes of primary insomnia.  DSM-III uses "primary insomnia" to indicate chronic insomnia not associated with other diagnosable mental or medical disorders, whereas the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) recognizes three subtypes:  psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, and sleep state misperception.  Method:  After reviewing all of the primary source references for each insomnia disorder in the ICSD and all of the additional primary sources cited in each of these, the authors conducted an automated literature search using Medline.  Of the 48 primary sources located, the authors selected 27 studies that were reported in peer-reviewed journals, had the largest available subject groups, used diagnostic reliability procedures, and included control groups.  Results:  The studies reviewed contained limited empirical support for the proposed distinction between idiopathic and psychophysiological insomnia.  Sleep state misperception appears, however, to be a highly prevalent feature of chronic insomnia generally, rather than only a specific disorder per se.  Conclusions:  The authors conclude that there is not yet sufficient empirical evidence to warrant the abandonment of DSM-III-R "primary insomnia" and the adoption of the ICSD subtypes in DSM-IV.  However, they affirm the heuristic value of the ICSD subtypes and the need for field trials to compare the performance characteristics of the DSM-III-R and ICSD systems with respect to 1) interrater reliability, 2) effects of rater expertise (generalist versus specialist) on rates of agreement, and 3) effects of polysomnographic data on rates of agreement.

AB  - In Victoria, Australia, both dryland salinity and salinity in irrigation regions are serious agricultural problems. One option to control the latter is to pump groundwater to maintain it below the surface. However, this leaves a saline wastewater for disposal, probably into local streams or wetlands. This review of the salt sensitivity of the biota of Australian streams and wetlands gives information of interest to those responsible for developing controls on these discharges. The review addresses the lethal and sub-lethal effects of salinity on microbes (mainly bacteria), macrophytes and micro-algae, riparian vegetation, invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. Data suggest that direct adverse biological effects are likely to occur in Australian river, stream and wetland ecosystems if salinity is increased to around 1 000 mg L-1. The review highlights a general lack of data on the sensitivity of freshwater plants and animals to salinity increases.

KW  - Valeriana jatamansi
AB  - Valeriana jatamansi Jones commonly known as "Indian Valerian" is a perennial medicinal herb, gynodioecious in nature belonging to family Valerianaceae. Today the species is highly valued medicinal plant with many pharmacopeial monographs. It occurs at an altitude of 1200-3000 m asl. Rhizomes and roots of the herb yields essential oil. The therapeutic properties of Valerian are attributed to a group of compounds known as Valmane and Valepotriates. The Valepotriates are a group of monoterpenoids of irridoid type having epoxy group and beta-acetoxy isovaleric acid. Three novel sesquiterpenoids, valeriananoids of each, forty constituents of essential oils and eleven jatamanins including a new lignin isovaleroxylariciresinol have been extracted from this valuable herb. Underground parts are used in mental disorders, scanting hair, epilepsy, leprosy, as an insecticide and as potential anti-tumour agent. Present paper highlights the information based on available published literature so as to describe the active constituents and medicinal profile of this threatened species which will serve as a valuable platform for further research and conservation of this medicinally important species.

AB  - This article traces the origins and production of the Post Abortion Syndrome (PAS), a fallacious bio-ideological construct which alleges a link between abortion and mental health risks. Through the work of social actors (anti-abortion activists, policy makers, funders, advocates, and researchers) involved in its construction, this diagnosis was disseminated and diffused into public policy in the US and is used as 'evidence' in deterring people from having abortions. This is despite overwhelming evidence that abortion poses no greater mental health risks than carrying an unintended pregnancy to term. Circulation of this fallacious discourse invalidates, distorts, and homogenizes the lived experiences of reproductive people, contributing to epistemologies of ignorance as pertains to women's health and reproductive experiences. This article examines the invention of PAS, exploring its political underpinnings and ongoing effects. We unearth how psychology and medicine have been coopted to function as handmaidens in passing conservative legislation, attending to the process of willful distortion underpinning this history. Uncovering the systemic nature of the production of ignorance around reproductive people's bodies and psychologies is a necessary step in providing liberatory epistemologies for pregnant people and in enabling individuals to make their own meaning of their abortions.

AB  - As per the requirement of metabolism and fitness, normal cellular functions are controlled by several proteins, and their interactive molecular and signaling events at multiple levels. Protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms ensure the correct folding and proper utilization of these proteins to avoid their misfolding and aggregation. To maintain the optimum environment of complex proteome PQC system employs various E3 ubiquitin ligases for the selective degradation of aberrant proteins. Glycoprotein 78 (Gp78) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that prevents multifactorial deleterious accumulation of different misfolded proteins via endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). However, the precise role of Gp78 under stress conditions to avoid bulk misfolded aggregation is unclear, which can act as a crucial resource to establish the dynamic nature of the proteome. Present article systematically explains the detailed molecular characterization of Gp78 and also addresses its various cellular physiological functions, which could be crucial to achieving protein homeostasis. Here, we comprehensively represent the current findings of Gp78, which shows its PQC roles in different physiological functions and diseases; and thereby propose novel opportunities to better understand the unsolved questions for therapeutic interventions linked with different protein misfolding disorders.

AB  - At present, available treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unable to halt disease progression. Microglia, the resident macrophages in the brain, are strongly implicated in the pathology and progressively degenerative nature of AD. Specifically, microglia are activated in response to both beta amyloid (A beta) and neuronal damage, and can become a chronic source of neurotoxic cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). NADPH oxidase is a multi-subunit enzyme complex responsible for the production of both extracellular and intracellular ROS by microglia. Importantly, NADPH oxidase expression is upregulated in AD and is an essential component of microglia-mediated A beta neurotoxicity. Activation of microglial NADPH oxidase causes neurotoxicity through two mechanisms: 1) extracellular ROS produced by microglia are directly toxic to neurons; 2) intracellular ROS function as a signaling mechanism in microglia to amplify the production of several pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic cytokines (for example, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin-1 beta). The following review describes how targeting NADPH oxidase can reduce a broad spectrum of toxic factors (for example, cytokines, ROS, and reactive nitrogen species) to result in inhibition of neuronal damage from two triggers of deleterious microglial activation (A beta and neuron damage), offering hope in halting the progression of AD.

AB  - Much has been said about how significant life events modulate our response to stimuli that are integral to those events. However, we know less about the more general consequences of these events, that is, how they affect Subsequent learning abilities that are seemingly irrelevant to the initial event. Here, it is proposed that significant life events, most often stressful in nature, alter future learned responses by inducing nonspecific and persistent changes in neuroanatomical structures. These change are induced in the presence of sex and stress hormones, which are released either in response to the event itself or as a consequence of stages or life. To illustrate, the effects of acute stressful experience oil learning processes and their regulation by the release of hormones are reviewed. I discuss how these events and their hormonal consequences alter anatomical substrates such as those involved in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. It is proposed that these modulatory processes allow past experiences to change the shape or memories to conic. In this way, memorable life events become less about the past and more about the future. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Visual and auditory motion information can be used together to provide complementary information about the movement of objects. To investigate the neural substrates of such cross-modal integration, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess brain activation while subjects performed separate visual and auditory motion discrimination tasks. Areas of unimodal activation included the primary and/or early sensory cortex for each modality plus additional sites extending toward parietal cortex. Areas conjointly activated by both tasks included lateral parietal cortex, lateral frontal cortex, anterior midline and anterior insular cortex. The parietal site encompassed distinct, but partially overlapping, zones of activation in or near the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). A subsequent task requiring an explicit cross-modal speed comparison revealed several foci of enhanced activity relative to the unimodal tasks. These included the IPS, anterior midline, and anterior insula but not frontal cortex. During the unimodal auditory motion task, portions of the dorsal visual motion system showed signals depressed below resting baseline. Thus, interactions between the two systems involved either enhancement or suppression depending on the stimuli present and the nature of the perceptual task. Together these results identify human cortical regions involved in polysensory integration and the attentional selection of cross-modal motion information.

AB  - Preventing childhood obesity has become a top priority in efforts to improve our nation's public health. Although much research is needed to address this health crisis, it is important to approach childhood obesity with an understanding of the social stigma that obese youths face, which is pervasive and can have serious consequences for emotional and physical health. This report reviews existing research on weight stigma in children and adolescents, with attention to the nature and extent of weight bias toward obese youths and to the primary sources of stigma in their lives, including peers, educators, and parents. The authors also examine the literature on psychosocial and physical health consequences of childhood obesity to illustrate the role that weight stigma may play in mediating negative health outcomes. The authors then review stigma-reduction efforts that have been tested to improve attitudes toward obese children, and they highlight complex questions about the role of weight bias in childhood obesity prevention. With these literatures assembled, areas of research are outlined to guide efforts on weight stigma in youths, with an emphasis on the importance of studying the effect of weight stigma on physical health outcomes and identifying effective interventions to improve attitudes.

AB  - Psychosocial maternal stress experienced during different vulnerable periods throughout gestation is thought to increase the individual's risk to develop neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular and metabolic disease in later life. Cortisol has generally been identified as the major mediator of maternal stress transfer to the fetus. Its lipophilic nature allows a trans-placental passage and thus excessive maternal cortisol could persistently impair the development of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). However, cortisol alone cannot fully explain all effects of maternal stress especially during early to mid pregnancy before maturation of the fetal HPAA has even begun and expression of fetal glucocorticoid receptors is limited. This review focuses on mediators of maternal fetal stress transfer that in addition to cortisol have been proposed as transmitters of maternal stress: catecholamines, cytokines, serotonin/tryptophan, reactive-oxygen-species and the maternal microbiota. We propose that the effects of psychosocial maternal stress on fetal development and health and disease in later life are not a consequence of a single pathway but are mediated by multiple stress-transfer mechanisms acting together in a synergistic manner.

AB  - The sport of competitive bodybuilding requires an intense regimen of weightlifting and dieting, often aided with muscle-building or fat-burning drugs, and culminating in an on-stage posing competition. Despite these rigorous demands, competitive bodybuilding is popular, with thousands of competitions performed annually around the world. Although many studies have addressed the psychological features of various sports and the athletes who compete in them, few have examined the psychological aspects of bodybuilding. Even fewer studies have specifically examined competitive bodybuilders, as opposed to the much larger group of "recreational" bodybuilders who do not compete. The limited available literature suggests that competitive bodybuilders may show an increased risk for four categories of psychopathology: muscle dysmorphia, eating disorders, abuse of appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs, and exercise dependence. However, in each of these categories, one must carefully distinguish between the planned and dedicated behaviors required for success in the sport, as opposed to frankly pathological behaviors that impair social or occupational function, cause subjective distress, or lead to adverse health consequences. Future work should attempt to better assess the nature and prevalence of these conditions among competitive bodybuilders, with perhaps greatest attention to the issue of drug use.

AB  - Purpose of review The current review provides an examination of the levels of personality functioning outlined by the International Classification of Diseases-11 and the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Recent findings Across self-report measures, high convergence is observed, and they evince relatively robust relations with general and pathological traits as well as other clinical symptoms. At the same time, current measures of impairment also demonstrate unstable factor structures, poor discriminant validity (when measures offer subscales aligned with different forms of personality impairment), and tend to account for relatively little unique variance beyond traits. As a result, some have questioned the utility of personality impairment, as currently measured. The dimensional models of personality psychopathology included in the International Classification of Diseases-11 and 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders signify important steps toward an empirically supported and clinically useful diagnostic model; however, self-report measures of impairment are problematic. The authors conclude by calling for the refinement of these measures to more directly assess deficits in various domains of functioning as well as the dimensional models, by assessing traits first, and then examining the nature of the associated personality impairment.

AB  - Psychiatric taxonomies exist within conceptual frameworks which presuppose certain conceptions of psychiatric distress and offer guiding principles. This article provides an overview of the historical development of psychiatric classifications with an emphasis on their methodological assumptions. After identifying roots of scientific psychiatric classifications in the works of Sydenham and Linnaeus and discussing early classification systems, our survey focuses on the Kahlbaum-Hecker-Kraepelin paradigm (with its emphasis on longitudinal course of illness), the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard tradition (with its emphasis on neural systems), the development of the ICD and the DSM classifications (with their roots in medical statistics, their pragmatic nature, and their emphasis on descriptive and operationalized criteria), psychodynamic and idiographic perspectives (e.g. the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual), and transdiagnostic approaches (e.g. Research Domain Criteria). The central philosophical questions of nosology (descriptive vs aetiological, symptoms vs course of illness, idiographic vs nomothetic, categorical vs dimensional, etc.) have appeared and reappeared throughout this evolution. Ongoing controversies reflect the epistemological and ontological difficulties inherent in defining and classifying mental illness. It may be that no single taxonomy can satisfy all clinical, research, and administrative needs, and that, echoing the ideas of Aubrey Lewis, multiple systems may be required to serve different needs.

AB  - Mind-wandering (MW) is among the most robust and permanent expressions of human conscious awareness, classically regarded by philosophers, clinicians, and scientists as a core element of an intact sense of self. Nevertheless, the scientific exploration of MW poses unique challenges; MW is by nature a spontaneous, off task, internal mental process which is often unaware and usually difficult to control, document or replicate. Consequently, there is a lack of accepted modus operandi for exploring MW in a laboratory setup, leading to a relatively small amount of studies regarding the neural basis of MW. In order to facilitate scientific examination of MW the current review categorizes recent literature into five suggested strategies. Each strategy represents a different methodology of MW research within functional neuroimaging paradigms. Particular attention is paid to resting-state brain activity and to the "default-mode" network. Since the default network is known to exert high activity levels during off-task conditions, it stands out as a compelling candidate for a neuro-biological account of mind-wandering, in itself a rest-based phenomenon. By summarizing the results within and across strategies we suggest further insights into the neural basis and adaptive value of MW, a truly intriguing and unique human experience.

AB  - People in different cultures have strikingly different construals of the self, of others, and of the interdependence of the 2. These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cultures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of individuals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interdependence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motivation; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed. Focusing on differences in self-construals enables apparently inconsistent empirical findings to be reconciled, and raises questions about what have been thought to be culture-free aspects of cognition, emotion, and motivation.

AB  - The intensified administration of chemotherapeutic drugs has gradually replaced cranial radiation therapy (CRT) for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While CRT is often implicated in neurocognitive impairment in ALL survivors, there is a paucity of the literature that evaluates the persistence of neurocognitive deficits in long-term survivors of pediatric ALL who were treated with contemporary chemotherapy-only protocols. Results from this systematic review concurred to the probable cognitive-sparing effect of chemotherapy-based protocols over CRT in long-term survivors. However, coupled with multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, survivors who received chemotherapy treatment still suffered from apparent cognitive impairment, particularly in the attention and executive function domains. Notably, there is evidence to suggest that the late neurotoxic effect of methotrexate on survivors' neurocognitive performance may be dose-related. This review also recommends future pharmacokinetic, neuroimaging and genetic studies to illuminate the multifactorial nature of this subject matter and discusses the potential value of neurochemical, physiological, inflammatory and genetic markers for the prediction of susceptibility to neurocognitive impairment in long-term survivors of childhood ALL (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the cognitive architecture of human action, showing how it is organized over several levels and how it is built up. Basic action concepts (BACs) are identified as major building blocks on a representation level. These BACs are cognitive tools for mastering the functional demands of movement tasks. Results from different lines of research showed that not only the structure formation of mental representations in long-term memory but also chunk formation in working memory are built up on BACs and relate systematically to movement structures. It is concluded that such movement representations might provide the basis for action implementation and action control in skilled voluntary movements in the form of cognitive reference structures. To simulate action implementation we discuss challenges and issues that arise when we try to replicate complex movement abilities in robots. Among the key issues to be addressed is the question how structured representations can arise during skill acquisition and how the underlying processes can be understood sufficiently succinctly to replicate them on robot platforms. Working towards this goal, we translate our findings in studies of motor control in humans into models that can guide the implementation of cognitive robot architectures. Focusing on the issue of manual action control, we illustrate some results in the context of grasping with a five-fingered anthropomorphic robot hand.

AB  - This paper focuses on several aspects of the relationship between sleep and depression, with particular attention to objective factors and subjective perceptions. It does not address the effect that antidepressants have on sleep, nor does it explore the wider implications of the types and course of depression, age, or other psychiatric conditions. "Normal sleep'' is explored, examining typical sleep architecture in individuals without sleep disorders, psychiatric conditions or physical illness. Sleep disorders are reviewed and examined to present the nature of the disturbance and the role that they may play in depression, with particular attention paid to insomnia. Studies have identified a sub-group of insomnia patients (highly distressed poor sleepers), who appear to be less satisfied with their sleep quality than "low distressed poor sleepers'', even though they did not differ on sleep timing perceptions. Recent work has shown that depressed individuals to be less satisfied with sleep quality than healthy controls, even though they did not differ on sleep timing perceptions. The evidence presented here supports the view that subjective sleep perceptions play an important role in depression. Poor subjective perceptions of sleep in depression may be associated with faulty cognitions. This has been found extensively in insomnia, but is under-researched in depression.

TI  - Developmental regulation of cognitive abilities: Modified composition of a molecular switch turns on associative learning
KW  - N-methyl-D-aspartate
KW  - postnatal plasticity
KW  - cognition
AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) act as molecular coincidence detectors and allow for association or dissociation between pre-and postsynaptic neurons. NMDA receptors are central to remodeling of synaptic connections during postnatal development and associative learning abilities in adults. The ability to remodel neural networks is altered during postnatal development, possibly due to a change in the composition of NMDARs. That is, as forebrain systems (and cerebellum) develop, synaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs (NR2B-NMDARs) are replaced by NR2A-containing NMDARs (NR2A-NMDARs) and NR2B-NMDARs move to extrasynaptic sites. During the initial phase of the switch, synapses contain both NR2A- and NR2B-NMDARs and both long-term potentiation and long-term depression are enhanced. As NMDAR subunit expression decreases and NR2A-NMDARs come to predominate in the synapse, channel function and synaptic plasticity are reduced, and remodeling ability dissipates. The end result is a balance of plasticity and stability that is optimal for information processing and storage. Associative learning abilities involving different sensory modalities emerge sequentially, in accordance with synaptic maturation in related cortical and underlying brain structures. Thus, developmental alterations in NMDAR composition that occur at different ages in various brain structures may explain the protracted nature of the maturation of various associative learning abilities.

AB  - Information used in decision making arises from the structuring of observations and data. The collection, dissemination, and use of information has monetary and non-monetary costs (e.g., competition for attention) and necessitates trade-offs. Understanding the benefits of having information (i.e., the value of information, VOI), including resulting societal outcomes, is useful to information producers/funders and decision makers. Using theory, use cases, and hypotheticals, we describe how information (e.g., geospatial information) is valued and incorporated in decisions and actions related to managing natural resources, environments, and the impacts of natural and anthropogenic hazards. We discuss the nature of information and how it relates to models (conceptual, mental, scientific), beliefs, knowledge, and economic analyses. VOI approaches and behavioral factors that potentially affect information use and value are summarized. Framing of information and VOI through data to decision pathways (DDPs) at first simplifies understanding, then illustrates the benefits of information, and the human and societal challenges encountered in valuing and using it. We present approaches to overcome these challenges. Our transdisciplinary analysis concludes with a summary of critical issues affecting DDPs and VOI, and suggestions for improving both economic analyses and the actionability and use of information.

AB  - Mathematical abilities that are correlated with various life outcomes vary across individuals. One approach to improve mathematical abilities is by understanding the underlying cognitive functions. Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that mathematical abilities are subserved by "core" and "noncore" skills. Core skills are commonly regarded as the "innate" capacity to attend to and process numerical information, while noncore skills are those that are important for mathematical cognition, but are not exclusive to the mathematical domain such as executive functions, spatial skills, and attention. In recent years, mathematical training has been combined with the application of noninvasive brain stimulation to further enhance training outcomes. However, the development of more strategic training paradigms is hindered by the lack of understanding on the contributory nature of core and noncore skills and their neural underpinnings. In the current review, we will examine the effects of brain stimulation with focus on transcranial electrical stimulation on core and noncore skills, and its impact on mathematical and numerical training. We will conclude with a discussion on the theoretical and experimental implications of these studies and directions for further research.

AB  - In the mid-1960s, a small number of scientists postulated the role of oxidative stress and oxygen-derived free radicals in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ischemic heart disease. However, because of the technical difficulty of measuring free radicals and quantitating oxidative damage, it was very difficult to prove that free radicals could contribute to cell pathology. The role of oxidative stress in biological systems was not definitely recognized until the early 1980s when measurement of short-lived oxygen-derived reactive species was made possible by the advent of sophisticated techniques such as EPR spectroscopy or fluorescent probes. These enabled both the study of free radical biochemistry and the acquisition of useful information about the nature and consequences of free radical-induced protein and lipid oxidation. The hypothesis that reactive oxygen species mediate cellular damage produced upon reperfusion of ischemic myocardium has gained considerable support during the past 10-15 years. Several experimental studies indicated that the administration of antioxidant enzymes or non-enzymatic antioxidants offers a significant degree of protection against ischemic damage, improving functional recovery and reducing morphological alterations to cardiomyocytes. In this context, selenium, as an essential component of glutathione peroxidase, plays a critical role in protecting aerobic tissues from oxygen radical-initiated cell injury.

AB  - The current study investigated workplace envy by exploring if perceived self-efficacy of negative and positive emotions could predict malicious or benign envy. This study also examined how malicious and benign envy relate to two important organizational outcomes: job engagement and turnover intentions. Malicious envy is typically associated with negative emotions toward the target of comparison as well as negative behavioral outcomes, whereas benign envy is typically associated with positive emotions toward the target of comparison as well as positive behavioral outcomes. A total of 80 participants completed multiple measures gauging the variables of interest in this study. Results were mixed: Although both dimensions of emotional self-efficacy significantly and positively predicted benign envy, neither dimension significantly predicted malicious envy. Additionally, benign envy significantly and positively predicted job engagement, and malicious envy significantly and positively predicted turnover intention. Both effects were practically significant. However, benign envy did not negatively predict turnover intention, and malicious envy did not negatively predict job engagement. Although these results did not confirm all hypothesized relationships, they demonstrate the complexity of envy as a construct, supporting its multidimensional nature. Our findings also provide further insight into the predictors and outcomes of benign and malicious envy in the workplace.

AB  - Cocaine addiction is a chronic brain disease in which the drug seeking habits and profound cognitive, emotional and motivational alterations emerge from drug-induced neuroadaptations on a vulnerable brain. Therefore, a 'cocaine addiction brain circuit' has been described to explain this disorder. Studies in both cocaine patients and rodents reveal the hippocampus as a main node in the cocaine addiction circuit. The contribution of the hippocampus to cocaine craving and the associated memories is essential to understand the chronic relapsing nature of addiction, which is the main obstacle for the recovery. Interestingly, the hippocampus holds a particular form of plasticity that is rare in the adult brain: the ability to generate new functional neurons. There is an active scientific debate on the contributions of these new neurons to the addicted brain. This review focuses on the potential role(s) of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in cocaine addiction. Although the current evidence primarily originates from animal research, these preclinical studies support AHN as a relevant component for the hippocampal effects of cocaine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The humanitarian cluster approach was established in 2005 but clarity on how lessons from humanitarian clusters can inform and strengthen health system responses to mass displacement in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) is lacking. We conducted a scoping review to examine the extent and nature of existing research and identify relevant lessons.
   We used Arksey and O'Malley's scoping framework with Levac's 2010 revisions and Khalil's 2016 refinements, focussing on identifying lessons from discrete humanitarian clusters that could strengthen health system responses to mass population displacement. We summarised thematically by cluster.
   Of 186 sources included, 56% were peer-reviewed research articles. Most related to health (37%), protection (18%), or nutrition (13%) clusters. Key lessons for health system responses included the necessity of empowering women; ensuring communities are engaged in decision-making processes (e.g. planning and construction of camps and housing) to strengthen trust and bonds between and within communities; and involving potential end-users in technological innovations development (e.g. geographical information systems) to ensure relevance and applicability.
   Our review provided evidence that non-health clusters can contribute to improving health outcomes using focussed interventions for implementation by government or humanitarian partners to inform LMIC health system responses to mass displacement.

KW  - women
AB  - The institution of marriage in Hindus is regulated by the prevailing social norms and the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA), 1955. Married women with mental illness are heavily discriminated. This paper examines the social and legal aspects of Hindu marriage in women with mental illness. The HMA, 1955 lays down the conditions for a Hindu marriage and also provides matrimonial reliefs: Nullity of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation and divorce. The application of the provisions of HMA in the setting mental illness is difficult and challenging. There is a wide gap between the legislative provisions of HMA, and societal value systems and attitudes towards marriage in Indian society. Societal norms are powerful and often override the legal provisions. The disparities are most glaring in the setting of mental illness in women. This is a reflection of social stigma for mental illness and patriarchal attitude towards women. Concerted efforts are needed to bridge the gap between the legislative provisions of HMA and societal value systems and attitudes toward marriage. Awareness programs regarding the nature and types of mental illness, advances in treatment and information about good outcome of severe mental illness will be helpful. Improvement in moral and religious values will overcome to some extent the negative attitudes and patriarchal mind set toward married women with mental illness.

AB  - Disease definitions and clinical judgments routinely affect coverage and reimbursement decisions by health insurers, the licensing determinations of regulatory agencies charged with reviewing new therapeutic technologies, evidentiary and substantive rulings by the judiciary in personal injury lawsuits and criminal trials, eligibility decisions in disability programs, and the resolution of claims before workers' compensation tribunals. This reliance on the definition and identification of disease by the medical profession fails to appreciate the extent to which our conceptions of illness are socially constructed rather than based on value-neutral scientific data and the application of technical expertise.
   Just as social forces shape medical practice, legal institutions have influenced nosology and diagnosis, but the nature and consequences of their effects on the definition and identification of disease have gone largely unnoticed. By virtue of their often uncritical reliance on clinical judgments, agencies and courts have, to some extent, distorted and even corrupted medical practice, thereby interfering with the primarily therapeutic purposes underlying diagnostic decisionmaking by asking physicians, psychiatrists, and clinical researchers to provide answers to difficult legal and political questions. To the extent that medical professionals make diagnostic judgments to serve non-therapeutic purposes, they may work against promoting the best interests of their patients and society.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide affecting 2-3% of the population over 65 years. This prevalence is expected to rise as life expectancy increases and diagnostic and therapeutic protocols improve. PD encompasses a multitude of clinical, genetic, and molecular forms of the disease. Even though the mechanistic of the events leading to neurodegeneration remain largely unknown, some molecular hallmarks have been repeatedly reported in most patients and models of the disease. Neuroinflammation, protein misfolding, disrupted endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria crosstalk, mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent bioenergetic failure, oxidative stress and autophagy deregulation, are amongst the most commonly described. Supporting these findings, numerous familial forms of PD are caused by mutations in genes that are crucial for mitochondrial and autophagy proper functioning. For instance, late and early onset PD associated to mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and Parkin (PRKN) genes, responsible for the most frequent dominant and recessive inherited forms of PD, respectively, have emerged as promising examples of disease due to their established role in commanding bioenergetic and autophagic balance. Concomitantly, the development of animal and cell models to investigate the etiology of the disease, potential biomarkers and therapeutic approaches are being explored. One of the emerging approaches in this context is the use of patient's derived cells models, such as skin-derived fibroblasts that preserve the genetic background and some environmental cues of the patients. An increasing number of reports in these PD cell models postulate that deficient mitochondrial function and impaired autophagic flux may be determinant in PD accelerated nigral cell death in terms of limitation of cell energy supply and accumulation of obsolete and/or unfolded proteins or dysfunctional organelles. The reliance of neurons on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and their post-mitotic nature, may explain their increased vulnerability to undergo degeneration upon mitochondrial challenges or autophagic insults. In this scenario, proper mitochondrial function and turnover through mitophagy, are gaining in strength as protective targets to prevent neurodegeneration, together with the use of patient-derived fibroblasts to further explore these events. These findings point out the presence of molecular damage beyond the central nervous system (CNS) and proffer patient-derived cell platforms to the clinical and scientific community, which enable the study of disease etiopathogenesis and therapeutic approaches focused on modifying the natural history of PD through, among others, the enhancement of mitochondrial function and autophagy.

KW  - Cancer
KW  - Trauma
KW  - Socio-economic
AB  - While recognizing that the geographic designation 'Africa' does not imply a homogeneous race or population, and that the concept 'men's health' is not clearly defined, the aim of this paper is to review the non-communicable diseases and socio-economic determinants affecting the health of African men. It is clear that Africa bears a disproportionate burden of disease in relation to health care funding, with the highest disease burden (measured in disability-adjusted life years) being in sub-Saharan Africa (21.4% of the global total). Many parts of Africa are exposed to a wide range of disasters, such as drought, desertification, infectious disease epidemics and armed conflicts, leading to poverty, malnutrition, environmental degradation, lack of economic development, and large refugee populations.
   Although malignant neoplasms do not form a major portion of the disease burden in Africa, certain types of cancer (primary hepatocellular and esophageal carcinoma) are much more common than in other parts of the world, most probably due to dietary carcinogens. With the advent of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Penile carcinoma is relatively more common, but testicular germ tumors are much less common in Africa than in other parts of the world.
   In many of the large urban centers there is an increasing mortality among young males due to road traffic accidents and the use of firearms, with a male:female ratio as high as 10:1 in some cities. Armed conflicts in several parts of Africa have left a legacy of physically and psychologically traumatized survivors, with a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, leading to alcohol and drug abuse. Refugee and migrant populations in sub-Saharan Africa have increased dramatically, due to the partisan nature of African politics in many countries, and the incapacity to manage ecological degradation.
   In the USA, African-American men bear a greater burden of diet and lifestyle-associated conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular disease. There is an increasing prevalence of hypertension among urban black men in sub-Saharan Africa, probably related to dietary factors such as increased salt intake and obesity. Many developing countries in Africa are experiencing a transition from diseases of poverty, such as malnutrition, infective and parasitic diseases, towards chronic conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive lung disease and lung cancer, which increasingly contribute to premature mortality in men.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the association between immigrants' sense of community belonging and self-rated general and mental health status in Canada as well as estimate how this relationship is moderated by sex differences. Design/methodology/approach This cross-sectional study used pooled data from seven cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey (N = 98,011) conducted between 2005 and 2018. Data were pooled to increase the sample size of the immigrant population. The surveys covered content areas such as well-being, sociodemographic, chronic diseases, self-rated general and mental health. A binary logistic regression fitted the model. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed between predictor variables and immigrants' self-rated general and mental health. Descriptive statistics and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Sex differences were also assessed. Findings This study found that slightly more than half of the respondents were female (53.2%). Generally, immigrants with a weak sense of community belonging were more likely to rate their general and mental health as poor although the association is stronger in mental health. Also factors such as older age, lower educational level, those single or never married, smoking status, physical inactivity, overweight or obesity and life stress were predictors of both poor self -rated general and mental health among immigrants. Sex differences in these risk factors were also noted. Research limitations/implications This study has several limitations that should be noted. The first limitation is the fact that causality cannot be deduced due to the cross-sectional nature of our pooled data. Secondly, responses from this data are subject to recall bias given that the data were self-reported. Therefore, the interpretation of these results must be done with caution. Further, questions regarding the primary exposure variable of this study were restrictive. The definition of the local community which forms part of the one-item community belonging question did not define what is meant by local community, and as such, the question might be subject to different interpretations (i.e. urban or rural geography?). Lastly, this study's findings did not stratify immigrants into countries or continents of origin. Immigrants from some countries or continents may be more prone to mental health than others. Originality/value This study shows a link between weak immigrants' sense of community belonging and poor self-rated general and mental health status in Canada and provides suggestive evidence of how contextual factors influence health outcomes differently in society.

AB  - Objective: Several literature reviews have highlighted the under-representation of Metis in research regarding Aboriginal Peoples. However, to date, an in-depth examination of trends in Metis research has not been undertaken. This literature review aims to identify trends and gaps in Metis-related health/well-being research over the past three decades (1980-2009).
   Methods: Health, medical and social sciences literature databases including Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, Pubmed, Pyschlnfo, and Web of Science were searched for Metis-relevant peer-reviewed articles published between 1980 and 2009 via two search strategies: 1) using the terms "Metis," "mixed-blood" or "half-breed," and 2) using a combination of terms: (Aboriginal OR Indigenous OR native OR "First Nation" OR Indian) and (mixed OR European OR Caucasian OR white) and "Canada". Articles pertaining to the health/well-being of Metis in Canada were retained, coded and analyzed by study type/design, gender-specificity, geography, research topic, the extent to which Metis-specific breakdown of findings was provided, and methodological quality relating to validity and reliability of the study.
   Results: Noteworthy strengths in Metis research were observed, including increasing attention to chronic diseases, diet/nutrition/physical activity, and maternal and child health; a trend towards increased presentation of Metis-specific results among pan-Aboriginal studies, and female-specific and qualitative studies; and an equitable focus on urban and rural areas. Gaps were seen in research related to environment/toxicology, genetics, health delivery/programming/policy, injury, mental health (MH)/addictions, social determinants of health, and violence/crime. In addition, a dearth of male-specific research was identified. Also, most articles were cross-sectional in design. Finally, despite an increase in Metis-related articles over the past three decades, a large proportion of articles remained pan-Aboriginal in nature and did not provide a Metis-specific breakdown of findings. With respect to methodological quality, nearly two thirds of all studies were of strong or moderate quality (cross-sectional studies), good quality (cohort/case-control studies) or acceptable quality (qualitative and mixed methods studies).
   Conclusion: Several gaps exist in Metis-related health/well-being research with respect to study type/design, gender-specificity, research topics, presentation of Metis-specific findings, and methodological quality. In addition to specific gaps, the overall limited number of research articles/studies needs to be recognized. These deficiencies could be alleviated by increasing targeted funding and support for Metis-related research, and removing barriers to Metis-specific research. Addressing gaps in Metis health research will enable identification of appropriate targets for intervention and, subsequently, design, development and evaluation of interventions to address Metis health disparities and their determinants.

AB  - Objective: Period of elderly age preordains the occurrence of many health issues. People deported during World War II to concentration camps suffered from malnutrition, lack of sleep, physical and mental exhaustion. Recently, the health condition of Holocaust survivors is often complicated as a result of physical punishments and different torture methods as well as mental hardships which they had suffered during deportation. The consequences often have psychosomatic nature thus the survivors are often receivers of health care. The topic of bibliography review is based on the need to objectivize and systematically evaluate subjective health issues of Holocaust survivors in connection with trauma related to the stay in a concentration camp. The aim is to offer a review of effects of the Holocaust on health of different body systems for survivors in concentration camps and Jewish ghettos in the course of World War II.
   Methods: To map the subjective problems of Holocaust survivors, evidence-based medicine (EBM) method has been used with the help of scientific database PubMed, CINAHL Plus with full text, ProQuest and other sources with specific key words and Boole operators. Prognostic type of clinical/review questions has been selected for the bibliography review, which is trying to predict the probability of relation or output of illness/condition and based on diseases or symptoms seriousness to find out expectancy for treatment/improvement of care.
   Results: 175 studies have been found in basic search with the use of key words both in English and in Czech language. The search has not been time-limited. The advanced search has focused on different body systems and health damage due to Nazi experiments. Fourteen studies have been used to complete the study. The research results have confirmed the significant effect of Holocaust trauma on body condition of the survivors. The reasons of this condition were insufficient nutrition, unsuitable and harmful hygienic, living and working conditions and brutality of the guards. According to the research, these factors have impacted all organ systems, mainly locomotion and cardiovascular ones. The results have shown a more frequent occurrence of osteoporosis, fractures of long bones and corresponding chronical pain of people of Jewish origin who had gone through different forms of torture during World War II. Other present symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, tumors mainly in the area of colorectum and lungs. Moreover, the stay in concentration camps had influence on women's menstrual cycle.
   Conclusion: The studies of Holocaust effects are an example of the influence of an extreme mental and physical burden on the body condition of the survivors' health. The results of the studies have shown a wide range of the effects also in mental and social areas.

AB  - Background. In 2017, a "Muslim ban" on immigrants to the United States was coupled with a continued rise in Islamophobia and hate crimes toward Muslims. Islamophobia undermines health equity, yet delineating the effects of Islamophobia globally is challenging as it affects a myriad of groups (geographically, racially, and socially). Additionally, stereotypes equate all Muslims with populations from the Middle East and South Asia. To date, health research pays insufficient attention to Islamophobia, Muslims, and those racialized to be Muslim.
   Objectives. This literature review advances our understanding of racism and health by examining the racialization of religion, by specifically examining Islamophobia as a form of discrimination.
   Search Methods. Per PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a search in October 2017 using PubMed-MEDLINE and a combination of terms. We identified additional articles using other search engines. For inclusion, articles needed to include a descriptor of discrimination, contain an identifier of Muslim or Muslim-like identity (i.e., groups commonly perceived as Muslim, including Arabs, Middle Easterners, North Africans, and South Asians), include a health outcome, be in English, and be published between 1990 and 2017.
   Selection Criteria. We identified 111 unique peer-reviewed articles. We excluded articles that did not meet the following criteria: (1) examined Islamophobia, discrimination, or racism among a Muslim or Muslim-like population; (2) included a health outcome or discussion of health disparities; and (3) was conducted in North America, Europe, Australia, or New Zealand. This yielded 53 articles.
   Results. The majority of studies (n = 34; 64%) were quantitative. The remaining studies were qualitative (n = 7; 13%), mixed methods (n = 2; 4%), or reviews (n = 10; 19%). Most studies were based in the United States (n = 31; 58%). Nearly half of the reviewed studies examined mental health (n = 24; 45%), and one fourth examined physical health or health behaviors (n = 13; 25%). Others focused on both physical and mental health (n = 10; 19%) or health care seeking (n = 7; 13%). Studies showed associations between Islamophobia and poor mental health, suboptimal health behaviors, and unfavorable health care-seeking behaviors.
   Conclusions. This study elucidates the associations between Islamophobia, health, and socioecological determinants of health. Future studies should examine the intersectional nature of Islamophobia and include validated measures, representative samples, subgroup analyses, and comparison groups. More methodologically rigorous studies of Islamophobia and health are needed.
   Public Health Implications. Addressing the discrimination-related poor health that Muslims and racialized Muslim-like subgroups experience is central to the goals of health equity and assurance of the fundamental right to health.

AB  - Background: Community Health Workers are widely utilised in low-and middle-income countries and may be an important tool in reducing maternal and child mortality; however, evidence is lacking on their effectiveness for specific types of programmes, specifically programmes of a preventive nature. This review reports findings on a systematic review analysing effectiveness of preventive interventions delivered by Community Health Workers for Maternal and Child Health in low-and middle-income countries.
   Methods: A search strategy was developed according to the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre's (EPPI-Centre) guidelines and systematic searching of the following databases occurred between June 8 - 11th, 2012: CINAHL, Embase, Ovid Nursing Database, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and POPLINE. Google, Google Scholar and WHO search engines, as well as relevant systematic reviews and reference lists from included articles were also searched. Inclusion criteria were: i) Target beneficiaries should be pregnant or recently pregnant women and/or children under-5 and/or caregivers of children under-5; ii) Interventions were required to be preventive and delivered by Community Health Workers at the household level. No exclusion criteria were stipulated for comparisons/controls or outcomes. Study characteristics of included articles were extracted using a data sheet and a peer tested quality assessment. A narrative synthesis of included studies was compiled with articles being coded descriptively to synthesise results and draw conclusions.
   Results: A total of 10,281 studies were initially identified and through the screening process a total of 17 articles detailing 19 studies were included in the review. Studies came from ten different countries and consisted of randomized controlled trials, cluster randomized controlled trials, before and after, case control and cross sectional studies. Overall quality of evidence was found to be moderate. Five main preventive intervention categories emerged: malaria prevention, health education, breastfeeding promotion, essential newborn care and psychosocial support. All categories showed some evidence for the effectiveness of Community Health Workers; however they were found to be especially effective in promoting mother-performed strategies (skin to skin care and exclusive breastfeeding).
   Conclusions: Community Health Workers were shown to provide a range of preventive interventions for Maternal and Child Health in low-and middle-income countries with some evidence of effective strategies, though insufficient evidence is available to draw conclusions for most interventions and further research is needed.

AB  - This article integrates our previous proposals on the nature and consequences of social life phases and transition phases. Two basic sources of life transition effects are described - changes in regulatory pressures and changes in informational exposure. Research is then presented that exemplifies the effects of such life changes. The results of one study suggest that becoming a parent shifts attention to the new demands of parenting, and thereby modifies the accessibility of pre-transition self-discrepancies that involve other regulatory pressures. The emotional consequences of such cognitive changes are described. Another study provides evidence that adaptation to new gender-related information during the initial construction phase of the transition to junior high school involves greater accomodation, as reflected in an increase in gender stereotype flexibility. This increased flexibility depended on when junior high began and not on grade level. A final study found that, compared to girls, boys who have just entered high school adjust to the increased conflict between what their friends wish them to be and what their mother demands that they be by moving their own personal aspirations closer to their friends and further away from their mother. This sex difference in mode of adjustment was related to greater self-regulatory and self-evaluative problems among those high school boys who continued to have conflicts between these different self-guides.

AB  - The topic of mental state attribution to robots has been approached by researchers from a variety of disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and philosophy. As a consequence, the empirical studies that have been conducted so far exhibit considerable diversity in terms of how the phenomenon is described and how it is approached from a theoretical and methodological standpoint. This literature review addresses the need for a shared scientific understanding of mental state attribution to robots by systematically and comprehensively collating conceptions, methods, and findings from 155 empirical studies across multiple disciplines. The findings of the review include that: (1) the terminology used to describe mental state attribution to robots is diverse but largely homogenous in usage; (2) the tendency to attribute mental states to robots is determined by factors such as the age and motivation of the human as well as the behavior, appearance, and identity of the robot; (3) there is a computer < robot < human pattern in the tendency to attribute mental states that appears to be moderated by the presence of socially interactive behavior; (4) there are conflicting findings in the empirical literature that stem from different sources of evidence, including self-report and non-verbal behavioral or neurological data. The review contributes toward more cumulative research on the topic and opens up for a transdisciplinary discussion about the nature of the phenomenon and what types of research methods are appropriate for investigation.

AB  - Self-harm in young people is a complex and pervasive problem with a number of co-existing risk factors. Although research has implicated a range of family variables in understanding the onset, maintenance and prevention of adolescent self-harm, relatively little attention has been given to the expressed emotion (EE) construct. Based on a narrative review and synthesis of peer-reviewed literature up to and including 2011, this paper considers the conceptual background and empirical evidence for the role of family environment in the expression of adolescent self-harm, with a particular focus on EE. The clinical implications of this literature for working with young people and families from different cultures are also addressed. In summary, the surveyed research provides insufficient evidence for a direct causal link between family environment and adolescent self-harm, with questions raised about the temporal sequencing of measured variables, specificity of implicated family risk factors, and the nature and role of protective factors in families. Emerging evidence for an association between high EE and adolescent self-harm requires replication in well-controlled, prospective studies. There is also a lack of empirically-supported, family-based treatment modalities for adolescents who self-harm. Intervention strategies should be guided by personalised formulation, taking into account individual vulnerabilities, strengths and social contexts, as well as cultural norms for family environment.

AB  - Considerable progresses have taken place, both in the methodology available to study changes in intracellular cytosolic calcium and in our understanding of calcium signaling cascades, but how calcium signals function in plant drought resistance is questionable. In plant cells, calcium plays roles as a second messenger coupling a wide range of extracellular stimuli with intracellular responses. Different extracellular stimuli trigger specific calcium signatures: dynamics, amplitude and duration of calcium transients specify the nature, implication and intensity of stimuli. Calcium-binding proteins (sensors) play a critical role in decoding calcium signatures and transducing signals by activating specific targets and corresponding metabolic pathways. Calmodulin is a calcium sensor known to regulate the activity of many mammalian proteins, whose targets in plants are now being identified. Higher plants possess a rapidly growing list of calmodulin targets with a variety of cellular functions. Nevertheless, many targets appear to be unique to higher plants and remain characterized, calling for a concerted effort to elucidate their functions. To date, three major classes of plant calcium signals, including calcium permeable ion channels, Ca2+/H+ antiporters and Ca2+-ATPases, have been responsible for drought-stress signal transduction. This review summarizes the current knowledge of calcium signals involved in plant anti-drought and plant water use efficiency (WUE) and presents suggestions for future focus of study.

AB  - For almost 5 decades, the scientific study of emotion has been guided by the assumption that categories such as anger, sadness, and fear cut nature at its joints. Barrett (2006a) provided a comprehensive review of the empirical evidence from the study of emotion in humans and concluded that this assumption has outlived its usefulness. Panksepp and Izard have written lengthy papers (published in this issue) containing complementary but largely nonoverlapping criticisms of Barrett (2006a). In our response, we address three of their concerns. First, we discuss the value of correlational versus experimental studies for evaluating the natural-kind model of emotion and refute the claim that the evidence offered in Barrett (2006a) was merely correlational. Second, we take up the issue of whether or not there is evidence for "coherently organized neural circuits'' for natural kinds of emotions in the mammalian brain and counter the claim that Barrett (2006a) ignored crucial evidence for existence of discrete emotions as natural kinds. Third, we address Panksepp and Izard's misconceptions of an alternative view, the conceptual act model of emotion, that was briefly discussed in Barrett (2006a). Finally, we end the article with some thoughts on how to move the scientific study of emotion beyond the debate over whether or not emotions are natural kinds.

AB  - Simple Summary Transposable elements are dynamic components of plant genomes, and display a high diversity of lineages and distribution as the result of evolutionary driving forces and overlapping mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic regulation. They are now regarded as main contributors for genome evolution and function, and important regulators of endogenous gene expression. In this review, we survey recent progress and current challenges in the identification and classification of transposon lineages in complex plant genomes, highlighting the molecular specificities that may explain the expansion and diversification of mobile genetic elements in land plants. Transposable elements (TEs) are important components of most plant genomes. These mobile repetitive sequences are highly diverse in terms of abundance, structure, transposition mechanisms, activity and insertion specificities across plant species. This review will survey the different mechanisms that may explain the variability of TE patterns in land plants, highlighting the tight connection between TE dynamics and host genome specificities, and their co-evolution to face and adapt to a changing environment. We present the current TE classification in land plants, and describe the different levels of genetic and epigenetic controls originating from the plant, the TE itself, or external environmental factors. Such overlapping mechanisms of TE regulation might be responsible for the high diversity and dynamics of plant TEs observed in nature.

AB  - The innocent eye, or seeing 'what the eye sees' is a meaningful expression many artists use to capture their experience in observational drawing and painting. However, a literal interpretation of the innocent eye does not comport with a science of vison focused on object perception. Nor is a two-step model involving a 'bottom-up strategy' a plausible account of the notion. Consistent with an emerging body of neuroscientific and psychophysical evidence for the pivotal role of attention in conscious vision, artists' innocent eye is best construed as an extended proximal mode of vision involving focused attention on pictorial relationships in an identified object or scene. The innocent eye is open to creative expansion, made possible by a competency developed most likely in the early through middle childhood that underpins the visuocognitive skills for flexible deployment of attention, flexible representation, mental imagery and visual memory. The potential challenge from the rare cases of savant-talented artists, who seem to be able to access retinal images directly, is discussed and considered inconclusive. The proposed theoretical framework raises new questions for empirical investigations on the nature and development of the artists' perceptual expertise, and has implications for science-based pedagogical approaches to drawing, painting, and creativity.

AB  - Dysfunctional mirror neuron activity (MNA) has been posited to underlie diverse symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., ego-boundary disturbances, negative symptoms, social cognition impairments and catatonic symptoms). In this paper, we systematically review studies that have empirically compared putative MNA in schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects using different neurophysiological probes. Majority of the studies (n = 9) reported reduced MNA in patients. Two each reported either increased MNA or mixed (both increased and decreased) results, while only one study reported normal findings. Reduced MNA was associated with greater negative symptoms and theory of mind deficits. The neurophysiological technique, task paradigms used, specific brain regions studied and laterality did not influence these findings. Further, we propose an overarching model to understand the heterogeneous symptom dimensions of schizophrenia, in which an inherent mirror system deficit underlying persistent negative symptoms, social cognition impairments and self-monitoring deficits triggers a pathological metaplastic reorganization of this system resulting in aberrant excessive MNA and the phasic catatonic symptoms, affective instability and hallucinations. Despite being preliminary in nature, evidence of abnormal MNA in schizophrenia reported necessitates more detailed investigation. Future research directions of using this model within the Research Domain Criteria framework of the National Institute of Mental Health are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Understanding the health of immigrant children from birth to 18 years of age is important given the significance of the early childhood years and complexity of factors that may influence the health status of immigrant populations. Thus, the purpose of this review was to understand the extent and nature of the literature on the health of immigrant children in Canada.
   Methods We conducted a scoping review of the literature. The review was focused on studies of first-generation and second-generation immigrant children aged 0-18 years. We completed standardised data extraction of immigration status, immigration route, age of children, data source, health or clinical focus, country of origin and major findings.
   Results In total, 250 published papers representing data from 237 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study. A total of 178 articles used quantitative methodologies (mostly survey and cross-sectional study designs), 54 used qualitative methodologies and 18 used mixed methodologies. The articles considered in this review included 147 (59%) focusing on physical health, 76 (30%) focusing on mental health and 37 (15%) focusing on the social aspects of health for refugee and first-generation and second-generation immigrant children across the provinces and territories of Canada.
   Conclusions Several literature gaps exist with respect to child immigrant health in Canada. For instance, there are no exclusive studies on immigrant boys and limited studies on children of international students.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's disease are chronic conditions highly prevalent in elderly communities and societies, and a diagnosis of them is devastating and life changing. Demanding therapies and changes, such as non-compliance, cognitive impairment, and non-cognitive anomalies, may lead to supplementary symptoms and subsequent worsening of well-being and quality of life, impacting the socio-economic status of both patient and family. In recent decades, additional hypotheses have attempted to clarify the connection between these two diseases, multifactorial in their nature, but even so, the mechanisms behind this link are still elusive. In this paper, we sought to highlight the current understanding of the mechanisms for cognitive decline in patients with these concurrent pathologies and provide insight into the relationship between markers related to these disease entities and whether the potential biomarkers for renal function may be used for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Exploring detailed knowledge of etiologies, heterogeneity of risk factors, and neuropathological processes associated with these conditions opens opportunities for the development of new therapies and biomarkers to delay or slow their progression and validation of whether the setting of chronic kidney disease could be a potential determinant for cognitive damage in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - In the United States, does growing up in a poor household cause negative developmental outcomes for children? Hundreds of studies have documented statistical associations between family income in childhood and a host of outcomes in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Many of these studies have used correlational evidence to draw policy conclusions regarding the benefits of added family income for children, in particular children in families with incomes below the poverty line. Are these conclusions warranted? After a review of possible mechanisms linking poverty to negative childhood outcomes, we summarize the evidence for income's effects on children, paying particular attention to the strength of the evidence and the timing of economic deprivation. We demonstrate that, in contrast to the nearly universal associations between poverty and children's outcomes in the correlational literature, impacts estimated from social experiments and quasi-experiments are more selective. In particular, these stronger studies have linked increases in family income to increased school achievement in middle childhood and to greater educational attainment in adolescence and early adulthood. There is no experimental or quasi-experimental evidence in the United States that links child outcomes to economic deprivation in the first several years of life. Understanding the nature of socioeconomic influences, as well as their potential use in evidence-based policy recommendations, requires greater attention to identifying causal effects.

AB  - The immune system and the nervous system are connected in a dynamic network that has important implications for psychology. First, if analyzed in functional terms, the immune system and the nervous system are not distinctly separated: The immune system can take part in neuronal signaling through the production of an array of transmitters and hormones, and brain cells can process and present antigen and produce immune proteins. Moreover, synapses seem to be formed between immune and neural cells in lymphoid tissue. The basis of this phenomenon may be a common evolutionary background of physiological systems that by tradition have been viewed as discrete rather than overlapping. Second, the immune system is actively involved in homeostatic regulation. Signals from immune cells can profoundly change the physiological state of the organism, with changes observed in metabolism, stress axes activity, behavior, motivation and cognition. Many of these changes have probably evolved to ease recuperation. Third, the activity in the immune system is dependent of homeostatic regulation by the neuroendocrine system in a biologically important network that is also capable of mediating psychological impact on immunity. In this reviews it is argued that immunology should be ecological in nature and thereby related to psychological and neural science. Hypothetically, an ecological immunology will show cross-fertilizing properties, increasing the explanatory power of the seemingly disparate scientific disciplines involved.

AB  - Rehabilitation of severe impairment in motor function following stroke is very challenging. This is because one of the driving forces for recovery of motor function is tasks practice, something this category of patients cannot voluntarily perform. However, it has now been shown that tasks practice can equally be carried out cognitively and through observation of another person's practice, using techniques known as mental practice and tasks observation, respectively. Mental practice and tasks observation are believed to activate networks of neurons in the brain known as mirror neurons and mentalizing systems to induce recovery. The effectiveness of these techniques has, however, limited evidence at the moment. One possible explanation for this could be the nature of the protocols of these techniques, especially as regards to the intensity of practice. This article proposes ways the potentials of the mirror neurons and mentalizing systems can be harnessed to optimize recovery of severe impairment in motor function using mental practice and tasks observation. The article suggests, among other ways, protocols where tasks observation or mirror therapy are carried out first, and are then followed by mental practice, increasing the number of times the tasks are observed or mentalized, observation of significant others performing the tasks and mental practice of very familiar tasks.

AB  - Soils are the fundament of terrestrial ecosystems. Across the globe we find different soil types with different properties resulting from the interacting soil forming factors: parent material, climate, topography, organisms and time. Here we present the role of soils in habitat formation and maintenance in natural systems, and reflect on how humans have modified soils from local to global scale. Soils host a tremendous diversity of life forms, most of them microscopic in size. We do not yet know all the functionalities of this diversity at the level of individual taxa or through their interactions. However, we do know that the interactions and feedbacks between soil life, plants and soil chemistry and physics are essential for soil and habitat formation, maintenance and restoration. Moreover, the couplings between soils and major cycles of carbon, nutrients and water are essential for supporting the production of food, feed and fibre, drinking water and greenhouse gas balances. Soils take thousands of years to form, yet are lost very quickly through a multitude of stressors. The current status of our soils globally is worrisome, yet with concerted action we can bend the curve and create win-wins of soil and habitat conservation, regeneration and sustainable development. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of soils in delivering Nature's Contributions to People'.

AB  - Housing conditions have been an enduring focus for public health activity throughout the modern public health era. However, the nature of the housing and health challenge has changed in response to an evolution in the understanding of the diverse factors influencing public health. Today, the traditional public health emphasis on the type and quality of housing merges with other wider determinants of health. These include the neighbourhood, community, and "place" where a house is located, but also the policies which make access to a healthy house possible and affordable for everyone. Encouragingly, these approaches to policy and action on housing have the potential to contribute to the "triple win" of health and well-being, equity, and environmental sustainability. However, more effective housing policies (and in public health in general) that adopt more systemic approaches to addressing the complex interactions between health, housing, and wider environment are needed. This paper illustrates some of the key components of the housing and health challenge in developed countries, and presents a conceptual model to co-ordinate activities that can deliver the "triple win." This is achieved by offering a perspective on how to navigate more effectively, inclusively and across sectors when identifying sustainable housing interventions.

AB  - More than 200 studies have found gender symmetry in perpetration of violence against a marital or dating partner in the sense that about the same percent of women as men physically assault a marital or dating partner. Most of these studies obtained the data using the Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS). However, these results have been challenged by numerous articles in the past 25?years that have asserted that the CTS is invalid. This article identifies and responds to 11 purported methodological problems of the CTS, and two other bases for the belief that the CTS is not valid. The discussion argues that the repeated assertion over the past 25?years that the CTS is invalid is not primarily about methodology. Rather it is primarily about theories and values concerning the results of research showing gender symmetry in perpetration. According to the prevailing patriarchal dominance theory, these results cannot be true and therefore the CTS must be invalid. The conclusion suggests that an essential part of the effort to prevent and treat violence against women and by women requires taking into account the dyadic nature of partner violence through use of instruments such as the CTS that measure violence by both partners.

AB  - In this article, we review the nature of the functional and causal relationship between neurophysiologically/psychologically generated states of emotional feeling and action tendencies and extrapolate a novel perspective. Emotion theory, over the past century and beyond, has tended to regard feeling and action tendency as independent phenomena: attempts to outline the functional and causal relationship that exists between them have been framed therein. Classically, such relationships have been viewed as unidirectional, but an argument for bidirectionality rooted in a dynamic systems perspective has gained strength in recent years whereby the feeling action tendency relationship is viewed as a composite whole. On the basis of our review of somatic visceral theories of feelings, we argue that feelings are grounded upon neural-dynamic representations (elevated and stable activation patterns) of action tendency. Such representations amount to predictions updated by cognitive and bodily feedback. Specifically, we view emotional feelings as minimalist predictions of the action tendency (what the agent is physiologically and cognitively primed to do) in a given situation. The essence of this point is captured by our exposition of action tendency prediction feedback loops which we consider, above all, in the context of emotion regulation, and in particular, of emotional regulation of goal-directed behavior. The perspective outlined may be of use to emotion theorists, computational modelers, and roboticists.

AB  - Bulk glass formation occurs over a very small part of phase space, and 'good' glasses (which form even at low quench rates similar to 10 K/sec) select an even smaller part of that accessible phase space. An axiomatic theory provides the physical basis of glass formation, and identifies these sweet spots of glass formation with existence of rigid but stress-free networks for which experimental evidence is rapidly emerging. Recently, theory and experiment have come together to show that these sweet spots of glass formation occur over a range of chemical compositions identified as 'intermediate phases' (IPs). These ranges appear to be controlled by elements of local and medium-range molecular structures that form isostatically rigid networks. IP glasses possess nonhysteretic glass transitions (T-g's) that do not age much. Raman scattering has played a pivotal role in elucidating the molecular structure of glasses in general, and in identifying domains of IPs. Experiments reveal that these phases possess sharp phase boundaries and are characterized by an optical elasticity that varies with network mean coordination number, r, as power law. In this review, we provide examples in chalcogenide and oxide glass systems in which these phases along with optical elasticity power laws have been established. IP glasses represent self-organized nanostructured functional materials optimized by nature. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are activated by various stimuli and are critical for neuronal development as well as for death following a stressful stimulus. Here, we have evaluated JNK activity in both healthy and dying motoneurons from developing chick embryos and found no apparent difference in overall JNK activity between the conditions, suggesting that this pathway maybe critical in both circumstances. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK in healthy motoneurons supplied with trophic support resulted in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, neurite outgrowth, and phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 1B. On the other hand, in motoneurons deprived of trophic support, inhibition of JNK attenuated caspase activation, and nuclear condensation. We also examined the role of JNK's downstream substrate c-Jun in mediating these events. While c-Jun expression and phosphorylation were greater in cells supplied with trophic support as compared with those deprived, inhibition of c-Jun had no effect on nuclear condensation in dying cells or neurite outgrowth in healthy cells, suggesting that JNK's role in these events is independent of c-Jun. Together, our data underscore the dualistic nature of JNK signaling that is critical for both survival and degenerative changes in motoneurons. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

AB  - Objective: The theoretical and empirical rationales for the potential therapeutic use of antiglucocorticoid agents in the treatment of depression are reviewed. Method: Individual case reports, case series, open-label, and double-blind, controlled trials of the usage of cortisol-lowering treatments in Cushing's syndrome and major depression ate evaluated and critiqued. Results: In each of the 28 reports of antiglucocorticoid treatment of Cushing's syndrome, antidepressant effects were noted in some patients; the largest two series document a response rate of 70% to 73%. Full response, however, was at times erratic and delayed. Across the 11 studies of antiglucocorticoid treatment of major depression, some degree of antidepressant response was noted in 67% to 77% of patients. Antidepressant or antiobsessional effects of antiglucocorticoid augmentation of other psychotropic medications have also been noted in small studies of patients with treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia. Conclusions: These promising results with antiglucocorticoid treatment must be interpreted cautiously because of the small sample sizes and heterogeneity of the studies reviewed, the bias favoring publication of positive results, and the open-label nature of most of the studies. Although definitive controlled trials remain to be conducted, there is a consistent body of evidence indicating that cortisol-lowering treatments may be of clinical benefit in select individuals with major depression and other hypercortisolemic conditions.

AB  - Primate social bonds are described as being especially complex in their nature, and primates have unusually large brains for their body size compared to other mammals. Communication in primates has attracted considerable attention because of the important role it plays in social bonding. It has been proposed that differentiated social relationships are cognitively complex because primates need to continuously update their knowledge about different types of social bonds. Therefore, primates infer whether an opportunity for social interaction is rewarding (valuable to individual goals) based on their knowledge of the social relationships of the interactants. However, exposure to distraction and stress has detrimental effects on the dopaminergic system, suggesting that understanding social relationships as rewarding is affected in these conditions. This paper proposes that complex communication evolved to augment the capacity to form social relationships during stress through flexibly modifying intentionality in communication (audience checking, response waiting and elaboration). Intentional communication may upregulate dopamine dynamics to allow recognition that an interaction is rewarding during stress. By examining these associations between complexity of communication and stress, we provide new insights into the cognitive skills involved in forming social bonds in primates and the evolution of communication systems in both primates and humans.This article is part of the theme issue 'Cognition, communication and social bonds in primates'.

AB  - Theoretical perspectives posit that heart-rate variability (HRV) reflects self-regulatory capacity and therefore can be employed as a bio-marker of top-down self-regulation (the ability to regulate behavioral, cognitive, and emotional processes). However, existing findings of relations between self-regulation and HRV indices are mixed. To clarify the nature of such relations, we conducted a meta-analysis of 123 studies (N=14,347) reporting relations between HRV indices and aspects of top-down self-regulation (e.g., executive functioning, emotion regulation, effortful control). A significant, albeit small, effect was observed (r = 0.09) such that greater HRV was related to better top-down self-regulation. Differences in relations were negligible across aspects of self-regulation, self-regulation measurement methods, HRV computational techniques, at-risk compared with healthy samples, and the context of HRV measurement. Stronger relations were observed in older relative to younger samples and in published compared to unpublished studies. These findings generally support the notion that HRV indices can tentatively be employed as bio-markers of top-down self-regulation. Conceptual and theoretical implications, and critical gaps in current knowledge to be addressed by future work, are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Approximately 10 million people need palliative care for life-limiting illnesses across Africa. Although non-communicable diseases are significant sources of morbidity and mortality globally, in Sub-Saharan Africa infectious diseases constitute the major disease burden, with HIV/AIDS its primary determinant. Despite this need, and the progress made in advancing service provision, palliative care coverage on the continent remains deficient. Following the World Health Organization's enhanced public health approach, palliative care providers on the continent have used the modality of home-based care. Central to this home-based palliative care are family carers. Against a backdrop of eroding extended kinship and community structures, a result of a combination of modernization and the demographic impact of HIV/AIDS, the normative, moral, and economic fabric that previously bound together the extended family is disentangling, rendering the assumption that, in African caring systems the capacity of the extended family to withstand crises is inexhaustible, baseless. Given the engendered nature of care provision in Africa, the primary burden of caring for the ill traditionally falls on women, especially the old and young. These family caregivers face multiple challenges, including limited knowledge and caring skills, the costs of caring, stress and burnout, care burden, the challenges and support for caregivers, and HIV-related stigma and discrimination. The article concludes by suggesting a number of ways by which familial care giving and research on the continent can be improved.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a syndrome which serves as a classic example of psychiatric disorders that result from the intersection of nature and nurture, or gene and environment. By definition, PTS requires the experience of a traumatic exposure, and yet data suggest that the risk for PTSD in the aftermath of trauma also has a heritable (genetic) component. Thus, PTS appears to require both a biological (genetic) predisposition that differentially alters how the individual responds to or recovers from trauma exposure. Epigenetics is defined as the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself, and more recently it has come to refer to direct alteration of DNA regulation, but without altering the primary sequence of DNA, or the genetic code. With regards to PTSD, epigenetics provides one way for environmental exposure to be "written" upon the genome, as a direct result of gene and environment (trauma) interactions. This review provides an overview of the main currently understood types of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, histone regulation of chromatin, and noncoding RNA regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, we examine recent literature related to how these methods of epigenetic regulation may be involved in differential risk and resilience for PTSD in the aftermath of trauma.

AB  - Recent scientific advances have revolutionized our understanding of classical epigenetic mechanisms and the broader landscape of molecular interactions and cellular functions that are inextricably linked to these processes. Our current view of epigenetics includes an increasing appreciation for the dynamic nature of DNA methylation, active mechanisms for DNA demethylation, differential functions of 5-methykytosine and its oxidized derivatives, the intricate regulatory logic of histone post-translational modifications, the incorporation of histone variants into chromatin, nucleosome occupancy and dynamics, and direct links between cellular signalling pathways and the actions of chromatin 'reader', 'writer' and 'eraser' molecules. We also have an increasing awareness of the seemingly ubiquitous roles played by diverse classes of selectively expressed non-coding RNAs in transcriptional, post-transcriptional, post-translational and local and higher order chromatin modulatory processes. These perspectives are still evolving with novel insights continuing to emerge rapidly (e.g. those related to epigenetic regulation of mobile genetic elements, epigenetic mechanisms in mitochondria, roles in nuclear architecture and 'RNA epigenetics'). The precise functions of these epigenetic factors/phenomena are largely unknown. However, it is unequivocal that they serve as key mediators of brain complexity and flexibility, including neural development and aging, cellular differentiation, homeostasis, stress responses, and synaptic and neural network connectivity and plasticity.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder associated with dementia in the elderly. Although the initiating events are still unknown, it is clear that AD results from a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Recently proposed diagnostic criteria, in addition to the clinical neuropsychological examination aimed at identifying the typical AD symptoms, include staging criteria based on AD biological measures related to its pathology. Despite the obvious benefits of these new criteria, an accurate diagnosis is not always easily reached because, particularly in its earliest stages, the symptoms of the disease are very variable. Biological measures, or biomarkers, of the disease should first facilitate an early and accurate diagnosis, have a prognostic and predictive value, and have the capacity to monitor therapeutic efficacy. While amyloid-beta and tau represent the two key pathological features of the disease, other aspects of this complex disease are emerging as important mediators in its pathogenesis. Among them, oxidative stress is probably one of the most investigated, and so are biomarkers reflecting it. Intrinsic limitation of biomarkers is the fact that they do not define mechanism of disease, but by nature are associative and/or correlative and unable to prove causality. Longitudinal studies are helping us in this difficult task by providing a clearer picture of the dynamic relationship between biomarkers, AD neuropathology, and cognitive phenotype.

AB  - In recent decades, malaria has become established in zones at the margin of its previous distribution, especially in the highlands of East Africa. Studies in this region have sparked a heated debate over the importance of climate change in the territorial expansion of malaria, where positions range from its neglect to the reification of correlations as causes. Here, we review studies supporting and rebutting the role of climatic change as a driving force for highland invasion by malaria. We assessed the conclusions from both sides of the argument and found that evidence for the role of climate in these dynamics is robust. However, we also argue that over-emphasizing the importance of climate is misleading for setting a research agenda, even one which attempts to understand climate change impacts on emerging malaria patterns. We review alternative drivers for the emergence of this disease and highlight the problems still calling for research if the multidimensional nature of malaria is to be adequately tackled. We also contextualize highland malaria as an ongoing evolutionary process. Finally, we present Schmalhausen's law, which explains the lack of resilience in stressed systems, as a biological principle that unifies the importance of climatic and other environmental factors in driving malaria patterns across different spatio-temporal scales.

KW  - CAPGRAS-SYNDROME
KW  - CITY
AB  - Background The delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS) include a myriad of discrete but related syndromes, which have wide spectrum anomalies of familiarity. Several misidentification syndromes have been described in the psychiatric literature, the most common of these delusions are: the Capgras syndrome; the Fregoli syndrome; the syndrome of inter-metamorphosis; reduplicative paramnesia; and environmental reduplication.
   Case Presentation The reported case highlights the emergence of late onset first episode psychosis in a Middle Eastern 65-year-old female who has no previous psychiatric history. The nature of psychosis was mainly delusions of misidentification and persecution.
   Discussion DMS are relatively rare and occur predominantly in association with schizophrenia and affective psychosis. Between 25 and 40% are associated with organic conditions such as dementia, head injuries, brain tumors, and epilepsy. Only three cases of misidentification of sacred places have been reported previously in the literature. This case report is the first to present a DMS, emerging as a late onset first episode psychosis during the sacred journey of Hajj.
   Clinical Implications The reported case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of mental health conditions that may appear de novo during the Hajj sacred journey. Readily available psychiatric resources, psychotropic medications, and psycho-education may be pivotal in ensuring mental well-being of pilgrims, which is fundamental to maintain the mental capacity required for completing these journeys.

AB  - The ideas of Vygotsky [Vygotsky, L. S. (1987). Thinking and speech. In The collected works of L. S. Vygotsky, (Vol. 1). New York: Plenum. (Original work published 1934.)] have been increasingly influential in accounting for social-environmental influences on the development of social understanding (SU). In the first part of this article, I examine how Vygotskian ideas have to date been recruited to explanations of the development of SU. Next, I present a model of SU development which draws on two implications of Vygotsky's ideas: the importance of semiotic mediation for mental functioning, and the dialogic nature of the higher mental functions. I then consider the value of the proposed model in accounting for evidence from three areas of enquiry: the typical development of SU in infancy and early childhood, relations between individual differences in SU and social-environmental variables, and atypical development. The model is suggested to be particularly helpful in understanding the transition from intentional-agent to mental-agent understanding, and the role of language in SU. Remaining challenges include a need to specify further the cognitive processes underlying internalization, and to gather more extensive evidence on the roles of typical and atypical social experience in SU development.

AB  - A 60-year-old, right-handed woman, with no focal brain lesions, suffered from a progressive impairment in recognising people of personal relevance and public figures familiar to her in the premorbid period. The patient did not suffer from general cognitive deterioration. There was no ecological or clear psychometric evidence of visuoperceptual or visuospatial deficits. Her defective person recognition was not overcome by extra-facial (e.g., observing animated people in their usual surroundings) or extra-visual information (e.g., listening to the voice). Moreover, presenting the correct name in the presence of an unrecognised familiar person failed to prompt her familiarity judgement, or retrieval of the relevant biographical knowledge. The patient also had some recognition difficulties with famous buildings and songs as well as with some common objects.
   It is argued that the patient's difficulty in identifying familiar people was the consequence of progressive loss of stored exemplars of familiar persons and perhaps also of some other "unique items" (famous songs and monuments) in an independent subsystem of semantics that we term "exemplar semantics." We discuss the associative (semantic) nature and specificity of the deficit in person knowledge, the possible top-down negative influences of the loss of exemplars in the person recognition system, and the link between the disorders and the right/left temporal lobe.

AB  - The lack of a single anatomical or functional definition of 'prefrontal cortex' has led to different and, in some respects, controversial views on the existence of a prefrontal cortex in non-primate mammals, in particular in rats. Until the classic paper by Rose and Woolsey [Res. Publ. Assoc. Nerv. Ment. Dis. 27 (1948) 210], the general idea was that a prefrontal cortex is unique to primate species. Rose and Woolsey's 'prefrontal cortex' definition was based upon a single anatomical criterion, i.e. the cortical projection area of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Single criteria, however, do not appear to be sufficient for defining the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, other anatomical and functional characteristics are currently used to identify the prefrontal cortex in different species. Yet, recently the debate about the nature of the prefrontal cortex in non-primate species has been resumed. In the present paper we will compare the structural and functional characteristics of the prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates and rats. We will argue that rats have a functionally divided prefrontal cortex that includes not only features of the medial and orbital areas in primates, but also some features of the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

AB  - The use of plastics is common across all aspects of human life owing to its durable and versatile nature. The gen-eration and utilization of plastics are directly related to the anthropogenic activities. The extensive use of plastics and adoption of inappropriate waste-management frameworks has resulted in their release into the environ-ment, where they may persist. Different environmental factors, such as, photochemical, thermo-oxidation, and biological degradation, can lead to the degradation of plastics into micro-(MPs) and nano-plastics (NPs). The be-haviour and concentration of MPs in the terrestrial environment can depend on their size, density, and local at-mospheric conditions. Microplastics and nanoplastics may enter the food web, carrying various organic pollutants, which bio-accumulate at different trophic levels, prompting organism health concerns. Microplastics being airborne identifies as new exposure route. Dietary and airborne exposure to MPs has led researchers to stress the importance of evaluating their toxicological potential. The primary goal of this paper is to explore the environmental fate of MPs from sources to sink in the terrestrial environment, as well as detail their potential impacts on human health. Additionally, this review article focuses on the presence of airborne microplastics, de-tailed sample pre-processing methods, and outlines analytical methods for their characterization .

AB  - Characterizing the nature and underlying neurobiological causes of psychiatric and neurological diseases at the circuit and network levels has remained elusive and necessitates the use of robust animal models. Noninvasive functional magnetic resonance imaging allows systems-level insight into disease phenotype in humans and animals alike, and functional neuroimaging represents an ideal platform for translational and reverse-translational research, with common measurements collected across species. Animal neuroimaging allows invasive manipulations and conveniently bypasses many limitations associated with human subjects; however, awake animal imaging introduces its own constraints to reduce motion and limit subjective stress. Anesthetics offer a viable alternative, but the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and molecular targets of anesthetics and their effects on physiology, neural activity, and neurovascular coupling must be considered. We discuss the physiological basis of and the influence of anesthetics on neurovascular coupling. We discuss anesthetic use in functional magnetic resonance imaging and focus on an anesthetic protocol developed in our laboratory. Finally, we discuss in detail our most recent work examining the physiological basis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging using this anesthetic regimen and the future directions of animal neuroimaging research. Using animal imaging in combination with cutting-edge in vivo neuromodulatory techniques is essential for causal understanding of brain function in health and disease and offers an exemplary bridge between human and animal research studies.

AB  - Scientists, humanists, and art lovers alike value art not just for its beauty, but also for its social and epistemic importance; that is, for its communicative nature, its capacity to increase one's self-knowledge and encourage personal growth, and its ability to challenge our schemas and preconceptions. However, empirical research tends to discount the importance of such social and epistemic outcomes of art engagement, instead focusing on individuals' preferences, judgments of beauty, pleasure, or other emotional appraisals as the primary outcomes of art appreciation. Here, we argue that a systematic neuroscientific study of art appreciation must move beyond understanding aesthetics alone, and toward investigating the social importance of art appreciation. We make our argument for such a shift in focus first, by situating art appreciation as an active social practice. We follow by reviewing the available psychological and cognitive neuroscientific evidence that art appreciation cultivates socio-epistemic skills such as self-and other-understanding, and discuss philosophical frameworks which suggest a more comprehensive empirical investigation. Finally, we argue that focusing on the socio-epistemic values of art engagement highlights the important role art plays in our lives. Empirical research on art appreciation can thus be used to show that engagement with art has specific social and personal value, the cultivation of which is important to us as individuals, and as communities.

AB  - Objective: To provide a critical review of autoimmune encephalopathy broadly defined as neuropsychiatric features directly related to an autoimmune process relevant for psychiatric practice. Methods: We consulted rheumatology textbooks to define the scope of autoimmune conditions and identified recent reviews of rheumatic conditions, autoimmune vasculitis, and autoimmune encephalitis. We integrated these with primary reports to provide a clinically relevant overview of autoimmune encephalopathy. We focus on clinical features that should raise suspicion for auto immunity. Results: Despite outlying conditions, 2 categories of autoimmune encephalopathy are described: (1) neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with rheumatic conditions and (2) antibody-associated autoimmune encephalitis. Rheumatic conditions principally include connective tissue disease and other vasculitides. These may present variously such as with unexplained delirium, cognitive decline, or depression. Autoimmune encephalitis may be diffuse or localized as in limbic, brainstem, or basal ganglia encephalitis. Unexplained delirium, psychosis, catatonia, strokes, and seizures are among common presenting symptoms. Conclusions: Prompt identification and management of autoimmunity are critical for optimal outcomes. The fact that undiagnosed and, therefore, untreated autoimmunity leads to debilitation demands vigilance for these conditions. Close attention to the unusual nature and course of neuropsychiatric symptoms, associated neurological features, and review of systems as reviewed here should guide the skillful clinician.

AB  - Crop plants should be resilient to climatic factors in order to feed ever-increasing populations. Plants have developed stress-responsive mechanisms by changing their metabolic pathways and switching the stress-responsive genes. The discovery of plant transcriptional factors (TFs), as key regulators of different biotic and abiotic stresses, has opened up new horizons for plant scientists. TFs perceive the signal and switch certain stress-responsive genes on and off by binding to different cis-regulatory elements. More than 50 families of plant TFs have been reported in nature. Among them, DREB, bZIP, MYB, NAC, Zinc-finger, HSF, Dof, WRKY, and NF-Y are important with respect to biotic and abiotic stresses, but the potential of many TFs in the improvement of crops is untapped. In this review, we summarize the role of different stress-responsive TFs with respect to biotic and abiotic stresses. Further, challenges and future opportunities linked with TFs for developing climate-resilient crops are also elaborated.

AB  - As it is well known, a worldwide improvement in life expectancy has taken place. This has brought an increase in chronic pathologies associated with aging. Cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative conditions are common in elderly subjects. As far as neurodegenerative diseases are concerned dementias and particularly, Alzheimer's disease (AD) occupy a central epidemiological position given their high prevalence and their profound negative impact on the quality of life and life expectancy. The amyloid cascade hypothesis partly explains the immediate cause of AD. However, limited therapeutical success based on this hypothesis suggests more complex remote mechanisms underlying its genesis and development. For instance, the strong association of AD with another irreversible neurodegenerative pathology, without curative treatment and complex etiology such as presbycusis, reaffirms the intricate nature of the etiopathogenesis of AD. Recently, oxidative stress and frailty syndrome have been proposed, independently, as key factors underlying the onset and/or development of AD and presbycusis. Therefore, the present review summarizes recent findings about the etiology of the above-mentioned neurodegenerative diseases, providing a critical view of the possible interplay among oxidative stress, frailty syndrome, AD and presbycusis, that may help to unravel the common mechanisms shared by both pathologies. This knowledge would help to design new possible therapeutic strategies that in turn, will improve the quality of life of these patients.

AB  - Interest in the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis has increased dramatically in recent years, in part because of concerns related to the growing availability of cannabis and potential risks to health and human functioning. There now exists a plethora of scientific articles addressing this issue, but few provide a clear verdict about the causal nature of the cannabis-psychosis association. Here, we review recent research reports on cannabis and psychosis, giving particular attention to how each report provides evidence relating to two hypotheses: (1) cannabis as a contributing cause and (2) shared vulnerability. Two primary kinds of data are brought to bear on this issue: studies done with schizophrenic patients and studies of first-episode psychosis. Evidence reviewed here suggests that cannabis does not in itself cause a psychosis disorder. Rather, the evidence leads us to conclude that both early use and heavy use of cannabis are more likely in individuals with a vulnerability to psychosis. The role of early and heavy cannabis use as a prodromal sign merits further examination, along with a variety of other problem behaviors (e.g., early or heavy use of cigarettes or alcohol and poor school performance). Future research studies that focus exclusively on the cannabis-psychosis association will therefore be of little value in our quest to better understand psychosis and how and why it occurs.

AB  - A current view proposes that the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) is particularly responsible for attentive decoding and cognitive evaluation of emotional cues in human vocalizations. Although some studies seem to support this view, an exhaustive review of all recent imaging studies points to an important functional role of both the right and the left IFC in processing vocal emotions. Second, besides a supposed predominant role of the IFC for an attentive processing and evaluation of emotional voices in IFC, these recent studies also point to a possible role of the IFC in preattentive and implicit processing of vocal emotions. The studies specifically provide evidence that both the right and the left IFC show a similar anterior-to-posterior gradient of functional activity in response to emotional vocalizations. This bilateral IFC gradient depends both on the nature or medium of emotional vocalizations (emotional prosody versus nonverbal expressions) and on the level of attentive processing (explicit versus implicit processing), closely resembling the distribution of terminal regions of distinct auditory pathways, which provide either global or dynamic acoustic information. Here we suggest a functional distribution in which several IFC subregions process different acoustic information conveyed by emotional vocalizations. Although the rostro-ventral IFC might categorize emotional vocalizations, the caudo-dorsal IFC might be specifically sensitive to their temporal features. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - After an era in which lesion studies have identified the declarative memory system and its essential anatomical structures, functional imaging and event-related potential studies have begun to delineate the neural underpinnings of declarative memory formation at the system level. By memory formation, we refer to those mnemonic processes present during encoding that transform perceptual representations into enduring memories. Recent studies have revealed that distinct regions in medial temporal and prefrontal areas exhibit more neural activity during successful than unsuccessful memory formation. We attempt to identify the nature of the processes underlying these subsequent memory effects, Reviewed data suggest specific mnemonic operations in the medial temporal lobe that may be integrated with semantic/perceptual operations and subserving operations in the prefrontal cortex. The formation of relational and non-relational memories may be supported by distinct subregions within these two brain regions. While the medial temporal lobe may have a serial organizational structure, with a processing hierarchy, interactions between medial temporal and prefrontal areas seem to occur in a parallel and bi-directional fashion. Interacting with this system, emotionally arousing events enhance neural activity in the amygdala, which in turn may modulate processing in other brain regions responsible for declarative memory formation.

AB  - Positive social interactions are essential for emotional well-being, healthy development, establishment and maintenance of adequate social structures and reproductive success of humans and animals. Here, we review the studies that have investigated whether forms of social interaction that occur in different phases of the lifespan of animals, i.e., maternal behavior, social play and sexual interaction are rewarding in rodents and non-human primates. We show that these three forms of social interaction can be used as incentive for place conditioning, lever pressing and maze learning, three setups that have been extensively used to study the rewarding properties of food and drugs of abuse and their neural underpinnings. The experience of positive social interactions during key developmental ages has profound and long-lasting effects on brain function and behavior in emotional, motivational and cognitive domains. For instance, pup interaction is more rewarding than cocaine for early postpartum dams and rats deprived of the opportunity to play during adolescence show social and cognitive impairments at adulthood. Furthermore, sexual behavior is only overtly rewarding when animals can control the rate at which the sexual interaction occurs. Last, we discuss how animal models contributed to our understanding of social reward mechanisms and its psychological components throughout development (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak began in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and have since spread globally. Deep sequencing analysis identified the disease within a few weeks, and on February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it "COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2." SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Coronavirus disease has become a global challenge for researchers and health care workers, affecting over 174 million people and causing over 3 million deaths. Because of the widespread nature, extensive measures are being taken to reduce person-to-person contact, and special precautions are being taken to prevent the transmission of this infection to vulner-able populations such as geriatrics, pediatrics, and health care professionals. We summarized the genesis of COVID-19 spread, its pathology, clinical perspectives, and the use of natural ingredients as a possible cure for COVID-19 in this review. This article has highlighted information about current vaccines approved for emergency use as well as those in various stages of clinical trials. Vaccine availability around the world is a promising development in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We conducted a narrative review to present the current state and research on this situation, specific diagnosis, clinical manifestation, emergency approaches, herbal-based remedies, and COVID vaccines.

AB  - Neural network models have potential for improving our understanding of brain functions. In this Perspective, Pulvermuller and colleagues examine various aspects of such models that may need to be constrained to make them more neurobiologically realistic and therefore better tools for understanding brain function.
   Neural network models are potential tools for improving our understanding of complex brain functions. To address this goal, these models need to be neurobiologically realistic. However, although neural networks have advanced dramatically in recent years and even achieve human-like performance on complex perceptual and cognitive tasks, their similarity to aspects of brain anatomy and physiology is imperfect. Here, we discuss different types of neural models, including localist, auto-associative, hetero-associative, deep and whole-brain networks, and identify aspects under which their biological plausibility can be improved. These aspects range from the choice of model neurons and of mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and learning to implementation of inhibition and control, along with neuroanatomical properties including areal structure and local and long-range connectivity. We highlight recent advances in developing biologically grounded cognitive theories and in mechanistically explaining, on the basis of these brain-constrained neural models, hitherto unaddressed issues regarding the nature, localization and ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of higher brain functions. In closing, we point to possible future clinical applications of brain-constrained modelling.

AB  - There is no health without mental health. Recently conducted National Mental Health Survey quoted a prevalence of 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% current mental morbidity. To address this mammoth problem, an aspirational law was enacted titled "Mental Healthcare Act, 2017" (MHCA 2017). The act is progressive and rights based in nature. The whole dedicated Chapter 5 on "Rights of the person with mental illness" is the heart and soul of this legislation. However, the act mainly focuses on the rights of the persons with mental illness (PMI), only during treatment in hospital but is not equally emphatic about continuity of treatment in the community. The act fails to acknowledge and foster the role and contribution of family members in providing care to PMI. Although there are many positive aspects to the MHCA 2017, it may impact adversely on the mental health care in India. This article focuses on the shortcomings and challenges of the act and also makes attempts to offer alternatives considering the available resources and ground reality. Concepts such as "Advance directives" and "Nominated representatives" appear to be very attractive, idealistic, and aspirational, but not evidenced based in the Indian context considering the resources. The act fails to make an impact even after 22 months to attain the goal, and will require pervasive efforts to fulfil a purpose that directs its development. This law needs to be amended as per the local resources and requirements of the society.

AB  - A common assumption regarding mass emergency situations is that individuals in such contexts behave in a way that maximizes their likelihood to escape, at the expense, or with little concern for, the welfare and survival of their neighbors. Doing so, they might even compromise the effectiveness of group evacuation. This conception follows the views of early works on crowd psychology, a tradition born with Gustave Le Bon's The Crowd: a study of the Popular Mind, first published in 1895, and which has had a tremendous impact on scientific representations of people's behavior in mass emergency contexts. Indeed, this work has greatly contributed to the idea that, in such situations, people revert to a primitive, impulsive, irrational, and antisocial nature, causing the breakdown of social order. However, more empirically oriented studies have consistently reported little collective panic, as well as a great deal of solidarity and pro-social behavior during mass emergency situations. Because of institutional barriers, such views have remained largely unknown to cognitive psychologists. Yet these are important results in that they show that human individual and collective reactions to threat are primarily affiliative. Indeed, far from leading to the breakdown of the social fabrics, the presence of a common threat can strengthen social bonds.

AB  - A mechanical trauma to the spinal cord can be followed by the development of irreversible and progressive neurodegeneration, as opposed to a temporary or partially reversible neurological damage. An increasing body of experimental and clinical evidence from humans and animal models indicates that spinal cord injury may set in motion the development of disabling and at times fatal neuromuscular disorders, whose occurrence is not normally associated with any major environmental event. This outcome appears to be dependent on the co-occurrence of a particular form of mechanical stress and of a genetically-determined vulnerability. This increased vulnerability to spinal cord injury may depend on a change of the nature and of the timing of activation of a number of neuroprotective and neurodestructive molecular signals in the injured cord. Among the main determinants, we could mention an altered homeostasis of lipids and neurofilaments, an earlier inflammatory response and the failure of the damaged tissue to rein in oxidative damage and apoptotic cell death. These changes could force injured tissue beyond a point of no return and precipitate an irreversible neurodegenerative process. A better knowledge of the molecular signals activated in a state of increased vulnerability to trauma can inform future treatment strategies and the prediction of the neurological outcome after spinal cord injury.

AB  - The pollution by heavy metals poses a serious threat to the aquatic environment and to the organisms if the concentration of heavy metals in the environment exceeds the safe limits. Due to their non-biodegradable and long persistence nature in the environment, heavy metals cause toxicity in fish by producing oxygen reactive species through oxidizing radical production. In this review, we investigated the effects of heavy metals on fish physiology with special emphasis on hemato-biochemical properties, immunological parameters especially hormones and enzymes, histopathology of different major organs and underlying molecular mechanisms. All those parameters are significantly affected by heavy metal exposure and are found to be important bio-monitoring tools to assess heavy metal toxicity. Hematological and biochemical alterations have been documented including cellular and nuclear abnormalities in different fish species exposed to different concentrations of heavy metals. Major fish organs (gills, liver, kidneys) including intestine, muscles showed different types of pathology specific to organs in acute and chronic exposure to different heavy metals. This study also revealed the expression of different genes involved in oxidative stress and detoxification of heavy metals. In a nutshell, this article shades light on the manipulation of fish physiology by the heavy metals and sought attention in the prevention and maintenance of aquatic environments particularly from heavy metals contaminations.

Cellular and molecular processes underlying LTD occur postsynaptically. In the 1960s, LTD was conceived as a theoretical possibility and in the 1980s, substantiated experimentally. Through further investigations using various pharmacological or genetic manipulations of LTD, a concept was formed that LTD plays a major role in learning capability of the cerebellum (referred to as "Marr-Albus-Ito hypothesis"). In this chapter, following a historical overview, recent intensive investigations of LTD are reviewed. Complex signal transduction and receptor recycling processes underlying LTD are analyzed, and roles of LTD in reflexes and voluntary movements are defined. The significance of LTD is considered from viewpoints of neural network modeling. Finally, the controversy arising from the recent finding in a few studies that whereas LTD is blocked pharmacologically or genetically, motor learning in awake behaving animals remains seemingly unchanged is examined. We conjecture how this mismatch arises, either from a methodological problem or from a network nature, and how it might be resolved.

AB  - Intact, 'healthy' soils provide indispensable ecosystem services that largely depend on the biotic activity. Soil health is connected with human health, yet, knowledge of the underlying soil functioning remains incomplete. This review highlights selected services, i.e. (i) soil as a genetic resource and hotspot of biodiversity, forming the basis for providing (ii) biochemical resources and (iii) medicinal services and goods. Soils harbour an unrivalled biodiversity of organisms, especially microorganisms. Some of the abilities of autochthonous microorganisms and their relevant enzymes serve (i) to improve natural soil functions and in particular plant growth, e.g. through beneficial plant growth-promoting, symbiotic and mycorrhizal microorganisms, (ii) to act as biopesticides, (iii) to facilitate biodegradation of pollutants for soil bioremediation and (iv) to yield enzymes or chemicals for industrial use. Soils also exert direct effects on human health. Contact with soil enriches the human microbiome, affords protection against allergies and promotes emotional well-being. Medicinally relevant are soil substrates such as loams, clays and various minerals with curative effects as well as pharmaceutically active organic chemicals like antibiotics that are formed by soil microorganisms. By contrast, irritating minerals, soil dust inhalation and misguided soil ingestion may adversely affect humans. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of soils in delivering Nature's Contributions to People.

AB  - Social robots need to understand human activities, dynamics, and the intentions behind their behaviors. Most of the time, this implies the modeling of the whole scene. The recognition of the activities and intentions of a person are inferred from the perception of the individual, but also from their interactions with the rest of the environment (i.e., objects and/or people). Centering on the social nature of the person, robots need to understand human social cues, which include verbal but also nonverbal behavioral signals such as actions, gestures, body postures, facial emotions, and proxemics. The correct understanding of these signals helps these robots to anticipate the needs and expectations of people. It also avoids abrupt changes on the human-robot interaction, as the temporal dynamics of interactions are anchored and driven by a major repertoire of social landmarks. Within the general framework of interaction of robots with their human counterparts, this paper reviews recent approaches for recognizing human activities, but also for perceiving social signals emanated from a person or a group of people during an interaction. The perception of visual and/or audio signals allow them to correctly localize themselves with respect to humans from the environment while also navigating and/or interacting with a person or a group of people.

AB  - Epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), is a mechanism that can help explain how early adversities can engender long-term vulnerability for mental health problems. At present, there is preliminary evidence to support the possibility of epigenetic mediation: environmental factors are reported to influence offspring DNAm, which in turn associate with child and adolescent psychopathology. However, all analyses have been correlational in nature and, as these studies have focussed on children and adolescents, DNAm has been based on peripheral tissue (cord blood, whole blood, buccal cells). Therefore, the extent to which DNAm could represent a causal mechanism (e.g., a surrogate of central nervous system function) or a biomarker(i.e., an indicator of the pathological process leading to disease) is unclear. This short report has 2 main components. First, 2 studies are summarized, one a candidate gene study and the other an epigenome-wide association study in which DNAm was reported to (partially) mediate the link between adversity and child development. Second, there is a discussion of (1) the "tissue issue," (2) maximizing the interpretability of candidate gene and epigenome-wide approaches, and (3) the need for examining DNAm as a potential biomarker for mental health. It is argued that advances within these 3 areas will make clearer the role of DNAm in the link between adversity and child and adolescent mental health. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - A familiar theme in Greek myth is that of the deadly gift that passes between a man and a woman. Analysis of exchanges between men and women reveals the gendered nature of exchange in ancient Greek mythic thinking. Using the anthropological categories of male and female wealth (with examples drawn from many cultures), it is possible to arrive at an understanding of the protocols of exchange as they relate to men and especially to women. These protocols, which are based in part on the distinction between metals and other durable goods as "male" and textiles as "female," are closely related to the gendered division of labor. Anxiety about women as exchangers derives in part from their status as objects exchanged in marriage (as exemplified by Helen in the "Iliad"), and partly from a misogynist and pessimistic strand of Greek thought (embodied by Hesiod's Pandora) that discounts any female economic contribution to the 'oikos.' Indeed the majority of destructive exchanges take place within the context of marital crisis. While some texts, beginning with the "Odyssey", show the positive side of women's economic role, tragedy tends to follow the Hesiodic distrust of women as exchange partners. Passages from the "Agamemnon" and the "Trachiniae" are analyzed to show how in situations of perverted reciprocity brought about by marital discord, even women's traditional gifts of textiles may become deadly.

AB  - Social functioning is a key domain of impairment in both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This review adopts the social information-processing model as the theoretical framework to compare and contrast the deficits of ASD and ADHD at each of the six steps of social information-processing. Both disorders show deficits at each step, but the nature and origins of the deficits are different. Thus, while both disorders exhibit a common outcome of social impairment, the exact pathways that each disorder traverses along the six steps of social information-processing are different. For ASD, there is a social knowledge/behaviour deficit arising from difficulties in social/emotional cue detection, encoding, and interpretation, leading to problems in joining and initiating social interaction. For ADHD, there is a performance deficit incurred by disruption arising from the ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, while its acquisition capacity on social knowledge is relatively intact. The inattentive, intrusive, and impulsive behaviours of ADHD unsettle social interaction. Finally, this review proposes training targets for intervention along the six steps of the social information-processing model for ASD and ADHD, as well as areas for future research in further elucidating the social impairment of the two disorders.

AB  - The abstract concept of time is mentally represented as a spatially oriented line, with the past associated with the left space and the future associated with the right. Although the line is supposed to be continuous, most available evidence is also consistent with a categorical representation that only discriminates between past and future. The aim of the present study was to test the continuous or categorical nature of the mental timeline. Italian participants judged the temporal reference of 20 temporal expressions by pressing keys on either the left or the right. In Experiment 1 (N = 32), all words were presented at the center of the screen. In Experiment 2 (N = 32), each word was presented on the screen in a central, left, or right position. In Experiment 3 (N = 32), all text was mirror-reversed. In all experiments, participants were asked to place the 20 temporal expressions on a 10-cm line. The results showed a clear Spatial-TEmporal Association of Response Codes (STEARC) effect which did not vary in strength depending on the location of the temporal expressions on the line. However, there was also a clear Distance effect: latencies were slower for words that were closer to the present than further away. We conclude that the mental timeline is a continuous representation that can be used in a categorical way when an explicit past vs. future discrimination is required by the task.

AB  - The beneficial effects of oxytocin on infarct size and functional recovery of the ischemic reperfused heart are well documented. The mechanisms for this cardioprotection are not well defined. Evidence indicates that oxytocin treatment improves cardiac work, reduces apoptosis and inflammation, and increases scar vascularization. Oxytocin-mediated cytoprotection involves the production of cGMP stimulated by local release of atrial natriuretic peptide and synthesis of nitric oxide. Treatment with oxytocin reduces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and reduces immune cell infiltration. Oxytocin also stimulates differentiation stem cells to cardiomyocyte lineages as well as generation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, promoting angiogenesis. The beneficial actions of oxytocin may include the increase in glucose uptake by cardiomyocytes, reduction in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, decrease in oxidative stress, and mitochondrial protection of several cell types. In cardiac and cellular models of ischemia and reperfusion, acute administration of oxytocin at the onset of reperfusion enhances cardiomyocyte viability and function by activating Pi3K and Akt phosphorylation and downstream cellular signaling. Reperfusion injury salvage kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins cardioprotective pathways are involved. Oxytocin is cardioprotective by reducing the inflammatory response and improving cardiovascular and metabolic function. Because of its pleiotropic nature, this peptide demonstrates a clear potential for the treatment of cardiovascular pathologies. In this review, we discuss the possible cellular mechanisms of action of oxytocin involved in cardioprotection.

AB  - Hoarding disorder is a disabling psychiatric disorder, characterized by the acquisition and retention of possessions to the point where it negatively impacts the individual's life, regardless of the value of the items. While treatments for hoarding disorder are promising, the chronic and egosyntonic nature of the disorder means that further development of the underlying theoretical model of hoarding is important in order to improve treatments. In particular, one aspect of hoarding disorder that has not received specific theoretical emphasis is the link between possessions and the self-concept, reflecting notions dating back to William James that what we own can come to define who we are. The purpose of the current review is to specifically examine literature pertinent to the link between possessions and the self-concept in hoarding disorder. The paper includes an examination of the various definitions of self, a review of literature relevant to self in hoarding, an integration of consumer psychology perspectives, and a discussion of treatment implications. The review highlights the need for more dedicated research, the development of an appropriate quantitative measure relevant to the link between possessions and the self-concept, and investigation into possible underlying factors for this link. Potential implications for treatment are highlighted.

AB  - Purpose -Intellectual disabilities (ID) may complicate the experience of bereavement and loss, in those with communicative impairments compounded by complex healthcare needs and sensori-motor limitations. Whilst theorists have argued that the cognitive difficulties of people with profound ID impede mourning reactions, none have attempted to make sense of the responses they do exhibit. The current paper discusses this.
   Design/methodology/approach - A select review considers the neurobiology underlying attachment bonds, complications in attachment formation and affect regulation in people with ID, and separation responses of people with profound ID.
   Findings - The current paper demonstrates that by recognising the affective nature of separation distress, an understanding beyond a cognitive conceptualisation is possible.
   Research limitations/implications - It is worth questioning whether people with profound ID are incapable of any meaningful form of person permanence. A critical review could deal with this comparatively by drawing on research of person and object permanence in typically developing children.
   Practical implications - Of specific interest, the bio-behavioural regulators of relationships may help us to appreciate the importance of routine physical health and social care for emotional wellbeing in this group.
   Originality/value - It is argued that by appreciating the basic emotional and regulatory functions of relationships, we can achieve a greater insight into the loss experiences of people with profound ID that will offer therapeutic direction.

AB  - Theories of children's developing understanding of mind tend to emphasize either individualistic processes of theory formation, maturation, or introspection, or the process of enculturation. However, such theories must be able to account for the accumulating evidence of the role of social interaction in the development of social understanding. We propose an alternative account, according to which the development of children's social understanding occurs within triadic interaction involving the child's experience of the world as well as communicative interaction with others about their experience and beliefs (Chapman 1991; 1999). It is through such triadic interaction that children gradually construct knowledge of the world as well as knowledge of other people. We contend that the extent and nature of the social interaction children experience will influence the development of children's social understanding. increased opportunity to engage in cooperative social interaction and exposure to talk about mental states should facilitate the development of social understanding. We review evidence suggesting that children's understanding of mind develops gradually in the context of social interaction. Therefore, we need a theory of development in this area that accords a fundamental role to social interaction, yet does not assume that children simply adopt socially available knowledge but rather that children construct an understanding of mind within social interaction.

AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric illnesses. It is particularly common in women of childbearing age. It is recurrent and tends to have a chronic course and is often comorbid in nature. It is important to view depression within its social context, as it is a disease, which impacts not only the individual but also the wider community. Evidence abounds as to the negative impact of maternal depression on children, husbands/partners, and family. Children of depressed women show deficits in social, psychological, and cognitive domains and are at increased risk for depression themselves and other psychiatric illness such as conduct disorder. They are also at an increased risk for child abuse. The mechanisms by which maternal depression may lead to child psychopathology including genetics, poor parenting, modelling, and environment are explored. Many children with depressed mothers cope well and escape negative effects; consequently the concept of resilience is elucidated. Research shows that a significant percentage of men become depressed when their wives/partners are depressed particularly if they have postnatal depression. There is an increase in marital discord and conflict within families of depressed women, all of which can have a deleterious effect on children. Children with two depressed parents are at an elevated risk of a negative outcome as compared to those with only one depressed parent. Finally the various interventions, management, and recommendations are examined.

AB  - Antimony has been known and used since ancient times, but its applications have increased significantly during the last two centuries. Aside from its few medical applications, it also has industrial applications, acting as a flame retardant and a catalyst. Geologically, native antimony is rare, and it is mostly found in sulfide ores. The main ore minerals of antimony are antimonite and jamesonite. The extensive mining and use of antimony have led to its introduction into the biosphere, where it can be hazardous, depending on its bioavailability and absorption. Detailed studies exist both from active and abandoned mining sites, and from urban settings, which document the environmental impact of antimony pollution and its impact on human physiology. Despite its evident and pronounced toxicity, it has also been used in some drugs, initially tartar emetics and subsequently antimonials. The latter are used to treat tropical diseases and their therapeutic potential for leishmaniasis means that they will not be soon phased out, despite the fact the antimonial resistance is beginning to be documented. The mechanisms by which antimony is introduced into human cells and subsequently excreted are still the subject of research; their elucidation will enable us to better understand antimony toxicity and, hopefully, to improve the nature and delivery method of antimonial drugs.

AB  - The emergence in DSM-5 of gambling addiction as the first official behavioural addiction has opened a new chapter in the thinking about and research into behavioural pathology. We are becoming increasingly aware of the causes, mechanisms and consequences of addictive behaviour, but the majority of the work is conducted mainly on adult populations. Although the use of the term "behavioural addiction" in children and adolescents is controversial due to the dynamic nature of their development processes, there is no doubt that more and more young people are involved in addictive behaviours that negatively affect their lives. The currently still few studies are throwing new light on the early symptoms of behavioural addictions observed in increasingly younger children.
   This article is a review of current knowledge about potential behavioural addictions in the first two decades of life viewed from the perspective of developmental psychopathology. While there is significantly less research into addictive behaviours in childhood and adolescence than in later decades, empirical evidence has clearly shown that early symptoms of behavioural addiction pose a significant threat to the mental health of children and adolescents, both now and in the future. The article discusses the definition of behavioural addiction in the DSM-5 context, the controversy surrounding the diagnosis of these disorders in young people, the behavioural addictions in children and adolescents, and the identified risk factors for early-onset behavioural addictions.

AB  - Structural racism is the historical and ongoing reinforcement of racism within society due to discriminatory systems and inequitable distribution of key resources. Racism, embedded within institutional structures, processes and values, perpetuates historical injustices and restricts access to structural factors that directly impact health, such as housing, education and employment. Due to the complex and pervasive nature of structural racism, interventions that act at the structural level, rather than the individual level, are necessary to improve racial health equity. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effects of structural-level interventions on determinants of health and health outcomes for racialized populations. A total of 29 articles are included in this review, analyzing interventions such as supplemental income programs, minimum wage policies, nutrition safeguard programs, immigration-related policies, and reproductive and family-based policies. Most studies were quasi-experimental or natural experiments. Findings of studies were largely mixed, although there were clear benefits to policies that improve socioeconomic status and opportunities, and demonstrable harms from policies that restrict access to abortion or immigration. Overall, research on the effects of structural-level interventions to address health inequities is lacking, and the evidence base would benefit from well-designed studies on upstream policy interventions that affect the structural determinants of health and health inequities and improve daily living conditions.

AB  - Nutrition and pollution stress stimulate genetic adaptation in microorganisms and assist in evolution of diverse metabolic pathways for their survival on several complex organic compounds. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly lipophilic in nature and cause adverse effects to the environment and human health by biomagnification through the food chain. Diverse microorganisms, harboring numerous plasmids and catabolic genes, acclimatize to these environmentally unfavorable conditions by gene duplication, mutational drift, hypermutation, and recombination. Genetic aspects of some major POP catabolic genes such as biphenyl dioxygenase (bph), DDT 2,3-dioxygenase, and angular dioxygenase assist in degradation of biphenyl, organochlorine pesticides, and dioxins/furans, respectively. Microbial metagenome constitutes the largest genetic reservoir with miscellaneous enzymatic activities implicated in degradation. To tap the metabolic potential of microorganisms, recent techniques like sequence and function-based screening and substrate-induced gene expression are proficient in tracing out novel catabolic genes from the entire metagenome for utilization in enhanced biodegradation. The major endeavor of today's scientific world is to characterize the exact genetic mechanisms of microbes for bioremediation of these toxic compounds by excavating into the uncultured plethora. This review entails the effect of POPs on the environment and involvement of microbial catabolic genes for their removal with the advanced techniques of bioremediation.

AB  - We reviewed empirical evidence regarding whether mostly heterosexual exists as a sexual orientation distinct from two adjacent groups on a sexual continuum-exclusively heterosexual and substantially bisexual. We addressed the question: Do mostly heterosexuals show a unique profile of sexual and romantic characteristics that distinguishes them as a separate sexual orientation group? We found sufficient data in four areas to support an affirmative answer. Individuals who acknowledged a mostly heterosexual orientation were distinct from adjacent sexual orientation groups in having a small degree of same-sex sexual and/or romantic attraction and, occasionally, same-sex behavior; constituted a substantial prevalence in the population; were relatively stable in their orientation over time; and reported that this sexual identity was subjectively meaningful to them. Findings suggested that self-identification as mostly heterosexual or an acknowledgment of slight same-sex sexuality increases during the teenage years, peaks around the early twenties (somewhat sooner for men than women), and remains relatively high during young adulthood. Limited evidence suggested that prevalence is lower among older participants. These findings have implications for our conceptualization of sexual orientation as a continuum, the nature of sex differences in sexuality, developmental changes in sexuality, biologically based assessments of sexual orientation, and an etiological theory of mostly heterosexuality.

AB  - Psychomotor retardation (PR) is among the most important features of depression. This study investigates the development of day- and night-time as well as intensity and quantity of circadian motor activity during a 4-week course of treatment among 27 patients with depression compared to 27 healthy controls. A diagnosis of major depression was made using SCID. Motor activity was continuously measured with an actigraph during the study and clinical course of depression with HAM-D-21. Motor activity was described as the quantity and intensity of movements during day-and night-time. Clinically improved patients had significantly intensified movements after 4 weeks, compared to subjects with <50% improvement on HAM-D. While the measures of day-time level of movements captured the clinical improvement of depression, clinical improvement was not reflected by the night-time measurements. This study demonstrates that the separated analysis of level and quantity of movements supports a better understanding of the nature of psychomotor retardation during depression. The subdivision in day-and night-time activity objectively measured with actigraphy captures distinct patterns of motor activity and represents prognostic factors in the treatment outcome of depression. The study also highlights the importance of studying the intensity of movements separately from the quantity of movements in relation to treatment outcome.

AB  - DNA is the ultimate depository of biological complexity. Thus, in order to understand life and gain insights into disease pathogenesis, genetic information embedded in the sequence of DNA base pairs comprising chromosomes should be deciphered. The stories of investigating the association between phenotype and genotype in China and other countries further demonstrate that genomics can serve as a probe for disease biology. We now know that in Mendelian disorders, one gene is not only a dictator of one phenotype but also a dictator of two or more distinct disorders. Dissecting genetic abnormalities of complex diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, mental diseases, coronary heart disease and cancer, may unravel the complicated networks and crosstalks, and help to simplify the complexity of the disease. The transcriptome and proteomic analysis for medicine not only deepen our understanding of disease pathogenesis, but also provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Taken together, genomic research offers a new opportunity for determining how diseases occur, by taking advantage of experiments of nature and a growing array of sophisticated research tools to identify the molecular abnormalities underlying disease processes. We should be ready for the advent of genomic medicine, and put the genome into the doctors' bag, so that we can help patients to conquer diseases.

KW  - MISSIONARIES
KW  - HISTORY
KW  - ORIGINS
AB  - During the last decade there has been a notable upsurge in publications about religion in African history. The trend is also noticeable in writing specifically concerned with Southern Africa though it is not spread evenly across regions and disciplines. Male writers with religious connections still predominate. There have been some important studies of mission Christianity and African evangelism, although inordinate attention is still paid to nineteenth-century origins and biography. Writing about the relationship between colonialism and Christianity is still permeated by disputes about the role of organised religion in sustaining white supremacy, despite an emerging consensus among historians that Christianity was a two-edged sword that could undercut as well as sustain domination. Understanding the position taken on these issues by active clergy and departments of religious studies requires some knowledge of the debates provoked by the advent of 'African Theology', 'Black Theology' and 'Liberation Theology'. One of the most interesting trends in historical studies of religion is renewed attention to the question of religious conversion, an inner process of mental/spiritual transformation often considered to be inaccessible to normal processes of investigation. The writings of Lamin Sanneh on 'translation' suggest interesting new lines of research. Up to this point there has been very little historical work on Southern African religion employing techniques of post-structural or discourse analysis. Other neglected areas include missionary medicine, the work of non-Anglophone missions and the gendered nature of religious experience.

AB  - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is consistently associated with a host of social problems, such as victimization and difficulties in maintaining close friendships. These problems are not limited to offline relations but also manifest in the online social world, as previous research shows that ADHD is associated with problematic use of social media. Given the ubiquitous nature of social media, the goal of the current review is to understand why adolescents with ADHD demonstrate more problematic social media use than their typically developing peers. To this end, we provide a narrative review on the evidence for the link between ADHD and social media use, and consequently present an integrative framework, which encompasses neurobiological mechanisms (i.e., imbalance theory of brain development and dual pathway model of ADHD) and social mechanisms, including influences from peers and parents. We conclude that empirical work shows most consistent evidence for the link between problematic social media use and ADHD (symptoms), while intensity of social media use is also associated with several other behaviors and outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize how existing interventions for ADHD may work on the identified mechanisms and provide at-hand clinical recommendations for therapists working with adolescents with ADHD who exhibit problematic social media use.

AB  - Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disease state in which currently approved pharmacotherapeutics are of relatively low effect at a population level. One reason for this may be that current pharmacotherapeutics focus on the reward pathway in relapse prevention, rather than addressing AUD from a holistic perspective. Importantly, one often overlooked symptom of AUD is sleep disruption. In recent years, an efficient, relatively low risk and economic strategy that has proven successful in other disorders is the repositioning or repurposing of drugs approved for the treatment of other indications. Suvorexant, a dual orexin receptor antagonist, has been licensed for the treatment of insomnia in the USA, Australia and Japan. The orexin system also plays a role in the emotional dysregulation that occurs during withdrawal from alcohol use and in alcohol-seeking behaviours. These two factors prompted the planning of a clinical trial into the use of suvorexant to treat insomnia in alcohol dependent individuals during and 24 weeks post-acute alcohol withdrawal. In this review we outline the comorbid nature of AUD and sleep disruptions. We then highlight the role of the orexin system in both sleep-wake regulation and AUD. Finally, we discuss our plan for a Phase II double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effectiveness of suvorexant for the treatment of comorbid insomnia and AUD.

AB  - Recent study into body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) has raised questions about the validity of its current diagnostic classification as well as categorical division into 'psychotic' and 'non-psychotic' variants. Furthermore, though individuals with the disorder are believed to experience cognitive difficulties, the precise nature of these deficits remains unclear. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of existing knowledge of BDD in terms of its nosology and cognitive deficits. We evaluate arguments in relation to its inclusion within the obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (OCSDs), consider how delusionality is coded in BDD, and also examine recent studies suggesting which specific cognitive deficits may underpin the disorder. There appears to be a sound rationale for considering BDD as part of the OCSDs, though current findings indicate that it is not simply a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Evidence also suggests that the degree of delusional beliefs in BDD would be more appropriately theorised on a dimensional basis. In terms of cognitive deficits, research to date has implied that attentional biases and/or abnormalities in basic visual processing may be especially important. Further research is needed to elucidate an inclusive profile of the underlying cognitive deficits in BDD. In turn, these insights could help to clarify current nosological debates surrounding the disorder.

AB  - Whether mathematics is a gendered domain or not is a long-lasting issue bringing along major social and educational implications. The females' underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has been considered one of the key signs of the math gender gap, although the current view largely attributes the origin of this phenomenon to sociocultural factors. Indeed, recent approaches to math gender differences reached the universal conclusion that nature and nurture exert reciprocal effects on each other, establishing the need for approaching the study of the math gender issue only once its intrinsic complexity has been accepted. Building upon a flourishing literature, this review provides an updated synthesis of the evidence for math gender equality at the start, and for math gender inequality on the go, challenging the role of biological factors. In particular, by combining recent findings from different research areas, the paper discusses the persistence of the "math male myth" and the associated "female are not good at math myth," drawing attention to the complex interplay of social and cultural forces that support such stereotypes. The suggestion is made that longevity of these myths results from the additive effects of two independent cognitive biases associated with gender stereotypes and with math stereotypes, respectively. Scholars' responsibility in amplifying these myths by pursuing some catching lines of research is also discussed.

AB  - Introduction. Confabulations, or the production of false memories without deliberate intent to lie, is an intriguing phenomenon for which an attempt has been made to explain it since they were first described. Confabulations are a good example for illustrating the reconstructive character of memory. Nevertheless, their exact nature and the way in which they are produced are still controversial.
   Objective. To review the different models proposed to explain the appearance of confabulations.
   Development. Neuropsychological models that currently have some theoretical development and empirical evidence are reviewed. In addition, a brief reference to motivational models, that have recently begun to recover popularity, are presented. We conclude by presenting the last version of the strategic retrieval model that makes it possible to integrate the relevant elements from the others.
   Conclusions. Early models of confabulations, which considered them a result of the need to fill memory gaps, are outdated nowadays. Nevertheless, emotional processes are taken into account to explain their content. From neuropsychological approaches, it is possible to distinguish models that consider confabulation as a result of a temporal or contextual problem, and those which consider that the main problem is on the memory retrieval process. More specifically, the strategic retrieval hypothesis states that confabulations are the result of a dysfunction in a complex system of monitoring the recovered information. This model would make it possible to integrate explanations and evidences coming from the other proposals.

AB  - Background Cigarette smoking is one of the most preventable causes of morbidities and mortalities. Since 2005, the World Health Organization Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (WHO-FCTC) provides an efficient strategic plan for tobacco control across the world. Many countries in the world have successfully reduced the prevalence of cigarette smoking. However, in developing countries, the prevalence of cigarette smoking is mounting which signifies a need of prompt attention. This scoping review aims to explore the extent and nature of Smoking Cessation (SmC) interventions and associated factors in South Asian Region (SAR) by systematically reviewing available recently published and unpublished literature. Methods The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) framework frames the conduct of this scoping review. PubMed, EBSCO CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, and local websites as well as other sources of grey literature were searched for relevant literature. In total, 573 literature sources were screened. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram, finally, 48 data sources were included for data extraction and analysis. We analyzed the extracted SmC interventions through the FCTC. Factors that affect smoking cessation interventions will be extracted through manual content analysis. Results Regarding FCTC recommended smoking cessation strategies (articles), most of the articles were either neglected or addressed in a discordant way by various anti-smoking groups in SAR. Key barriers that hamper the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions included lack of awareness, poor implementation of anti-smoking laws, and socio-cultural acceptance of tobacco use. Conversely, increased levels of awareness, through different mediums, related to smoking harms and benefits of quitting, effective implementation of anti-smoking laws, smoking cessation trained healthcare professionals, support systems, and reluctance in the community to cigarette smoking were identified as facilitators to smoking cessation interventions. Conclusion The ignored or uncoordinated FCTC's directions on smoking cessation strategies have resulted in continued increasing prevalence of cigarette smoking in developing countries, especially SAR. The findings of this review highlight the need for refocusing the smoking cessation strategies in SAR. Strengths The review was conducted by a team of expert comprising information specialists, and senior professors bringing rich experience in systematic and scoping reviews. Every effort was made to include all available literature sources addressing cigarette SmC and associated factors in SAR. The review findings signal the need and direction for more SmC efforts in SAR which may contribute to development of effective policies and guidelines for the control of smoking prevalence. Limitations Despite efforts, potentially relevant records may have been missed due to unpublished or inaccessible articles, unintended selection bias, or those published in local languages, etc. Moreover, the exclusion of literature on under 18 participants and mentally ill smokers may limit the generalizability of findings.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a major mood disorder with several genes of moderate or small effect contributing to the genetic susceptibility. It is also likely heterogeneous, which stimulated efforts to refine its clinical phenotype, studies investigating the link between BD susceptibility and response to a specific mood stabilizer appear to be one of the promising directions.
   In particular, excellent response to lithium prophylaxis has been described as a clinical marker of a more homogeneous subgroup of BD, characterized by an episodic course, low rates of co-morbid conditions, absence of rapid cycling, and a strong genetic loading. These results also suggest that lithium response clusters in families (independent of the increased familial loading for affective disorders), likely on a genetic basis.
   For almost 40 years, clinical studies have pointed to differences between lithium responders (LR) and non-responders (LNR). For instance, there is a higher frequency of BD in LR families. As well, investigations in offspring of LR and LNR probands show that the offspring of LR tend to manifest a higher frequency of affective disorders, less co-morbidity and an episodic course of the disorder, compared with the offspring of LNR, who had a broad range of psychopathology, a higher rate of co-morbidity and a chronic course of the disorder.
   A number of candidate genes have been studied in patients treated with lithium; of these, several showed an association in at least one study: cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase (INNP1), serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phospholipase gamma-1(PLC gamma-1), dopomine receptors (D2 and D4), polyglutamine tracts, tyrosine hydroxylase, inositol monophosphatase (IMPA), mitochondrial DNA, and breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene.
   Clinical studies have shown as well that the treatment response and outcome appear to be specific for the different types of mood stabilizers. Patients who respond to lithium exhibit qualitative differences from patients responding to other medications, such as valproate, carbamazepine or lamotrigine. Responders to carbamazepine had atypical clinical features, such as mood-incongruent psychosis, an age of onset of illness below 30 years old, and a negative family history of mood disorders. Similarly, in a study comparing the phenotypic spectra in responders to lithium versus lamotrigine the probands differed with respect to clinical course (with rapid cycling and non-episodic course in the lamotrigine group) and co-morbidity, with the lamotrigine-responder group showing a higher frequency of panic attacks and substance abuse.
   In conclusion, pharmacogenetic studies may provide important clues to the nature of bipolar disorder and the response to long term treatment.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine and synthesise the empirical evidence on the perceptions of Black and Ethnic Minority (BAME) carers views on mental health (MH) services and support offered in the UK. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive search conducted by searching Medline, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection served to identify relevant studies that explored the perceptions of BAME carers on MH services. Other key sources and reference list of identified journal articles were searched to ascertain that this review contains all relevant studies and captured studies not indexed in the databases. Using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool, 20 relevant studies published between 1996 and 2020 retrieved were and reviewed. From the reviewed papers five themes emerged which summarised the perception of BAME carers views on MH services and support services offered in the UK. Findings Critical appraisal of 20 studies that met the ascribed inclusion criteria was undertaken. A total of 18 studies were of qualitative design, one used a quantitative approach and one was a systematic review. Several themes addressing the participants' views were identified from the studies. The core themes central to these studies were: awareness and utilization of available MH services, language barriers to accessing MH services, positive experience whilst in contact with MH services, negative experience whilst in contact with MH services and difficulties in seeking help. Research limitations/implications One of the review criteria was to focus on peer-reviewed articles; grey literature was exempted from the search for relevant studies. Although a systematic literature review was conducted, there is the possibility that some appropriate studies were not identified. This could be because of different use of key terms in some of the studies. Papers that identified and acknowledged BAME MH carers and MH services were focused on, which resulted in 20 eligible studies for synthesis. Originality/value This review revealed the perception of BAME carers on MH services and available support offered. It highlighted that a significant number of BAME carers had limited understanding of the range of available MH services and support on offer within the UK. The review highlighted that fear of stigmatisation, discrimination in conjunction with the formulaic nature of MH services, delayed at best and inhibited at worst BAME Carers from accessing support from MH services, which consequentially had detrimental effects on service users receiving the timely appropriate support needed (Mermon et al., 2016). It is, therefore, a recommended imperative that MH services are deliberate in their endeavour to be inclusive, culturally embracing and accessible, if the MH needs of diverse ethnic minority groups within the UK are to be met appropriately.

AB  - Participatory research has as a central tenet that power relations between researcher and researched be reduced. In the last 20 years, a substantial literature has demonstrated the difficulties inherent in this as well as the troublesome nature of certain central concepts.
   (1) To describe and illustrate a new form of participatory research where the researchers share at least something with the participants in the research. That is, all are users of mental health services. (2) To reflect on the novel form of participatory research in terms of whether it shares, mitigates or avoids some of the difficulties of more traditional forms and to pose the question: what is a mental health community?
   The model described is new in that the researchers have a different status than in conventional participatory research. But it is illuminated by and itself illuminates issues of power relations in research and difficulties in reducing that; gatekeepers and the exclusion of crucial groups of service users; the confusion of demographic representativeness with the silencing of marginalized perspectives; coming out of the academic space and the shifting issue of what counts as 'communities' in mental health.
   The examples given are moderate in scale and relevant to social psychiatry. Yet they may change methods and the definition of participatory research and at the same time be vitiated by but also illuminate dilemmas already identified in the literature albeit in different formations.

AB  - Social phobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by heightened fear and avoidance of one or more social or performance situations, including public speaking, meeting new people, eating or writing in front of others, and attending social gatherings. People with social phobia are typically anxious about the possibility that others will evaluate them negatively and/or notice symptoms of their anxiety. Social phobia affects up to 13% of individuals at some time in their lives and is usually associated with at least moderate functional impairment. Research on the nature and treatment of social phobia has increased dramatically over the past decade. As with many of the anxiety disorders, sensitive assessment instruments and effective treatments now exist for people suffering from heightened social anxiety. Typical assessment strategies include clinical interviews, behavioural assessments, monitoring diaries, and self-report questionnaires. Treatments with demonstrated efficacy for social phobia include pharmacotherapy (for example, phenelzine, moclobemide, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medications) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (for example, cognitive restructuring, in vivo exposure, social skills training). Although preliminary comparative studies suggest that both approaches are about equally effective in the short term, each approach has advantages and disadvantages over the other. Trials examining combined psychological and pharmacological treatments are now under way, although no published data on the relative efficacy of combined treatments are currently available.

AB  - Word learning requires successful pairing of form and meaning. A common hypothesis about the process of word learning is that initially, infants work on identifying the phonological segments corresponding to words (speech analysis), and subsequently map those segments onto meaning. A range of theories have been proposed to account for the underlying mechanisms and factors in this remarkable achievement. While some are mainly concerned with the sensorimotor affordances and perceptual properties of referents out in the world, other theories emphasize the importance of language as a system, and the relations among language units (other words or syntax). Recent approaches inspired by neuro-science suggest that the storage and processing of word meanings is supported by neural systems subserving both the representation of conceptual knowledge and its access and use (Lambon Ralph et al., Nature Reviews Neuroscience 18:42-55, 2017). Developmental disorders have been attested to impact on different aspects of word learning. While impaired word knowledge is not a hallmark of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and remains largely understudied in this population, there is evidence that there are, sometimes subtle, problems in that domain, reflected in both how such knowledge is acquired and how words are used (Vulchanova et al., Word knowledge and word usage: A cross-disciplinary guide to the mental lexicon, Mouton De Gruyter, 2020). In addition, experimental evidence suggests that children with autism present with specific problems in categorizing the referents of linguistic labels leading to subsequent problems with using those labels (Hartley and Allen, Autism 19:570-579, 2015). Furthermore, deficits have been reported in some of the underlying mechanisms, biases and use of cues in word learning, such as e.g., object shape (Field et al., Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 46:1210-1219, 2016; Tek et al., Autism Research 1:208-222, 2008). Finally, it is likely that symbol use might be impaired in ASD, however, the direction of the causal relationship between social and communication impairment in autism and symbolic skills is still an open question (Allen and Lewis, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 45:1-3, 2015; Allen and Butler, British Journal of Developmental Psychology 38:345-362, 2020; Wainwright et al., Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 50:2941-2956, 2020). Further support for impaired symbol formation in autism comes from the well-attested problems with figurative, non-literal language use (e.g., metaphors, idioms, hyperbole, irony) (Vulchanova et al., Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 9:24, 2015). Here we propose that embodied theories of cognition which link perceptual experience with conceptual knowledge (see Eigsti, Frontiers in Psychology 4:224, 2013; Klin et al., Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences 358:345-360, 2003) might be useful in explaining the difficulty in symbolic understanding that individuals with autism face during the word learning process.

AB  - As has been demonstrated, Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) occurs in at least 1% of the population worldwide. However, earlier studies suggested a lower prevalence. In addition, the prevalence figures for different studies very between 0.4% and 3.8%. Moreover, the prevalence appears to vary in some parts of the world and races, with a lower rate in Afro-Americans and sub-Saharan black Africans. In this the second part of the review, possible reasons for the differences in prevalence and epidemiology are discussed. Tentative explanations for differing prevalence figures in GTS include problems with the diagnosis of GTS, the multidimensional nature of ties, as well as other tic factors including the waxing and waning of symptoms and the suppressibility of symptoms. Other factors inherent to GTS include the fact that there is no diagnostic test and indeed no definitive diagnosis other than clinical, the fact that psychosocial stresses can lead to increased tic severity, and that comorbid disorders may mask tics. The varying methods of study employed can also effect prevalence. There may be some regional differences in GTS as well, which may be due to a lack of awareness of GTS, or it may be a true reflection of low prevalence as in some populations GTS does appear rare. With regard to the sub-Saharan Africa data and possibly the African American data, matters are much more complex than meets the eye. The following reasons are all possible for the apparent rarity in these populations and include (i) other medical priorities and less propensity to seek health care, (ii) lack of awareness of GTS, (iii) chance, (iv) ethnic and epigenetic differences and reasons, (v) genetic and allelic differences in different races, and (vi) an admixture of races. The aetiology of GTS is also complex, with influences from complex genetic mechanisms, pre- and perinatal difficulties and, in a subgroup, some infections, possibly by epigenetic mechanisms. These may well affect phenotype and, thus, prevalence. There have even been suggestions that people with GTS are increasing. Recent data suggests that GTS is not a unitary condition and that there may well be different types of GTS. The prevalence of GTS in these individual subtypes is unknown. It is suggested that a new nomenclature be adopted for GTS in future, pending further genetic and phenomenological studies. To what extent the aetiology affects the phenotype and, thus, the prevalence is still unclear. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The neuropathological basis of schizophrenia and related psychoses remains elusive despite intensive scientific investigation. Symptoms of psychosis have been reported in a number of conditions where normal myelin development is interrupted. The nature, location, and timing of white matter pathology seem to be key factors in the development of psychosis, especially during the critical adolescent period of association area myelination. Numerous lines of evidence implicate myelin and oligodendrocyte function as critical processes that could affect neuronal connectivity, which has been implicated as a central abnormality in schizophrenia. Phenocopies of schizophrenia with a known pathological basis involving demyelination or dysmyelination may offer insights into the biology of schizophrenia itself. This article reviews the pathological changes in white matter of patients with schizophrenia, as well as demyelinating diseases associated with psychosis. In an attempt to understand the potential role of dysmyelination in schizophrenia, we outline the evidence from a number of both clinically-based and post-mortem studies that provide evidence that OMR genes are genetically associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. To further understand the implication of white matter dysfunction and dysmyelination in schizophrenia, we examine diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which has shown volumetric and microstructural white matter differences in patients with schizophrenia. While classical clinical-neuropathological correlations have established that disruption in myelination can produce a high fidelity phenocopy of psychosis similar to schizophrenia, the role of dysmyelination in schizophrenia remains controversial.

AB  - Despite the prevalence of opioid misuse, opioids remain the frontline treatment regimen for severe pain. However, opioid safety is hampered by side-effects such as analgesic tolerance, reduced analgesia to neuropathic pain, physical dependence, or reward. These side effects promote development of opioid use disorders and ultimately cause overdose deaths due to opioid-induced respiratory depression. The intertwined nature of signaling via mu-opioid receptors (MOR), the primary target of prescription opioids, with signaling pathways responsible for opioid side-effects presents important challenges. Therefore, a critical objective is to uncouple cellular and molecular mechanisms that selectively modulate analgesia from those that mediate side-effects. One such mechanism could be the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via MOR. Notably, MOR-mediated side-effects can be uncoupled from analgesia signaling via targeting RTK family receptors, highlighting physiological relevance of MOR-RTKs crosstalk. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge surrounding the basic pharmacology of RTKs and bidirectional regulation of MOR signaling, as well as how MOR-RTK signaling may modulate undesirable effects of chronic opioid use, including opioid analgesic tolerance, reduced analgesia to neuropathic pain, physical dependence, and reward. Further research is needed to better understand RTK-MOR transactivation signaling pathways, and to determine if RTKs are a plausible therapeutic target for mitigating opioid side effects.

AB  - Scholarship pertinent to the nature of human plasticity and the contemporary theoretical stress on developmental systems theories suggest that the regulation of dynamic person-context relations should be the key focus of inquiry in the study of adolescent development. An exemplar of a theory congruent with this relational conception of adolescent development is the Selection, Optimization, and Compensation (SOC) model offered by Baltes, Baltes, and colleagues. The model may be a value-added contribution to the adolescent literature in several respects: through illustrating the centrality of selection, optimization, and compensation processes in conceptualizing the regulation of the person-context relations that characterize development in adolescence; by integrating key themes within the adolescent development theoretical and empirical literatures; and through suggesting ideas for extending these literatures in new and useful ways, including needed directions for research and applications to policies and programs that are aimed at enhancing adaptive regulation in adolescence. We illustrate these value-added contributions of the SOC model by focusing on theory and research pertinent to arguably the central construct in the study of adolescence, identity. In addition, we discuss the implications of the SOC model for using developmental systems theory to understand the relation between individual development and social constraints or opportunities. The methodological features of research using the SOC model are noted, and its implications for both the development of the person and for the maintenance and perpetuation of civil society are presented.

AB  - Affect signaling in human communication involves cortico-limbic brain systems for affect information decoding, such as expressed in vocal intonations during affective speech. Both, the affecto-acoustic speech profile of speakers and the cortico-limbic affect recognition network of listeners were previously identified using non-social and non-adaptive research protocols. However, these protocols neglected the inherent socio-dyadic nature of affective communication, thus underestimating the real-time adaptive dynamics of affective speech that maxi-mize listeners' neural effects and affect recognition. To approximate this socio-adaptive and neural context of affective communication, we used an innovative real-time neuroimaging setup that linked speakers' live affective speech production with listeners' limbic brain signals that served as a proxy for affect recognition. We show that affective speech communication is acoustically more distinctive, adaptive, and individualized in a live adaptive setting and more efficiently capitalizes on neural affect decoding mechanisms in limbic and associated networks than non-adaptive affective speech communication. Only live affective speech produced in adaption to listeners' limbic signals was closely linked to their emotion recognition as quantified by speakers' acoustics and listeners' emotional rating correlations. Furthermore, while live and adaptive aggressive speaking directly modulated limbic activity in listeners, joyful speaking modulated limbic activity in connection with the ventral striatum that is, amongst others, involved in the processing of pleasure. Thus, evolved neural mechanisms for affect decoding seem largely optimized for interactive and individually adaptive communicative contexts.

AB  - Theory suggests that evolutionary changes in phenotypic plasticity could either hinder or facilitate evolutionary rescue in a changing climate. Nevertheless, the actual role of evolving plasticity in the responses of natural populations to climate change remains unresolved. Direct observations of evolutionary change in nature are rare, making it difficult to assess the relative contributions of changes in trait means versus changes in plasticity to climate change responses. To address this gap, this review explores several proxies that can be used to understand evolving plasticity in the context of climate change, including space for time substitutions, experimental evolution and tests for genomic divergence at environmentally responsive loci. Comparisons among populations indicate a prominent role for divergence in environmentally responsive traits in local adaptation to climatic gradients. Moreover, genomic comparisons among such populations have identified pervasive divergence in the regulatory regions of environmentally responsive loci. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that divergence in plasticity plays a prominent role in adaptation to climatic gradients over space, indicating that evolving plasticity is also likely to play a key role in adaptive responses to climate change through time. This suggests that genetic variation in plastic responses to the environment (G x E) might be an important predictor of species' vulnerabilities to climate-driven decline or extinction.

AB  - Dendritic spines are multifunctional integrative units of the nervous system and are highly diverse and dynamic in nature. Both internal and external stimuli influence dendritic spine density and morphology on the order of minutes. It is clear that the structural plasticity of dendritic spines is related to changes in synaptic efficacy, learning and memory and other cognitive processes. However, it is currently unclear whether structural changes in dendritic spines are primary instigators of changes in specific behaviors, a consequence of behavioral changes, or both. In this review, we first examine the basic structure and function of dendritic spines in the brain, as well as laboratory methods to characterize and quantify morphological changes in dendritic spines. We then discuss the existing literature on the temporal and functional relationship between changes in dendritic spines in specific brain regions and changes in specific behaviors mediated by those regions. Although technological advancements have allowed us to better understand the functional relevance of structural changes in dendritic spines that are influenced by environmental stimuli, the role of spine dynamics as an underlying driver or consequence of behavior still remains elusive. We conclude that while it is likely that structural changes in dendritic spines are both instigators and results of behavioral changes, improved research tools and methods are needed to experimentally and directly manipulate spine dynamics in order to more empirically delineate the relationship between spine structure and behavior.

AB  - While mass panic (and/or violence) and self-preservation are often assumed to be the natural response to physical danger and perceived entrapment, the literature indicates that expressions of mutual aid are common and often predominate, and collective flight may be so delayed that survival is threatened. In fact, the typical response to a variety of threats and disasters is not to flee but to seek the proximity of familiar persons and places; moreover, separation from attachment figures is a greater stressor than physical danger. Such observations can be explained by an alternative "social attachment" model that recognizes the fundamentally gregarious nature of human beings and the primacy of attachments. In the relatively rare instances where flight occurs, the latter can be understood as one aspect of a more general affiliative response that involves escaping from certain situations and moving toward other situations that are perceived as familiar but which may not necessarily be objectively safe. The occurrence of flight-and-affiliation depends mainly on the social context and especially the whereabouts of familiar persons (i.e., attachment figures); their physical presence has a calming effect and reduces the probability of flight-and-affiliation, while their absence has the opposite effect. Combining the factors of perceived physical danger and the location of attachment figures results in a four-fold typology that encompasses a wide spectrum of collective responses to threat and disaster. Implications of the model for predicting community responses to terrorist attacks and/or use of weapons of mass destruction are briefly discussed.

AB  - Neuropsychological impairment is well established as a feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) but studies have shown a variable pattern of impairment. This paper seeks first to clarify this by examining methodological and clinical factors that give rise to variability in study findings. Second, it examines theories of the origin of these neuropsychological abnormalities. Third, it reviews evidence regarding the clinical significance of different patterns of deficit. A selective review was undertaken of the literature with a particular emphasis on methodological factors, the influence of clinical subtypes and prevalent theories of neuropsychological abnormality. Methodological issues and the heterogeneity of MDD account for considerable variability in results. Specific investigation of the subtypes of psychotic MDD, melancholic MIDD and bipolar depression reduces this heterogeneity and results are more consistent in the elderly. Hypothalamicpituitary -adrenal axis dysfunction is associated with neuropsychological dysfunction in MIDD although evidence of direct causation is not definitive at present. Impairment of executive and psychomotor function is a consistent finding, particularly in the elderly, and may reflect frontostriatal-limbic dysfunction. There is growing evidence that this may have clinical significance. It is suggested that future research take very careful account of the exact phenotype of MDD. Classification based on neuropsychological profile may, in fact, be useful. Further research should examine further the clinical importance of patterns of neuropsychological impairment.

AB  - The first section of this paper describes methodology and major cognitive outcomes of the Canberra Longitudinal Study (CLS). This community study of 1045 Australians aged 70 years or over commenced in 1990. Participants were reassessed on three subsequent occasions. Its major themes were investigations of prevalence of dementia and depression, risk factors, inter-individual variability and instrument development. Over 60 papers arising from the study have been published.
   The second section of this paper describes the use of a Factor of Curves (FOC) latent growth model to examine the existence of a common factor responsible for age-related deterioration in cognitive and non-Cognitive processes. This analysis is a logical progression in a series of investigations using the Canberra Longitudinal Study into risk factors and correlates of cognitive change using structural equation modeling techniques. The FOC model is described and is used to explore the nature of an hypothesized common factor and to determine its relationship with age, gender, education, pre-morbid intelligence and to the ApoE crenotype. Latent growth models were developed for each of reaction time, Symbol Letter Modalities Test (SLMT). Grip strength, self-reported Sensory disability and memory from three waves of data. Second-order latent level slope factors were established based on the individual factor growth curve models. Although a common factor model could be fitted to the data, there is little support that it represents a single common cause.

AB  - The role of the left hemisphere in calculation has been unequivocally demonstrated in numerous studies in the last decades. The right hemisphere, on the other hand, had been traditionally considered subsidiary to the left hemisphere functions, although its role was less clearly defined. Recent clinical studies as well as investigations conducted with other methodologies (e.g. neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation and direct cortical electro-stimulation) leave several unanswered questions about the contribution of the right hemisphere in calculation. In particular, novel clinical studies show that right hemisphere acalculia encompasses a wide variety of symptoms, affecting even simple calculation, which cannot be easily attributed to spatial disorders or to a generic difficulty effect as previously believed. The studies reported here also show how the right hemisphere has its own specific role and that only a bilateral orchestration between the respective functions of each hemisphere guarantees, in fact, precise calculation. Vis-a-vis these data, the traditional wisdom that attributes to the right hemisphere a role mostly confined to spatial aspects of calculation needs to be significantly reshaped. The question for the future is whether it is possible to precisely define the specific contribution of the right hemisphere in several aspects of calculation while highlighting the nature of the cross-talk between the two hemispheres.

AB  - Environmental mutagens are chemical and physical substances in the environment that has a potential to induce a wide range of mutations and generate multiple physiological, biochemical, and genetic modifications in humans. Most mutagens are having genotoxic effects on the following generation through germ cells. The influence of germinal mutations on health will be determined by their frequency, nature, and the mechanisms that keep a specific mutation in the population. Early prenatal lethal mutations have less public health consequences than genetic illnesses linked with long-term medical and social difficulties. Physical and chemical mutagens are common mutagens found in the environment. These two environmental mutagens have been associated with multiple neurological disorders and carcinogenesis in humans. Thus in this study, we aim to unravel the molecular mechanism of physical mutagens (UV rays, X-rays, gamma rays), chemical mutagens (dimethyl sulfate (DMS), bisphenol A (BPA), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 5-chlorocytosine (5ClC)), and several heavy metals (Ar, Pb, Al, Hg, Cd, Cr) implicated in DNA damage, carcinogenesis, chromosomal abnormalities, and oxidative stress which leads to multiple disorders and impacting human health. Biological tests for mutagen detection are crucial; therefore, we also discuss several approaches (Ames test and Mutatox test) to estimate mutagenic factors in the environment. The potential risks of environmental mutagens impacting humans require a deeper basic knowledge of human genetics as well as ongoing research on humans, animals, and their tissues and fluids.

AB  - Fatigue is a common problem; when chronic and disabling, subjects can be categorized as having chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Whilst it is most likely a multifactorial condition of biopsychosocial origin, the nature of the pathophysiological component remains unclear. There has been a wealth of interest in the possible hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction in CFS, and whether such changes may mediate fatigue. On balance, there appears to be reduced cortisol output in a proportion of patients, together with heightened negative feedback and glucocorticoid receptor function. There is evidence for impaired adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol responses to a variety of challenges. However, there is no evidence for a specific or uniform dysfunction of the HPA axis. Evidence that these changes may be related to symptom production comes from randomized controlled trials of glucocorticoid replacement therapy, which have shown improvements in fatigue and disability. Given the many factors that may impinge on the HPA axis in CFS, such as inactivity, sleep disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, medication and ongoing stress, it seems likely that there is not a single or specific change to the HPA axis in CFS and that the observed HPA axis disturbances are of multifactorial etiology. This is further supported by a comparison of neuroendocrine findings in other conditions in which fatigue is prominent, showing both similarities and differences with the pattern in CFS.

This phenomenon-otherwise known as growth following adversity-has attracted increasing attention from sport psychology scholars. In this paper, wesystematically review and synthesize the findings of studies in this area to better understand: (a) how growth has been conceptualized in competitive sport, (b) the theory underpinning the study of growth in sport performers, (c) the nature of research conducted in this area, and (d) the adversity-and growth-related experiences of competitive athletes. Following the application of inclusion criteria and methodological quality assessment, 17 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion in the systematic review. The findings of these studies are reviewed and synthesized in relation to study characteristics (viz. growth terminology, theoretical underpinning, study design, participant details, and data analysis), quality appraisal, adversity-related experiences (viz. negative events and experiences, and response to negative events and experiences), and growth-related experiences (viz. mechanisms of growth and indicators of growth). To facilitate understanding of growth following adversity in competitive sport, we address the definitions and theories that have informed the body of research, discuss the associated findings related to the adversity-and growth-related experiences of competitive athletes, and outline avenues for future research. It is hoped that this review and synthesis will facilitate understanding and inform practice in this area.

AB  - Recent developments in chemogenetic approaches to the investigation of brain function have ushered in a paradigm change in the strategy for drug and behavior research and clinical drug-based medications. As the nature of the drug action is based on humoral regulation, it is a challenge to identify the neuronal mechanisms responsible for the expression of certain targeted behavior induced by drug application. The development of chemogenetic approaches has allowed researchers to control neural activities in targeted neurons through a toolbox, including engineered G protein-coupled receptors or ligand-gated ion channels together with exogenously inert synthetic ligands. This review provides a brief overview of the chemogenetics toolbox with an emphasis on the DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) technique used in rodent models, which is applicable to the investigation of how specific neural circuits regulate behavioral processes. The use of chemogenetics has had a significant impact on basic neuroscience for a better understanding of the relationships between brain activity and the expression of behaviors with cell- and circuit-specific orders. Furthermore, chemogenetics is potentially a useful tool to deconstruct the neuropathological mechanisms of mental diseases and its regulation by drug, and provide us with transformative therapeutics with medication. We also review recent findings in the use of chemogenetic techniques to uncover functional circuit connections of serotonergic neurons in rodent models.

AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the common modalities of monitoring the mental activities. Owing to the non-invasive availability of this system, its applicability has seen remarkable developments beyond medical use-cases. One such use case is brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Such systems require the usage of high resolution-based multi-channel EEG devices so that the data collection spans multiple locations of the brain like the occipital, frontal, temporal, and so on. This results in huge data (with high sampling rates) and with multiple EEG channels with inherent artifacts. Several challenges exist in analyzing data of this nature, for instance, selecting the optimal number of EEG channels or deciding what best features to rely on for achieving better performance. The selection of these variables is complicated and requires a lot of domain knowledge and non-invasive EEG monitoring, which is not feasible always. Hence, optimization serves to be an easy to access tool in deriving such parameters. Considerable efforts in formulating these issues as an optimization problem have been laid. As a result, various multi-objective and constrained optimization functions have been developed in BCI that has achieved reliable outcomes in device control like neuro-prosthetic arms, application control, gaming, and so on. This paper makes an attempt to study the usage of optimization techniques in formulating the issues in BCI. The outcomes, challenges, and major observations of these approaches are discussed in detail.

AB  - Most organisms, including ourselves, are exposed to environmental stressors at various points during life, and responses to such stressors have been optimised by evolution to give the best fitness outcomes. It is expected that environmental change will substantially increase long-term stress exposure in many animal groups in the coming decades. A major challenge for biologists is to understand and predict how this will influence individuals, populations and ecosystems, and over what time scale such effects will occur. This requires a multi-disciplinary approach, combining studies of mechanisms with studies of fitness consequences for individuals and their descendants. In this review, I discuss the positive and negative fitness consequences of responses to stressful environments, particularly during early life, and with an emphasis on studies in birds. As many of the mechanisms underlying stress responses are highly conserved across the vertebrate groups, the findings from these studies have general applicability when interpreted in a life history context. One important route that has recently been identified whereby chronic stress exposure can affect health and longevity over long time frames is via effects on telomere dynamics. Much of this work has so far been done on humans, and is correlational in nature, but studies on other taxa, and experimental work, are increasing. I summarise the relevant aspects of vertebrate telomere biology and critically appraise our current knowledge with a view to pointing out important future research directions for our understanding of how stress exposure influences life histories.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewDue to the interdisciplinary nature of mental health disability in post-secondary educational settings, there is limited information available in the general psychiatric literature. This paper aims to familiarize psychiatrists with issues surrounding mental health disability in post-secondary educational settings. In this manuscript, we review critical aspects of the evaluation and management of post-secondary students who may be entitled to academic accommodations as a result of impairment from psychiatric diagnoses. We discuss common misconceptions about mental health impairment and best practices to mitigate its burden. We review relevant legislation and literature from psychiatric, psychological, and higher education journals and include multidisciplinary expert opinions.Recent FindingsMental illness is increasingly common in the post-secondary student population. When symptoms are severe, they can lead to academic impairment or disability. Nationwide data suggests an increase in post-secondary students requesting accommodations for mental health-related impairments. Recent guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and The Jed Foundation aim to familiarize mental health providers, evaluators, administrators, students, and their families with best practices related to evaluating and managing mental health disability in post-secondary educational settings.SummaryEvaluating, accommodating, and managing mental health disability during the post-secondary years are complicated processes. Legislation and nuanced evaluations can guide evaluating psychiatrists and administrators in recommending appropriate accommodations. By being knowledgeable about relevant legislation, best practices for evaluations, and available student resources, psychiatrists will be able to collaborate effectively with all stakeholders.

AB  - The central argument presented in this paper is that statistical learning (SL) is an ability comprised of multiple components that operate largely implicitly. Components relating to the stimulus encoding, retention and abstraction required for SL may include, but are not limited to, certain types of attention, processing speed and memory. It is likely that individuals vary in terms of the efficiency of these underlying components, and in patterns of connectivity among these components, and that SL tasks differ from one another in how they draw on certain underlying components more than others. This theoretical framework is of value because it can assist in gaining a clearer understanding of how SL is linked with individual differences in complex mental activities such as language processing. Variability in language processing across individuals is of central concern to researchers interested in child development, including those interested in neurodevelopmental disorders where language can be affected such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This paper discusses the link between SL and individual differences in language processing in the context of age-related changes in SL during infancy and childhood, and whether SL is affected in ASD. Viewing SL as a multicomponent ability may help to explain divergent findings from previous empirical research in these areas and guide the design of future studies.

AB  - Objective: In some Australian states clinicians and mental health tribunal members are already required to assess a person's decision-making capacity before involuntary treatment can be applied. Professionals in other jurisdictions will likely soon be required to do the same as mental health law reform in most Australian jurisdictions makes the assessment of decision-making capacity a central component of the process of providing unconsented psychiatric treatment. We provide a guide to the legal issues around the capacity to refuse psychiatric treatment to assist with this task.
   Method: We review the legislation in the four Australian states most advanced in the mental health law reform process and use examples from clinical practice and the common law to describe how decision-making capacity should be assessed by these statutory standards.
   Results: Clinicians and tribunal members will primarily be required to judge whether a person with mental illness can understand the information relevant to the treatment decision and whether he or she can use or weigh that information to come to a decision. A person with a mental illness is presumed to have capacity, but that presumption can be rebutted. Capacity is specific to the decision at hand and cannot be determined by the nature of the decision made.
   Conclusions: The information provided should assist clinicians and tribunal members to make determinations of decision-making capacity around treatment refusal in the context of mental illness.

AB  - Many theories of emotion propose that emotional input is processed preferentially due to its relevance for the organism. Further, because consciousness has limited capacity, these considerations imply that emotional input ought to be processed even if participants are perceptually unaware of the input (subliminal perception). Although brain imaging has studied effects of unattended, suppressed (in binocular rivalry), and visually masked emotional pictures, conclusions regarding subliminal perception have been mixed. The reason is that subliminal perception demands a concept of an awareness threshold or limen, but there is no agreement on how to define and measure this threshold. Although different threshold concepts can be identified in psychophysics (signal detection theory), none maps directly onto perceptual awareness. Whereas it may be tempting to equate unawareness with the complete absence of objective discrimination ability (d = 0), this approach is incompatible with lessons from blindsight and denies the subjective nature of consciousness. This review argues that perceptual awareness is better viewed as a continuum of sensory states than a binary state. When levels of awareness are characterized carefully in terms of objective discrimination and subjective experience, findings can be informative regarding the relative independence of effects from awareness and the potentially moderating role of awareness in processing emotional input. Thus, because the issue of a threshold concept may never be resolved completely, the emphasis is to not prove subliminal perception but to compare effects at various levels of awareness.

AB  - Infertility is a problem that affects millions of couples around the world. It is known as a disease of couples, not individuals, which makes diagnosis difficult and treatment unclear. Male infertility can have many causes, from mechanical ones to abnormal spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis. Semen quality is determined by a number of factors, including those dependent on men themselves, with the number of infertile men growing every year. These include, e.g., diet, physical activity, sleep quality, stress, among many others. As these factors co-exist with insulin resistance, which is a disease closely related to lifestyle, it has been singled out in the study due to its role in affecting semen quality. In order to examine connections between lifestyle, insulin resistance, and semen quality, a review of literature published from 1989 to 2020 in the following databases PubMed/Medline, EMBASE (Elsevier), Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed. Hence, semen quality, environment, and insulin resistance are interrelated, thus it is difficult to indicate which aspect is the cause and which is the effect in a particular relationship and the nature of possible correlations. Since the influence of lifestyle on semen quality has been extensively studied, it is recommended that more thorough research be done on the relationship between insulin resistance and semen quality, comparing the semen quality of men with and without insulin resistance.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has increasingly been linked to heightened systemic inflammation. It matters whether this association is causal (and either bidirectional or unidirectional) or correlational. Investigators have hypothesized that chronic systemic low-grade inflammation may contribute to greater risk of developing PTSD after experiencing trauma and/or serve as a mechanism linking PTSD to adverse physical health outcomes. However, if the PTSD-inflammation relation is correlational, it may not warrant further research aimed at understanding inflammation as a PTSD risk factor or as a pathway linking PTSD with poor health. In this review, we first assess the longitudinal evidence related to PTSD and inflammation to understand more clearly the directionality and causal nature of this relation. Overall, few longitudinal studies rigorously assess the direction of the PTSD-inflammation relation. Some of the evidence indicates that elevated inflammation assessed pretrauma or in the acute aftermath of trauma increases risk for developing PTSD. Fewer studies evaluate the influence of PTSD on subsequent inflammation levels, and findings are mixed. Sample characteristics and study designs, and also the type of inflammation-related measure, vary widely across studies. Based on current evidence, we then recommend several statistical and study design approaches that may help untangle issues of bidirectionality and aid in determining the direction of causality between PTSD and inflammation. Last, we conclude with future research directions and consider potential implications for interventions or treatment approaches based on this growing body of literature.

AB  - Excess exposure to both essential and non-essential heavy metals can lead to a variety of adverse clinical conditions which selectively affect a variety of organs and cells in the body. The diverse, but highly specific nature of the symptoms produced by each metal indicates that they can interact with a restricted population of cellular targets ultimately resulting in unique clinical manifestations. The symptoms, which can be reversible or irreversible, often present with different patterns and outcomes depending on the net accumulated dose of any given metal. There are some common pathological conditions that result from excess exposure to heavy metals which unfortunately have not received widespread recognition and thus, have not been extensively investigated. For example, chronic exposure to several heavy metals such as Co, Mn, Cd, Pb, and Hg has the potential to affect hearing in humans and experimental animals based on previous studies including case reports and ex vivo studies. Understanding exactly how these metals induce hearing deficits is complicated by the fact that the inner ear is an extremely complex system that composed of a diverse collection of sensory, neural, and supporting cells which must act in synchrony to produce a neurophysiological signal terminating in the central auditory system. This review will focus on the anatomical, cellular, and functional changes that occur in the cochlea, the sensory organ for hearing, due to excessive exposure to manganese, cadmium, cobalt, lead, and mercury.

AB  - Humans have created a strong relationship with cats and dogs by domesticating them. Whether owned by a human or living feral, modern domestic cats and dogs interact extensively with people and the environment. The negative interactions between these domesticated animals and wildlife have been discussed in several reviews, but few reports have provided an overview of both the positive and negative impacts these domesticated animals have on wildlife conservation. Here, we describe the diverse issues associated with domestic cats and dogs and wildlife including predation, competition, pathogen transmission, hybridization, behavioural modification, harvest of wild animals for pet food, and creation of human-wildlife conflict. We then discuss their role in supporting conservation efforts (e.g., use in species identification and tracking, biological control), and shaping our social values towards animals and appreciation for nature. Finally, we suggest necessary steps to harmonize our relationship with cats and dogs and the conservation of wildlife. For owned animals, there is potential for pet owners to support conservation efforts through a 'pet tax' adopted by veterinary clinics and pet stores to be used for wildlife conservation. Moreover, information regarding the impacts of these animals on wildlife and potential solutions (e.g., voluntarily keeping cats and dogs inside or use of "pet curfews", use of bells to alert wildlife to cats) should be made available to owners who are most likely to have an influence on the behaviour of their companion animal.

AB  - Common brain mechanisms are thought to play a significant role across a multitude of chronic pain syndromes. In addition, there is strong evidence for the existence of sex differences in the prevalence of chronic pain and in the neurobiology of pain. Thus, it is important to consider sex when developing general principals of pain neurobiology. The goal of the current Mini-Review is to evaluate what is known about sex-specific brain alterations across multiple chronic pain populations. A total of 15 sex difference and 143 single-sex articles were identified from among 412 chronic pain neuroimaging articles. Results from sex difference studies indicate more prominent primary sensorimotor structural and functional alterations in female chronic pain patients compared with male chronic pain patients: differences in the nature and degree of insula alterations, with greater insula reactivity in male patients; differences in the degree of anterior cingulate structural alterations; and differences in emotional-arousal reactivity. Qualitative comparisons of male-specific and female-specific studies appear to be consistent with the results from sex difference studies. Given these differences, mixed-sex studies of chronic pain risk creating biased data or missing important information and single-sex studies have limited generalizability. The advent of large-scale neuroimaging databases will likely aid in building a more comprehensive understanding of sex differences and commonalities in brain mechanisms underlying chronic pain.

AB  - Discrimination against people with mental illness is rife across the globe. Among different types of discrimination is the policy in many countries where persons with mental illness are forbidden to inherit property, and they are not able to enter into a contract in a large number of countries. Using various databases, legislations dealing with law of contract, law of succession/inheritance, and law relating to testamentary capacity (wills) of all UN Member states (193 countries) were studied. With respect to federal countries, the laws of the most populous state as a representative state in the respective country were studied. Only 40 Member States (21%) recognize/allow persons with mental health problems to enter into contracts. Of these, however, only 16 Member States (9%) recognize the right of persons with mental health problems to enter into a contract without any restrictions. The remaining 24 Member States (12%) allow a contract entered into by a person with mental health problems to be invalidated under certain conditions. These countries also make the validity of the contract subject to the capacity to consent or based on the level of understanding of the person with mental health problems. They may allow persons with mental health problems to enter into contracts only for transactions of an insignificant nature or of personal rights. Only 9% of the countries allow people with mental illness to enter into contracts in an unrestricted way. Furthermore, there remain variations between high income and low income states. In spite of international laws in many countries, laws remain discriminatory.

AB  - This systematic review describes human molecular imaging Studies which have investigated alterations in extracellular DA levels during performance of behavioral tasks. Whilst heterogeneity in experimental methods limits meta-analysis, we describe the advantages and limitations of different methodological approaches. Interpretation of experimental results may be limited by regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes, head movement and choice of control conditions. We revisit Our Original Study of striatal DA release during video-game playing [Koepp, M.J., Gunn, R.N., Lawrence, A.D., Cunningham, V.J., Dagher, A., Jones,T., Brooks, D.J., Bench, C.J., Grasby, P.M., 1998. Evidence for striatal dopamine release during a video game. Nature 393, 266-268] to illustrate the potentially confounding influences of head movement and alterations in rCBF. Changes in [C-11]raclopride binding may be detected in extrastriatal as well as striatal brain regions-however we review evidence which suggests that extrastriatal changes may not be clearly interpreted in terms of DA release. Whilst several investigations have detected increases in striatal extracellular DA concentrations during task components such as motor learning and execution, reward-related processes, stress and cognitive performance, the presence of potentially biasing factors should be carefully considered (and, where possible, accounted for) when designing and interpreting future studies.

AB  - Although perseveration-the inappropriate repetition of previous responses-is quite common among patients with neurological damage, relatively few detailed computational accounts of its various forms have been put forth. A particularly well-documented variety involves the pattern of errors made by ''optic aphasic'' patients, who have a selective deficit in naming visually presented objects. Based on our previous work in modeling impaired reading via meaning in deep dyslexia, we develop a connectionist simulation of visual object naming. The major extension in the present work is the incorporation of short-term correlational weights that bias the network towards reproducing patterns of activity that have occurred on recently preceding trials. Under damage, the network replicates the complex semantic and perseverative effects found in the optic aphasic error pattern. Further analysis reveals that the perseverative effects are strongest when the lesions are near or within semantics, and are relatively mild when the preceding object evokes no response. Like optic aphasics, the network produces predominantly semantic rather than visual errors because, in contrast to reading, there is some structure in the mapping from visual to semantic representations for objects. Viewed together with the dyslexia simulations, the replication of complex empirical phenomena concerning impaired visual comprehension based on a small set of general connectionist principles strongly suggests that these principles provide important insights into the nature of semantic processing of visual information and its breakdown following brain damage.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the 'Plague of Twenty-First Century,' is a crippling neurodegenerative disease that affects a majority of the older population globally. By 2050, the incidence of AD is expected to rise to 135 million, while no treatment(s) that can reverse or control the progression of AD are currently available. The treatment(s) in use are limited in their ability to manage the symptoms or slow the progression of the disease and can lead to some severe side effects. The overall care is economically burdensome for the affected individuals as well as the caretakers or family members. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify and develop much safer alternative therapies that can better manage AD. This review discusses a multitude of such treatments borrowed from Ayurveda, traditional Chinese practices, meditation, and exercising for AD treatment. These therapies are in practice since ancient times and reported to be beneficial as anti-AD therapies. Ayurvedic drugs like turmeric, Brahmi, Ashwagandha, etc., management of stress by meditation, regular exercising, and acupuncture have been reported to be efficient in their anti-AD usage. Besides, a combination of vitamins and natural dietary intakes is likely to play a significant role in combating AD. We conclude that the use of such alternative strategies will be a stepping-stone in preventing, treating, curing, or managing the disease.

AB  - The use of neuroscience in the courtroom can be traced back to the early twentieth century. However, the use of neuroscientific evidence in criminal proceedings has increased significantly over the last two decades. This rapid increase has raised questions, among the media as well as the legal and scientific communities, regarding the effects that such evidence could have on legal decision makers. In this article, we first outline the history of neuroscientific evidence in courtrooms and then we provide a review of recent research investigating the effects of neuroscientific evidence on decision-making broadly, and on legal decisions specifically. In the latter case, we review studies that measure the effect of neuroscientific evidence (both imaging and nonimaging) on verdicts, sentencing recommendations, and beliefs of mock jurors and judges presented with a criminal case. Overall, the reviewed studies suggest mitigating effects of neuroscientific evidence on some legal decisions (e.g., the death penalty). Furthermore, factors such as mental disorder diagnoses and perceived dangerousness might moderate the mitigating effect of such evidence. Importantly, neuroscientific evidence that includes images of the brain does not appear to have an especially persuasive effect (compared with other neuroscientific evidence that does not include an image). Future directions for research are discussed, with a specific call for studies that vary defendant characteristics, the nature of the crime, and a juror's perception of the defendant, in order to better understand the roles of moderating factors and cognitive mediators of persuasion.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscle paralysis determined by the degeneration of motoneurons in the motor cortex brainstem and spinal cord. The ALS pathogenetic mechanisms are still unclear, despite the wealth of studies demonstrating the involvement of several altered signaling pathways, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. To date, the proposed therapeutic strategies are targeted to one or a few of these alterations, resulting in only a minimal effect on disease course and survival of ALS patients. The involvement of different mechanisms in ALS pathogenesis underlines the need for a therapeutic approach targeted to multiple aspects. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can support motoneurons and surrounding cells, reduce inflammation, stimulate tissue regeneration and release growth factors. On this basis, MSC have been proposed as promising candidates to treat ALS. However, due to the drawbacks of cell therapy, the possible therapeutic use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by stem cells is raising increasing interest. The present review summarizes the main pathological mechanisms involved in ALS and the related therapeutic approaches proposed to date, focusing on MSC therapy and their preclinical and clinical applications. Moreover, the nature and characteristics of EVs and their role in recapitulating the effect of stem cells are discussed, elucidating how and why these vesicles could provide novel opportunities for ALS treatment.

AB  - Musical hallucinations (MH) have been labeled Oliver Sacks syndrome, and in the majority of cases, they occur in the context of a hearing loss. In these instances, they have been described as auditory Charles Bonnet syndrome because they are thought to represent a cortical release phenomenon. Patients with MH tend to have intact reality testing, and as such, the condition may also be described as musical hallucinosis. The temporal course of MH is variable, but given that they may improve or remit with time, education on their benign nature is often sufficient. MH also may improve when hearing loss is reversed. The use of ambient noise potentially ameliorates mild to moderate MH; however, where this is insufficient, somatic treatments may be considered. Case reports have documented successful use of low-dose antiepileptics, atypical antipsychotics and donepezil. We present a case of a 52-year-old man who received only partial relief from serial treatment with several psychotropic agents. He developed major depression with suicidal ideation in the context of persistent, intrusive MH that were refractory to several medication trials, and whereas a course of electroconvulsive therapy led to remission of depressive and suicidal symptoms, it provided only transient relief of his MH. In this article, we also provide a review of the literature on the neurobiology and treatment of MH. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - primacy of believing
AB  - In his latest book, Jesus and Philosophy, Don Cupitt looks for a "reform and renewal of Christianity." He envisages this transformation by means of a recognition of the emotive foundation of ethics, a recognition which ousts a traditional moral realism. Examination of the teaching of Jesus reveals that he also evoked the emotive humanitarian nature of ethics over against a rigid divine law. Ethics, like Christianity, should be understood horizontally, rather than vertically. On this basis Jesus looked for a new world-order, based on an extravagant love. There is much to be said for Cupitt's demythologising of a metaphysical religion, particularly in the light of the recent scientific appreciation and development of Darwin's work. There is merit also in Cupitt's stress on the prophetic message, present in the teaching of Jesus, that knowledge of God is synonymous with love of the neighbour. However, his central thesis is damaged by a confusing epistemology, which fails to explain how an ethic of extravagant love can be derived merely from feeling, and by an uprooting of Jesus from his place in first-century Judaism and locating him in a post Enlightenment sceptical modernity.
   Cupitt's secular transcendence offers us the vision of a "secular Jesus" promoting a "quite new moral world." However this important idea is undermined by a lack of clarity concerning the ethical transcendence, and an autonomous ethic which is compromised by reliance upon an eccentric interpretation of Jesus.

AB  - In this review we explore the clinical and scientific status of categorical models of childhood disorder. Three themes are developed. First, the practical origins of standardised category-based diagnostic schemes are examined along with their contemporary philosophical and psychological significance. Next, the impact that these systems have had on the science of child psychopathology is explored. We look at their link to the medical model and the assumption that childhood disorders are categorical, endogenous, and dysfunctional in nature. We argue that these assumptions underpin the dominant paradigm in child psychopathology and so constrain empirical study and theory development. In the final section, the different ways in which researchers have responded to this link and its impact on science are presented. We present the sort of scientific realism associated with Meehl (1995) as the most appropriate basis for a philosophically respectable child psychopathology. Following this approach means unpacking the paradigmatic assumptions, including the assumption of the categorical structure of disorder, into hypotheses that are then put to empirical test. The sorts of data that would allow us to test the categorical hypothesis are identified. We conclude by discussing the results from three recent studies using behaviour genetic analysis of twin data that, in fact, lead us toward a rejection of this hypothesis. The implications for diagnostic and clinical practice of such a rejection are discussed.

AB  - While it has been suggested that loving kindness meditation (LKM) is an effective practice for promoting positive emotions, the empirical evidence in the literature remains unclear. Here, we provide a systematic review of 24 empirical studies (N = 1759) on LKM with self-reported positive emotions. The effect of LKM on positive emotions was estimated with meta analysis, and the influence of variations across LKM interventions was further explored with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. The meta-analysis showed that (1) medium effect sizes for LKM interventions on daily positive emotions in both wait-list controlled RCTs and non-ROT studies; and (2) small to large effect sizes for the on going practice of LKM on immediate positive emotions across different comparisons. Further analysis showed that (1) interventions focused on loving-kindness had medium effect size, but interventions focused on compassion showed small effect sizes; (2) the length of interventions and the time spent on meditation did not influence the effect sizes, but the studies without didactic components in interventions had small effect sizes. A few individual studies reported that the nature of positive emotions and individual differences also influenced the results. In sum, LKM practice and interventions are effective in enhancing positive emotions, but more studies are needed to identify the active components of the interventions, to compare different psychological operations, and to explore the applicability in clinical populations.

AB  - Background: Depression and pain are both burdensome ailments that affect a major proportion of the population. It is evident that depression and pain frequently coexist, with treatment and outcome implications.
   Objective: To review the literature on the nature, prevalence and co-morbidity of depression and pain, the biological and psychological mechanisms involved and treatment options, thus presenting a broad overview of the current information available.
   Methods: Relevant sources were identified from PubMed and Medline databases using a combination of keywords including depression, pain, prevalence, co-morbidity, biological and psychological mechanisms, serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, amygdala, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), antidepressant and psychological therapy.
   Results: It is evident from the research that depression and pain are common co-morbidities. Pain as a physical symptom of depression affects approximately 65% of patients, leading to less favourable outcomes and greater health care utilization. Moreover, depression is a common feature in chronic pain patients and can affect pain threshold and tolerance. Evidence from biological and psychological studies has revealed mechanisms that link chronic pain to depression. Several classes of anti-depressants and psychological interventions have been used successfully in the treatment of somatic symptoms of depression and for a variety of pain syndromes.
   Conclusions: Pain and depression are linked by overlapping phenomenology, neurobiology and therapy. They are mutually interacting, and the interaction has significant treatment and outcome implications.

AB  - The acute subjective effects of psychedelics are responsive to users' expectations and surroundings (i.e., "set and setting"). Accordingly, a great deal of thought has gone into designing the psychosocial context of psychedelic administration in clinical settings. But what theoretical paradigms inform these considerations about set and setting? Here, we describe several historical, sociological influences on current psychedelic administration in mainstream European and American clinical research settings, including: indigenous practices, new age spirituality from the 1960s, psychodynamic/psychoanalytic approaches, and cognitive-behavioral approaches. We consider each of these paradigms and determine that cognitive-behavioral therapies, including newer branches such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), have the strongest rationale for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy going forward. Our primary reasons for advocating for cognitive-behavioral approaches include, (1) they avoid issues of cultural insensitivity, (2) they make minimal speculative assumptions about the nature of the mind and reality, (3) they have the largest base of empirical support for their safety and effectiveness outside of psychedelic therapy. We then propose several concepts from cognitive-behavioral therapies such as CBT, DBT, and ACT that can usefully inform the preparation, session, and integration phases of psychedelic psychotherapy. Overall, while there are many sources from which psychedelic psychotherapy could draw, we argue that current gold-standard, evidence-based psychotherapeutic paradigms provide the best starting point in terms of safety and efficacy.

AB  - Purpose of review
   This study considers the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a tool for promoting the full social inclusion of people with a mental or intellectual disability.
   Recent findings
   The United Nations Convention has ushered in a new era of discourse that moves beyond a consideration of individual impairments, to focus on the social and environmental barriers that prevent full and effective social participation of people with disabilities. It provides an important social justice framework to guide and integrate disability policy within and across countries. In order to realize its potential, the mental health community must now actively develop a new disability discourse - one that moves beyond the traditional focus on negative protections, such as against forced confinement or coercive treatment, to one that examines the services and supports that are needed to allow people who have a mental illness to become fully functioning members of society. To meet the monitoring requirements of the Convention, the mental health community must actively seek population data to assess the nature of prejudice and discrimination experienced by people with a mental illness. An approach used by Statistics Canada is provided as one such example.
   Summary
   The United Nations Convention is an important roadmap for change, which can be used to shift current mental health discourse from a discussion emphasizing the protection of negative rights, such as from involuntary detention or coerced treatment, to one emphasizing social rights and civic participation.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) etiopathogenesis is still unclear and no effective preventive and treatment measures have been identified. Research has focused on the potential role of neuroinflammation and the Kynurenine pathway; here we review the nature of these interactions. Pre-natal or neonatal infections would induce microglial activation, with secondary consequences on behavior, cognition and neurotransmitter networks. Peripherally, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-brain antibodies have been identified. Increased frequency of autoimmune diseases, allergies, and recurring infections have been demonstrated both in autistic patients and in their relatives. Genetic studies have also identified some important polymorphisms in chromosome loci related to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. The persistence of immune-inflammatory deregulation would lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, creating a self-sustaining cytotoxic loop. Chronic inflammation activates the Kynurenine pathway with an increase in neurotoxic metabolites and excitotoxicity, causing long-term changes in the glutamatergic system, trophic support and synaptic function. Furthermore, overactivation of the Kynurenine branch induces depletion of melatonin and serotonin, worsening ASD symptoms. Thus, in genetically predisposed subjects, aberrant neurodevelopment may derive from a complex interplay between inflammatory processes, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and Kynurenine pathway overexpression. To validate this hypothesis a new translational research approach is necessary.

AB  - Ageing is the main risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanisms connecting ageing to this disease remain incompletely understood. In this Review, Saez-Atienzar and Masliah examine whether cellular senescence may have a role in linking ageing and AD.
   Globally, 50 million people live with dementia, with Alzheimer disease (AD) being responsible for two-thirds of the total cases. As ageing is the main risk factor for dementia-related neurodegeneration, changes in the timing or nature of the cellular hallmarks of normal ageing might be key to understanding the events that convert normal ageing into neurodegeneration. Cellular senescence is a candidate mechanism that might be important for this conversion. Under persistent stress, as occurs in ageing, both postmitotic cells - including neurons - and proliferative cells - such as astrocytes and microglia, among others - can engender a state of chronic cellular senescence that is characterized by the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules that promote the functional decline of tissues and organs. Ablation of senescent cells has been postulated as a promising therapeutic venue to target the ageing phenotype and, thus, prevent or mitigate ageing-related diseases. However, owing to a lack of evidence, it is not possible to label cellular senescence as a cause or a consequence of neurodegeneration. This Review examines cellular senescence in the context of ageing and AD, and discusses which of the processes - cellular senescence or AD - might come first.

AB  - Urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine; it affects millions of people worldwide, causing significant detrimental effects on their quality of life. Direct expenses, such as containment products, long-term drug prescriptions and surgery, complemented by indirect costs, such as reduced employment productivity, result in overall expenditure running to billions of dollars. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) occurs on physical exertion, and results from weakness of the bladder outlet. Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) results from inability to resist a sudden compelling desire to pass urine, arising as a consequence of bladder dysfunction. Clinical evaluation clarifies the underlying mechanisms and excludes diseases causing similar symptoms. Urodynamic studies to measure bladder and abdominal pressures and deduce the bladder and outlet function are undertaken when invasive treatments are being considered or when the nature of the incontinence is not entirely clear. Initial management of SUI involves pelvic floor muscle exercise training; if insufficient symptom improvement results, surgical measures are needed. UUI treatment commences with advice on suitable fluid intake and measures to improve ability to defer voiding, followed by antimuscarinic drugs. Refractory UUI is a difficult problem, currently managed with a range of surgical interventions, including bladder injections of botulinum-A neurotoxin, augmentation cystoplasty and nerve stimulation methods. New treatment options are needed, because of the risk of impeding voiding function, resulting in urinary retention. Persistent leakage is controlled with containment products, such as pads, or collection devices, such as catheters. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Huntington's disease is an inherited autosomal dominant trait neuro-degenerative disorder caused by changes (mutations) of a gene called huntingtin (htt) that is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 4, CAG expansion mutation. It is characterized by unusual movements, cognitive and psychiatric disorders. Objective: This review was undertaken to apprehend biological pathways of Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis and its management by nature-derived products. Natural products can be lucrative for the management of HD as it shows protection against HD in pre-clinical trials. Advanced research is still required to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of the known organic products and their isolated compounds in HD experimental models. Summary: Degeneration of neurons in Huntington's disease is distinguished by progressive loss of motor coordination and muscle function. This is due to the expansion of CAG trinucleotide in the first exon of the htt gene responsible for neuronal death and neuronal network degeneration in the brain. It is believed that the factors such as molecular genetics, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroglia dysfunction, protein aggregation, and altered UPS leads to HD. The defensive effect of the natural product provides therapeutic efficacy against HD. Recent reports on natural drugs have enlightened the protective role against HD via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and neurofunctional regulation.

AB  - With the numerous failures of pharmaceuticals to treat traumatic brain injury in humans, more researchers have become interested in combination therapies. This is largely due to the multimodal nature of damage from injury, which causes excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, edema, neuroinflammation and cell death. Polydrug treatments have the potential to target multiple aspects of the secondary injury cascade, while many previous therapies focused on one particular aspect. Of specific note are vitamins, minerals and nutrients that can be utilized to supplement other therapies. Many of these have low toxicity, are already FDA approved and have minimal interactions with other drugs, making them attractive targets for therapeutics. Over the past 20 years, interest in supplementation and supraphysiologic dosing of nutrients for brain injury has increased and indeed many vitamins and nutrients now have a considerable body of the literature backing their use. Here, we review several of the prominent therapies in the category of nutraceutical treatment for brain injury in experimental models, including vitamins (B2, B3, B6, B9, C, D, E), herbs and traditional medicines (ginseng, Gingko biloba), flavonoids, and other nutrients (magnesium, zinc, carnitine, omega-3 fatty acids). While there is still much work to be done, several of these have strong potential for clinical therapies, particularly with regard to polydrug regimens.

AB  - Context: The rapid growth of psychiatric disorders requires psychiatric consultations to be provided on a greater scale, particularly for hospitalized patients.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent of psychiatric consultation requests in general hospitals and to identify potential gaps in the literature.
   Evidence Acquisition: This scoping review was based on relevant research published in Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane (1977-Dec 2019). The collected literature was closely examined prior to selecting the applicable studies by means of peer review. Data were summarized within a framework of themes comprised of psychiatric consultation, prevalence of psychiatric disorders, hospital departments, diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, and nature of research prior to theoretical classification and tabulation.
   Results: Ultimately, 22 studies were included in this scoping review. Requests for psychiatric consultations were highest in Austria and Italy, with 22.6% and 13.6% of cases, respectively. The majority of requests were from internal and surgical departments. Consultations were requested more frequently for female patients compared to male patients. mood disorders and substance use disorder were the most diagnostic reports.
   Conclusions: Taking into consideration the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients suffering from physical illnesses, the referral rate results were considerably low. Although the frequency of psychiatric consultation reports vary widely between countries. As we limited the review to articles written in English, this may be due to selection bias. In this review, we identified that methodological differences and the use of different diagnostic criteria are major gaps that limit a definitive statistical comparison between studies.

AB  - Higher plants are recognized as excellent genetic models to detect cytogenetic and mutagenic agents and are frequently used in environmental monitoring studies. Vicia faba (V. faba) bioassay have been used to study DNA damages i.e., chromosomal and nuclear aberrations induced by metallic compounds, pesticides, complex mixtures, petroleum derivates, toxins, nanoparticles and industrial effluents. The main advantages of using V. faba is its availability round the year, economical to use, easy to grow and handle; its use does not require sterile conditions, rate of cell division is fast, chromosomes are easy to score, less expensive and more sensitive as compared to other short-term tests that require pre-preparations. The V. faba test offers evaluation of different endpoints and tested agents can be classified as cyto toxic/genotoxicimutagenic. This test also provides understanding about mechanism of action, whether the tested agent is clastogenic or aneugenic in nature. In view of advantages offered by V. faba test system, it is used extensively to assess toxic agents and has been emerged as an important bioassay for ecotoxicological studies. Based on the applications of V. faba test to assess the environmental quality, this article offers an overview of this test system and its efficiency in assessing the cytogenetic and mutagenic agents in different classes of the environmental concerns.

AB  - This paper provides a review of a systematic micro-Raman scattering study on various lead- and barium-based ABO(3) perovskites (A = Pb, La, Ba, Sr, Ce, Gd, Nd and B = Ti, Zr), Aurivillius-type Bi-layered compounds (SrBi2Ta2O9, Bi4Ti3O12) and their solid solutions useful in a broad range of device applications. Various factors that influence the material properties such as particle size, stresses, stoichiometry, compositional homogeneity and their effects on phase transition were investigated. The processing conditions, A- and B-site substitution, size-dependent Raman spectra and the structure-property correlations are discussed in the bulk, thin film and nano-crystalline forms of these materials. A film thickness dependence stress study on lead titanate (PT) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films indicated that the nature of stress depends strongly on the lattice parameters of the film and substrate. The size effect was found to decrease the ferroelectric transition temperature in lead-based perovskite materials. Both ionic charge and radii induced changes in the Raman spectra of A- and B-site substituted perovskites and layered compounds were studied. A-site substitution in strontium bismuth tantalite (SBT) was found to induce a relatively linear variation of transition temperature compared with the B-site substituted SBT. Raman spectra of layered compounds and their solid solutions exhibited a strong dependence on dopants resulting in structural modifications. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives:
   Physicians and other mental health experts are increasingly called on to assist the courts with the determination of testamentary capacity. We aim to improve the understanding of the retrospective assessment of testamentary capacity for medical experts in order to provide more useful reports for the court's determinations and to provide a methodology for the retrospective assessment of testamentary capacity.
   Method:
   Medical experts with experience in the retrospective assessment of testamentary capacity collaborated with lawyers who practice estate litigation. The medical literature on the assessment of testamentary capacity was reviewed and integrated. The medical experts provided a clinical perspective, while the lawyers ensured that the case law and legal perspective were integrated into this review.
   Results:
   The focus and limitations of the medical expert are outlined including the need to be objective, nonpartisan, and fair. For the benefit of the court, the medical expert should describe the nature and severity of relevant medical, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders, and how they may impact on the specific criteria for testamentary capacity as defined by the leading case of Banks v Goodfellow. Medical experts should opine only on the issue of vulnerability to influence and defer to the court to determine the facts of the case regarding any influence that may have been exerted.
   Conclusions:
   Although the ultimate determination of testamentary capacity is a legal one, medical experts can help the court achieve the most informed legal decision by providing relevant information on clinical issues that may impact the criteria for testamentary capacity.

AB  - Presenilin 1 (PS1) is a catalytic component of the gamma-secretase complex, responsible for the intramembraneous cleavage of more than 90 type I transmembrane proteins, including Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related amyloid precursor protein (APP). The gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of the APP C-terminal membrane stub leads to the production of various amyloid beta (A beta) species. The assembly of A beta into neurotoxic oligomers, which causes synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration, is influenced by the relative ratio of the longer (A beta 42/43) to shorter A beta (A beta 40) peptides. The ratio of A beta 42 to A beta 40 depends on the conformation and activity of the PS1/gamma-secretase enzymatic complex. The latter exists in a dynamic equilibrium of the so called "closed" and "open" conformational states, as determined by the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based PS1 conformation assay. Here we review several factors that can allosterically influence conformational status of the enzyme, and hence the production of A beta peptides. These include genetic variations in PS1, APP and other gamma-secretase components, environmental stressors implicated in AD pathogenesis and pharmacological agents. Since "closed" PS1 conformation is the common outcome of many AD-related insults, the novel assays monitoring PS1 conformation in live/intact cells in vivo and in vitro might be utilized for diagnostic purposes and for validation of the potential therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The plus-maze apparatus figured prominently in the historical debate between cognitive and stimulus-response habit learning theorists concerned with the fundamental question of "what" animals learn. An important feature of this task is that variants of the training procedure can be arranged to allow for an assessment of the relative use of cognitive/place or habit/response learning mechanisms. This brief review describes findings from several neurobiological studies published primarily over the past decade that have re-introduced the plus-maze to investigate the role of the dorsal striatum in learning and memory. Converging evidence from research using brain lesion, pharmacological, and molecular/genetic approaches is described supporting the hypothesis that the dorsolateral striatum plays a selective role in response learning in the plus-maze. Within a multiple systems framework of memory organization, factors that can influence the relative use of place and response learning in the plus-maze are also considered, including the nature of the visual environment, reinforcement/training parameters, and emotional state of the organism. Response learning in the plus-maze may be considered an exemplar task useful for investigating the neurobiological bases of dorsal striatal involvement in habit learning and memory. This mnemonic function of the dorsal striatum generalizes across several sensory modalities and mammalian species, including humans. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Early immunotherapy administration improves outcomes in patients with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-antibody encephalitis. As most patients with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis present to psychiatrists, the psychopathology of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis needs to be clearly defined to encourage accurate clinical identification and prompt treatment.
   Methods For this systematic review, we searched PubMed for all studies published in English between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 7, 2017, to identify individually reported adult patients (>= 18 years) who satisfied consensus criteria for definite NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. After generating a list of 50 fine-grained, lower-level features, we extracted psychopathological data in addition to demographic and aetiological data. The lower-level features were later ordered within higher-level categories. As a means of quality control, we filtered the data according to proxy markers of psychiatric involvement in their description. Subsequently, we compared lower-level features from individual patient data with operationalised psychiatric syndromes using a constrained combination approach and principal component analysis, and did a network analysis to explore the inter-relationships between multiple lower-level features. The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017068981.
   Findings Of 1096 records identified in PubMed, 333 satisfied inclusion criteria and described 1100 patients in total with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. The psychopathology of 505 (46%) patients with reported psychiatric symptoms was described in more detailed terms than only psychiatric or behavioural. 464 (91%) of the 505 patients were from papers in which patient data were reported individually. The remainder of the analyses focused exclusively on these 464 patients. Median age was 27 years (IQR 22-34), 368 (79%) of 464 patients were female and in 147 (32%), NMDAR-antibody encephalitis was associated with ovarian teratoma. The five higher-level categories into which the 464 patients most frequently grouped were behaviour (316 [68%]), psychosis (310 [67%]), mood (219 [47%]), catatonia (137 [30%]), and sleep disturbance (97 [21%]). The overall pattern of lower-level features was statistically stable across subgroups classified by age, sex, pregnancy association, presence of ovarian teratoma, prior herpes simplex virus encephalitis, and isolated psychiatric presentations (two-way ANOVA p=0.6-0.9). Constrained combination and principal component analyses found that mixtures of mood and psychosis syndromes fit each patient better than any single diagnosis alone, particularly for the patients in the psychiatric-described subgroup (mean Delta Akaike information criterion -0.04 in non-psychiatric-described subgroup vs 0.61 in psychiatric described subgroup). The overlapping nature of the higher-level features was also enriched upon analysis of the psychiatric-described data (221 [67%] of 329 overlaps in non-psychiatric-described subgroup vs 96 [81%] of 118 overlaps in psychiatric-described subgroup, p=0.0052). Network analysis confirmed that the features were closely related and consistent between individual patients; the psychiatric-described subgroup had a markedly high and narrow range of closeness centralities (92% above 0.93 in psychiatric-described subgroup vs 51% above 0.93 in the non-psychiatric group).
   Interpretation The distinctive aspect of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis psychopathology is complexity; core aspects of mood and psychotic disorders consistently coexist within individual patients. Alongside the predominant young female demographic, these psychopathological features could help psychiatrists identify patients who would benefit from cerebrospinal fluid testing and immunotherapies. Well-controlled prospective studies with bespoke inventories are needed to advance this clinically grounded approach. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Mental disorders are a leading cause of distress and disability worldwide. To meet patient demand, there is a need for increased access to high-quality, evidence-based mental health care. Telehealth has become well established in the treatment of illnesses, including mental health conditions.
   Objective: This study aims to conduct a robust evidence synthesis to assess whether there is evidence of differences between telehealth and face-to-face care for the management of less common mental and physical health conditions requiring psychotherapy.
   Methods: In this systematic review, we included randomized controlled trials comparing telehealth (telephone, video, or both) versus the face-to-face delivery of psychotherapy for less common mental health conditions and physical health conditions requiring psychotherapy. The psychotherapy delivered had to be comparable between the telehealth and face-to-face groups, and it had to be delivered by general practitioners, primary care nurses, or allied health staff (such as psychologists and counselors). Patient (symptom severity, overall improvement in psychological symptoms, and function), process (working alliance and client satisfaction), and financial (cost) outcomes were included.
   Results: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials were included, with 931 patients in aggregate; therapies included cognitive behavioral and family therapies delivered in populations encompassing addiction disorders, eating disorders, childhood mental health problems, and chronic conditions. Telehealth was delivered by video in 7 trials, by telephone in 3 trials, and by both in 1 trial, and the delivery mode was unclear in 1 trial. The risk of bias for the 12 trials was low or unclear for most domains, except for the lack of the blinding of participants, owing to the nature of the comparison. There were no significant differences in symptom severity between telehealth and face-to-face therapy immediately after treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.05, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.27) or at any other follow-up time point. Similarly, there were no significant differences immediately after treatment between telehealth and face-to-face care delivery on any of the other outcomes meta-analyzed, including overall improvement (SMD 0.00, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.39), function (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.42), working alliance client (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.57), working alliance therapist (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.91 to 0.59), and client satisfaction (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.53), or at any other time point (3, 6, and 12 months).
   Conclusions: With regard to effectively treating less common mental health conditions and physical conditions requiring psychological support, there is insufficient evidence of a difference between psychotherapy delivered via telehealth and the same therapy delivered face-to-face. However, there was no includable evidence in this review for some serious mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, and further high-quality research is needed to determine whether telehealth is a viable, equivalent treatment option for these conditions.

AB  - Faces are among the most important visual stimuli we perceive, informing us not only about a person's identity, but also about their mood, sex, age and direction of gaze. The ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interactions and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors. Considerable evidence from behavioural, neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations supports the hypothesis that humans have specialized cognitive and neural mechanisms dedicated to the perception of faces (the face-specificity hypothesis). Here, we review the literature on a region of the human brain that appears to play a key role in face perception, known as the fusiform face area (FFA).
   Section 1 outlines the theoretical background for much of this work. The face-specificity hypothesis falls squarely on one side of a longstanding debate in the fields of cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience concerning the extent to which the mind/brain is composed of: (i) special- purpose ('domain-specific') mechanisms, each dedicated to processing a specific kind of information (e. g. faces, according to the face-specificity hypothesis), versus (ii) general-purpose ('domain-general') mechanisms, each capable of operating on any kind of information. Face perception has long served both as one of the prime candidates of a domain-specific process and as a key target for attack by proponents of domain-general theories of brain and mind. Section 2 briefly reviews the prior literature on face perception from behaviour and neurophysiology. This work supports the face-specificity hypothesis and argues against its domain-general alternatives (the individuation hypothesis, the expertise hypothesis and others).
   Section 3 outlines the more recent evidence on this debate from brain imaging, focusing particularly on the FFA. We review the evidence that the FFA is selectively engaged in face perception, by addressing (and rebutting) five of the most widely discussed alternatives to this hypothesis. In closed integral 4, we consider recent findings that are beginning to provide clues into the computations conducted in the FFA and the nature of the representations the FFA extracts from faces. We argue that the FFA is engaged both in detecting faces and in extracting the necessary perceptual information to recognize them, and that the properties of the FFA mirror previously identified behavioural signatures of face-specific processing (e. g. the face-inversion effect).
   Section 5 asks how the computations and representations in the FFA differ from those occurring in other nearby regions of cortex that respond strongly to faces and objects. The evidence indicates clear functional dissociations between these regions, demonstrating that the FFA shows not only functional specificity but also area specificity. We end by speculating in closed integral 6 on some of the broader questions raised by current research on the FFA, including the developmental origins of this region and the question of whether faces are unique versus whether similarly specialized mechanisms also exist for other domains of high-level perception and cognition.

AB  - Phenotypic trade-offs are inevitable in nature, but the mechanisms driving them are poorly understood. Movement and oxygen are essential to all animals, and as such, the common ancestor to all living animals passed on mechanisms to acquire oxygen and contract muscle, sometimes at the expense of other activities or expression of traits. Nevertheless, convergent pathways have also evolved to deal with critical trade-offs that are necessary to survive ubiquitous environmental challenges. We discuss how whole-animal performance traits, such as locomotion, are important to fitness, yet costly, resulting in trade-offs with other aspects of the phenotype via specific conserved and convergent mechanistic pathways across all animals. Specifically, we discuss conserved pathways involved in muscle structure and signaling, insulin/insulin-like signaling, sirtuins, mitochondria and hypoxia-inducible factors, as well as convergent pathways involved in energy regulation, development, reproductive investment and energy storage. The details of these mechanisms are only known from a few model systems, and more comparative studies are needed. We make two main recommendations as a framework for future studies of animal form and function. First, studies of performance should consider the broader life-history context of the organism, and vice versa, as performance expression can require a large portion of acquired resources. Second, studies of life histories or mechanistic pathways that measure performance should do so in meaningful and standardized ways. Understanding proximate mechanisms of phenotypic trade-offs will not only better explain the phenotypes of the organisms we study, but also allow predictions about phenotypic variation at the evolutionary scale.

AB  - Projections show that Earth's climate will continue to warm concurrent with increases in the percentage of the world's elderly population. With an understanding that the body's resilience to the heat degrades as it ages, these coupled phenomena point to serious concerns of heat-related mortality in growing elderly populations. As many of the people in this age cohort choose to live in managed long-term care facilities, it's imperative that outdoor spaces of these communities be made thermally comfortable so that connections with nature and the promotion of non-sedentary activities are maintained. Studies have shown that simply being outside has a positive impact on a broad range of the psychosocial well-being of older adults. However, these spaces must be designed to afford accessibility, safety, and aesthetically pleasing experiences so that they are taken full advantage of. Here, we employ an integrative review to link ideas from the disciplines of climate science, health and physiology, and landscape architecture to explain the connections between heat, increased morbidity and mortality in aging adults, existing gaps in thermal comfort models, and key strategies in the development of useable, comfortable outdoor spaces for older adults. Integrative reviews allow for new frameworks or perspectives on a subject to be introduced. Uncovering the synergy of these three knowledge bases can contribute to guiding microclimatic research, design practitioners, and care providers as they seek safe, comfortable and inviting outdoor spaces for aging adults.

AB  - Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder related to the systemic deposition of mutated transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils, particularly in peripheral nervous system (PNS). TTR fibrils are diffusely distributed in the PNS of FAP patients, involving nerve trunks, plexuses and ganglia. In peripheral nerves, amyloid deposits are prominent in the endoneurium. near blood vessels, Schwann cells and collagen fibrils. Fiber degeneration is axonal, beginning in the unmyelinated and low diameter myelinated fibers. Several hypotheses have been raised to explain axonal and neuronal loss: (i) compression of the nervous tissue by amyloid; however, a cause-effect relationship between amyloid deposition, structural nerve changes and degeneration was never clearly made; (ii) role of nerve ischemia secondary to lesions caused by perivascular amyloid, which is also doubtful as compromised blood flow was never demonstrated; (iii) lesions in the dorsal root ganglia neurons or Schwann cells. Recently, evidence for the presence of toxic non-fibrillar TTR aggregates early in FAP nerves constituted a first step to unravel molecular signaling related to neurodegeneration in FAR The toxic nature of TTR non-fibrillar aggregates, and not mature TTR fibrils, was evidenced by their ability to induce the expression of oxidative stress and inflammation-related molecules in neuronal cells, driving them into apoptotic pathways. How these TTR aggregates exert their effects is debatable: interaction with cellular receptors, namely, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), is a probable candidate mechanism. The pathology and the yet unknown molecular signaling mechanisms responsible for neurodegeneration in FAP are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This rapid systematic review describes violence and health outcomes among child domestic workers (CDWs) taken from 17 studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Our analysis estimated the median reported rates of violence in CDWs aged 5-17-year-olds to be 56.2% (emotional; range: 13-92%), 18.9% (physical; range: 1.7-71.4%), and 2.2% (sexual; range: 0-62%). Both boys and girls reported emotional abuse and sexual violence with emotional abuse being the most common. In Ethiopia and India, violence was associated with severe physical injuries and sexual insecurity among a third to half of CDWs. CDWs in India and Togo reported lower levels of psycho-social well-being than controls. In India, physical punishment was correlated with poor psycho-social well-being of CDWs [OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 3.2-4; p < 0.0001]. Across the studies, between 7% and 68% of CDWs reported work-related illness and injuries, and one third to half had received no medical treatment. On average, children worked between 9 and 15 h per day with no rest days. Findings highlight that many CDWs are exposed to abuse and other health hazards but that conditions vary substantially by context. Because of the often-hidden nature of child domestic work, future initiatives will need to be specifically designed to reach children in private households. Young workers will also benefit from strategies to change social norms around the value and vulnerability of children in domestic work and the long-term implications of harm during childhood.

AB  - Theta burst stimulation is increasingly growing in popularity as a non-invasive method of moderating corticospinal networks. Theta burst stimulation uses gamma frequency trains applied at the rhythm of theta, thus, mimicking theta-gamma coupling involved in cognitive processes. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been found to play a crucial role in numerous cognitive processes. Here, we include 25 studies for review to determine the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 20 of these studies are healthy participant and five are patient (pharmacotherapy-resistant depression) studies. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the included studies, only a descriptive approach is used and meta-analytics ruled out. The cognitive effect is measured on various cognitive domains: attention, working memory, planning, language, decision making, executive function, and inhibitory and cognitive control. We conclude that continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mainly inhibits cognitive performance. However, in some instances, it can lead to improved performance by inhibiting the effect of distractors or other competing irrelevant cognitive processes. To be precise, continuous theta burst stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired attention, inhibitory control, planning, and goal-directed behavior in decision making but also improved decision making by reducing impulsivity. Conversely, continuous theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired executive function, working, auditory feedback regulation, and cognitive control but accelerated the planning, decision-making process. These findings constitute a useful contribution to the literature on the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Lipid peroxidation can be broadly defined as the process of inserting a hydroperoxy group into a lipid. Polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the phospholipids are often the targets for peroxidation. Phospholipids are indispensable for normal structure of membranes. The other important function of phospholipids stems from their role as a source of lipid mediators - oxygenated free fatty acids that are derived from lipid peroxidation. In the CNS, excessive accumulation of either oxidized phospholipids or oxygenated free fatty acids may be associated with damage occurring during acute brain injury and subsequent inflammatory responses. There is a growing body of evidence that lipid peroxidation occurs after severe traumatic brain injury in humans and correlates with the injury severity and mortality. Identification of the products and sources of lipid peroxidation and its enzymatic or non-enzymatic nature is essential for the design of mechanism-based therapies. Recent progress in mass spectrometry-based lipidomics/oxidative lipidomics offers remarkable opportunities for quantitative characterization of lipid peroxidation products, providing guidance for targeted development of specific therapeutic modalities. In this review, we critically evaluate previous attempts to use non-specific antioxidants as neuroprotectors and emphasize new approaches based on recent breakthroughs in understanding of enzymatic mechanisms of lipid peroxidation associated with specific death pathways, particularly apoptosis. We also emphasize the role of different phospholipases (calcium-dependent and -independent) in hydrolysis of peroxidized phospholipids and generation of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators.

AB  - Exercise has been shown to facilitate the release of molecules that support neuroplasticity and to offer protection from brain damage. This article addresses the mechanisms behind exercise's beneficial effects within the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI). First, we describe how ongoing metabolic, neuroendocrine and inflammatory alterations after TBI interact with exercise. Given the dynamic nature of TBI-initiated pathophysiological processes, the timing, intensity and type of exercise need to be considered when implementing exercise. These factors have been shown to be important in determining whether exercise enhances or impedes neuroplasticity after TBI. In point of fact, intense exercise during the acute post-injury period has been associated with worsened cognitive performance. Similarly, exercise that is associated with a pronounced increase of stress hormones can inhibit the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor that is usually increased with exercise. Second, we describe the clinical implications of these findings in returning to play following TBI. Finally, we address therapeutic exercise interventions in the context of rehabilitation following TBI. Exercise is likely to play an important role in improving cognitive and affective outcome during post-acute rehabilitation. It is important to take into account relevant patient, injury, and exercise variables when utilizing exercise as a therapeutic intervention to ensure that physical exercise programs promote adaptive neuroplasticity and hence recovery.

AB  - The nature of species at the extremes of their ranges impinges fundamentally on diverse biological issues, including species' range dynamics, population variability, speciation and conservation biology. We review the literature concerning genetic and ecological variation at species' range edges, and discuss historical and contemporary forces that may generate observed trends, as well as their current and future implications. We discuss literature which shows how environmental, ecological and evolutionary factors act to limit species' ranges, and how these factors impose selection for adaptation or dispersal in peripheral populations exposed to extreme and stochastic biotic and abiotic stressors. When conditions are sufficiently harsh such that local extinction is certain, peripheral populations may represent temporary offshoots from stable core populations. However, in cases where peripheral populations persist at the range edge under divergent or extreme conditions, biologically significant differences can arise from historical and contemporary ecological and evolutionary forces. In many such cases reviewed herein, peripheral populations tended to diverge from the species' core, and to display lower genetic diversity or greater stress-adaptation. We conclude that while such populations may be of particular conservation value as significant components of intraspecific biodiversity or sources of evolutionary innovation and persistence during environmental change, small and greatly variable population size, especially combined with low genetic variability, can result in elevated extinction risk in harsh and stochastic peripheral environments. As a result, while peripheral populations should not be dismissed as evolutionary dead-ends destined for local extinction, neither should they be uncritically granted inherently superior significance based only on their peripheral position alone.

AB  - Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALAD) is involved in the synthesis of haem and exhibits a polymorphic nature. delta-ALAD polymorphism produces two alleles, namely delta-ALAD-1 and delta-ALAD-2, which in turn produce three different phenotypes, namely delta-ALAD1-1, delta-ALAD1-2, and delta-ALAD2-2. delta-ALAD gene is more susceptible to lead (Pb) toxicity than any other genes. Its genotype and phenotype frequencies change with respect to different geographical areas and extent of Pb exposure. The delta-ALAD-2 allele dominancy is linked with high concentration of lead in the body. It has also been thought that the delta-ALAD-2 allele can provoke Pb toxicity by producing a protein that binds more tightly with Pb than delta-ALAD-1 protein. However, few evidences suggest that delta-ALAD-2 may reduce harmful effects by increasing excretion of Pb from the body, thus producing its unavailability towards pathophysiologic alterations. However, the recent evidences have supported that the individuals who are heterozygote for the delta-ALAD-1 allele may be associated with a higher risk of long-term Pb toxicity. In this regard, the individuals who are exposed at occupational levels are among the most frequent study population. The main objective of our study was to explore the gene susceptibility associated with Pb poisoning. Moreover, this study also summarizes various sources of Pb exposure and thereafter outlined multiple strategies to minimize the Pb toxicity in order to save the exposed residential communities.

AB  - There is an emerging consensus that spatial thinking plays a fundamental role in how people conceive, express, and perform mathematics. However, the underlying nature of this relationship remains elusive. Questions remain as to how, why, and under what conditions spatial skills and mathematics are linked. This review paper addresses this gap. Through a review and synthesis of research in psychology, neuroscience, and education, we examine plausible mechanistic accounts for the oft-reported close, and potentially causal, relations between spatial and mathematical thought. More specifically, this review targets candidate mechanisms that link spatial visualization skills and basic numerical competencies. The four explanatory accounts we describe and critique include the: (1)Spatial representation of numbers account, (2)shared neural processing account, (3)spatial modelling account, and (4)working memory account. We propose that these mechanisms do not operate in isolation from one another, but in concert with one another to give rise to spatial-numerical associations. Moving from the theoretical to the practical, we end our review by considering the extent to which spatial visualization abilities are malleable and transferrable to numerical reasoning. Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a more coherent and mechanistic account of spatial-numerical relations in the hope that this information may (1) afford new insights into the uniquely human ability to learn, perform, and invent abstract mathematics, and (2) on a more practical level, prove useful in the assessment and design of effective mathematics curricula and intervention moving forward.

AB  - An estimated 25%-32% of veterans of the 1991 Gulf War continue to experience multiple unexplained health problems known as Gulf War Illness (GWI). GWI encompasses chronic pain, musculoskeletal weakness, headache, fatigue, cognitive deficits, alterations in mood, and numerous multi-system complaints. Most potential exposures implicated in GWI were not well documented but included varying levels of several neurotoxicants as well as the anticholinergic drug pyridostigmine bromide (PB), which was routinely taken as prophylaxis against the nerve agent soman. While some veterans also took chloroquine as an antimalarial agent, the literature suggests an association between receipt of multiple vaccinations prior to or during the conflict (perhaps combined with other exposures), and GWI. In-theater exposures may account for any single individual veteran's ill health but many veterans of the same era who were not deployed overseas also suffer the same or similar symptoms. The features of GWI also overlap with those of fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple chemical sensitivity, in all of which liver dysfunction has been documented, suggesting a unifying hypothesis. It is proposed that multiple vaccinations, with concurrent or subsequent exposure to PB or additional chemical insults of a liver-damaging nature, plausibly explain the pathogenesis and the observed chronicity of GWI. The suggested mechanism for GWI is thus a chemically-induced impaired liver function, with the spillage of stored vitamin A compounds (retinoids) into the circulation in toxic concentrations, resulting in an endogenous chronic form of hypervitaminosis A. Implications of the hypothesis are briefly reviewed.

AB  - Over the last two decades, the study of the relationship between nature and nurture in shaping human behavior has encountered a renewed interest. Behavioral genetics showed that distinct polymorphisms of genes that code for proteins that control neurotransmitter metabolic and synaptic function are associated with individual vulnerability to aversive experiences, such as stressful and traumatic life events, and may result in an increased risk of developing psychopathologies associated with violence. On the other hand, recent studies indicate that experiencing aversive events modulates gene expression by introducing stable changes to DNA without modifying its sequence, a mechanism known as "epigenetics". For example, experiencing adversities during periods of maximal sensitivity to the environment, such as prenatal life, infancy and early adolescence, may introduce lasting epigenetic marks in genes that affect maturational processes in brain, thus favoring the emergence of dysfunctional behaviors, including exaggerate aggression in adulthood. The present review discusses data from recent research, both in humans and animals, concerning the epigenetic regulation of four genes belonging to the neuroendocrine, serotonergic and oxytocinergic pathways-Nuclear receptor subfamily 3-group C-member 1 (NR3C1), oxytocin receptor (OXTR), solute carrier-family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-and their role in modulating vulnerability to proactive and reactive aggressive behavior. Behavioral genetics and epigenetics are shedding a new light on the fine interaction between genes and environment, by providing a novel tool to understand the molecular events that underlie aggression. Overall, the findings from these studies carry important implications not only for neuroscience, but also for social sciences, including ethics, philosophy and law.

AB  - Hippocrates induced healing (salutogenesis) with the "principle of similarity" - like cures like. The similarity principle has been used in the holistic mind-body medicine developed by the Swedish physician Bengt Stern, which recently has been found highly efficient in improving quality of life and normalizing sense of coherence (estimated NNT=2) without any side effects or adverse events. Stern's therapy mimics the most difficult events in life during role-plays. His unique therapeutic program, "Meet yourself', takes the participant though the most difficult aspects of life, including birth, death, and neurotic and evil human interactions, also of violent and sexual nature. About 4000 patients have now been trough the "fascist exercise" without getting side effects or adverse events (NNH > 4000), This exercise includes the methods of controlled sexual and psychological abuse (level 8 in tools of clinical holistic medicine). Since Freud it has been known that to rehabilitate a patient's health the healing of the patient's sexuality is particularly important. In his therapy Stern has done what Freud could not do for moral reasons hundred years ago: Making the full, painful drama of early life happen again for patients to heal not only their physical, mental disorders and sexual dysfunctions, but their whole life and existence. The therapeutic program is evaluated and found to be ethical and in accordance with the healing principles and traditions of holistic medicine. The healing principles of CAM are used. Stem's "Meet yourself' course is an effective, nonpharmaceutical medicine that does not cause any harm without side effects or adverse events.

AB  - Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are debilitating and chronic in nature, are difficult to treat, and contribute to poor functional outcomes. Motivational deficits are a core negative symptom and may involve alterations in reward processing, which involve subcortical regions such as the basal ganglia. More specifically, dopamine-rich regions like the ventral striatum, have been implicated in these reward-processing deficits. Inflammation is one mechanism that may underlie negative symptoms, and specifically motivational deficits, via the effects of inflammatory cytokines on the basal ganglia. Previous work has demonstrated that inflammatory stimuli decrease neural activity in the ventral striatum and decrease connectivity in reward-relevant neural circuitry. The immune system has been shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be altered in patients with the disorder. This paper reviews the literature on associations between inflammatory markers and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as the role of anti-inflammatory drugs to target negative symptoms. We also review the literature on the role of inflammation and reward processing deficits in both healthy controls and individuals with depression. We use the literature on inflammation and depression as a basis for a model that explores potential mechanisms responsible for inflammation modulating certain aspects of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. This approach may offer novel targets to treat these symptoms of the disorder that are significant barriers to functional recovery and do not respond well to available antipsychotic medications.

AB  - Systems biology and systems neurophysiology generate comprehensive mechanistic models of the spatial-temporal evolution of body system networks from physiological to pathophysiological conditions.
   Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathophysiological alterations converge with overexpressed age-related functional decline, i.e. aging, which is induced by genetic- and stochastic time-dependent events.
   Accumulation of cellular senescence has a casual role in aging-related disease and senotherapeutic drugs have already shown encouraging results for counteracting the detrimental effect of senescence.
   However, the non-linear complex nature of AD pathophysiology calls for a systems-level integration of aging dynamics, from molecules until large-scale networks.
   We need a holistic systems-wide comprehensive model of aging which is constituted by a non-linear spatial-temporal weakening of adaptive responses resulting in the activation of compensatory mechanisms that ensure biological robustness, resilience, and finally preserve homeodynamics.
   After exceeding the threshold of compensated (resilient) aging, a cascade of decompensatory events occurs, ultimately triggering irreversible systems failure that, at some advanced stages, reflect widespread "pathophysiological hallmarks of AD".
   The gap in the comprehensive understanding of aging, resilience, and AD pathophysiological evolution will be filled through a quantitative, flexible, and integrative modeling approach to detect multiple spatial-temporal patterns and for dissecting causal mechanisms and downstream cascades throughout the aging-AD continuum.
   Novel technological and conceptual advances, will enable the systems-level integration of aging signatures as well as compensatory mechanisms that provide resilience to early functional decline. This will provide new systems-scaled outcomes and endpoints to map and therapeutically enhance resilience, accomplishing a long-lasting compensated aging.

AB  - An increasing demand for food together with a growing demand for energy crops result in an increasing demand for and competition over water. Sugar cane, sugar beet and maize are not only essential food crops, but also important feedstock for bio-ethanol. Crop growth requires water, a scarce resource. This study aims to assess the green, blue and grey water footprint (WF) of sweeteners and bio-ethanol from sugar cane, sugar beet and maize in the main producing countries. The WFs of sweeteners and bio-ethanol are mainly determined by the crop type that is used as a source and by agricultural practise and agro-climatic conditions; process water footprints are relatively small. The weighted global average WF of sugar cane is 209 m(3)/tonne: for sugar beet this is 133 m(3)/tonne and for maize 1222 m(3)/tonne. Large regional differences in WFs indicate that WFs of crops for sweeteners and bio-ethanol can be improved. It is more favourable to use maize as a feedstock for sweeteners or bio-ethanol than sugar beet or sugar cane. The WF of sugar cane contributes to water stress in the Indus and Ganges basins. In the Ukraine, the large grey WF of sugar beet contributes to water pollution. In some western European countries, blue WFs of sugar beet and maize need a large amount of available blue water for agriculture. The allocation of the limited global water resources to bio-energy on a large scale will be at the cost of water allocation to food and nature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Delirium is a complex multifactorial neuropsychiatric disease, associated with negative outcomes: increased length of hospital stay, functional and cognitive decline, institutionalization and mortality. It is often poorly recognized due to its fluctuating nature, its overlap with dementia and the lack of valid and specific rating scales in clinical routine. Aim: This study review describes the characteristics and psychometric properties of delirium scales available in research and clinical practice. Methods: The MEDLINE database was used to identify the delirium scales (1990-2010), using keywords: delirium, confusion, severity, questionnaires, scales and screening. Only primary and validation studies were included. The exclusion criteria were children and alcohol or drug delirium assessment scales. Results: This study included seven screening scales (CAM, ICDSC, DSI, NEECHAM, CTD, DOSS, Nu-DESC) and six severity scales (DRS-98-R, MDAS, CSE, DSS, DI, DOM). The psychometric properties of each scale were reported. The majority of scales were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-IV criteria as well as on a review of selected symptoms of delirium informed by systematic clinical observation and formal brief assessment of mental status. Conclusions: The selection of instrument may be dependent on administration time and rater training requirements. However, bearing in mind the recent reviews included, the CAM is considered the most widely used instrument for delirium diagnosis and the DRS-98-R to measure the severity of delirium states. In overall studies these instruments revealed good psychometric properties: sensitivity/specificity (CAM 100-94%/95-90%; DRS-98-R 92%/93%) and interobserver reliability (CAM k=0.81-1; DRS-98-R ICC=0.98-0.99).

AB  - The precise nature and etiopathogenesis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) Continues to elude researchers and clinicians. Yet, increasing evidence from various strands of research converges to suggest that affect dysregulation, impulsivity, and unstable relationships constitute the core feature,,, of BPD. Over the last two decades, the mentalization-based approach to BPD has attempted to provide a theoretically consistent way of conceptualizing the interrelationship between these core features of BPD. with the aim of providing clinicians with a conceptually sound and empirically supported approach to BPD and its treatment. This paper presents an extended version of this approach to BPD based oil recently accumulated data. In Particular, We Suggest that the core features of BPD reflect impairments in different facets of mentalization, each related to impairments in relatively distinct neural circuits underlying these facets. Hence, we provide a comprehensive account of BPD by showing how its core features are related to each other in theoretically meaningful ways. More specifically, we argue that BPD is primarily associated with a low threshold for the activation of the attachment system and deactivation of controlled mentalization. linked to impairments in the ability to differentiate mental states of self and other, which lead to hypersensitivity and increased susceptibility to contagion by other people's mental states, and poor integration of cognitive and affective aspects of mentalization. The combination of these impairments may explain BPD patients' propensity for vicious interpersonal cycles, and their high levels of affect dysregulation and impulsivity. Finally, the implications of this expanded mentalization-based approach to BPD for mentalization-based treatment and treatment of BPD more generally are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: The study presents complications following spinal cord injury (SCI) in relation to aging.
   Views: It is estimated that there are approximately 6 million SCI patients in the world who are struggling with disabilities of the locomotor system of a paraplegic or tetraplegic nature. The effects of aging in a person with SCI are due to age factors related to abnormal health behavior, environmental impact, and the presence of comorbidities and complications. SCI entails numerous complications, the most common including infections of the urinary and respiratory systems, the formation of pressure ulcers, cardiovascular disorders, sleep disorders, depression, muscle atrophy and osteoporosis. In patients who have suffered a SCI, it was found that age-related changes occur as early as 15 years following the injury, much more often than in the healthy population. The incidence of cardiovascular disease, for example, is 200% higher in people after a SCI than in the general population. It should be emphasized that SCI does occur within the young population, although recently there has been a significant increase in SCI in patients over 65, who as an age group are increasingly fit, and get involved in accidents.
   Conclusions: The complications of SCI affect the patient's independence and limit his or her activity and functioning in social, professional and personal life. All this implies an assessment of the life quality of patients after a SCI. Also, the prolonged period of a patient's lack of independence resulting from osteoporosis, sarcopenia or cardiovascular diseases significantly increases the financial burden on the health and social care system.

AB  - Background Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is linked to many chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Among several possible mechanisms are gradual glutathione depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction after chronic exposure to very low doses of POP mixtures. However, it is biologically noteworthy that glutathione status and mitochondrial function is subject to hormesis, defined broadly as mild stress-induced stimulation of cellular protective mechanisms, including increased synthesis of glutathione and promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis. Although high levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS) can cause cellular damage, certain levels of ROS function as signalling molecules to induce hormetic effects. Thus, similar to many other stressors generating ROS, glutathione status and mitochondrial function can be improved at higher POP doses. However, higher POP levels are dangerous despite their hormetic effects due to other adverse phenomena. Also, the persistent nature of POPs can make hormetic effects less effective in humans as hormesis may be the most active with transient stressors. Hormesis-inducing stressors should be placed into three categories for public health purposes: (1) disadvantageous: chemicals like POPs and radiation, that could harm humans by endocrine disruption, action of chemical mixtures and susceptible populations; (2) neutral: cold, heat, and gravity; and (3) advantageous: moderate exercise, phytochemical intake, and calorie restriction. Noting that regulation of POPs, while critical, has provided insufficient protection because POPs persist in human bodies and the food chain, advantageous stressors should be used by the public to mitigate glutathione depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction due to POPs.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of the most widely distributed persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environmental media. PAHs have beenwidely concerned due to their significant health risk and adverse effects to human and animals. Currently, themain sources of PAHs in the environment are the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, aswell as municipal waste incineration and agricultural non-surface source emissions. In this work, the scope of our attention includes 16 typical PAHs themselves without involving their metabolites and industrial by-products. Exposure of human and animals to PAHs can lead to a variety of adverse effects, including carcinogenicity and teratogenicity, genotoxicity, reproductive- and endocrine-disrupting effects, immunotoxicity and neurotoxicity, the type and severity of which depend on a variety of factors. On the other hand, the regulatory effect of microplastics (MPs) on the bio-toxicity and bioaccumulation capacity of PAHs has now gradually attracted attention. We critically reviewed the adsorption capacity and mechanisms of MPs on PAHs as well as the effects of MPs on PAHs toxicity, thus highlighting the importance of paying attention to the joint bio-toxicity caused by PAHs-MPs interactions. In addition, due to the extensive nature of the common exposure pathway of PAHs and ultraviolet ray, an accurate understanding of biological processes exposed to both PAHs and UV light is necessary to develop effective protective strategies. Finally, based on the above critical review, we highlighted the research gaps and pointed out the priority of further studies. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Some Issues of Occupational Health of Health Care Workers in Central Asia (Review)
AB  - Introduction: In the Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for the promotion of decent working conditions for health care workers (HCWs) in all settings. The Central Asian countries (CACs) are low- and middle-income countries with economies past transition and with implemented health care reforms that touch HCWs and occupational health and safety (OHS) at large.
   The aim: of the present article is to highlight some challenges in OHS regulation and to highlight some of the latest studies on biological health risks to HCWs in CACs.
   Materials and methods: The article reviews 18 journal articles in Russian and 3 journal articles in English published since 2004, 3 dissertations, 10 national statistical sources and profiles, and 5 books.
   Results: OHS management systems in CACs are built on the principle of responding to insurance cases, not their prevention. Most labor law standards are declarative in nature because many employers ignore labor protection requirements. There has been no study since 2000 on the working conditions, the physical and chemical health risks or the effects of working conditions, mental and physical loads on the health of HCWs. A few studies were found on work-related infectious diseases (viral hepatitis, HIV and tuberculosis) of HCWs in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. The latest studies showed a high prevalence of viral hepatitis B, C and G and of HIV infection in HCWs in Kyrgyzstan, with much lower rates in Kazakhstan.
   Conclusions: The traditional OHS approach used in soviet times has proven insufficient in CACs with developing market economies. OHS and the health of HCWs in Central Asia is insufficiently studied. The available data indicate a low level of attention to the health of HCWs. Serious studies on OHS in health care settings in this region are needed.

AB  - Clinical evidence and structural neuroimaging studies linked cerebellar deficits to cognitive-related symptoms in schizophrenia. Yet, in functional neuroimaging literature to date, the role of the cerebellum in schizophrenia was not explored in a systematic fashion. Here, we reviewed 234 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies indexed by PubMed and published in 1997-2010 that had at least one group of schizophrenia patients, used blood oxygenation level dependent contrast and the general linear model to assess neuronal activity. We quantified presence/absence of cerebellar findings and the frequency of hypo- and hyperactivations (ie, less or more activity in patients relative to healthy controls). We used peaks of activations reported in these studies to build a topographical representation of group differences on a cerebellar map. Cerebellar activity was reported in patients in 41.02% of the articles, with more than 80% of these dedicated to cognitive, emotional, and executive processes in schizophrenia. Almost two-thirds of group comparisons resulted in cerebellar hypoactivation, with a frequency that presented an inverted U shape across different age categories. The majority of the hypoactivation foci were located in the medial portion of the anterior lobe and the lateral hemispheres (lobules IV-V) of the cerebellum. Even though most experimental manipulations did not target explicitly the cerebellum's functions in schizophrenia, the cerebellar findings are frequent and cerebellar hypoactivations predominant. Therefore, although the cerebellum seems to play an important functional role in schizophrenia, the lack of reporting and interpretation of these data may hamper the full understanding of the disorder.

AB  - Delta (1-4 Hz) EEG power in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep declines massively during adolescence. This observation stimulated the hypothesis that during adolescence the human brain undergoes an extensive reorganization driven by synaptic elimination. The parallel declines in synaptic density, delta wave amplitude and cortical metabolic rate during adolescence further support this model. These late brain changes probably represent the final ontogenetic manifestation of nature's strategy for constructing nervous systems: an initial overproduction of neural elements followed by elimination. Errors in adolescent brain reorganization may cause mental illness; this could explain the typical age of onset of schizophrenia. Longitudinal studies of sleep EEG are enhancing our knowledge of adolescent brain maturation. Our longitudinal study of sleep EEG changes in adolescence showed that delta power, which may reflect frontal cortex maturation, begins its decline between ages 11 and 12 years and falls by 65% by age 17 years. In contrast, NREM theta power begins its decline much earlier. Delta and theta EEG frequencies are important to sleep theory because they behave homeostatically. Surprisingly, these brain changes are unrelated to pubertal maturation but are strongly linked to age. In addition to these (and other) maturational EEG changes, sleep schedules in adolescence change in response to a complex interaction of circadian, social and other influences. Our data demonstrate that the daytime sleepiness that emerges in adolescence is related to the decline in NREM delta as well as to altered sleep schedules. These longitudinal sleep data provide guideposts for studying cognitive and behavioral correlates of adolescent brain reorganization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relationship between psychoanalysis and attachment theory is complex indeed. A brief review of the psychoanalytic literature as it concerns attachment theory and research, and of the attachment literature as it pertains to psychoanalytic ideas, demonstrates an increasing interest in attachment theory within psychoanalysis. Some of the difficulties that attachment theory faces in relation to psychoanalytic ideas are traced to its links to the now dated cognitive science of the 1960s and 1970s. Today, however, a second-generation cognitive neuroscience seeks neurobiologically plausible accounts in which links with brain and body are seen as shaping mind and consciousness, which increasingly are seen as "embodied," as emerging from or serving the needs of a physical being located in a specific time, place, and social context. This idea has also been at the core of much psychoanalytic thinking, which has historically affirmed the rootedness of symbolic thought in sensory, emotional, and enacted experience with objects. Now neurobiological advances supporting the concept of embodied cognition offer an opportunity to forge powerful links between the hitherto separate domains of attachment theory and psychoanalysis. Speculations about the nature of language are presented that emphasize the origin of internal working models (and of representations in general) in early sensorimotor and emotional experiences with a caregiver. It is argued that language and symbolic thought may be phylogenetically and ontogenetically embodied, built on a foundation of gestures and actions, and are thus profoundly influenced by the experience of early physical interaction with the primary object. Finally, the clinical and research implications of these ideas are discussed.

AB  - The problem of explaining the connection between the phenomena of subjective reality and brain processes is usually called the "Hard problem of consciousness". The solution of its main theoretical issues is of great importance for the development of modern neuroscience, especially for such direction as neurocryptology ("Brain-Reading"). From the standpoint of the information approach it is proposed to address these issues, namely: 1) the nature of the connection with brain processes of the phenomena of subjective reality (mental state), 2) their causal ability to control bodily functions; 3) the compatibility of freedom of will with the determinism of brain processes and also 4) the frequently asked question: why is information about the acting agent not just represented, but experienced in the form of subjective reality. The connection between the phenomenon of subjective reality and the corresponding brain process is the relationship between information and its carrier; specific features of this relationship are analyzed. Mental causation is a kind of information causality that differs from ordinary physical causation because information is invariant with respect to the physical properties of its carrier, can be coded in different ways. The author identifies and describes those analytical parameters that must be taken into account in the problems of constructing a model of the code neurodynamic structure of the phenomena of subjective reality. A hypothesis is advanced on the emergence of the very quality of subjective reality in the course of biological evolution. On this basis, the methodological aspects of the problem of deciphering brain neurodynamic code of the phenomena of subjective reality and the prospects of neuroscience studies of consciousness are discussed.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a pleiotropic janus-faced molecule synthesized by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) which plays a critical role in a number of physiological and pathological processes in humans. The physiological roles of NO depend on its local concentrations, as well as its availability and the nature of downstream target molecules. Its double-edged sword action has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders. Excessive NO production, as the evoked by inflammatory signals, has been identified as one of the major causative reasons for the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, excessive NO synthesis under neuroinflammation leads to the formation of reactive nitrogen species and neuronal cell death. There is an intimate relation between microglial activation, NO and neuroinflammation in the human brain. The role of NO in neuroinflammation has been defined in animal models where this neurotransmitter can modulate the inflammatory process acting on key regulatory pathways, such as those associated with excitotoxicity processes induced by glutamate accumulation and microglial activation. Activated glia express inducible NOS and produce NO that triggers calcium mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum, activating the release of vesicular glutamate from astroglial cells resulting in neuronal death. This change in microglia potentially contributes to the increased age-associated susceptibility and neurodegeneration. In the current review, information is provided about the role of NO, glial activation and age related processes in the central nervous system (CNS) that may be helpful in the isolation of new therapeutic targets for aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The nature of consciousness is considered one of science's most perplexing and persistent mysteries. We all know the subjective experience of consciousness, but where does it arise? What is its purpose? What are its full capacities? The assumption within today's neuroscience is that all aspects of consciousness arise solely from interactions among neurons in the brain. However, the origin and mechanisms of qualia (i.e., subjective or phenomenological experience) are not understood. David Chalmers coined the term "the hard problem" to describe the difficulties in elucidating the origins of subjectivity from the point of view of reductive materialism. We propose that the hard problem arises because one or more assumptions within a materialistic worldview are either wrong or incomplete. If consciousness entails more than the activity of neurons, then we can contemplate new ways of thinking about the hard problem. This review examines phenomena that apparently contradict the notion that consciousness is exclusively dependent on brain activity, including phenomena where consciousness appears to extend beyond the physical brain and body in both space and time. The mechanisms underlying these "non-local" properties are vaguely suggestive of quantum entanglement in physics, but how such effects might manifest remains highly speculative. The existence of these non-local effects appears to support the proposal that post-materialistic models of consciousness may be required to break the conceptual impasse presented by the hard problem of consciousness.

AB  - Research in sport pedagogy and its applied recommendations are still characterized by a contrast between the different learning theories from psychology. Traditional theories and their corresponding approaches to the specific case of teaching and learning "how to play [team sports like soccer]" are subject to compatibilities and incompatibilities. We discuss how behaviorism as an approach to teaching the game shows more incompatibilities with the nature of tactical actions when compared to constructivism. As coaches strive to teach the game and make their players and team perform, we argue that teaching the game requires teaching approaches that will help develop their way to play (i.e., tactical behavior) without taking away their autonomy and adaptiveness. The teaching-learning-training process for playing the game should then be conducted to harmonize the characteristics of the contents, the context, and the individual(s) at hand. We provide two illustrated examples and portray how the recommended approaches fit key contents of the game that are observed in the tactical behavior. We finally argue that the coherent design of games provides minimal conditions to teaching approaches, and that such a design should be a priority when elaborating the learning activities along the player development process. As a conclusion, the interactionist theory is the one that best serves the teaching of the game and the development of tactical behavior. We therefore defend that its principles can help coaches tailor their own strategy to teach the game with the many tools.

TI  - How does India Decide Insanity Pleas? A Review of High Court Judgments in the Past Decade
KW  - Criminal liability
KW  - insanity defence
KW  - McNaughton's rules
KW  - mens rea
AB  - Background: The Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) describes how Indian courts have to deal with 'the act of an unsound person'. This study was undertaken with the objectives of estimating the success rate of insanity pleas in Indian High Courts and determining the factors associated with the outcome of such insanity pleas. Materials and Methods: The data was collected from the websites of 23 High Courts of India using the keywords 'insanity' and 'mental illness', and the judgments delivered between 1.1.2007 and 31.08.17 were retrieved. Information regarding the nature of the crime, diagnosis provided by the psychiatrist as an expert witness, documents used to prove mental illness, and the judgment pronounced by the High Court were retrieved. Results: A total of 102 cases were retrieved from 13 High Courts for which data was available. Out of the 102 cases examined, the High Court convicted the accused in 76 cases (74.50%), thereby rejecting the insanity defense. The High Court acquitted the accused under section 84 IPC in 18 cases (17.65%), thereby accepting the insanity plea raised by the accused. Chi-square tests of independence revealed that the verdict of the lower court, documentary evidence of mental illness prior to the crime, and the psychiatrist's opinion were associated with the success of insanity pleas. Conclusion: Insanity pleas had a success rate of about 17% in Indian High Courts in the past decade. The factors associated with success of insanity pleas provide valuable guidance to several stakeholders who are dealing with mentally ill offenders.

AB  - Chenopodium album and C. murale are cosmopolitan, annual weed species of notable economic importance. Their unique biological features, including high reproductive capacity, seed dormancy, high persistence in the soil seed bank, the ability to germinate and grow under a wide range of environmental conditions and abiotic stress tolerance, help these species to infest diverse cropping systems. C. album and C. murale grow tall and absorb nutrients very efficiently. Both these species are allelopathic in nature and, thus, suppress the germination and growth of native vegetation and/or crop plants. These weed species infest many agronomic and horticultural crops and may cause >90% loss in crop yields. C. album is more problematic than C. murale as the former is more widespread and infests more number of crops, and it also acts as an alternate host of several crop pests. Different cultural and mechanical methods have been used to control these weed species with varying degrees of success depending upon the cropping systems and weed infestation levels. Similarly, allelopathy and biological control have also shown some potential, especially in controlling C. album. Several herbicides have been successfully used to control these species, but the evolution of wide-scale herbicide resistance in C. album has limited the efficacy of chemical control. However, the use of alternative herbicides in rotation and the integration of chemicals and biologically based control methods may provide a sustainable control of C. album and C. murale.

AB  - Aims: We aim to describe and classify reasons behind women's choice between medical and surgical abortion. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed and PsycINFO in October 2015. The subjects were women in early pregnancy opting for abortion at clinics or hospitals in high-income countries. We extracted women's reasons for choice of abortion method and analysed these qualitatively, looking at main reasons for choosing either medical or surgical abortion. Results: Reasons for choice of method were classified to five main groups: technical nature of the intervention, fear of complications, fear of surgery or anaesthesia, timing and sedation. Reasons for selecting medical abortion were often based on the perception of the method being 'more natural' and the wish to have abortion in one's home in addition to fear of complications. Women who opted for surgical abortion appreciated the quicker process, viewed it as the safer option, and wished to avoid pain and excess bleeding. Reasons were often based on emotional reactions, previous experiences and a lack of knowledge about the procedures. Some topics such as pain or excess bleeding received little attention. Overall the quality of the studies was low, most studies were published more than 10 years ago, and the generalisability of the findings was poor. Conclusion: Women did not base their choice of abortion method only on rational information from professionals but also on emotions and especially fears. Support techniques for a more informed choice are needed. Recent high-quality studies in this area are lacking.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that the storage and processing capabilities of the human working memory system co-vary with individuals' performance on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The ubiquitous nature of this relationship suggests that variations in these processes may underlie individual differences in intelligence. Here we briefly review relevant data which supports this view. Furthermore, we emphasize an emerging literature describing a trait in genetically heterogeneous mice that is quantitatively and qualitatively analogous to general intelligence (g) in humans. As in humans, this animal analog of g co-varies with individual differences in both storage and processing components of the working memory system. Absent some of the complications associated with work with human subjects (e.g., phonological processing), this work with laboratory animals has provided an opportunity to assess otherwise intractable hypotheses. For instance, it has been possible in animals to manipulate individual aspects of the working memory system (e.g., selective attention), and to observe causal relationships between these variables and the expression of general cognitive abilities. This work with laboratory animals has coincided with human imaging studies (briefly reviewed here) which suggest that common brain structures (e.g., prefrontal cortex) mediate the efficacy of selective attention and the performance of individuals on intelligence test batteries. In total, this evidence suggests an evolutionary conservation of the processes that co-vary with and/or regulate "intelligence" and provides a framework for promoting these abilities in both young and old animals.

AB  - Phenomenological approaches suggest that the bodily presence of others has a profound influence on the experience of social spaces. This intimate relationship is particularly evident in mental disorders. Investigations into the nature of intersubjectivity in various pathologies indicate that modifications to the capacity for social perception play a key role in determining the manners in which the social space is experienced and felt. This paper aims to examine the interviewing relation of social perception and the experience of space and its consequences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This is done through a phenomenologically informed analysis of the functioning of social perception in ASD. Our account proposes that the atypical socio-perceptual patterns exhibited by people with autism significantly reduce the capacity to grasp the context of the situation, which facilitates and intensifies negative feelings that are intertwined with the experience of social spaces. This novel understanding draws on the idea that ASD involves a fundamental difficulty to establish a gestalt perception of social scenes. The evidence we discuss suggests that this anomaly in the operation of social perception also modulates the experience of the social space. Failing to perceive the wholeness of the situation means that people with autism often experience the social space as unfamiliar, confusing, uncertain, and unsafe, rather than feeling familiar and understood in the embodied presence of others. As a result, autistic subjects may experience difficulty evaluating the outcomes of hazardous circumstances, which poses a risk to their well-being, particularly in borderline situations. This suggestion is elaborated through the tragic occurrences that led to the killing of Eyad al-Hallaq, a 32-year-old Palestinian with autism.

AB  - D-Serine is a potent co-agonist at the NMDA glutamate receptor and has been the object of many preclinical studies to ascertain the nature of its metabolism, its regional and cellular distribution in the brain, its physiological functions and its possible clinical relevance. The enzymes involved in its formation and catabolism are serine racemase (SR) and D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), respectively, and manipulations of the activity of those enzymes have been useful in developing animal models of schizophrenia and in providing clues to the development of potential new antipsychotic strategies. Clinical studies have been conducted in schizophrenia patients to evaluate body fluid levels of D-serine and/or to use D-serine alone or in combination with antipsychotics to determine its effectiveness as a therapeutic agent. D-serine has also been used in combination with DAAO inhibitors in preclinical investigations, and interesting results have been obtained. Genetic studies and postmortem brain studies have also been conducted on D-serine and the enzymes involved in its metabolism. It is also of considerable interest that in recent years clinical and preclinical investigations have suggested that D-serine may also have antidepressant properties. Clinical studies have also shown that D-serine may be a biomarker for antidepressant response to ketamine. Relevant to both schizophrenia and depression, preclinical and clinical studies with D-serine indicate that it may be effective in reducing cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Over the last few years, the concept of food addiction has become a common feature in the scientific literature, as well as the popular press. Nevertheless, the use of the term addiction to describe pathological aspects of food intake in humans remains controversial, and even among those who affirm the validity of the concept, there is considerable disagreement about its utility for explaining the increasing prevalence of obesity throughout much of the world. An examination of the literature on food addiction indicates that mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine systems often are cited as mechanisms that contribute to the establishment of food addiction. However, in reviewing this literature, it is important to have a detailed consideration of the complex nature of dopaminergic involvement in motivational processes. For example, although it is often stated that mesolimbic dopamine mediates reward, there is no standard or consistent technical meaning of this term. Moreover, there is a persistent tendency to link dopamine transmission with pleasure or hedonia, as opposed to other aspects of motivation or learning. The present article provides a critical discussion of some aspects of the food addiction literature, viewed through the lens of recent findings and current theoretical views of dopaminergic involvement in food motivation. Furthermore, compulsive food intake and binge eating will be considered from an evolutionary perspective, in terms of the motivational subsystems that are involved in adaptive patterns of food consumption and seeking behaviors and a consideration of how these could be altered in pathological conditions.

AB  - Cortical spreading depression (CSD) produces propagating waves of transient neuronal hyperexcitability followed by depression. CSD is initiated by K+ release following neuronal firing or electrical, mechanical or 0 9 9 chemical stimuli. A triphasic (30-50 s) cortical potential transient accompanies localized transmembrane redistributions of K+, glutamate, Ca2+, Na+, Cl- and H+. Accumulated K+ in the restricted interstitial space can cause both further neuronal depolarisation and inward movement of K+ into astrocytes that buffers this increased extracellular K+ concentration ([K+])(o). However, astrocyte interconnections may then propagate the CSD wave by K+ liberation through an opening of remote K+ channels by volume, Ca2+ or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. Changes in cerebral blood volume and in apparent water diffusion co-efficient (ADC) accompanying CSD were first studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in whole lissencephalic brains. Diffusion-weighted echoplanar imaging in gyrencephalic brains went on to demonstrate CSD features that paralleled classical migraine aura. The ADC activity persisted minutes/hours post KCl stimulus. Pixelwise analyses distinguished single primary events and multiple, spatially restricted, slower propagating, secondary events whose detailed features varied with the nature of the originating stimulus. These ADC changes varied reciprocally with T2*-weighted (i.e. referring to spin-spin relaxation times) waveforms reflecting local blood flow. There followed prolonged decreases in cerebral blood flow culminating in late cerebrovascular changes blocked by the antimigraine agent sumatriptan. CSD phenomena have possible translational significance for human migraine aura and other cerebral pathologies such as the peri-infarct depolarisation events that follow ischaemia and brain injury.

AB  - BackgroundTic disorders are childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by multiple motor or vocal tics with frequent comorbidities and a broad spectrum of phenotypic presentations. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions in pediatric patients with tic disorders.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 119 pediatric patients (89 males, 30 females) who were diagnosed with tic disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) at Uijeongbu St. Mary's Hospital, Republic of Korea, between January 2012 and July 2019.ResultsThe mean age of tic onset was 6.9years (range, 1-14) and the mean age at diagnosis was 8years (range, 1-17). The mean lag between tic onset and diagnosis was 13.3months (range, 0.25-132). The most common, first-presenting tics were eye blinking (50.4%), followed by jaw or lip movement (29.4%) and throat clearing (29.4%). Thirty-seven (31.1%) patients had at least one co-occurring neuropsychiatric disorder at the time of tic diagnosis. Subtypes of tic disorders, types of initial tics, and presence of neuropsychiatric comorbidities were not associated with tic severity. Tic severity was associated with greater functional impairment and tic noticeability (p<0.05). A relatively shorter time to diagnosis was associated with tic severity (Spearman's <rho>=-0.14, p=0.11).ConclusionsThe evolving nature of tic expression and severity, high prevalence of neuropsychiatric comorbidities, and associated functional impairments emphasize the importance of comprehensive assessment during the disease course for determining and prioritizing goals of treatment.

AB  - There are a number of disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV) that are characterised by having psychotic symptoms as the defining feature [17]. The narrowest definition of psychosis is restricted to delusions or prominent hallucinations, with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight into their pathological nature, Schizophrenia is the most prevalent form of psychosis, but this may also occur due to other medical conditions (e.g,, Prader-Willi syndrome, epilepsy), in the early post-partum period, at menopause, and as a result of drug use. This article attempts to draw together an underlying causation across the various forms of psychotic disorder and, by integrating this with what is known about the genetics, neuroanatomy and neuropharmacology of the positive symptoms in schizophrenia, produce a broader understanding. At the cellular level, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons are a common feature in psychotic states, and are a principal focus for serotonin and dopamine innervations, as well as playing an important role in cortical development. At the systems level, prefrontal and medial temporal cortices are implicated with activity levels out of synchrony in schizophrenics, How these vast areas of disparately functioning cortical networks are "bound" together to provide coherent conscious experiences is again a function of GABA-ergic interneurons. These interneurons have highly divergent inhibitory projections to large numbers of pyramidal neurons and are themselves synchronised by the ascending dopamine and serotonin innervations.

AB  - Oxidative damage is predicted to be a mediator of trade-offs between current reproduction and future reproduction or survival, but most studies fail to support such predictions. We suggest that two factors underlie the equivocal nature of these findings: (1) investigators typically assume a negative linear relationship between current reproduction and future reproduction or survival, even though this is not consistently shown by empirical studies; and (2) studies often fail to target mechanisms that could link interactions between sequential life-history events. Here, we review common patterns of reproduction, focusing on the relationships between reproductive performance, survival and parity in females. Observations in a range of species show that performance between sequential reproductive events can decline, remain consistent or increase. We describe likely bioenergetic consequences of reproduction that could underlie these changes in fitness, including mechanisms that could be responsible for negative effects being ephemeral, persistent or delayed. Finally, we make recommendations for designing future studies. We encourage investigators to carefully consider additional or alternative measures of bioenergetic function in studies of life-history trade-offs. Such measures include reactive oxygen species production, oxidative repair, mitochondrial biogenesis, cell proliferation, mitochondrial DNA mutation and replication error and, importantly, a measure of the respiratory function to determine whether measured differences in bioenergetic state are associated with a change in the energetic capacity of tissues that could feasibly affect future reproduction or lifespan. More careful consideration of the life-history context and bioenergetic variables will improve our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the life-history patterns of animals.

AB  - Objective To determine the nature, scope and effectiveness of interventions to reduce the household economic burden of illness or injury.
   Methods We systematically reviewed reports published on or before 31 January 2014 that we found in the CENTRAL, CINAHL, Econlit, Embase, MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE and PsycINFO databases. We extracted data from prospective controlled trials and assessed the risk of bias. We narratively synthesized evidence.
   Findings Nine of the 4330 studies checked met our inclusion criteria seven had evaluated changes to existing health-insurance programmes and two had evaluated different modes of delivering information. The only interventions found to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure significantly were those that eliminated or substantially reduced co-payments for a given patient population. However, the reductions only represented marginal changes in the total expenditures of patients. We found no studies that had been effective in addressing broader household economic impacts such as catastrophic health expenditure in the disease populations investigated.
   Conclusion In general, interventions designed to reduce the complex household economic burden of illness and injury appear to have had little impact on household economies. We only found a few relevant studies using rigorous study designs that were conducted in defined patient populations. The studies were limited in the range of interventions tested and they evaluated only a narrow range of household economic outcomes. There is a need for method development to advance the measurement of the household economic consequences of illness and injury and facilitate the development of innovative interventions to supplement the strategies based on health insurance.

AB  - December 2014 marked the 30th year anniversary of Bhopal gas tragedy. This sudden and accidental leakage of deadly poisonous methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas instigated research efforts to understand the nature, severity of health damage and sufferings of 570 000 ailing survivors of this tragedy. In a decade-long period, our systematic laboratory investigations coupled with long-term molecular surveillance studies have comprehensively demonstrated that the risk of developing an environmental associated aberrant disease phenotype, including cancer, involves complex interplay of genomic and epigenetic reprogramming. These findings poised us to translate this knowledge into an investigative framework of "molecular biodosimetry" in a strictly selected cohort of MIC exposed individuals. A pragmatic cancer risk-assessment strategy pursued in concert with a large-scale epidemiological study might unfold molecular underpinnings of host-susceptibility and exposure-response relationship. The challenges are enormous, but we postulate that the study will be necessary to establish a direct initiation-promotion paradigm of environmental carcinogenesis. Given that mitochondrial retrograde signaling-induced epigenetic reprogramming is apparently linked to neoplasticity, a cutting-edge tailored approach by an expert pool of biomedical researchers will be fundamental to drive these strategies from planning to execution. Validating the epigenomic signatures will hopefully result in the development of biomarkers to better protect human lives in an overburdened ecosystem, such as India, which is continuously challenged to meet population demands. Besides, delineating the mechanistic links between MIC exposure and cancer morbidity, our investigative strategy might help to formulate suitable regulatory policies and measures to reduce the overall burden of occupational and environmental carcinogenesis.

AB  - AimIn the last decade, advances have been made in identifying young people who may be at relatively high risk (HR) of developing psychosis. Given the controversial and experimental nature of the HR concept, the attitudes and experiences of mental health professionals and patients are likely to influence practice in this area. Previous work has been published that has speculated on the potential risks and advantages of identifying and intervening within the HR state. However, few have attempted to capture the attitudes and experiences of patients and professionals towards this concept. This article provides, via the collation of existing research reports, a reflection on the views, attitudes and experiences of these key stakeholders.
   MethodsA narrative review of the literature was undertaken focussing upon the following key areas: mental health professionals' attitudes towards the HR concept, patients' attitudes towards the HR concept, attitudes of patients towards potential treatments and attitudes of professionals towards HR treatments.
   ResultsRelatively few published studies focusing on the attitudes and experiences of patients and mental health professionals exist. However, there is some evidence that both professionals and affected individuals view the HR concept as worthy of diagnosis and intervention. Expressed treatment preferences appear to vary, dependent on the group of individuals surveyed.
   ConclusionsFurther systematic studies of patient and professional preferences, in relation to identification and intervention, are desirable in order to explore the way that the HR denotation is personally interpreted and the extent to which it affects patient and practitioner behaviour.

AB  - The Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) initiative, funded by an R13 from the National Institute of Mental Health, seeks to enhance translational research in treatment development for impaired cognition in schizophrenia by developing tools from cognitive neuroscience into useful measures of treatment effects on behavior and brain function. An initial series of meetings focused on the selection of a new set of tasks from cognitive neuroscience for the measurement of treatment effects on specific cognitive and neural systems. Subsequent validation and optimization studies are underway and a subset of validated measures with well-characterized psychometric properties will be generally available in 2011. This article describes results of the first meeting of the second phase of the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia, which seeks to develop imaging biomarkers and improved animal models to enhance translational research. In this meeting, we considered issues related to the use of methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and transcranial magnetic simulation as biomarkers for treatment development. We explored the biological nature of the signals measured by each method, their validity and reliability as measures of cognition-related neural activity, potential confounds related to drug effects on the signal of interest, and conceptual, methodological, and pragmatic issues related to their use in preclinical, first into human, and multicenter phase II and III studies. This overview article describes the background and goals of the meeting together with a summary of the major issues discussed in more detail in the accompanying articles appearing in this issue of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - Oxytocin and vasopressin are key effectors of social behaviour (Insel, T. R. and Fernald, R. D. (2004). Annu. Rev. Neurosci., 27: 697-722). Oxytocin effects in humans were recently demonstrated by a behavioural study showing selectively increased trust after hormone administration (Kosfeld, M., et al. (2005). Nature, 435: 673-676). Since this suggested involvement of the amygdala, which is linked to trust (Winston, J. S., et al. (2002). Nat. Neurosci., 5: 277-283) - presumably because of its role in danger monitoring - and highly expresses oxytocin receptors (Huber, D., et al. (2005). Science, 308: 245-248), we studied amygdala circuitry after double-blind crossover intranasal application of placebo or oxytocin (Kirsch, P., et al. (2005). J. Neurosci., 25: 11489-11493). Oxytocin potently reduced amygdala activation and decreased coupling to brainstem regions implicated in autonomic and behavioural manifestations of fear, indicating a neural mechanism for the effects of oxytocin in social cognition in humans and providing a potential therapeutic approach to social anxiety currently being tested in social phobia and autism. Furthermore, these data suggested a translational genetic approach. Preliminary findings (data not presented) from our laboratory using imaging genetics indeed implicate genetic variants for both AVPR1A, encoding the primary receptor of vasopressin in brain, and the oxytocin receptor, OXTR, in amygdala regulation and activation. Taken together, our results indicate neural mechanisms for human social behaviour mediating genetic risk for autism through an impact on amygdala signalling and provide a rationale for exploring therapeutic strategies aimed at abnormal amygdala function in this disorder and in social dysfunction in general.

AB  - Among the factors making recognition of severe depression problematic for clinicians are the heterogeneous nature of the condition, lack of standardized definitions, and concomitant comorbidities that confound differential diagnosis of symptoms. The spectrum of severity in depressive disorders is extraordinarily broad, and severity assessment is comprised of several metrics including symptom intensity, diagnostic subtypes, suicidatity risk, and hospitalization status. The overall diagnosis is achieved through consideration of symptom types and severities together with the degree of functional impairment as assessed by the psychiatric interview. It is likely that no single fundamental neurobiological defect underlies severe depression. The chronicity and heterogeneity of this disorder lead to frequent clinic visits and a longer course of treatment; therefore, successful approaches may require an arsenal of treatments with numerous mechanisms of action. The categories of drugs used to treat severe depression are detailed herein, as are several non-pharmacologic options including a number of experimental treatments. Pharmacotherapies include tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antidepressants such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and combination and augmentation therapies. Drugs within each class are not equivalent, and efficacy may vary with symptom severity. Patient adherence makes tolerability another critical consideration in antidepressant choice. The role of non-pharmacological treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy, vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and deep brain stimulation remain active avenues of investigation. Improved knowledge and treatment approaches for severe depression are necessary to facilitate remission, the ideal treatment goal. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - More than a century has elapsed since the description of Alois Alzheimer's patient Auguste D. Yet, the well-documented generation of l amyloid aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles that define Alzheimer's disease is believed to represent only a portion of the cellular processes that can determine the course of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding of the complex nature of this disorder has evolved with an increased appreciation for pathways that involve the generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, apoptotic injury that leads to nuclear degradation in both neuronal and vascular populations, and the early loss of cellular membrane asymmetry that mitigates inflammation and vascular occlusion. Recent work has identified novel pathways, such as the Wnt pathway and the serine-threonine kinase Akt, as central modulators that oversee cellular apoptosis and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles through their downstream substrates that include glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, Bad, and Bcl-x(L). Other closely integrated pathways control microglial activation, release of inflammatory cytokines, and caspase and calpain activation for the processing of amyloid precursor protein, tau protein cleavage, and presenilin disposal. New therapeutic avenues that are just open to exploration, such as with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide modulation, cell cycle modulation, metabotropic glutamate system modulation, and erythropoietin targeted expression, may provide both attractive and viable alternatives to treat Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Background Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is recommended in treatment guidelines as an efficacious therapy for treatment-resistant depression. However, it has been associated with loss of autobiographical memory and short-term reduction in new learning. Aims To provide clinically useful guidelines to aid clinicians in informing patients regarding the cognitive side-effects of ECT and in monitoring these during a course of ECT, using complex data. Method A Committee of clinical and academic experts from Australia and New Zealand met to the discuss the key issues pertaining to ECT and cognitive side-effects. Evidence regarding cognitive side-effects was reviewed, as was the limited evidence regarding how to monitor them. Both issues were supplemented by the clinical experience of the authors. Results Meta-analyses suggest that new learning is impaired immediately following ECT but that group mean scores return at least to baseline by 14 days after ECT. Other cognitive functions are generally unaffected. However, the finding of a mean score that is not reduced from baseline cannot be taken to indicate that impairment, particularly of new learning, cannot occur in individuals, particularly those who are at greater risk. Therefore, monitoring is still important. Evidence suggests that ECT does cause deficits in autobiographical memory. The evidence for schedules of testing to monitor cognitive side-effects is currently limited. We therefore make practical recommendations based on clinical experience. Conclusions Despite modern ECT techniques, cognitive side-effects remain an important issue, although their nature and degree remains to be clarified fully. In these circumstances it is useful for clinicians to have guidance regarding what to tell patients and how to monitor these side-effects clinically.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, and affects millions of people worldwide. As the number of AD cases continues to increase in both developed and developing countries, finding therapies that effectively halt or reverse disease progression constitutes a major research and public health challenge. Since the identification of the arnyloid-beta peptide (A beta) as the major component of the amyloid plaques that are characteristically found in AD brains, a major effort has aimed to determine whether and how A/beta leads to memory loss and cognitive impairment. A large body of evidence accumulated in the past 15 years supports a pivotal role of soluble A beta oligomers (A beta Os) in synapse failure and neuronal dysfunction in AD. Nonetheless, a number of basic questions, including the exact molecular composition of the synaptotoxic oligomers, the identity of the receptor(s) to which they bind, and the signaling pathways that ultimately lead to synapse failure, remain to be definitively answered. Here, we discuss recent advances that have illuminated our understanding of the chemical nature of the toxic species and the deleterious impact they have on synapses, and have culminated in the proposal of an A beta oligomer hypothesis for Alzheimer's pathogenesis. We also highlight outstanding questions and challenges in AD research that should be addressed to allow translation of research findings into effective AD therapies.

AB  - Humans are by nature social beings tuned to communicate and interact from the very beginning of their lives. The sense of touch represents the most direct and intimate channel of communication and a powerful means of connection between the self and the others. In our digital age, the development and diffusion of internet-based technologies and virtual environments offer new opportunities of communication overcoming physical distance. It however, happens that social interactions are often mediated, and the tactile aspects of communication are overlooked, thus diminishing the feeling of social presence, which may contribute to an increased sense of social disconnection and loneliness. The current manuscript aims to review the extant literature about the socio-affective dimension of touch and current advancements in interactive virtual environments in order to provide a new perspective on multisensory virtual communication. Specifically, we suggest that interpersonal affective touch might critically impact virtual social exchanges, promoting a sense of co-presence and social connection between individuals, possibly overcoming feelings of sensory loneliness. This topic of investigation will be of crucial relevance from a theoretical perspective aiming to understand how we integrate multisensory signals in processing and making sense of interpersonal exchanges, this is important in both typical and atypical populations. Moreover, it will pave the way to promising applications by exploring the possibility to use technical innovations to communicate more interactively in the case of people who suffer from social isolation and disconnection from others.

AB  - Presently, the progressive concern for the adverse effect of mining has emphasized the significance of reclamation in derelict mine site. The manuscript aims to present a scientometric analysis followed by a review on eco-restoration of heavy metal polluted mine spoil, tailing and to develop a timeline analysis done in the last 10 years (2010-2020). Web of Science (WoS) database was used to obtain the desired data set, and these are analysed based on WoS categories, leading journals and contributing countries. According to these databases, research progress was delineated to draw a clear picture of the scientific status and progress and to develop knowledge gap in this area. China is the leading country in eco-restoration-based study for heavy metal remediation in mines. Among the categories, "Environmental Science" has the highest number of publications in this domain. After reviewing various literature, it is evident that vegetation cover has the ability to remediate mine derelict sites. Most of the studies reported that woody, fast growing, native vegetation cover suit best for heavy metal remediation. The use of vegetation cover native to the mining sites should be prioritized as they are better indicator of reclamation success due to their high biomass, fast growing, ability to acclimatize in adverse environmental condition in nature. Lastly, as most studies focused on the recuperating soil properties, the application of innovative genomic approaches (recognising genetic markers for abatement of contaminants) to heavy metal remediation practice should also be amplified to develop new concepts of land reclamation in mining area.

AB  - Background Explicit and implicit memories are conserved but flexible biological tools that nature uses to regulate the daily behaviors of human beings. An aberrant form of the implicit memory is presumed to exist and may be contributory to the pathophysiology of disorders such as tardive syndromes, phantom phenomena, flashback, posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), and related disorders. These disorders have posed significant clinical problems for both patients and physicians for centuries. All extant pathophysiological theories of these disorders have failed to provide basis for effective treatment. Objective The objective of this article is to propose an alternative pathophysiological theory that will hopefully lead to new treatment approaches. Methods The author sourced over 60 journal articles that treated topics on memory, and involuntary motor and sensory disorders, from open access journals using Google Scholar, and reviewed them and this helped in the formulation of this theory. Results From the reviews, the author thinks physical or chemical insult to the nervous system can cause defective circuit remodeling, leading to generation of a variant of implicit (automatic) memory, herein called "reflex memory" and this is encoded interoceptively to contribute to these phenomena states. Conclusion Acquired involuntary motor and sensory disorders are caused by defective circuit remodeling involving multiple neural mechanisms. Dysregulation of excitatory neurotransmitters, calcium overload, homeostatic failure, and neurotoxicity are implicated in the process. Sustained effects of these defective mechanisms are encoded interoceptively as abnormal memory in the neurons and the conscious manifestations are these disorders. Extant theories failed to recognize this possibility.

   Views: In this study, the authors collected data on nutrients that support traditional drug treatment and potentially reduce central nervous system infections, while also indicating the role they play in the central nervous system (CNS). The article points out that long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics and prebiotics, as well as vitamin D selenium and zinc play a role in supporting immune function and reducing the risk of CNS infections. It should be noted that, due to the novel nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, limited number of studies evaluating the potential impact of dietary components on COVID-19 risk reduction or their adjunctive effect on treatment are available. Therefore, further clinical studies are needed to confirm these results.
   Conclusions: The dietary habits and nutrients described in the article support medical care, including vaccination and other therapies. They are likely to reduce the risk of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection. The functioning of the physiological gut-brain axis supported by probiotics, polyphenols, certain minerals such as zinc, selenium and vitamin D consumed with the diet, can probably reduce the cost of COVID-19 treatment on the CNS. Also, nutrients other than those mentioned in the article, including vitamins A, E, B-1, B-6, B-12 and iron, could potentially reduce the cost of the treatment of this disease.

AB  - The increasing interest about dispositional optimism's role in health status and its positive modulating effect on health outcomes has led to a remarkable scientific production in the last decade. To date lot is known for which diseases optimism is relevant, instead much less is known about how optimism interacts with other factors, both biological and psychological, in determining health status. The aim of this mini review is to explore the literature derived from clinical and experimental research assessing the associations between dispositional optimism and health status. Dispositional optimism can be considered as facet of personality that is cognitive in nature which holds the global expectation that the future will be plenty of good events. Optimists view desired goals as obtainable, so they often confront adversities in active manners resulting in perseverance and increased goal attainment. Only studies that explicitly included optimism and health outcomes, as measurable variables, and that reported a clear association between them have been reviewed. Cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory failure, and aging with multimorbidity were considered. Among the possible explicative hypotheses, two seem to best describe results: optimism may have a direct effect on the neuroendocrine system and on immune responses, and it may have an indirect effect on health outcomes by promoting protective health behaviors, adaptive coping strategies and enhancing positive mood. The research on optimism and health status has already shed light on important mechanisms regarding chronic diseases' management, however, further studies are needed to deepen the knowledge.

AB  - As is the case with any metaphor, parental effects mean different things to different biologists-from developmental induction of novel phenotypic variation to an evolved adaptation, and from epigenetic transference of essential developmental resources to a stage of inheritance and ecological succession. Such a diversity of perspectives illustrates the composite nature of parental effects that, depending on the stage of their expression and whether they are considered a pattern or a process, combine the elements of developmental induction, homeostasis, natural selection, epigenetic inheritance and historical persistence. Here, we suggest that by emphasizing the complexity of causes and influences in developmental systems and by making explicit the links between development, natural selection and inheritance, the study of parental effects enables deeper understanding of developmental dynamics of life cycles and provides a unique opportunity to explicitly integrate development and evolution. We highlight these perspectives by placing parental effects in a wider evolutionary framework and suggest that far from being only an evolved static outcome of natural selection, a distinct channel of transmission between parents and offspring, or a statistical abstraction, parental effects on development enable evolution by natural selection by reliably transferring developmental resources needed to reconstruct, maintain and modify genetically inherited components of the phenotype. The view of parental effects as an essential and dynamic part of an evolutionary continuum unifies mechanisms behind the origination, modification and historical persistence of organismal form and function, and thus brings us closer to a more realistic understanding of life's complexity and diversity.

   A fundamental feature of cellular senescence is the emergence of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), which represents a considerable source of inflammatory and tissue-remodeling cues. The pathophysiological relevance of senescence and SASP has generated a fertile area of research aimed at manipulating the SASP to fight cancer and age-related conditions. This review enlightens the most important mechanisms that regulate the SASP and summarizes the current evidence on the feasibility of intervening on its composition, providing a reading frame of the general potentialities of SASP modulation.
   Cellular senescence represents a robust tumor-protecting mechanism that halts the proliferation of stressed or premalignant cells. However, this state of stable proliferative arrest is accompanied by the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), which entails the copious secretion of proinflammatory signals in the tissue microenvironment and contributes to age-related conditions, including, paradoxically, cancer. Novel therapeutic strategies aim at eliminating senescent cells with the use of senolytics or abolishing the SASP without killing the senescent cell with the use of the so-called "senomorphics". In addition, recent works demonstrate the possibility of modifying the composition of the secretome by genetic or pharmacological intervention. The purpose is not to renounce the potent immunostimulatory nature of SASP, but rather learning to modulate it for combating cancer and other age-related diseases. This review describes the main molecular mechanisms regulating the SASP and reports the evidence of the feasibility of abrogating or modulating the SASP, discussing the possible implications of both strategies.

AB  - The urban environment is becoming the most common setting in which people worldwide will spend their lives. Urban forests, and the ecosystem services they provide, are becoming a priority for municipalities. Quantifying and communicating the vulnerability of this resource are essential for maintaining a consistent and equitable supply of these ecosystem services. We propose a theory-based conceptual framework for the assessment of urban forest vulnerability that integrates the biophysical, built, and human components of urban forest ecosystems. A review and description of potential vulnerability indicators are provided. Urban forest vulnerability can be defined as the likelihood of decline in ecosystem service supply and its associated benefits for human populations, urban infrastructure, and biodiversity. It is comprised of (i) exposure, which refers to the stressors and disturbances associated with the urban environment that negatively affect ecosystem function, (ii) sensitivity, which is determined by urban forest structure and dictates the system response to forcing from exposures and the magnitude of potential impacts, and (iii) adaptive capacity, which is the social and environmental capacity of a system to shift or alter its conditions to reduce its vulnerability or to improve its ability to function while stressed. Potential impacts, or losses in ecosystem service supply, are temporal in nature and require backward-looking monitoring and (or) forward-looking modelling to be measured and assessed. Vulnerability can be communicated through the use of indicators, aggregated indices, and mapping. A vulnerability approach can communicate complex issues to decision-makers and advance the theoretical understanding of urban forest ecosystems.

AB  - In this article, we focus on two issues, namely, the nature and onset of very early personal memories, especially for traumatic events, and the role of stress in long-term retention. We begin by outlining a theory of early autobiographical memory, one whose unfolding is coincident with emergence of the cognitive self. It is argued that it is not until this self emerges that personal memories will remain viable over extended periods of time. We illustrate this with 25 cases of young children's long-term retention of early traumatic events involving emergency room treatment. On the basis of both qualitative (case profiles) and quantitative (analysis of covariance) analyses, we conclude that (a) very young children (under the age of 2 years) retain limited memories for events which they commonly express behaviorally, (b) coherent autobiographical memories are not constructed until the child develops a cognitive sense of self (on average, at 24 months of age), (c) autobiographical memories for traumatic events are essentially no different from those for nontraumatic events, (d) stress is only related to long-term retention inasmuch as it is one variable that serves to make an event unique, and (e) like nontraumatic events, traumatic memories lose peripheral details during the retention interval and retain the central components of the event. These results are discussed both in terms of their implications for theories of early autobiographical memory as well as the ways in which we might differentiate implanted (or false) memories and authentic memories for traumatic events.

AB  - The relationship between humans and plastics has become intricate due to their versatile nature and low production cost. Plastics generation has surpassed that of other manufactured products, which, coupled with the prevailing poor waste management systems, makes it a serious problem for the terrestrial and aquatic environments as its final destination. Their extensive presence has continued to pose a significant threat, not only to the aquatic ecosystem but also to the approximately 3 billion people relying on it for their livelihood. Even more disturbing were the recent findings of these plastics in food and drinking water and the evidence of human exposure, the long-term health effects of which are largely unknown. This ubiquitous phenomenon has over time put plastics under critical observation, leading to the development of many local and international policies, resolutions, and directives aimed at addressing and reversing the menace. This review provided the first snapshot of the global and local governance strategies currently aimed at mitigating plastic pollution, their limitations, and future directions. The findings of the review revealed several aspects of microplastics (MPs) pollution to be overlooked in policy formulation, a laxity in policy implementation, and an apparent lack of indices to ascertain the impact of the regulations. Furthermore, there is currently no regulation on MPs contamination of food and drinking water and an apparent lack of funding for research into the health effects of plastics and their alternatives. This, therefore, necessitates the need for a well-coordinated approach at international and national levels to scale up these policies in all countries and translate them from paper to measurable, holistic, and realizable actions that will address all forms of plastic pollution.

AB  - Purpose Migrant and ethnic minority populations exhibit a higher incidence of psychotic disorders. The Ultra-High Risk for psychosis (UHR) paradigm provides an opportunity to explore the stage at which such factors influence the development of psychosis. In this systematic review, we collate and appraise the literature on the association between ethnicity and migrant status and the rate of identification of individuals at UHR, as well as their rate of transition to psychosis. Methods We conducted a systematic review in the Ovid Medline, PsychINFO, Pubmed, CINAHL and EMBASE databases according to PRISMA guidelines. We included studies written in English that included an UHR cohort, provided a measure of ethnicity or migrant status, and examined the incidence, rate, or risk of UHR identification or transition to psychosis. Results Of 2182 unique articles identified, seven fulfilled the criteria. One study found overrepresentation of UHR individuals from black ethnic groups, while another found underrepresentation. Two studies found increased rates of transition among certain ethnic groups and a further two found no association. Regarding migrant status, one study found that first-generation migrants were underrepresented in an UHR sample. Lastly, a lower transition rate in migrant populations was identified in one study, while two found no association. Conclusion Rates of UHR identification and transition according to ethnic and migrant status were inconsistent and insufficient to conclusively explain higher incidences of psychotic disorders among these groups. We discuss the clinical implications and avenues for future research, which is required to clarify the nature of the associations.

AB  - Results of basic science studies demonstrate shared actions of endogenous neuroactive steroid hormones and drugs of abuse on neurotransmission. As such, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) may be associated with smoking, however, results from studies examining this relationship have been mixed. Following PRISMA guidelines, we extracted unique studies examining the relationship between smoking and PMS. We used the escalc () function in R to compute the log odds ratios and corresponding sampling variance for each study. We based quality assessment on the nature of PMS diagnosis and smoking estimation, confounding adjustment, participation rate, and a priori specification of target population. Our final sample included 13 studies, involving 25,828 study participants. Smoking was associated with an increased risk for PMS [OR = 1.56 (95% CI: 1.25-1.93), p < 0.0001]. Stratified by diagnosis, the effect size estimate was higher for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) [OR = 3.15 (95% CI: 2.20-4.52), p < 0.0001] than for PMS [OR = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.16-1.39), p < 0.0001]. We review some of the basic mechanisms for the observed association between smoking and PMS. Given nicotine's rewarding effects, increased smoking behavior may be a mechanism to alleviate affective symptoms of PMS. However, smoking may lead to worsening of PMS symptoms because nicotine has effects on neurocircuitry that increases susceptibility to environmental stressors. Indeed, prior evidence shows that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is already sub-optimal in PMS, hence, smoking likely further deteriorates it. Combined, this complicates the clinical course for the treatment of both PMS and Tobacco Use Disorder in this population.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is an essential metal for human, animals and plants, although it is also potentially toxic above supra-optimal levels. In plants, Cu is an essential cofactor of numerous metalloproteins and is involved in several biochemical and physiological processes. However, excess of Cu induces oxidative stress inside plants via enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Owing to its dual nature (essential and a potential toxicity), this metal involves a complex network of uptake, sequestration and transport, essentiality, toxicity and detoxification inside the plants. Therefore, it is vital to monitor the biogeo-physiochemical behavior of Cu in soil-plant-human systems keeping in view its possible essential and toxic roles.
   This review critically highlights the latest understanding of (i) Cu adsorption/desorption in soil (ii) accumulation in plants, (iii) phytotoxicity, (iv) tolerance mechanisms inside plants and (v) health risk assessment. The Cu-mediated oxidative stress and resulting up-regulation of several enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants have been deliberated at molecular and cellular levels. Moreover, the role of various transporter proteins in Cu uptake and its proper transportation to target metalloproteins is critically discussed. The review also delineates Cu build-up in plant food and accompanying health disorders.
   Finally, this review proposes some future perspectives regarding Cu biochemistry inside plants. The review, to a large extent, presents a complete picture of the biogeo-physiochemical behavior of Cu in soil-plant-human systems supported with up-to-date 10 tables and 5 figures. It can be of great interest for post-graduate level students, scientists, industrialists, policymakers and regulatory authorities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Creative thinking is arguably the pinnacle of cerebral functionality. Like no other mental faculty, it has been omnipotent in transforming human civilizations. Probing the neural basis of this most extraordinary capacity, however, has been doggedly frustrated. Despite a flurry of activity in cognitive neuroscience, recent reviews have shown that there is no coherent picture emerging from the neuroimaging work. Based on this, we take a different route and apply two well established paradigms to the problem. First is the evolutionary framework that, despite being part and parcel of creativity research, has no informed experimental work in cognitive neuroscience. Second is the emerging prediction framework that recognizes predictive representations as an integrating principle of all cognition. We show here how the prediction imperative revealingly synthesizes a host of new insights into the way brains process variation-selection thought trials and present a new neural mechanism for the partial sightedness in human creativity. Our ability to run offline simulations of expected future environments and action outcomes can account for some of the characteristic properties of cultural evolutionary algorithms running in brains, such as degrees of sightedness, the formation of scaffolds to jump over unviable intermediate forms, or how fitness criteria are set for a selection process that is necessarily hypothetical. Prospective processing in the brain also sheds light on how human creating and designing - as opposed to biological creativity - can be accompanied by intentions and foresight. This paper raises questions about the nature of creative thought that, as far as we know, have never been asked before.

AB  - Pheromones and other social odor cues convey rich information among rodents. Social investigation is described as a key element in olfactory communication, which involves motivated approaches to conspecifics and other socially relevant stimuli. This behavior is activated by the detection of social cues to gather information about conspecifics for subsequent strategies such as avoidance or further approach, thereby determining the extent and nature of physical contact that ensues. This feature indicates a useful way for describing the process of social communication in distance-based manner. In particular, airborne odorant signals in rodent species guide social investigation at a distance, and provide information regarding the health status of the odor donors. In this review, we will address the role of the inflammatory response in the release of odor cues that involve information about several illness-associated conditions (bacterial or parasitic infection, stressor exposure, etc.). We will provide an overview of how sex and developmental epoch in odor donors serve as predictors of subsequent social behavior. We conclude that inflammatory processes have a profound impact on social behavior through a direct effect on the sick individual (i.e., reduced motivation to engage in social interaction), while the release of illness-related, aversive odor cues from the sick individual serves to inhibit social investigation by healthy conspecifics. Together, this dual impact of acute illness is thought to minimize disease transmission across individuals and promote healthy group living. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - 'A nice derangement of epitaphs': Missionary language-learning in mid-nineteenth century natal
AB  - Although the relationship of missionary linguistics to colonial power in Africa has been well-documented, far less attention has been paid to the role of language-learning in forging missionary identities. This article examines a diverse range of responses to the Zulu language among missionaries in Natal in the 1850s and 1860s - the period in which missionary work became consolidated in the colony - addressing their relationship not only to the work of colonisation, but also to missionaries' own evangelical self-conception. It argues that for many missionaries, from a range of denominations and backgrounds, the experience of second-language learning came to be definitive of their evangelical identity. In a positive sense, learning to speak Zulu was considered as the indispensable key to the central tasks of mission, whether primary attention was given to preaching, translation, or interpreting 'the minds and modes of thought' of Zulu-speakers. However, attitudes to the Zulu language were driven as much by anxiety as by a sense of confidence, or cultural and religious superiority. The insecurities commonly felt by novice language-learners were sometimes exacerbated as missionaries were exposed to censure or ridicule by the Zulu- speakers they sought to convert, and concerns about the sinful nature of the 'unsaved' Zulu were mapped on to attitudes to language. This article thus demonstrates some of the ways in which missionaries established, reinforced, or reconsidered their own evangelical identities by means of their relationship to the Zulu language, and explores some of the worries and fears that underpinned their conceptions of language-learning. The themes of laughter and contamination symbolise in different ways the dangers which language-learning could pose to missionaries' sense of self, power, or propriety.

AB  - Exposure to stressors in early postnatal life induces long-lasting modifications in brain function. This plasticity, an essential characteristic of the brain that enables adaptation to the environment, may also induce impairments in some psychophysiological functions, including learning and memory. Early life stress (ELS) has long-term effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stressors, and has been reported to lead to neuroinflammation, altered levels of neurotrophic factors, modifications in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, with changes in neurotransmitter systems and network functioning. In this review, we focus on early postnatal stress in animal models and their effects on learning and memory. Many studies have reported ELSinduced impairments in different types of memories, including spatial memory, fear memory, recognition (both for objects and social) memory, working memory and reversal learning. Studies are not always in agreement, however, no effects, or sometimes facilitation, being reported, depending on the nature and intensity of the early intervention, as well as the age when the outcome was evaluated and the sex of the animals. When considering processes occurring after consolidation, related with memory maintenance/persistence or transformation, there are a very reduced number of reports. Future studies addressing the mechanisms underlying memory changes for ELS should shed some light on the understanding of the different effects induced by stressors of different types and intensities on cognitive functions.

AB  - Critical consciousness refers to an individual's awareness of oppressive systemic forces in society, a sense of efficacy to work against oppression, and engagement in individual or collective action against oppression. In the past few decades, interest in critical consciousness as a resource that may promote thriving in marginalized people has grown tremendously. This article critically examines the results of a systematic review of 67 studies of critical consciousness in children and adolescents, published between 1998 and 2019. Across these studies, major themes included the role of socialization experiences, relationships, and context in the development of critical consciousness. In addition, critical consciousness was associated with a number of adaptive developmental outcomes, including career-related, civic, social-emotional, and academic outcomes-especially for marginalized youth. However, our analysis highlights several critical gaps in the literature. We highlight the need for further delineation of the impacts of parent and peer socialization on critical consciousness in specific developmental periods and for studying critical consciousness at multiple levels of the ecological system. We further note the dearth of rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental studies in the area of interventions to promote critical consciousness. In addition, we note that developmental questions-questions about the nature and function of critical consciousness over time-are largely unanswered in the literature, including questions about how critical consciousness manifests and develops during childhood. Leveraging the findings of our systematic review, we outline key next steps for this rapidly growing area of research.

AB  - Previous literature on growth after major life events has primarily focused on negative experiences and operationalized growth with measures which rely on the post hoc self-perception of change. Because this method is prone to many biases, two questions have become increasingly controversial: Is there genuine growth after major life events and does growth require suffering? The present meta-analysis is the first synthesis of longitudinal research on the effects of life events on at least one subdomain of psychological well-being, posttraumatic, or postecstatic growth. Studies needed to have a longitudinal design, assess changes through independent measures over time, and provide sufficient data to estimate change scores. The present meta-analysis comprises 364 effect sizes from 154 independent samples (total N = 98,436) in 122 longitudinal studies. A positive trend has been found for self-esteem, positive relationships, and mastery in prospective studies after both positive and negative events. We found no general evidence for the widespread conviction that negative life events have a stronger effect than positive ones. No genuine growth was found for meaning and spirituality. In the majority of studies with control groups, results did not significantly differ between event and control group, indicating that changes in the outcome variables cannot simply be attributed to the occurrence of the investigated life events. More controlled prospective studies are necessary to validate the genuine nature of postevent growth. Overall, the meta-analysis provides a systematic overview of the state of life event research and delineates important guidelines for future research on genuine growth.

AB  - We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the cerebral structures required during the recollection of episodic autobiographical memories according to 5 time periods covering the whole lifespan to test the 2 concurring models of memory consolidation, which propose either a temporary (standard model) or a permanent (multiple-trace model) role of the hippocampus in episodic memory retrieval. The experimental paradigm was specially designed to engage subjects (67.17 +/- 5.22 years old) in the retrieval of episodic autobiographical memories, whatever the time period, from personally relevant cues selected by questioning a family member. Moreover, the nature of the memories was checked at debriefing by means of behavioral measures to control the degree of episodicity. Behavioral data showed that recollected memories were characterized by specificity and details whatever their remoteness. Main neuroimaging data (Statistical Parametric Mapping 99) revealed the activation of a network including the left superior frontal gyri, bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate and lingual gyri, left angular gyrus, and left hippocampus, although the subtraction analyses detected subtle differences between certain time periods. Small volume correction centered on the hippocampus detected left hippocampal activation for all time periods and additional right hippocampal activation for the intermediate periods. Further confirmation was provided by using a 3-way analysis of variance on blood oxygen level-dependent values, which revealed hippocampal activation whatever the time interval. The present data challenge the standard model of memory consolidation and support the multiple-trace model, instead. The comparison with previous literature stresses the idea that a bilateral involvement of the hippocampus characterizes rich episodic autobiographical memory recollection.

AB  - Cerebellum was shown to be vulnerable to traumatic brain injury (TBI) in experimental animals. However, the detailed pathological and functional changes within the cerebellum following TBI are not known. Using our established cerebellum fluid percussion injury (FPI) model, we characterized the temporal pattern and the nature of structural damage following FPI, as well as the functional changes of Purkinje cells in response to climbing fiber activation. Our results showed that 60% of Purkinje cells died within the first 24 h following moderate FPI. In contrast, clusters of densely stained shrunken granule cells were stained positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) in 1, 3 or 7 days following FPI animals. We also observed an accompanying structural damage to the cerebellar white matter tract. Disconnected axonal fibers appeared 1 day post-FPI, and loss of white matter fibers were visible 3 and 7 days post-FPI. Massive accumulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) was found in the white matter tracts and molecular layer in the cerebellum of 1, 3 or 7 days FPI animals. Our functional study showed that the majority of Purkinje cells from 1 day and all cells from 3 to 7 days post-FPI had distorted membrane potential and synaptic responses to climbing fiber activation. These results suggested that there is a co-related structural and functional deterioration with a specific temporal pattern in the cerebellum following FPI. These observations provide a basis for future mechanistic investigations aiming to realize neuroprotection from cerebellar neuronal death and loss of cerebellar functionality.

AB  - Substance use disorders (SUDs) represent a critical public and occupational health issue. Therefore, understanding the process of SUD recovery has become an issue of growing importance among substance use and recovery professionals. Nonetheless, despite the acknowledged importance of employment for SUD recovery, little conceptual or empirical work exists on how the workplace might support or undermine SUD recovery. In this article, we address this limitation in several ways. First, to promote a better understanding of SUD recovery for occupational health researchers, we provide a brief overview of the nature of a SUD, prior definitions of SUD recovery, and general themes associated with the recovery process. Second, we develop a working definition of workplace supported recovery. Third, we present a heuristic conceptual model showing how the workplace might impact the SUD recovery process. Fourth, using this model and research from the substance use and occupational health literatures, we develop a series of general research propositions. These propositions highlight broad directions requiring more detailed conceptualization and empirical research to understand better how work conditions may support or undermine the process of employee SUD recovery. Our overarching goal is to motivate innovative conceptualization and research on workplace supported recovery from SUDs. Such research may inform the development and evaluation of workplace interventions and policies supporting SUD recovery and highlight the benefits of workplace supported SUD recovery for employees, employers, and communities. Research on this issue may allow occupational health researchers to impact a significant societal and occupational health issue.

AB  - Infant survival and the development of secure and cooperative relationships are central to the future of the species. In humans, this relies heavily on the evolving early parent-infant social and affective relationship. While much is known about the behavioural and psychological components of this relationship, relatively little is known about the underlying functional neuroanatomy. Affective and social neuroscience has helped to describe the main adult brain networks involved, but has so far engaged very little with developmental findings. In this review, we seek to highlight future avenues for research by providing a coherent framework for describing the parent-infant relationship over the first 18 months. We provide an outline of the evolving nature of the relationship, starting with basic orienting and recognition processes, and culminating in the infant's attainment of higher socio-emotional and cognitive capacities. Key social and affective interactions, such as communication, cooperative play and the establishment of specific attachments propel the development of the parent-infant relationship. We summarise our current knowledge of the developing infant brain in terms of structure and function, and how these relate to the emergent abilities necessary for the formation of a secure and cooperative relationship with parents or other caregivers. Important roles have been found for brain regions including the orbitofrontal, cingulate, and insular cortices in parent-infant interactions, but it has become clear that much more information is needed about the developmental time course and connectivity of these regions.

AB  - At present, coastal disposal of maintenance dredged material constitutes one of the most important problems in coastal zone management and in some coastal areas represents the major anthropogenic disturbance to the benthos. In this review we first propose, based on the classic literature, that macrofaunal communities typical of environmentally stressed habitats are more resilient than those of more environmentally stable habitats, and we outline the macrofaunal successional changes following a disturbance. Second, from a review and analysis of the published and unpublished literature on macrofaunal recovery following maintenance dredged material deposition in the coastal environment, we compare the successional sequences and recovery rates in euhaline and polyhaline systems. The review reveals that invertebrate recovery following dredged material disposal in relatively unstressed marine environments generally takes between 1 and 4 years, while in more naturally stressed areas, recovery is generally achieved within 9 months, although deeper polyhaline habitats can take up to 2 years to recover. Differences in recovery times are attributed to the number of successional stages required to regain the original community composition and that species typical of naturally unstressed assemblages do not possess life-history traits to allow rapid recolonization of disturbances. In the last section of this review, the management implications of these findings are discussed in terms of minimizing dredged material disposal impacts on fisheries resources. Since the natural disturbance regime appears to be very important in determining the response of a benthic community following dredged material disposal, it is recommended that when predicting the potential environmental impact of an operation, the nature of the physical environment in combination with the status (and role) of associated marine benthic communities should be considered.

AB  - In ambiguous situations, infants have the tendency to gather information from a social interaction partner to regulate their behavior [social referencing (SR)]. There are two main competing theories concerning SR's function. According to social-cognitive information-seeking accounts, infants look at social interaction partners to gain information about the ambiguous situation. According to co-regulation accounts, infants look at social interaction partners to receive emotional support. This review provides an overview of the central developments in SR literature in the past years. We focus on the role of situational aspects such as familiarity of SR partners and situational threat, not only for SR (looking), but also for subsequent behavioral regulation (exploration, affect). As the competing accounts make different predictions concerning both contextual factors, this approach may reveal novel insights into the function of SR. Findings showed that a higher familiarity of SR partners consistently resulted in decreased looking (cf. social-cognitive accounts) and that higher threat remains largely understudied, but seemed to increase looking in the first few studies (cf. co-regulation accounts). Concerning behavioral regulation (exploration, affect) findings are mixed. We point out that moving toward a more complex situatedness may help to disentangle the heterogeneous results by considering the interaction between familiarity and threat rather than investigating the factors in isolation. From a general perspective, this review underlines the importance of situational factors and their interaction in eliciting a phenomenon, such as SR, but also in determining the nature of the phenomenon itself.

AB  - Parent-child play interactions in the first years of life are linked to more positive cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes for children. The vast majority of previous research has focussed on mother-infant play interactions, but the potential positive role of fathers' early involvement in children's lives is being increasingly recognised, with higher levels of caregiving by fathers in many countries. To characterise the nature and potential impact of father-child play we undertook a systematic review of the published literature in psychological and educational databases up until 2018. We focussed on studies addressing the frequency and characteristics of fathers' play with children (aged 0-3 years), and the potential impact on children's development. We screened 436 articles, yielding 78 papers addressing the questions of interest. There are 3 key findings. First, fathers spend a significant proportion of their time with their children engaging in playful interactions, often in the form of physical play such as rough and tumble. Second, whilst findings are mixed, on balance the evidence suggests that fathers' play frequency increases from infancy to preschool age with a subsequent decline in play as children reach early- middle childhood. Third, studies investigating links between fathers' play and child outcomes suggest that fathers' play in the early years can positively contribute to children's social, emotional and cognitive outcomes. This potential for substantial benefit for children provides a clear imperative for policy makers and practitioners to facilitate and support fathers, as well as mothers, in developing more positive and playful interactions with their infants.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of adult onset dementia, is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss, decline in language skills, and other cognitive impairments. Although its etiology is not completely known, several factors including deficits of acetylcholine, beta-amyloid deposits, tau-protein phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation are considered to play significant roles in the pathophysiology of this disease. For a long time, AD patients have been treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil (Aricept (R)) but with limited therapeutic success. This might be due to the complex multifactorial nature of AD, a fact that has prompted the design of new Multi-Target-Directed Ligands (MTDL) based on the "one molecule, multiple targets" paradigm. Thus, in this context, different series of novel multifunctional molecules with antioxidant, anti-amyloid, anti-inflammatory, and metal-chelating properties able to interact with multiple enzymes of therapeutic interest in AD pathology including acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and monoamine oxidases A and B have been designed and assessed biologically. This review describes the multiple targets, the design rationale and an in-house MTDL library, bearing the N-benzylpiperidine motif present in donepezil, linked to different heterocyclic ring systems (indole, pyridine, or 8-hydroxyquinoline) with special emphasis on compound ASS234, an N-propargylindole derivative. The description of the in vitro biological properties of the compounds and discussion of the corresponding structure-activity-relationships allows us to highlight new issues for the identification of more efficient MTDL for use in AD therapy.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, which leads to widespread focal lesions of primary demyelination with variable axonal, neuronal and astroglia injury. The mechanisms responsible for tissue injury in the MS brain and spinal cord are only incompletely understood. In this review we discuss that the formation of confluent subpial cortical lesions is the most specific type of tissue damage, which is exclusively present in MS patients. Current data suggest that subpial demyelination is triggered by a soluble factor, which is produced in meningeal inflammatory infiltrates and diffuses into the cortical parenchyma, where it destroys myelin either directly or indirectly through microglia activation. The presence of demyelinating activity in sera and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients is known for decades, but the molecular nature of the possibly underlying demyelinating factor is still unclear. Destruction of myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes as well as neuro-degeneration in MS are associated with massive oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury. Oxidative stress appears to be driven in early MS by activated microglia and oxidative burst and is, in the progressive stage of the disease, amplified by additional factors related to the age of patients and accumulation of pre-existing brain damage. Thus, the demyelinating factor in MS patients may either be a currently unknown cytokine or an inflammatory mediator or, alternatively, a mixture of cytokines. It may activate microglia towards uncontrolled oxygen radical production. Alternatively, the demyelinating factor may by itself trigger demyelination, which is then amplified by oxidative injury. The molecular characterization of the demyelinating factor may provide an important clue for the understanding of MS pathogenesis in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - Tourette syndrome (TS) is a heritable neuropsychiatric disorder that presents in childhood with a constellation of motor and non-motor symptoms. The defining feature of the disorder is the presence of brief, stereotyped, motor or vocal behaviours called tics. Although tics are themselves voluntary, they are typically performed secondary to involuntary sensory symptoms or irresistible urges. TS is therefore said to be a disorder of human volition that likely represents a general failure of inhibition. It shares many features with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and impulse control disorder with which it is also commonly associated. Much of the anatomic substrate for TS probably lies in the circuits that connect multiple areas of cortex with the basal ganglia and thalamus to subserve motivation, inhibition of behaviour, planning of motor acts and detection of threats. To date, pathological studies of TS have been very few and the number of subjects evaluated too small to reliably elucidate the nature and significance of several reported abnormalities. However, evidence derived from both pharmacological trials and selected functional imaging studies suggests that disturbances of the dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems play a key role in the pathogenesis of TS. At the same time, multiple studies have demonstrated reciprocal interactions between the serotonin and dopamine systems of the brain. This information, when placed in the context of the observed functional imaging abnormalities, may generate further insights into the pathophysiology of TS.

AB  - Various stressor produce a wide range of behavioral responses such as analgesia, catalepsy and motor suppression, which are sensitive to opioid receptor antagonists. These behavioral responses in stress are accompanied by changes in the contents of opioid peptides, the mRNAs encoding their precursors and opioid receptor binding in the brain. In the present article, experimental data concerning stress-induced analgesia and motor suppression is reviewed and discussed in relation to a possible involvement of different opioid systems in the various observed behavioral responses in stress. Pharmacological studies with subtype-selective antagonists have demonstrated that not only mu- but also delta- and/or kappa-opioid receptors are involved in opioid-mediated stress-induced analgesia. There are two types of stress-induced analgesia referred to as opioid-mediated and non-opioid mediated forms. It has been proposed that the intensity and temporal pattern of stressor may be a critical factor determining the nature of stress-induced analgesia. Accumulated evidence demonstrate that these two foms of pain inhibitory systems interact each other according to a collateral inhibition model. Recent studies show that parallel activation of multiple opioid receptors mediates non-opioid froms of stress-induced analgesia. Dynorphins, by acting at kappa-opioid receptors, may play a pivotal role in the expression of stress-induced motor suppression, whereas enkephalins may act to attenuate this response.

AB  - Background:The fornix is the primary axonal tract of the hippocampus, connecting it to modulatory subcortical structures. This review reveals that fornix damage causes cognitive deficits that closely mirror those resulting from hippocampal lesions.
   Methods:We reviewed the literature on the fornix, spanning non-human animal lesion research, clinical case studies of human patients with fornix damage, as well as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) work that evaluates fornix microstructure in vivo.
   Results:The fornix is essential for memory formation because it serves as the conduit for theta rhythms and acetylcholine, as well as providing mnemonic representations to deep brain structures that guide motivated behavior, such as when and where to eat. In rodents and non-human primates, fornix lesions lead to deficits in conditioning, reversal learning, and navigation. In humans, damage to the fornix manifests as anterograde amnesia. DWI research reveals that the fornix plays a key role in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease, and can potentially predict conversion from the former to the latter. Emerging DWI findings link perturbations in this structure to schizophrenia, mood disorders, and eating disorders. Cutting-edge research has investigated how deep brain stimulation of the fornix can potentially attenuate memory loss, control epileptic seizures, and even improve mood.
   Conclusions:The fornix is essential to a fully functioning memory system and is implicated in nearly all neurological functions that rely on the hippocampus. Future research needs to use optimized DWI methods to study the fornix in vivo, which we discuss, given the difficult nature of fornix reconstruction.

AB  - Current knowledge on the architecture of exogenous attention (also called automatic, bottom-up, or stimulus-driven attention, among other terms) has been mainly obtained from studies employing neutral, anodyne stimuli. Since, from an evolutionary perspective, exogenous attention can be understood as an adaptive tool for rapidly detecting salient events, reorienting processing resources to them, and enhancing processing mechanisms, emotional events (which are, by definition, salient for the individual) would seem crucial to a comprehensive understanding of this process. This review, focusing on the visual modality, describes 55 experiments in which both emotional and neutral irrelevant distractors are presented at the same time as ongoing task targets. Qualitative and, when possible, meta-analytic descriptions of results are provided. The most conspicuous result is that, as confirmed by behavioral and/or neural indices, emotional distractors capture exogenous attention to a significantly greater extent than do neutral distractors. The modulatory effects of the nature of distractors capturing attention, of the ongoing task characteristics, and of individual differences, previously proposed as mediating factors, are also described. Additionally, studies reviewed here provide temporal and spatial information-partially absent in traditional cognitive models-on the neural basis of preattention/evaluation, reorienting, and sensory amplification, the main subprocesses involved in exogenous attention. A model integrating these different levels of information is proposed. The present review, which reveals that there are several key issues for which experimental data are surprisingly scarce, confirms the relevance of including emotional distractors in studies on exogenous attention.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS), the most frequent genetic disorder leading to mental retardation (MR), is caused by three copies of human chromosome 21 (HC21). Trisomic and transgenic mouse models for DS allow genetic dissection of DS neurological and cognitive disorders in view to identify genes responsible for these phenotypes. The effects of the gene dosage imbalance on DS phenotypes are explained by two hypotheses: the ''gene dosage effect'' hypothesis claims that a DS critical region, containing a subset of dosage-sensitive genes, determines DS phenotypes, and the ''amplified developmental instability'' hypothesis holds that HC21 trisomy determines general alteration in developmental homeostasis. Transcriptome and expression studies showed different up- or down-expression levels of genes located on HC21 and the other disomic chromosomes. HC21 genes, characterized by their overexpression in brain regions affected in DS patients and by their contribution to neurological and cognitive defects when overexpressed in mouse models, are proposed herein as good candidates for MR. In this article, we propose a new molecular and cellular mechanism explaining MR pathogenesis in DS. In this model, gene dosage imbalance effects on transcriptional variations are described considering the nature of gene products and their functional relationships. These transcriptional variations may affect different aspects of neuronal differentiation and metabolism and finally, determine the brain neuropathologies and mental retardation in DS.

AB  - Even though studies have shown that prenatal maternal stress is associated with increased reactivity of the HPA axis, the association between prenatal maternal stress and fetal glucocorticoid exposure is complex and most likely dependent on unidentified and poorly understood variables including nature and timing of prenatal insults. The precise mechanisms in which prenatal maternal stress influence neuroendocrine signaling between the maternal-placental-fetal interface are still unclear. The aim of this review article is to bring comprehensive basic concepts about prenatal maternal stress and mechanisms of transmission of maternal stress to the fetus. This review covers recent studies showing associations between maternal stress and alterations in offspring aggressive behavior, as well as the possible pathways for the "transmission" of maternal stress to the fetus: (1) maternal-fetal HPA axis dysregulation; (2) intrauterine environment disruption due to variations in uterine artery flow; (3) epigenetic modifications of genes implicated in aggressive behavior. Here, we present evidence for the phenomenon of intergenerational and transgenerational transmission, to better understands the mechanism(s) of transmission from parent to offspring. We discuss studies showing associations between maternal stress and alterations in offspring taking note of neuroendocrine, brain architecture and epigenetic changes that may suggest risk for aggressive behavior. We highlight animal and human studies that focus on intergenerational transmission following exposure to stress from a biological mechanistic point of view, and maternal stress-induced epigenetic modifications that have potential to impact on aggressive behavior in later generations.

AB  - Despite putative gender differences in the expression of narcissism, prominent theories have virtually dismissed the role of females in the development and manifestation of narcissism. The contention that narcissism is a pathology of the self that may partly differ in males and females is further evident in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The DSM-5 reports that up to 75% of those diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) are men. Such figures suggest that the representation of narcissism as codified in the DSM-5 may only be marginally applicable to females, given its prominent focus and nature on capturing grandiose themes which closely resemble commonly masculine norms. The overemphasis on grandiose features extends to the empirical literature which defines narcissism as a normative personality trait and is widely assessed using the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI), on which males obtain significantly higher scores than females. As this review will demonstrate, one limitation frequently occurring in the literature is the attempt to comprehend narcissistic manifestations in females through the lens of what has commonly been defined as narcissism (DSM/NPI). In this review, the literature concerning the diagnostic assessment and conceptualisation of narcissistic personality disorder, aetiological factors, aggression, and partner violence perpetration will be discussed in relation to the importance of gender. This is followed by a review of existing gaps in theory and research, and suggestions for fruitful directions that can aid a richer and more meaningful literature on narcissism inclusive of gender issues.

AB  - The role of disgust in moral psychology has been a matter of much controversy and experimentation over the past 20 or so years. We present here an integrative look at the literature, organized according to the four functions of emotion proposed by integrative functional theory: appraisal, associative, self-regulation, and communicative. Regarding appraisals, we review experimental, personality, and neuroscientific work that has shown differences between elicitors of disgust and anger in moral contexts, with disgust responding more to bodily moral violations such as incest, and anger responding more to sociomoral violations such as theft. We also present new evidence for interpreting the phenomenon of sociomoral disgust as an appraisal of bad character in a person. The associative nature of disgust is shown by evidence for "unreasoning disgust," in which associations to bodily moral violations are not accompanied by elaborated reasons, and not modified by appraisals such as harm or intent. We also critically examine the literature about the ability of incidental disgust to intensify moral judgments associatively. For disgust's self-regulation function, we consider the possibility that disgust serves as an existential defense, regulating avoidance of thoughts that might threaten our basic self-image as living humans. Finally, we discuss new evidence from our lab that moral disgust serves a communicative function, implying that expressions of disgust serve to signal one's own moral intentions even when a different emotion is felt internally on the basis of appraisal. Within the scope of the literature, there is evidence that all four functions of Giner-Sorolla's (2012) integrative functional theory of emotion may be operating, and that their variety can help explain some of the paradoxes of disgust.

AB  - The genetic, biological, and environmental backgrounds of an organism fundamentally influence the balance between risk and resilience to stress. Sex, age, and environment transact with responses to trauma in ways that can mitigate or exacerbate the likelihood that post-traumatic stress disorder will develop. Translational approaches to modeling affective disorders in animals will ultimately provide novel treatments and a better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings behind these debilitating disorders. The extant literature on trauma/stress has focused predominately on limbic and cortical structures that innervate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and influence glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback. It is through these neuroendocrine pathways that a self-perpetuating fear memory can propagate the long-term effects of early life trauma. Recent work incorporating translational approaches has provided novel pathways that can be influenced by early life stress, such as the glucocorticoid receptor chaperones, including FKBP51. Animal models of stress have differing effects on behavior and endocrine pathways; however, complete models replicating clinical characteristics of risk and resilience have not been rigorously studied. This review discusses a four-factor model that considers the importance of studying both risk and resilience in understanding the developmental response to trauma/stress. Consideration of the multifactorial nature of clinical populations in the design of preclinical models and the application of preclinical findings to clinical treatment approaches comprise the core of translational reciprocity, which is discussed in the context of the four-factor model.

AB  - Autobiographical memory (AM) entails a complex set of operations, including episodic memory, self-reflection, emotion, visual imagery, attention, executive functions, and semantic processes. The heterogeneous nature of AM poses significant challenges in capturing its behavioral and neuroanatomical correlates. Investigators have recently turned their attention to the functional neuroanatomy of AM. We used the effect-location method of meta-analysis to analyze data from 24 functional imaging studies of AM. The results indicated a core neural network of left-lateralized regions, including the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal, medial and lateral temporal and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortices, the temporoparietal junction and the cerebellum. Secondary and tertiary regions, less frequently reported in imaging studies of AM, are also identified. We examined the neural correlates of putative component processes in AM, including, executive functions, self-reflection, episodic remembering and visuospatial processing. We also separately analyzed the effect of select variables on the AM network across individual studies, including memory age, qualitative factors (personal significance, level of detail and vividness), semantic and emotional content, and the effect of reference conditions. We found that memory age effects on medial temporal lobe structures may be modulated by qualitative aspects of memory. Studies using rest as a control task masked process-specific components of the AM neural network. Our findings support a neural distinction between episodic and semantic memory in AM. Finally, emotional events produced a shift in lateralization of the AM network with activation observed in emotion-centered regions and deactivation (or lack of activation) observed in regions associated with cognitive processes.

AB  - In the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in research effectively integrating cognitive psychology, functional neuroimaging, and behavioral neurology. This new work is typically conducting basic research into aspects of the human mind and brain. The present review features as examples of such integrations two series of studies by the author and his colleagues. One series, employing object recognition, mental motor imagery, and mental rotation paradigms, clarifies the nature of a cognitive process, imagined spatial transformations used in shape recognition. Among other implications, it suggests that when recognizing a hand's handedness, imagining one's body movement depends on cerebrally lateralized sensory-motor structures and deciding upon handedness depends on exact match shape confirmation. The other series, using cutaneous, tactile, and auditory pitch discrimination paradigms, elucidates the function of a brain structure, the cerebellum. It suggests that the cerebellum has non-motor sensory support functions upon which optimally fine sensory discriminations depend. Tn addition, six key issues for this integrative approach are reviewed. These include arguments for the value and greater use of: rigorous quantitative meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies; stereotactic coordinate-based data, as opposed to surface landmark-based data; standardized vocabularies capturing the elementary component operations of cognitive and behavioral tasks; functional hypotheses about brain areas that are consistent with underlying microcircuitry; an awareness that not all brain areas implicated by neuroimaging or neurology are necessarily directly involved in the associated cognitive or behavioral task; and systematic approaches to integrations of this kind.

AB  - Background: A variety of psychosocial interventions have been developed to promote better adjustment to breast cancer (BC) and their efficacy has been demonstrated repeatedly. However, the effect sizes (ES) vary considerably across studies. Purpose: This article intends to shed light on potential moderators of intervention efficacy for BC patients, such as the intervention type (e.g., education, supportive), the composition of the sample (only BC patients or BC mixed with other cancer types), and the practitioner of the intervention (psychologist, nonpsychologist). Methods: Fifty-six randomized-controlled studies investigating the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions with adult BC patients were meta-analytically reviewed Results: The overall ES of d = 0.26 was similar to previous meta-analyses and moderated by several variables. The ES varied notably based on the composition of the sample, the profession offering the intervention, and the type of intervention. Studies with samples consisting of only BC patients and studies with nonpsychologist-led interventions showed lower ES. Psychoeducation yielded the strongest ES. These moderators maintained their significance even when controlling for the nature of the control group, the format of the intervention, the timing of the intervention, or the stage of disease. Conclusions: These results suggest that among current interventions, psychoeducation is a treatment of choice for BC patients, preferably prior to surgery and led by individuals with a medical expertise. Other psychosocial interventions appear most effective when administered individually and led by a psychologist. In addition, there is a need for improved psychosocial interventions to enhance the present ES for women with BC.

AB  - Objective. - The review aims to identify the extent and nature of research on mental disorders and their care in immigrant populations in three major European countries with high levels of immigration, i.e. Germany, Italy, United Kingdom (UK).
   Method. - Peer-reviewed publications on the subject from the three countries between 1996 and 2004 were analyzed. The research questions addressed, the methods used, and the results obtained were assessed.
   Results. - Thirteen papers reporting empirical studies were found from Germany, four from Italy and 95 front the UK. Studies addressed a range of research questions and most frequently assessed rates of service utilization in different immigrant groups, The most consistent finding is a higher rate of hospital admissions for Afro-Caribbean patients in the UK. Many studies had serious methodological shortcomings with low sample sizes and unspecified inclusion criteria.
   Discussion. - Despite large scale immigration in each of the three studied countries. the numbers of relevant research publications vary greatly with a relatively high level of empirical research in the UK. Possible reasons for this are it generally stronger Culture of mental health service research and a higher number of researchers who are themselves front immigrant backgrounds ill the UK,
   Conclusion. - Overall the evidence base to guide the development of mental health services for immigrant populations appears limited. Future research requires appropriate funding, should be of sufficient methodological quality and may benefit from collaboration across Europe. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, cardiovascular disease (CND) is a health hazard that is associated with progressive deterioration upon exposure to environmental pollutants. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DRIP) has been one of the focuses of emerging concern due to its ubiquitous nature and its toxicity to the cardiovascular (CV) system. DR IP has been noted as a causative risk factor or a risk indicator for the initiation and augment of CVDs. DEHP represents a precursor that contributes to the pathogenesis of CVDs through its active metabolites, which mainly include mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP). Herein, we systematically presented the association between DEHP and its metabolites and adverse CV outcomes and discussed the corresponding effects, underlying mechanisms and possibly interventions. Epidemiological and experimental evidence has suggested that DEHP and its metabolites have significant impacts on processes and factors involved in CVD, such as cardiac developmental toxicity, cardiac injury and apoptosis, cardiac arrhythmogenesis, cardiac metabolic disorders, vascular stnictural damage, atherogencsis, coronary heart disease and hypertension. DNA methylation, PPAR-related pathways, oxidative stress and inflammation, Ca2+ homeostasis disturbance may pinpoint the relevant mechanisms. The preventive and therapeutic measures am potentially related with P-glycoprotcin, heatshock proteins, some antioxidants, curcumin, apigcnin, beta-thujaplicin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and Ang-convcrting enzyme inhibitors and so on. Promisingly, future investigations should aid in thoroughly assessing the causal relationship and molecular interactions between CVD and DEHP and its metabolites and explore feasible prevention and treatment measures accordingly.

AB  - Research over the last decades has shown that humans and other animals reveal behavioral and emotional responses to unequal reward distributions between themselves and other conspecifics. However, cross-species findings about the mechanisms underlying such inequity aversion are heterogeneous, and there is an ongoing discussion if inequity aversion represents a truly social phenomenon or if it is driven by non-social aspects of the task. There is not even general consensus whether inequity aversion exists in non-human animals at all. In this review article, we discuss variables that were found to affect inequity averse behavior in animals and examine mechanistic and evolutionary theories of inequity aversion. We review a range of moderator variables and focus especially on the comparison of social vs. non-social explanations of inequity aversion. Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of considering the experimental design when interpreting behavior in inequity aversion tasks: the tasks used to probe inequity aversion are often based on impunity-game-like designs in which animals are faced with unfair reward distributions, and they can choose to accept the unfair offer, or reject it, leaving them with no reward. We compare inequity-averse behavior in such impunity-game-like designs with behavior in less common choice-based designs in which animals actively choose between fair and unfair rewards distributions. This review concludes with a discussion of the different mechanistic explanations of inequity aversion, especially in light of the particular features of the different task designs, and we give suggestions on experimental requirements to understand the "true nature" of inequity aversion.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the leading causes of deaths in Southeast Asian countries including India. Exposure to air pollutants affects vital cellular mechanisms and is intimately linkedwith the etiology of a number of chronic diseases. Earlier work from our laboratory has shown that airborne particulate matter disturbs the mitochondrial machinery and causes significant damage to the epigenome. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species possess the ability to trigger redox-sensitive signaling mechanisms and induce irreversible epigenomic changes. The electrophilic nature of reactive metabolites can directly result in deprotonation of cytosine at C-5 position or interfere with the DNA methyltransferases activity to cause alterations in DNA methylation. In addition, it also perturbs level of cellular metabolites critically involved in different epigenetic processes like acetylation and methylation of histone code and DNA hypo or hypermethylation. Interestingly, these modifications may persist through downstream generations and result in the transgenerational epigenomic inheritance. This phenomenon of subsequent transfer of epigenetic modifications is mainly associated with the germ cells and relies on the germline stability of the epigenetic states. Overall, the recent literature supports, and arguably strengthens, the contention that air pollution might contribute to transmission of epimutations from gametes to zygotes by involving mitochondrial DNA, parental allele imprinting, histone withholding and non-coding RNAs. However, larger prospective studies using innovative, integrated epigenome-wide metabolomic strategy are highly warranted to assess the air pollution induced transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and associated human health effects.

AB  - The review paper, summaries the results of heavy metal concentration reported by several authors in the soils of North Indian states viz. Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, and crop response towards different heavy metal exposure. The metals which are included in this review study are mainly Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Co, Mo, V, Cr, Pb, Cd,, and As. Different essential and non-essential metals in soil pose different toxic effects on the plants if present in exceeded concentrations. The level of toxicity varies from crop to crop and from metal to metal. Also the physico-chemical parameters of soils viz., pH, CEC, texture and organic matter influence the uptake of metals. Studies reveal that although the soils of North India are highly productive in nature, but the concentration of some heavy metals was found crossing the permissible limits at different locations. The cause of heavy metal contamination in different regions of North India is anthropogenic which includes the discharge of sewage sludge, fly ash, untreated industrial waste disposal on agricultural land, extensive use of agrochemicals, fertilizer, pesticides used in the agriculture processes. As the soils of Northern India are highly fertile and are in a threat of contamination, a detailed literature survey has been carried out to assess the contamination level and crop response to bring the attention of regulatory bodies and policy makers to take possible measures to prevent further contamination of the soils.

AB  - Stroke poses a serious threat to human health and burdens both society and the healthcare system. Standard rehabilitative therapies may not be effective in improving functions after stroke, so alternative strategies are needed. The FDA has approved vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for the treatment of epilepsy, migraines, and depression. Recent studies have demonstrated that VNS can facilitate the benefits of rehabilitation interventions. VNS coupled with upper limb rehabilitation enhances the recovery of upper limb function in patients with chronic stroke. However, its invasive nature limits its clinical application. Researchers have developed a non-invasive method to stimulate the vagus nerve (non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, nVNS). It has been suggested that nVNS coupled with rehabilitation could be a promising alternative for improving muscle function in chronic stroke patients. In this article, we review the current researches in preclinical and clinical studies as well as the potential applications of nVNS in stroke. We summarize the parameters, advantages, potential mechanisms, and adverse effects of current nVNS applications, as well as the future challenges and directions for nVNS in cerebral stroke treatment. These studies indicate that nVNS has promising efficacy in reducing stroke volume and attenuating neurological deficits in ischemic stroke models. While more basic and clinical research is required to fully understand its mechanisms of efficacy, especially Phase III trials with a large number of patients, these data suggest that nVNS can be applied easily not only as a possible secondary prophylactic treatment in chronic cerebral stroke, but also as a promising adjunctive treatment in acute cerebral stroke in the near future.

AB  - Landfill has become an underlying source of surface and groundwater pollution if not efficiently managed, due to the risk of leachate infiltration into to land and aquifers. The generated leachate is considered a serious environmental threat for the public health, because of the toxic and recalcitrant nature of its constituents. Thus, it must be collected and appropriately treated before being discharged into the environment. At present, there is no single unit process available for proper leachate treatment as conventional wastewater treatment processes cannot achieve a satisfactory level for degrading toxic substances present. Therefore, there is a growing interest in examination of different leachate treatment processes for maximum operational flexibility. Based on leachate characteristics, discharge requirements, technical possibilities, regulatory requirements and financial considerations, several techniques have been applied for its degradation, presenting varying degrees of efficiency. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive review of existing research articles on the pros and cons of various leachate degradation methods. In line with environmental sustainability, the article stressed on the application and efficiency of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system treating landfill leachate due to its operational flexibility, resistance to shock loads and high biomass retention. Contributions of integrated leachate treatment technologies with SBR were also discussed. The article further analyzed the effect of different adopted materials, processes, strategies and configurations on leachate treatment. Environmental and operational parameters that affect SBR system were critically discussed. It is believed that information contained in this review will increase readers fundamental knowledge, guide future researchers and be incorporated into future works on experimentally-based SBR studies for leachate treatment.

AB  - Arsenic (As) is one of the highly toxic metalloids distributed ubiquitously in nature. Two inorganic forms of As are present abundantly: arsenite (As-III) and arsenate (As-V), former being 100 times more toxic than latter. Arsenic is a well known inducer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in crop plants either directly during conversion of AsV to AsIII or indirectly via inactivation of the antioxidants by binding to their thiol groups. Arsenic-mediated oxidative stress causes an array of metabolic dysfunctions in plants. Therefore, in recent years, demonstration of various mechanisms to improve crop productivity and/or alleviation of As toxicity has become a prime concern. Modulation of cellular thiol molecules for protection against ROS-induced damage has been used as a strategy against As. Accrual of proline, polyphenols and exogenous application of salicylic acid, nitric oxide, phosphate and potassium show protection against As-mediated injuries in crop plants. Proline, nitric oxide and salicylic acid display defensive functions by activating antioxidant machinery of crop plants whereas phosphate and potassium reduce As toxicity by controlling As-uptake or maintaining cellular protein and antioxidant enzymes in plants. Likewise, polyphenols serve as antioxidants and reduce activities of ROS synthesizing enzymes, thereby confering As-stress tolerance. In this review we have attempted to collate recent advances on 1) mechanism( s) of As uptake by plants, 2) toxicity responses [physiological, biochemical and molecular] exerted by As, and 3) roles of varied molecules in amelioration of As effects in crop plants. Gaps in the existing knowledge and future research prospects have also been highlighted in this review.

AB  - Exposure to chronic arsenic toxicity is associated with cancer. Although unstable genome is a characteristic feature of cancer cells, the mechanisms leading to genomic instability in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis are poorly understood. While there are excellent reviews relating to genomic instability in general, there is no comprehensive review presenting the mechanisms involved in arsenic-induced genomic instability. This review was undertaken to present the current state of research in this area and to highlight the major mechanisms that may involved in arsenic-induced genomic instability leading to cancer. Genomic instability is broadly classified into chromosomal instability (CIN), primarily associated with mitotic errors; and microsatellite instability (MIN), associated with DNA level instability. Arsenic-induced genomic instability is essentially multi-factorial in nature and involves molecular cross-talk across several cellular pathways, and is modulated by a number of endogenous and exogenous factors. Arsenic and its metabolites generate oxidative stress, which in turn induces genomic instability through DNA damage, irreversible DNA repair, telomere dysfunction, mitotic arrest and apoptosis. In addition to genetic alteration; epigenetic regulation through promoter methylation and miRNA expression alters gene expression profiling leading to genome more vulnerable and unstable towards cancer risk. Moreover, mutations or silencing of pro-apoptotic genes can lead to genomic instability by allowing survival of damaged cells that would otherwise die. Although a large body of information is now generated regarding arsenic-induced carcinogenesis; further studies exploring genome-wide association, role of environment and diet are needed for a better understanding of the arsenic-induced genomic (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Risk and loss aversion are phenomena with an important influence on decision-making, especially in economic contexts. At present, it remains unclear whether both are related, as well as whether they could have an emotional origin. The objective of this review, following the PRISMA statements, is to find consistencies in the genetic bases of risk and loss aversion with the aim of understanding their nature and shedding light on the above issues. A total of 23 empirical research met the inclusion criteria and were included from PubMed and ScienceDirect. All of them reported genetic measures from human samples and studied risk and loss aversion within an economic framework. The results for risk aversion, although with many limitations, attributed mainly to their heterogeneity and the lack of control in the studies, point to the implication of multiple polymorphisms related to the regulation of the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. In general, studies found the highest levels of risk aversion were associated with alleles that are linked to lower (higher) sensitivity or levels of dopamine (serotonin). For loss aversion, the scarcity of results prevents us from drawing clear conclusions, although the limited evidence seems to point in the same direction as for risk aversion. Therefore, it seems that risk aversion could have a stable genetical base which, in turn, is closely linked to emotions, but more research is needed to answer whether this phenomenon is related to loss aversion, as well as if the latter could also have an emotional origin. We also provide recommendations for future studies on genetics and economic behavior.

AB  - Purpose Psychotic disorders, which are associated with substantially increased morbidity and mortality, are up to five times more common in some ethnic minority groups compared with the white majority in Western countries. This long-standing and well-replicated public mental health disparity has hitherto largely eluded adequate explanation. We argue that this might have arisen in part due to the lack of attention given to theoretical work characterising the complex and multidimensional social nature of ethnicity by those epidemiological investigations that have dominated the literature. Methods To bridge this gap, we draw on theoretical and empirical literature from across the social sciences considering the ontological significance of ethnicity (as biology, migration, racialised structures and identity) and its relationships with psychotic disorders to illuminate probable drivers of excess psychosis risk. Results The largest gains in our theoretical understanding of excess psychosis risk among ethnic minority groups are to be made by considering ethnicity in relation to disempowerment resulting from structural and identity-based exclusion. The former is readily studied through the social gradient in health: socioeconomic disadvantage clusters in some ethnic minorities and increases the risk of poor health outcomes, including psychosis. Furthermore, limitations on identity acquisition and expression imposed by the ethnic majority can further contribute to alienate ethnic minorities and increase psychosocial disempowerment (a lack of control over one's life). Conclusion We theorise that structural and identity-based exclusion act as the primary drivers shaping variation in rates of psychotic disorder by ethnic minority status.

AB  - The cerebellum is commonly studied in the context of the classical eyeblink conditioning model, which attributes an adaptive motor function to cerebellar learning processes. This model of cerebellar function has quite a few shortcomings and may in fact be somewhat deficient in explaining the myriad functions attributed to the cerebellum, functions ranging from motor sequencing to emotion and cognition. The involvement of the cerebellum in these motor and non-motor functions has been demonstrated in both animals and humans in electrophysiological, behavioral, tracing, functional neuroimaging, and PET studies, as well as in clinical human case studies. A closer look at the cerebellum's evolutionary origin provides a clue to its underlying purpose as a tool which evolved to aid predation rather than as a tool for protection. Based upon this evidence, an alternative model of cerebellar function is proposed, one which might more comprehensively account both for the cerebellum's involvement in a myriad of motor, affective, and cognitive functions and for the relative simplicity and ubiquitous repetitiveness of its circuitry. This alternative model suggests that the cerebellum has the ability to detect coincidences of events, be they sensory, motor, affective, or cognitive in nature, and, after having learned to associate these, it can then trigger (or "mirror") these events after having temporally adjusted their onset based on positive/negative reinforcement. The model also provides for the cerebellum's direction of the proper and uninterrupted sequence of events resulting from this learning through the inhibition of efferent structures (as demonstrated in our lab).

TI  - "Separate Families, Separate Worlds, the Same Native Space": Aspects of the South African Short Story
AB  - This review article attempts to discuss the sixty-odd stories in Michael Chapman's A Century of South African Short Stories from a unifying perspective. While conceding that Chapman's emphasis on the short story as primarily the vehicle of "the fragment, the irresolute moment" does render the sense of a fragmentary and often divided society, the essay seeks to establish a dialogue amongst the stories on the related stresses of land and family. Through a brief discussion of most of the stories in the collection, the essay seeks to show how, in a single century, the short story has reflected the changing priorities, values and political realities of South Africa. In the process, too, the story itself has changed its nature from something close to Walter Benjamin's notion of the story-teller as counsellor and sage to something more akin to the perplexity Benjamin associates with the novel as genre.
   What the generous selection in this collection makes possible is a tracing of the wellknown movement from a rural to an urban culture, often in terms of the impact of that dynamism on the institution of the family. To best render this process as process, the discussion is roughly chronological, though a more synchronic approach is necessitated at times by the varieties of connection and contrast generated by the eclecticism of the collection.
   Though, of course, a collection like this argues no case and supplies no answers, the essay argues that it encourages and facilitates new perspectives on old questions by the unpredictable way in which story connects to story and all stories relate back to the land and the people inhabiting it.

AB  - One of the most important findings in recent years regarding response selection is that stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effects occur for situations in which stimulus and response sets vary along orthogonal dimensions. For two-choice tasks, two types of orthogonal SRC effects are found: an overall advantage for the up-right/down-left mapping, and mapping preferences that vary as a function of position of the response apparatus and responding hand. We review evidence regarding the nature of both types of orthogonal SRC effects. Only asymmetric coding accounts have been proposed for the up-right/down-left advantage, and the evidence indicates that th is asymmetry is a property of both verbal and spatial codes. Motoric and coding accounts, as well as a hybrid account based on end-state comfort, have been proposed for the second type of orthogonal SRC effect. In this case, the effects of response-apparatus position, hand, and hand posture conform more closely to predictions of the asymmetric coding accounts than to those of the motoric accounts. We also evaluate the mechanisms proposed by the alternative accounts in terms of related literature on the properties of spatial and verbal codes. Evidence indicates that spatial information is represented in categorical and coordinate codes, and both categorical spatial codes and verbal codes are asymmetric. Experiments on mental rotation suggest that it is unlikely that the direction of rotation is determined automatically by movement constraints, as the end-state comfort hypothesis suggests. An explanation in terms of salient features and referential coding can accommodate the range of orthogonal SRC effects.

AB  - Research on psychological flow is well established, although criticisms remain regarding conceptual and measurement issues associated with the construct. This scoping review maps flow-related research across scientific disciplines, examining the conceptualization, measurement instruments, and outcomes of flow between 2012 and 2019. Across 236 sources that met the review criteria, 108 different flow-related constructs were measured by 141 instruments, and 84 possible antecedents were identified. Despite the varied approaches, a common set of overarching antecedent constructs included "optimal challenge" and "high motivation," and recurring characteristics of the flow experience itself included "absorption," "effort-less control," and "intrinsic reward." Applied studies-albeit inconsistent in approach and largely correlational in nature-predominantly linked flow to "positive development" (i.e., well-being and health), "high functioning," and "further engagement." We contextualize the findings of the review relative to important work on flow that has recently emerged (following the review period)-in doing so, we hope this review offers a contemporary framework that can be used for the study of flow across scientific disciplines.
   Public Significance Statement This review scopes flow research across all scientific disciplines and identifies key commonalities and differences in how researchers have conceptualized the psychological state of flow-an optimal experience often referred to as being "in the zone." It addresses inconsistencies and concerns of practical application that characterize some contemporary flow-related models and studies. This review also provides a framework--derived from the findings of the review--for the study of flow antecedents and experiential dimensions.

AB  - Child welfare workers (CWWs) often work under conditions similar in nature to workers within safety critical organizations (SCOs). This is because most of their work surrounds child neglect, securing homes for foster children, haphazard, and intricate cases, among other things, and where making wrong decisions, inattention to details, and the likes could lead to adverse consequences especially for the kids within their care. Research has shown that employees who experience support at work often report less stress symptoms, burnout, and a host of other negative workplace experiences. Experience of support at work has also been found to boost employees' retention, job satisfaction, and productivity. Despite this development, research exploring the essence of workplace support among CWW is very scarce in the literature, and we know very little about the type of workplace support and their influence on a host of workplace outcomes, especially the negative ones like secondary traumatic stress, aggression, and violence toward CWWs. The purpose of the current scoping review was to uncover what is known about workplace support and their relationship with workplace outcomes among CWWs. The authors explored four databases and identified 55 primary studies investigating workplace support and workplace outcomes among CWWs in the review. Studies mostly framed support under three main support types of coworker/peer support, social/organizational/management support, and supervisor/leadership support. Findings showed that workplace support has a positive impact on workplace variables like job satisfaction, engagement, commitment, and reduces the risk of turnover, burnout, and other negative workplace variables. The review highlights possible directions for future research.

AB  - The visible burrow system (VBS) is an ethologically relevant social stress model that creates a distinct dominance hierarchy in rats. Randall Sakai's laboratory performed an impressive series of studies documenting the very different impact of VBS exposure on the brain and behavior of dominants (DOM) and subordinates (SUBs). Hierarchy formation causes pronounced changes in metabolism in SUBs relative to both DOMs and unstressed controls, resulting in marked weight loss and metabolic imbalance. Stress testing revealed multiple phenotypes in the VBS, including DOMs, stress-responsive SUBs and stress-non-responsive SUBs. Stress-responsive SUBs have adrenal hypertrophy and elevated baseline corticosterone, consistent with prolonged HPA axis activation; however, peak acute stress responses are not sensitized. In contrast, stress non-responsive individuals do not mount a response to an acute stress, suggesting HPA axis hypofunction. In brain, SUBs exhibit a pattern of gene regulation consistent with impaired stress inhibition (e.g., hippocampal adrenocorticosteroid receptor down-regulation and dendritic retraction) and drive of stress pathways (e.g., increased locus coeruleus tyrosine hydroxylase expression). The non-responsive phenotype is distinguished by down-regulation of paraventricular nucleus corticotropin releasing hormone expression and enhanced neuropeptide Y expression in amygdala. The brain 'signature' created by VBS hierarchy formation differed substantially from that of another Well-studied chronic stress model (chronic variable stress). Thus, the impact of VBS is mediated by neurocircuit mechanisms at least in part distinct that of other chronic stress modalities, and suggests that the nature of the stressor may be an essential consideration in development of treatment strategies for stress-related diseases.

AB  - Exposure of organisms to repetitive mild hypoxia results in development of brain hypoxic/ischemic tolerance and cross-tolerance to injurious factors of a psycho emotional nature. Such preconditioning by mild hypobaric hypoxia functions as a "warning" signal which prepares an organism, and in particular the brain, to subsequent more harmful conditions. The endogenous defense processes which are mobilized by hypoxic preconditioning and result in development of brain tolerance are based on evolutionarily acquired gene determined mechanisms of adaptation and neuroprotection. They involve an activation of intracellular cascades including kinases, transcription factors and changes in expression of multiple regulatory proteins in susceptible areas of the brain. On the other hand they lead to multilevel modifications of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal endocrine axis regulating various functions in the organism. All these components are engaged sequentially in the initiation, induction and expression of hypoxia-induced tolerance. A special role belongs to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, in particular of histone acetylation leading to changes in chromatin structure which ensure access of pro-adaptive transcription factors activated by preconditioning to the promoters of target genes. Mechanisms of another, relatively novel, neuroprotective phenomenon termed hypoxic postconditioning (an application of mild hypoxic episodes after severe insults) are still largely unknown but according to recent data they involve apoptosis-related proteins, hypoxia-inducible factor and neurotrophins. The fundamental data accumulated to date and discussed in this review open new avenues for elaboration of the effective therapeutic applications of hypoxic pre- and postconditioning.

AB  - Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome that involves a combination of emotional and physical symptoms that result in significant functional impairment. Because of the debilitating nature of PMDD, multiple treatment options have been considered. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these therapeutic regimens to help health care professionals provide adequate treatment for PMDD and premenstrual syndrome. The treatments that are reviewed are organized into the following categories: psychiatric, anovulatory, supplements, herbal, nonpharmacological, and other. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been established as the first-line treatment for PMDD. Although luteal phase or continuous dosing can be used, additional research is needed to more thoroughly compare the efficacies and differential symptom response of continuous, semi-intermittent, luteal phase, and symptoms-onset dosing. The psychiatric medications venlafaxine, duloxetine, alprazolam, and buspirone have also been found to be useful treatments for PMDD. Various anovulatory-related treatments have demonstrated efficacy; however, the use of some of these treatments remains limited due to potential side effects and/or the availability of cheaper alternatives. Although a variety of supplement and herbal-related treatments have been proposed, with some warranting further research, at this time only calcium supplementation has demonstrated a consistent therapeutic benefit. In conclusion, serotoninergic antidepressants have been established as the first-line treatment option for PMDD; however, there are a variety of additional treatment options that should be considered if a patient fails to achieve an adequate therapeutic response with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

KW  - projection
KW  - object relationship
AB  - Love is a delicate experience that delves into the foundations of the psyche, and many sources of the emotional experience of love remain unconscious. The nature of love is twofold and contradictory, regressive and progressive, constructive and destructive, connecting and separating, directed toward the object and the self. The ability to idealize is a precondition for "falling in love". Abrupt disappointments can be traumatizing, but gradual ones include the work of mourning and may lead to a more authentic relationship that is less obscured by narcissistic needs. Some aspects of projective identification, which can be a defense, a primitive form of object relation, and a path for psychological change, may be present in all forms of love. These are the close interaction of self and object, blurred boundaries between them, the need that the other person feels what one feels, and a strong desire to continue the relationship. A therapeutic setting can enable the long-term transformation of love in transference and more mature expressions of love in life. The maturation of narcissism is the hallmark of mature love. One of the prerequisites for mature love is a mature superego, which does not require suffering as a prerequisite for satisfying one's needs. Clear differentiation of the boundaries of the self enables safe (temporary) blurring or disappearing of its boundaries and satisfaction of needs for repetition of lost fusion with the primary object of love. Mature love also means the capacity for tolerating ambivalence, i.e., the capacity to integrate both love and hatred experiences of the same person. One can see love as a "glue" that helps integrate different aspects of the psyche into a harmonious whole.

AB  - Hypoxia, which occurs in the brain when oxygen availability drops below the normal level, is a major cause of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII). The transcriptional factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a key regulator in the pathophysiological response to the Stress of hypoxia. Genes regulated by HIF-1 are involved in energy metabolism, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, vasodilatation, cell survival and apoptosis. Compared with the adult brain, the neonatal brain is different in physiological structure, function, cellular composition and signaling pathway related gene activation and response after hypoxia. The purpose of this review is to determine if developmental Susceptibility of the brain after hypoxic/ischemic injury is related to HIF-1 alpha, which also plays a pivotal role in the normal brain development. HIF-1 alpha regulates both prosurvival and prodeath responses in the neonatal brain and Various mechanisms underlie the apparent contradictory effects, including duration of ischemic injury and severity, cell-types, and/or dependent on the nature of the stimulus after HII. Studies report an excessive induction of HIF-1 in the immature brain, which suggests that a cell death promoting role of HIF may prevail. Inhibition of HIF-1 alpha and targeted activation of its prosurvival genes appear as a favorable therapeutic strategy. However, a better understanding of multifaceted HIF-1 function during brain development is required to explore potential targets for further therapeutic interventions in the neonate.

AB  - Background: The link between heat exposure and adverse health outcomes in workers is well documented and a growing body of epidemiological evidence from various countries suggests that extreme heat may also contribute to increased risk of occupational injuries (OI). Previously, there have been no comparative reviews assessing the risk of OI due to extreme heat within a wide range of global climate zones. The present review therefore aims to summarise the existing epidemiological evidence on the impact of extreme heat (hot temperatures and heatwaves (HW)) on OI in different climate zones and to assess the individual risk factors associated with workers and workplace that contribute to heat-associated OI risks.
   Methods: A systematic review of published peer-reviewed articles that assessed the effects of extreme heat on OI among non-military workers was undertaken using three databases (PubMed, Embase and Scopus) without temporal or geographical limits from database inception until July 2020. Extreme heat exposure was assessed in terms of hot temperatures and HW periods. For hot temperatures, the effect estimates were converted to relative risks (RR) associated with 1.C increase in temperature above reference values, while for HW, effect estimates were RR comparing heatwave with non-heatwave periods. The patterns of heat associated OI risk were investigated in different climate zones (according to Koppen Geiger classification) based on the study locations and were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis models. Subgroup analyses according to workers' characteristics (e.g. gender, age group, experience), nature of work (e. g. physical demands, location of work i.e. indoor/outdoor) and workplace characteristics (e.g. industries, business size) were also conducted.
   Results: A total of 24 studies published between 2005 and 2020 were included in the review. Among these, 22 studies met the eligibility criteria, representing almost 22 million OI across six countries (Australia, Canada, China, Italy, Spain, and USA) and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results suggested that the overall risk of OI increased by 1% (RR 1.010, 95% CI: 1.009-1.011) for 1. C increase in temperature above reference values and 17.4% (RR 1.174, 95% CI: 1.057-1.291) during HW. Among different climate zones, the highest risk of OI during hot temperatures was identified in Humid Subtropical Climates (RR 1.017, 95% CI: 1.014-1.020) followed by Oceanic (RR 1.010, 95% CI: 1.008-1.012) and Hot Mediterranean Climates (RR 1.009, 95% CI: 1.008-1.011). Similarly, Oceanic (RR 1.218, 95% CI: 1.093-1.343) and Humid Subtropical Climates (RR 1.213, 95% CI: 0.995-1.431) had the highest risk of OI during HW periods. No studies assessing the risk of OI in Tropical regions were found. The effects of hot temperatures on the risk of OI were acute with a lag effect of 1-2 days in all climate zones. Young workers (age < 35 years), male workers and workers in agriculture, forestry or fishing, construction and manufacturing industries were at high risk of OI during hot temperatures. Further young workers (age < 35 years), male workers and those working in electricity, gas and water and manufacturing industries were found to be at high risk of OI during HW.
   Conclusions: This review strengthens the evidence on the risk of heat-associated OI in different climate zones. The risk of OI associated with extreme heat is not evenly distributed and is dependent on underlying climatic conditions, workers' attributes, the nature of work and workplace characteristics. The differences in the risk of OI across different climate zones and worker subgroups warrant further investigation along with the development of climate and work-specific intervention strategies.

AB  - This essay is the outcome of a colloquium convened in November 2005 at the Benthos Laboratory of the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Ischia, Italy, on chemical ecology and the role of secondary metabolites in the structuring and functioning of marine biodiversity. The participants of the workshop are part of the European Network of Excellence MarBEF (Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function), a consortium of 56 European marine institutes to integrate and disseminate knowledge and expertise on marine biodiversity. Here we review some of the new trends and emerging topics in marine chemical ecology. The first section deals with microbial chemical interactions. Microbes communicate with each other using diffusible molecules such as N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHL). These are regulators in cell-density-dependent gene regulation (quorum sensing) controlling microbial processes. In chemical interactions with higher organisms, microbes can act either as harmful pathogens that are repelled by the host's chemical defense or as beneficial symbionts. These symbionts are sometimes the true producers of the host's secondary metabolites that have defensive and protective functions for their hosts. We also describe how allelochemicals can shape phytoplankton communities by regulating competition for available resources, and also interactions among individuals of the same species. Compounds such as the diatom-derived unsaturated aldehydes have been demonstrated to act as infochemicals, and they possibly function as a diffusible bloom-termination signal that triggers an active cell death and bloom termination at sea. The same molecules have also been shown to interfere with the reproductive capacity of grazing animals deterring future generations of potential predators. Such compounds differ from those that act as feeding deterrents since they do not target the predator but its offspring. Many of the neurotoxins produced by dinoflagellates act as feeding deterrents, and laboratory experiments have shown that ingestion of these algae by some microzooplankton and macrozooplankton can cause acute responses such as death, incapacitation, altered swimming behavior, and reduced fecundity and egg-hatching success. These effects may rarely occur in nature because of low individual grazing rates on dinoflagellate cells and grazing on other food sources such as microflagellates; and diatoms. We also consider the nutritional component of marine plant-herbivore interactions, especially in the plankton, and the information available on the effects of growing conditions of algae on the production of toxic metabolites. Species producing saxitoxins seem to consistently produce the highest amounts of toxins (on a per cell basis) in the exponential phase of growth, and there is a decrease in their production under nitrogen, but not under phosphorus stress, where the production actually increases. We try to explain the circumstances under which organisms defend themselves chemically and argue that the most likely explanatory model for the production of secondary metabolites used for defense in planktonic organisms is the carbon nutrient balance hypothesis, which predicts that most algae produce their toxins mainly under conditions where carbon is in excess and nitrogen (or other nutrients) is limiting. We also discuss chemically mediated macroalgal-herbivore interactions in the benthos and the large variation in concentration of seaweed defense metabolites at different spatial and temporal scales.
   Seaweeds have been shown to produce a large variety of secondary metablites with highly variable chemical structures such as terpenoids, acetogenins, amino acid derivates, and polyphenols. Many of these compounds probably have multiple simultaneous functions for the seaweeds and can act as allelopathic, antimicrobial, and antifouling or ultraviolet-screening agents, as well as herbivore deterrents. We also provide examples of interactions between marine benthic invertebrates, especially sponges, molluscs, and cnidarians, that are mediated by specific secondary metabolites and discuss the role of these in shaping benthic communities.

AB  - Two important issues of recent discussion in the philosophy of biology and of the cognitive sciences have been the ontological status of living, cognitive agents and whether cognition and action have a normative characterper se. In this paper I will explore the following conditional in relation with both the notion of affordance and the idea of the living as self-creation: if we recognize the need to use normative vocabulary to make sense of life in general, we are better off avoiding taking sides on the ontological discussion between eliminativists, reductionists and emergentists. Looking at life through normative lenses is, at the very least, in tension with any kind of realism that aims at prediction and control. I will argue that this is so for two separate reasons. On the one hand, understanding the realm of biology in purely factualist, realist terms means to dispossess it of its dignity: there is more to life than something that we simply aim to manipulate to our own material convenience. On the other hand, a descriptivist view that is committed to the existence of biological and mental facts that are fully independent of our understanding of nature may be an invitation to make our ethical and normative judgments dependent on the discovery of such alleged facts, something I diagnose as a form of representationalism. This runs counter what I take to be a central democratic ideal: while there are experts whose opinion could be considered the last word on purely factual matters, where value is concerned, there are no technocratic experts above the rest of us. I will rely on the ideas of some central figures of early analytic philosophy that, perhaps due to the reductionistic and eliminativist tendencies of contemporary philosophy of mind, have not been sufficiently discussed within post-cognitivist debates.

AB  - Various abiotic stress factors significantly contribute to major worldwide-losses in crop productivity by mainly impacting plant's stress tolerance/adaptive capacity. The latter is largely governed by the efficiency of antioxidant defense system for the metabolism of elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), caused by different abiotic stresses. Plant antioxidant defense system includes both enzymatic (such as superoxide dismutase, SOD, E.C. 1.15.1.1; catalase, CAT E.C. 1.11.1.6; glutathione reductase, GR, E.C. 1.6.4.2; peroxidase, POD, E.C. 1.11.1.7; ascorbate peroxidase, APX, E.C. 1.11.1.11; guaiacol peroxidase, GPX, E.C. 1.11.1.7) and non-enzymatic (such as ascorbic acid, AsA; glutathione, GSH; tocopherols; phenolics, proline etc.) components. Research reports on the status of various abiotic stresses and their impact on plant growth, development and productivity are extensive. However, least information is available on sustainable strategies for the mitigation of abiotic stress-mediated major consequences in plants. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a novel group of phytohormones with significant growth promoting nature. BRs are considered as growth regulators with pleiotropic effects, as they influence diverse physiological processes like growth, germination of seeds, rhizogenesis, senescence etc. and also confer abiotic stress resistance in plants. In the light of recent reports this paper: (a) overviews major abiotic stresses and plant antioxidant defense system, (b) introduces BRs and highlights their significance in general plant growth and development, and (c) appraises recent literature available on BRs mediated modulation of various components of antioxidant defense system in plants under major abiotic stresses including metals/metalloids, drought, salinity, and temperature regimes. The outcome can be significant in devising future research in the current direction.

AB  - As the air temperature of the Earth rises, ecological relationships within a community might shift, in part due to differences in the thermal physiology of species. Prediction of these shifts - an urgent task for ecologists - will be complicated if thermal tolerance itself can rapidly evolve. Here, we employ a mechanistic approach to predict the potential for rapid evolution of thermal tolerance in the intertidal limpet Lottia gigantea. Using biophysical principles to predict body temperature as a function of the state of the environment, and an environmental bootstrap procedure to predict how the environment fluctuates through time, we create hypothetical time-series of limpet body temperatures, which are in turn used as a test platform for a mechanistic evolutionary model of thermal tolerance. Our simulations suggest that environmentally driven stochastic variation of L.. gigantea body temperature results in rapid evolution of a substantial 'safety margin' : the average lethal limit is 5-7 degrees C above the average annual maximum temperature. This predicted safety margin approximately matches that found in nature, and once established is sufficient, in our simulations, to allow some limpet populations to survive a drastic, century-long increase in air temperature. By contrast, in the absence of environmental stochasticity, the safety margin is dramatically reduced. We suggest that the risk of exceeding the safety margin, rather than the absolute value of the safety margin, plays an underappreciated role in the evolution of thermal tolerance. Our predictions are based on a simple, hypothetical, allelic model that connects genetics to thermal physiology. To move beyond this simple model - and thereby potentially to predict differential evolution among populations and among species - will require significant advances in our ability to translate the details of thermal histories into physiological and population-genetic consequences.

AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that meditation naive subjects can, in just a few weeks, become proficient enough in meditation to show cognitive improvements accompanied with functional and structural changes in the brain. Would long-term exposure to qualitatively different levels of meditative training bring about differences in cognitive processing? Would meditation prior to task performance help separate out these differences? Could the nature of the task influence the findings related to cognitive enhancements? To address these questions, we evaluated cognitive functions in three groups of experienced Vipassana practitioners (Novices: n = 22, Mean +/- SD meditation experience = 989 +/- 595h; Senior practitioners: 21, 10,510 +/- 5313; Teachers: 16, 14,648 +/- 9623) who differed in terms of duration and quality of meditative practice. Specifically, we employed "ANGEL" a gamified multilevel oddball paradigm, to assess P3 event-related potentials (ERPs) and associated EEG dynamics-power spectra, event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC). In order to elicit the state-trait influences of meditation, the cognitive task was performed after the participants had undergone an hour long traditional meditation session. All participants could perform the task well and the gross ERP waveforms were similar for the three groups. As hypothesized, we found distinct state-trait influences of meditation leading to graded differences in P3 EEG dynamics. Specifically, we found reduced theta synchrony, enhanced alpha de-synchrony and lesser theta-alpha coherence in the more proficient meditators. Post hoc analyses revealed several differences between the novice and teacher groups but not as many between novice and seniors suggesting that the senior meditators formed an intermediate group. Our study demonstrates that both quantity and quality of meditation influence EEG dynamics during cognitive processing and that meditation prior to a task can provide additional state-trait effects involved in meeting the specific cognitive demands.

AB  - Chills are a psychophysiological response that can be experienced when listening to music. They have been of particular interest in scientific research on music because of their association with emotion and pleasure. However, with the literature doubling in size since the last review on the subject, it has become increasingly difficult to gain a broad and integrated understanding of the empirical and theoretical research on music-evoked chills (MECs). Notably, crucial questions remain about the criteria that are necessary and sufficient to characterize MECs. In this article, we systematically review the literature on MECs to reconcile diverging opinions and empirical findings on their psychological nature, and to develop a preliminary model that provides a robust framework for future hypothesis-driven research. We explore the context behind current research on MECs, discuss how they relate to emotional and esthetic responses, assess current empirical measures and paradigms, summarize their physiological and neural correlates, categorize their possible stimulus-driven elicitors, examine how they are affected by individual differences, and evaluate theoretical perspectives about their potential evolutionary causes. We conclude by providing a preliminary model of MECs that suggests different pathways for the experience of MECs, a dataset listing pieces of music reported to elicit MECs in the reviewed literature, and a set of open issues, hypotheses, and recommended approaches for future research.
   Public Significance Statement Many people experience pleasurable physical sensations during musical listening, commonly referred to as chills. Although there is a fast-growing body of research on chills, their underlying psychological basis remains obscure, partly due to the lack of an integrated theoretical framework for understanding them and generating hypotheses. Our systematic review of 167 research reports on chills from 1980 to 2020 allows us to synthesize a preliminary model of music-evoked chills, which allows for three distinct underlying psychological mechanisms based, respectively, on arousal, expectation, and emotion.

AB  - Pain is the most common symptom of disease, which accompanies us from an early age. It is a protective mechanism to which the body responds to harmful stimulus. The definition of pain states that it is a subjective sensory and emotional experience. It is connected to the stimulus that it invokes and is also based on the observation of psychological interpretation of the phenomena taking place. Pain is individual for each person. Pain affects both our previous experience of pain and psychosomatic conditions, depending on the relationship between the psyche and the body. Pain is always an unpleasant sensation. The feeling of pain can be caused by irritation of pain receptors, which can be found in the skin, joints and many internal organs. The cause of pain may also be damage to the nervous system, both the peripheral nerves, brain and spinal cord. Pain can also occur without damage to tissues, although the patient refers to it (psychogenic pain). The process of pain is a complex phenomenon. Experience of pain depends on the strength of the stimulus, individual susceptibility and individual resistance to pain. Pain receptors are sensitive to mechanical, thermal or chemical stimuli. The operation of noxious stimulus to these receptors results in the processing into an electrical signal. This impulse is conducted by nerve fibress into the spinal cord and then to the brain. At this point, there is the realization that something hurts us. Pain is not Only somatic in nature, associated with the condition of the body, but it is a multidimensional phenomenon. Therefore, in addition to the physiological process of pain, its Subjective perception is also important, which is decided by the central nervous system. It consists of the emotional aspects: suffering and attitude towards pain and pain expression. A review of pain physiology is essential to fully understand the principles of pain Management.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) leads to micro- and macro-vascular complications, including renal and cardiovascular disease. These alone, or in combination, are a major cause of premature morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Despite advances in glucose lowering treatments, these diabetic complications are still inadequately prevented or reversed. This ongoing cardiovascular-renal burden in diabetes poses a heavy cost on the health care system. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments. In this review, we discuss how oxidative stress and inflammation induce and perpetuate the renal and cardiovascular complications of diabetes. It is particularly important to understand these driving mechanisms in order to elucidate pharmacological targets and mechanism-based future drug therapies.
   Oxidative stress and inflammation are considered major drivers in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, including renal and cardiovascular disease. A symbiotic relationship also appears to exist between oxidative stress and inflammation. Several emerging therapies target these crucial pathways, to alleviate the burden of the aforementioned diseases. Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses, a pathological state which not only leads to direct cellular damage but also an inflammatory cascade that further perpetuates tissue injury. Emerging therapeutic strategies tackle these pathways in a variety of ways, from increasing antioxidant defenses (antioxidants and Nrf2 activators) to reducing ROS production (NADPH oxidase inhibitors and XO inhibitors) or inhibiting the associated inflammatory pathways (NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, lipoxins, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and AT-1 receptor antagonists). This review summarizes the mechanisms by which oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to and perpetuate diabetes associated renal and cardiovascular disease along with the therapeutic strategies which target these pathways to provide reno and cardiovascular protection in the setting of diabetes.

AB  - Protein inclusions are a predominant molecular pathology found in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease. Protein inclusions form in discrete areas of the brain characteristic to the type of neurodegenerative disease, and coincide with the death of neurons in that region (e.g. spinal cord motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). This suggests that the process of protein misfolding leading to inclusion formation is neurotoxic, and that cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms that maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis) can, at times, be insufficient to prevent protein inclusion formation in the central nervous system. The heat shock response is a pro-survival pathway induced under conditions of cellular stress that acts to maintain proteostasis through the up-regulation of heat shock proteins, a superfamily of molecular chaperones, other co-chaperones and mitotic regulators. The kinetics and magnitude of the heat shock response varies in a stress-and cell-type dependent manner. It remains to be determined if and/or how the heat shock response is activated in the different cell-types that comprise the central nervous system (e.g. neurons and astroglia) in response to protein misfolding events that precede cellular dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases. This is particularly relevant considering emerging evidence demonstrating the non-cell autonomous nature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease (and other neurodegenerative diseases) and the destructive role of astroglia in disease progression. This review highlights the complexity of heat shock response activation and addresses whether neurons and glia sense and respond to protein misfolding and aggregation associated with neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, by inducing a pro-survival heat shock response.

AB  - A conceptual paradigm, the "Relative Dominance Model", provides the perspective to assess the interactive external forcing-mechanisms controlling phase shifts among the dominant benthic functional groups on tropical coral reefs [i.e., microalgal turfs and frondose macroalgae (often harmful) versus reef-building corals and calcareous coralline algae (mostly beneficial due to accretion of calcareous reef framework)]. Manipulative experiments, analyses of existing communities and bioassays tested hypotheses that the relative dominances of these functional groups are mediated by two principal controlling factors: nutrients (i.e., bottom-up control) and herbivory (i.e., top-down control). The results show that reduced nutrients alone do not preclude fleshy algal growth when herbivory is low, and high herbivory alone does not prevent fleshy algal growth when nutrients are elevated. However, reduced nutrients in combination with high herbivory virtually eliminate all forms of fleshy micro- and macro-algae. The findings reveal considerable complexity in that increases in bottom-up nutrient controls and their interactions stimulate harmful fleshy algal blooms (that can alter the abundance patterns among functional groups, even under intense herbivory); conversely, elevated nutrients inhibit the growth of ecologically beneficial reef-building corals. The results show even further complexity in that nutrients also act directly as either limiting factors (e.g., physiological stresses) or as stimulatory mechanisms (e.g., growth enhancing factors), as well as functioning indirectly by influencing competitive outcomes. Herbivory directly reduces fleshy-algal biomass, which indirectly (via competitive release) favors the expansion of grazer-resistant reef-building corals and coralline algae. Because of the sensitive nature of direct/indirect and stimulating/limiting interacting factors, coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic reversal effects that decrease top-down controls and, concomitantly, increase bottom-up controls, dramatically altering ecosystem resiliencies.

AB  - Stroke is a devastating medical condition with no treatment to hasten recovery. Its abrupt nature results in cataclysmic changes in the affected tissues. Resident cells fail to cope with the cellular stress resulting in massive cell death, which cannot be endogenously repaired. A potential strategy to improve stroke outcomes is to boost endogenous pro-survival pathways. The unfolded protein response (UPR), an evolutionarily conserved stress response, provides a promising opportunity to ameliorate the survival of stressed cells. Recent studies from us and others have pointed toward mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) being a UPR responsive gene with an active role in maintaining proteostasis. Its pro-survival effects have been demonstrated in several disease models such as diabetes, neurodegeneration, and stroke. MANF has an ER-signal peptide and an ER-retention signal; it is secreted by ER calcium depletion and exits cells upon cell death. Although its functions remain elusive, conducted experiments suggest that the endogenous MANF in the ER lumen and exogenously administered MANF protein have different mechanisms of action. Here, we will revisit recent and older bodies of literature aiming to delineate the expression profile of MANF. We will focus on its neuroprotective roles in regulating neurogenesis and inflammation upon post-stroke administration. At the same time, we will investigate commonalities and differences with another UPR responsive gene, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), which has recently been associated with MANF's function. This will be the first systematic comparison of these two UPR responsive genes aiming at revealing previously uncovered associations between them. Overall, understanding the mode of action of these UPR responsive genes could provide novel approaches to promote cell survival.

AB  - Motivated behavior exhibits properties that change with experience and partially dissociate among a number of brain structures. Here, we review evidence from rodent experiments demonstrating that multiple brain systems acquire information in parallel and either cooperate or compete for behavioral control. We propose a conceptual model of systems interaction wherein a ventral emotional memory network involving ventral striatum (VS), amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex triages behavioral responding to stimuli according to their associated affective outcomes. This system engages autonomic and postural responding (avoiding, ignoring, approaching) in accordance with associated stimulus valence (negative, neutral, positive), but does not engage particular operant responses. Rather, this emotional system suppresses or invigorates actions that are selected through competition between goal-directed control involving dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and habitual control involving dorsolateral striatum (DLS). The hippocampus provides contextual specificity to the emotional system, and provides an information rich input to the goal-directed system for navigation and discriminations involving ambiguous contexts, complex sensory configurations, or temporal ordering. The rapid acquisition and high capacity for episodic associations in the emotional system may unburden the more complex goal-directed system and reduce interference in the habit system from processing contingencies of neutral stimuli. Interactions among these systems likely involve inhibitory mechanisms and neuromodulation in the striatum to form a dominant response strategy. Innate traits, training methods, and task demands contribute to the nature of these interactions, which can include incidental learning in non-dominant systems. Addition of these features to reinforcement learning models of decision-making may better align theoretical predictions with behavioral and neural correlates in animals.

AB  - RNA modifications have emerged as an additional layer of regulatory complexity governing the function of almost all species of RNA. N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the addition of methyl groups to adenine residues, is the most abundant and well understood RNA modification. The current review discusses the regulatory mechanisms governing m(6)A, how this influences neuronal development and function and how aberrant m(6)A signaling may contribute to neurological disease. M(6)A is known to regulate the stability of mRNA, the processing of microRNAs and function/processing of tRNAs among other roles. The development of antibodies against m(6)A has facilitated the application of next generation sequencing to profile methylated RNAs in both health and disease contexts, revealing the extent of this transcriptomic modification. The mechanisms by which m(6)A is deposited, processed, and potentially removed are increasingly understood. Writer enzymes include METTL3 and METTL14 while YTHDC1 and YTHDF1 are key reader proteins, which recognize and bind the m(6)A mark. Finally, FTO and ALKBH5 have been identified as potential erasers of m(6)A, although there in vivo activity and the dynamic nature of this modification requires further study. M(6)A is enriched in the brain and has emerged as a key regulator of neuronal activity and function in processes including neurodevelopment, learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, and the stress response. Changes to m(6)A have recently been linked with Schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease. Elucidating the functional consequences of m(6)A changes in these and other brain diseases may lead to novel insight into disease pathomechanisms, molecular biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Cell division, the purpose of which is to enable cell replication, and in particular to distribute complete, accurate copies of genetic material to daughter cells, is essential for the propagation of life. At a morphological level, division not only necessitates duplication of cellular structures, but it also relies on polar segregation of this material followed by physical scission of the parent cell. For these fundamental changes in cell shape and positioning to be achieved, mechanisms are required to link the cell cycle to the modulation of cytoarchitecture. Outside of mitosis, the three main cytoskeletal networks not only endow cells with a physical cytoplasmic skeleton, but they also provide a mechanism for spatio-temporal sensing via integrin-associated adhesion complexes and site-directed delivery of cargoes. During mitosis, some interphase functions are retained, but the architecture of the cytoskeleton changes dramatically, and there is a need to generate a mitotic spindle for chromosome segregation. An economical solution is to re-use existing cytoskeletal molecules: transcellular actin stress fibres remodel to create a rigid cortex and a cytokinetic furrow, while unipolar radial microtubules become the primary components of the bipolar spindle. This remodelling implies the existence of specific mechanisms that link the cell-cycle machinery to the control of adhesion and the cytoskeleton. In this article, we review the intimate three-way connection between microenvironmental sensing, adhesion signalling and cell proliferation, particularly in the contexts of normal growth control and aberrant tumour progression. As the morphological changes that occur during mitosis are ancient, the mechanisms linking the cell cycle to the cytoskeleton/adhesion signalling network are likely to be primordial in nature and we discuss recent advances that have elucidated elements of this link. A particular focus is the connection between CDK1 and cell adhesion.

AB  - An important role for the reactive gas nitric oxide (NO) in regulating striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission was identified shortly after initial observations indicated that this unorthodox neurotransmitter mediates many of the influences of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus. While the precise actions of NO on striatal presynaptic and postsynaptic elements remain to be fully characterized, the recent application of sophisticated anatomical, neurochemical, and electrophysiological approaches to the study of nitrergic signaling has revealed that NO exerts a powerful influence both on tonic extracellular dopamine (DA) levels and phasic DA neuron spike activity via the modulation of intrinsic striatal mechanisms and striatonigral feedback loops. Although the nature of the NO-mediated modulatory influence on DA neurotransmission was initially clouded by seemingly conflicting neurochemical observations, a growing body of literature and understanding of the diverse signaling mechanisms and effector pathways utilized by NO indicates that NO exerts a primary facilitatory influence over tonic and phasic dopaminergic neurotransmission under physiological conditions. A review of neurochemical and electrophysiological studies examining the influence of endogenous and exogenous NO on DA neurotransmission indicates that NO signaling exerts multiple effects on local striatal circuits and projection neurons involved in regulating basal ganglia output and nigrostriatal DA neuron activity. In addition to summarizing these influences, the current review focuses on the mechanisms utilized by striatal NO signaling pathways involved in modulating DA transmission at the level of the terminal and cell body and attempts to integrate these observations into a functional model of NO-dependent regulation of basal ganglia systems.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia among older adults, is a progressive and neurodegenerative brain disease. AD is characterized by progressive memory impairments, but not other types of dementia. Autobiographical memory (AM) is defined as episodes recollected from individuals' life, and it is one of the memory systems impaired in AD. One consequence of AM decline in AD is difficulties in the retrieval of recent AMs rather than past ones. AM contains both episodic and semantic components, and it is crucial for self-concept. The aim of the present study is to review the current understanding of AM in people with AD. In the introduction part of the review, AD and its cognitive correlates are presented in detail, with how AM performance is important for the self. In the second part of the review, AM deteriorations in patients with AD are discussed. Factors, such as emotion and olfaction, affecting AM are mentioned along with the neural substrates. In this regard, the effect of the emotional dimension (e.g., valence) on the formation and retrieval of AMs is discussed and how AM is studied with olfactory stimuli is presented, respectively. Studies on the link between AM and emotion have shown that there is a positive shift of AM in AD, indicating that patients with AD remember their AMs more positively. In addition, olfactory stimuli evoke more AMs than verbal and visual stimuli. The conclusion section of the current review is devoted to some recommendations that might guide future research. For instance, stage-by-stage investigation of AM in AD and the comparison of them in relation to relevant variables could be one way of providing detailed findings on the nature of AM in AD.

AB  - Fos-protein immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) was used to identify neurocircuits potentially participating in the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis sensitivity to glucocorticoid-mediated fast-feedback in rats exposed to the physical stressor, hemorrhage, or the psychological stressor, airpuff startle. Marked regional brain differences in the Fos-IR expression were observed in response to these stressors. Specifically, after hemorrhage, nuclear Fos-IR increased in the nucleus of the solitary tract and other brainstem regions known to regulate hemodynamic processes including the supraoptic nucleus, and the magnocellular division of hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In contrast, after airpuff startle Fos-IR increased in the dorsomedial and lateral hypothalamus as well as in the lateral septum. Thus, activation of brainstem neurocircuits predominated after hemorrhage whereas activation of forebrain neurocircuits predominated after airpuff startle. In other regions, the magnitude of stressor-induced Fos-IR expression varied in a region-specific manner. When stressor exposure was preceded by administration of corticosterone to achieve levels within the physiological range after stressors, HPA axis responses were suppressed in response to the airpuff startle but not to either a small or moderate hemorrhage. In conclusion: (1) fast-feedback mediated inhibition of HPA axis activity is critically dependent upon stressor modality; (2) this apparent selectivity is reflected by differences in the nature of the neurocircuitry mediating these stressors. It is suggested that determination of the central actions of glucocorticoids in mediating fast-feedback regulation of the HPA axis requires evaluation of the interactions between activated glucocorticoid receptors and intracellular signaling cascades evoked by convergent neuronal input.

AB  - When cognitive scientists apply computational theory to the problem of phenomenal consciousness, as many have been doing recently, there are two fundamentally distinct approaches available. Consciousness is to be explained either in terms of the nature of the representational vehicles the brain deploys or in terms of the computational processes defined over these vehicles. We call versions of these two approaches vehicle and process theories of consciousness, respectively. However, although there may be space for vehicle theories of consciousness in cognitive science, they are relatively rare. This is because of the influence exerted, on the one hand, by a large body of research that purports to show that the explicit representation of information in the brain and conscious experience are dissociable, and on the other, by the classical computational theory of mind - the theory that takes human cognition to be a species of symbol manipulation. Two recent developments in cognitive science combine to suggest that a reappraisal of this situation is in order. First, a number of theorists have recently been highly critical of the experimental methodologies used in the dissociation studies - so critical, in fact, that it is no longer reasonable to assume that the dissociability of conscious experience and explicit representation has been adequately demonstrated. Second, classicism, as a theory of human cognition, is no longer as dominant in cognitive science as it once was. It now has a lively competitor in form of connectionism; and connectionism, unlike classicism, does not have the computational resources to support a robust vehicle theory of consciousness. In this target article we develop and defend this connectionist vehicle theory of consciousness. It takes the form of the following simple empirical hypothesis: phenomenal experience consists of the explicit representation of information in neurally realized parallel distributed processing (PDP) networks. This hypothesis leads us to reassess some common wisdom about consciousness, but, we argue, in fruitful and ultimately plausible ways.

AB  - Theory of mind (ToM; a.k.a., mind-reading, mentalizing, mental-state attribution, and perspective-taking) is the ability to ascribe mental states, such as desires and beliefs, to others, and it is central to the unique forms of communication, cooperation, and culture that define our species. As a result, for 40 years, researchers have endeavored to determine whether ToM is itself unique to humans. Investigations in other species (e.g., apes, monkeys, corvids) are essential to understand the mechanistic underpinnings and evolutionary origins of this capacity across taxa, including humans. We review the literature on ToM in nonhuman animals, suggesting that some species share foundational social cognitive mechanisms with humans. We focus principally on innovations of the last decade and pressing directions for future work. Underexplored types of social cognition have been targeted, including ascription of mental states, such as desires and beliefs, that require simultaneously representing one's own and another's conflicting motives or views of the world. Ongoing efforts probe the motivational facets of ToM, how flexibly animals can recruit social cognitive skills across cooperative and competitive settings, and appropriate motivational contexts for comparative inquiry. Finally, novel methodological and empirical approaches have brought new species (e.g., lemurs, dogs) into the lab, implemented critical controls to elucidate underlying mechanisms, and contributed powerful new techniques (e.g., looking-time, eye-tracking) that open the door to unexplored approaches for studying animal minds. These innovations in cognition, motivation, and method promise fruitful progress in the years to come, in understanding the nature and origin of ToM in humans and other species.

AB  - Many personality theories link specific traits to the sensitivities of the neural systems that control approach and avoidance. But there is no consensus on the nature of these systems. Here we combine recent advances in economics and neuroscience to provide a more solid foundation for a neuroscience of approach/avoidance personality. We propose a two-stage integration of valuation (loss/gain) sensitivities with motivational (approach/avoidance/conflict) sensitivities. Our key conclusions are: (1) that valuation of appetitive and aversive events (e.g. gain and loss as studied by behavioural economists) is an independent perceptual input stage - with the economic phenomenon of loss aversion resulting from greater negative valuation sensitivity compared to positive valuation sensitivity; (2) that valuation of an appetitive stimulus then interacts with a contingency of presentation or omission to generate a motivational 'attractor' or 'repulsor', respectively (vice versa for an aversive stimulus); (3) the resultant behavioural tendencies to approach or avoid have distinct sensitivities to those of the valuation systems; (4) while attractors and repulsors can reinforce new responses they also, more usually, elicit innate or previously conditioned responses and so the perception/valuation-motivation/action complex is best characterised as acting as a 'reinforcer' not a 'reinforcement': and (5) approach-avoidance conflict must be viewed as activating a third motivation system that is distinct from the basic approach and avoidance systems. We provide examples of methods of assessing each of the constructs within approach-avoidance theories and of linking these constructs to personality measures. We sketch a preliminary five-element reinforcer sensitivity theory (RST-5) as a first step in the integration of existing specific approach-avoidance theories into a coherent neuroscience of personality.

AB  - We review Berwick and Chomsky's Why Only Us, Language and Evolution, a book premised on language as an instrument primarily of thought, only secondarily of communication. The authors conclude that a Universal Grammar can be reduced to three biologically isolated components, whose computational system for syntax was the result of a single mutation that occurred about 80,000 years ago. We question that argument because it ignores the origin of words, even though Berwick and Chomsky acknowledge that words evolved before grammar. It also fails to explain what evolutionary problem language uniquely solved (Wallace's question). To answer that question, we review recent discoveries about the ontogeny and phylogeny of words. Ontogenetically, two modes of nonverbal relation between infant and mother begin at or within 6 months of birth that are crucial antecedents of the infant's first words: intersubjectivity and joint attention. Intersubjectivity refers to rhythmic shared affect between infant and caretaker(s) that develop during the first 6 months. When the infant begins to crawl, they begin to attend jointly to environmental objects. Phylogenetically, Hrdy and Bickerton describe aspects of Homo erectus' ecology and cognition that facilitated the evolution of words. Hrdy shows how cooperative breeding established trust between infant and caretakers, laying the groundwork for a community of mutual trust among adults. Bickerton shows how 'confrontational scavenging' led to displaced reference, whereby an individual communicated the nature of a dead animal and its location to members of the group that could not see it. Thus, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically, the original function of language was primarily an instrument of communication. Rejecting Berwick and Chomsky's answer to Wallace's question that syntax afforded better planning and inference, we endorse Bickerton's view that language enabled speakers to refer to objects not immediately present. Thus arose context-free mental representations, unique to human language and thought.

AB  - Inflammation is the key host-defense response to infection and injury, yet also a major contributor to a diverse range of diseases, both peripheral and central in origin. Brain injury as a result of stroke or trauma is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet there are no effective treatments, resulting in enormous social and economic costs. Increasing evidence, both preclinical and clinical, highlights inflammation as an important factor in stroke, both in determining outcome and as a contributor to risk. A number of inflammatory mediators have been proposed as key targets for intervention to reduce the burden of stroke, several reaching clinical trial, but as yet yielding no success. Many factors could explain these failures, including the lack of robust preclinical evidence and poorly designed clinical trials, in addition to the complex nature of the clinical condition. Lack of consideration in preclinical studies of associated co-morbidities prevalent in the clinical stroke population is now seen as an important omission in previous work. These co-morbidities (atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, infection) have a strong inflammatory component, supporting the need for greater understanding of how inflammation contributes to acute brain injury. Interleukin (IL)-1 is the prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokine, first identified many years ago as the endogenous pyrogen. Research over the last 20 years or so reveals that IL-1 is an important mediator of neuronal injury and blocking the actions of IL-1 is beneficial in a number of experimental models of brain damage. Mechanisms underlying the actions of IL-1 in brain injury remain unclear, though increasing evidence indicates the cerebrovasculature as a key target. Recent literature supporting this and other aspects of how IL-1 and systemic inflammation in general contribute to acute brain injury are discussed in this review.

AB  - IQ scores provide the best general predictor of success in education, job training, and work. However, there are many ways in which IQ scores can be increased, for instance by means of retesting or participation in learning potential training programs. What is the nature of these score gains? Jensen [Jensen, A.R. (1998a). The g factor: The science of mental ability. London: Praeger] argued that the effects of cognitive interventions on abilities can be explained in terms of Carroll's three-stratum hierarchical factor model. We tested his hypothesis using test-retest data from various Dutch, British, and American IQ test batteries combined into a meta-analysis and learning potential data from South Affica using Raven's Progressive Matrices. The meta-analysis of 64 test-retest studies using IQ batteries (total N=26,990) yielded a correlation between g loadings and score gains of -1.00, meaning there is no g saturation in score gains. The learning potential study showed that: (1) the correlation between score gains and the g loadedness of item scores is -.39, (2) the g loadedness of item scores decreases after a mediated intervention training, and (3) low-g participants increased their scores more than high-g participants. So, our results support Jensen's hypothesis. The generalizability of test scores resides predominantly in the g component, while the test-specific ability component and the narrow ability component are virtually non-generalizable. As the score gains are not related to g, the generalizable g component decreases and, as it is not unlikely that the training itself is not g-loaded, it is easy to understand why the score gains did not generalize to scores on other cognitive tests and to g-loaded external criteria.

AB  - DNA provides the fundamental framework for heritability, yet heritable trait variation need not be completely 'hard-wired' into the DNA sequence. In plants, the epigenetic machinery that controls transposable element (TE) activity, and which includes DNA methylation, underpins most known cases of inherited trait variants that are independent of DNA sequence changes. Here, we review our current knowledge of the extent, mechanisms and potential adaptive contribution of epiallelic variation at TE-containing alleles in this group of species. For the purpose of this review, we focus mainly on DNA methylation, as it provides an easily quantifiable readout of such variation. The picture that emerges is complex. On the one hand, pronounced differences in DNA methylation at TE sequences can either occur spontaneously or be induced experimentally en masse across the genome through genetic means. Many of these epivariants are stably inherited over multiple sexual generations, thus leading to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Functional consequences can be significant, yet they are typically of limited magnitude and although the same epivariants can be found in nature, the factors involved in their generation in this setting remain to be determined. On the other hand, moderate DNA methylation variation at TE-containing alleles can be reproducibly induced by the environment, again usually with mild effects, and most of this variation tends to be lost across generations. Based on these considerations, we argue that TE-containing alleles, rather than their inherited epiallelic variants, are the main targets of natural selection. Thus, we propose that the adaptive contribution of TE-associated epivariation, whether stable or not, lies predominantly in its capacity to modulate TE mobilization in response to the environment, hence providing hard-wired opportunities for the flexible exploration of the phenotypic space.

AB  - The main causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally are diabetes and hypertension but epidemics of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) occur in Central America, Sri Lanka, India and beyond. Althoug also being observed in women, CKDu concentrates among men in agricultural sectors. Therefore, suspicions fell initially on pesticide exposure, but currently chronic heat stress and dehydration are considered key etiologic factors. Responding to persistent community and scientific concerns about the role of pesticides, we performed a systematic review of epidemiologic studies that addressed associations between any indicator of pesticide exposure and any outcome measure of CKD. Of the 21 analytical studies we identified, seven were categorized as with low, ten with medium and four with relatively high explanation value. Thirteen (62%) studies reported one or more positive associations, but four had a low explanation value and three presented equivocal results. The main limitations of both positive and negative studies were unspecific and unquantified exposure measurement ('pesticides'), the cross-sectional nature of most studies, confounding and selection bias. The four studies with stronger designs and better exposure assessment (from Sri Lanka, India and USA) all showed exposure-responses or clear associations, but for different pesticides in each study, and three of these studies were conducted in areas without CKDu epidemics. No study investigated interactions between pesticides and other concommittant exposures in agricultural occupations, in particular heat stress and dehydration. In conclusion, existing studies provide scarce evidence for an association between pesticides and regional CKDu epidemics but, given the poor pesticide exposure assessment in the majority, a role of nephrotoxic agrochemicals cannot be conclusively discarded. Future research should procure assessment of lifetime exposures to relevant specific pesticides and enough power to look into interactions with other major risk factors, in particular heat stress.

AB  - We review recent evidence from studies of patients with unilateral neglect and/or extinction, who suffer from a loss of awareness for stimuli towards the affected side of space. We contrast their deficit with the effects of damage to primary sensory areas, noting that such areas can remain structurally intact in neglect, with lesions typically centred on the right inferior parietal lobe. In keeping with preservation of initial sensory pathways, many recent studies have shown that considerable residual processing can still take place for neglected or extinguished stimuli, yet without reaching the patient's awareness. This ranges from preserved visual grouping processes through to activation of identity, semantics and emotional significance. Similarly to 'preattentive' processing in normals, such residual processing can modulate what will enter the patient's awareness. Recent studies have used measures such as ERPs and fMRI to determine the neural correlates of conscious versus unconscious perception in the patients, which in turn can be related to the anatomy of their lesions. We relate the patient findings to neurophysiological data from areas in the monkey parietal lobe, which indicate that these serve as cross-modal and sensorimotor interfaces highlighting currently relevant locations as targets for intentional action. We speculate on the special role such brain regions may play in perceptual awareness, seeking to explain how damage to a system which appears primarily to code space could eliminate awareness even for non-spatial stimulus propel ties at affected locations. This may relate to the extreme nature of 'winner-takes-all' functions within the parietal lobe, and their correspondingly strong influence on other brain areas. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Objective: Although it is well established that depressive symptoms are associated with recurrent cardiac events among cardiac patients and novel cardiac events among participants with no known coronary artery disease (CAD), the nature of this association remains unclear. In this regard, little attention has been paid to the possibility that common genetic vulnerability contributes to both depressive symptoms and CAD. In this paper, we review the existing evidence for common genetic contributions to depression and CAD, primarily using evidence from twin and family Studies, followed by a review of two major pathophysiological mechanisms thought to underlie covariation between depressive symptoms and CAD: inflammation and serotonin. We conclude with ail overview of select candidate genes within these pathways. Methods: Literature review. Results: In twin studies, both depression and CAD appear heritable. In the only twin study to consider depression and CAD jointly, the correlation across heritabilities was 0.42, suggesting that nearly 20% of variability in depressive symptoms and CAD was attributable to common genetic factors. In addition, although it is plausible that genetic variation related to inflammation and serotonin may be associated with both depression and CAD, genetic variation related to inflammation has been primary examined in relation to CAD, whereas genetic variation in the serotonin system has been primarily examined in relation to depression. Conclusions: It appears that the covariation of depressive symptoms and CAD may be attributable, in part, to a common genetic vulnerability. Although several pathways may be involved, genes within the inflammation and serotonin pathways may serve as good candidates for the first steps in identifying genetic variation important for depression, CAD or both.

AB  - Although recent research on the neural substrates of word classes has generated some valuable findings, significant progress has been hindered by insufficient attention to theoretical issues involving the nature of the lexical phenomena under investigation. This paper shows how insights from linguistic typology can provide cognitive neuroscientists with well-motivated guidelines for interpreting the extant data and charting a future course. At the outset, a fundamental distinction is made between universal and language-particular aspects of word classes. Regarding universals, prototypical nouns involve reference to objects, and their meanings rely primarily on the ventral temporal lobes, which represent the shape features of entities; in contrast, prototypical verbs involve predication of actions, and their meanings rely primarily on posterior middle temporal regions and frontoparietal regions, which represent the visual motion features and somatomotor features of events. Some researchers maintain that focusing on object nouns and action verbs is inappropriate because it conflates the semantic and grammatical properties of each word class. However, this criticism not only ignores the importance of the universal prototypes, but also mistakenly assumes that there are straightforward morphological and/or syntactic criteria for identifying nouns and verbs in particular languages. In fact, at the level of individual languages, the classic method of distributional analysis leads to a proliferation of constructionally based entity-denoting and event-denoting word classes with mismatching memberships, and all of this variation must be taken seriously, not only by linguists, but also by cognitive neuroscientists. Many of these word classes involve remarkably close correspondences between grammar and meaning and hence are highly relevant to the neurobiology of conceptual knowledge, but so far hardly any of them have been investigated from a neurolinguistic perspective.

AB  - We review recent work on extinction learning with emphasis on its modulation. Extinction is the learned inhibition of responding to previously acquired tasks. Like other forms of learning, it can be modulated by a variety of neurotransmitter systems and behavioral procedures. This bears on its use in the treatment of fear memories, particularly in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for which it is the treatment of choice, often under the name of exposure therapy. There have not been many laboratories interested in the modulation of extinction, but the available data, although not very abundant, are quite conclusive. Most studies on the nature of extinction and on its modulation have been carried out on fear motivated behaviors, possibly because of their applicability to the therapy of PTSD. A role for D-serine and the glycine site of NMDA receptors has been ascertained in two forms of extinction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala and dorsal hippocampus. The serine analog, D-cycloserine, has received clinical trials as an enhancer of extinction. The brain histaminergic system acting via H2 receptors, and the endocannabinoid system using CB1 receptors in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and basolateral amygdala enhance extinction. Dopaminergic D1 and beta-noradrenergic receptors also modulate extinction by actions on these three structures. Isolated findings suggest roles for on serotonin-1A, dopaminergic-D2 and alpha- and beta-noradrenergic receptors in extinction modulation. Importantly, behavioral tagging and capture mechanisms in the hippocampus have been shown to play a major modulatory role in extinction. In addition, extinction of at least one aversive task (inhibitory avoidance) can be made state dependent on peripheral epinephrine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: This research explored the relationship between active music making and subjective well-being, in older people's lives. The research focused on how participation in making music might enhance older people's social, emotional and cognitive well-being, through meeting the basic psychological needs identified in earlier research.
   Method: The research comprised three case studies, each offering a variety of musical activities to older people. In each case study a sample of older people were asked to complete questionnaires and psychological needs scales related to autonomy, competence, relatedness and self-realisation before and after a substantial period of active engagement with music.
   Results: Principal components analysis (PCA) of responses to the CASP-12(1) and the Basic Needs Satisfaction scale(2) revealed three factors: purpose (having a positive outlook on life; autonomy and control; and social affirmation (positive social relationships, competence and a sense of recognised accomplishment). Comparisons of those engaged in music making with those participating in other activities revealed statistically significant differences on all three factors with the music groups giving more positive responses.
   Conclusions: The enhanced subjective well-being found among participants in music may have been due to the potential for music to provide a sense of purpose through progression in music and creative expression. Control and autonomy may be supported by the holistic nature of musical engagement, whereby meeting new musical challenges involves physical and cognitive engagement. Finally, social affirmation may be supported through social interaction; giving and receiving peer support; and performance, which confers status, a sense of giving something back to the community, pride and opportunities for positive reinforcement. Further research needs to identify the mechanisms through which music is able to achieve these effects.

AB  - Following much work ill linguistic theory, it is hypothesized that the language faculty has a modular structure and consists of two basic components, a lexicon of (structured) entries and a computational system of combinatorial operations to form larger linguistic expressions from lexical entries. This target article provides evidence for the dual nature of the language faculty by describing recent re suits of a multidisciplinary investigation of German inflection. We have examined: (1) its linguistic representation, focussing on noun plurals and verb inflection (participles), (2) processes involved in the way adults product and comprehend inflected words, (3) brain potentials generated during the processing of inflected words, and (4) the way children acquire and use inflection. It will be shown that the evidence from all these sources converges and supports the distinction between lexical entries and combinatorial operations.
   Our experimental results indicate that adults have access to two distinct processing routes, one accessing (irregularly) inflected entries from the mental lexicon and another invoking morphological decomposition of(regularly) inflected words into stem+affix representations. These two processing routes correspond to the dual structure of the linguistic system. Results fr om event-related potentials confirm this linguistic distinction at the level of brain structures. In children's language, we have also found these two processes to be clearly dissociated: regular and ii-regular inflection are used under different circumstances, and the constraints under which children apply them are identical to those of the adult linguistic system.
   Our findings will be explained in terms of a linguistic model that maintains the distinction between the lexicon and the computational system but replaces the traditional view of the lexicon as a simple list of idiosyncrasies with the notion of internally structured lexical representations.

AB  - Rare genomic disorders (RGDs) confer elevated risk for neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. In this era of intense genomics discoveries, the landscape of RGDs is rapidly evolving. However, there has not been comparable progress to date in scalable, harmonized phenotyping methods. As a result, beyond associations with categorical diagnoses, the effects on dimensional traits remain unclear for many RGDs. The nature and specificity of RGD effects on cognitive and behavioral traits is an area of intense investigation: RGDs are fre-quently associated with more than one psychiatric condition, and those studied to date affect, to varying degrees, a broad range of developmental and cognitive functions. Although many RGDs have large effects, phenotypic expression is typically influenced by addi-tional genomic and environmental factors. There is emerging evidence that using polygenic risk scores in individuals with RGDs offers opportunities to refine prediction, thus allowing for the identification of those at greatest risk of psychiatric illness. However, transla-tion into the clinic is hindered by roadblocks, which include limited genetic testing in clinical psychiatry, and the lack of guidelines for following individuals with RGDs, who are at high risk of developing psychiatric symptoms. The Genes to Mental Health Network (G2MH) is a newly funded National Institute of Mental Health initiative that will collect, share, and analyze large-scale data sets combining genomics and dimen-sional measures of psychopathology spanning diverse populations and geography. The authors present here the most recent understanding of the effects of RGDs on dimensional behavioral traits and risk for psychiatric conditions and discuss strategies that will be pursued within the G2MH network, as well as how expected results can be translated into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - The normal brain development and function are delicately driven by an ever-changing milieu of steroid hormones arising from fetal, placental, and maternal origins. This reliance on the neuroendocrine system sets the stage for the exquisite sensitivity of the central nervous system to the adverse effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most common EDCs which has been a particular focus of environmental concern for decades due to its widespread nature and formidable threat to human and animal health. The heightened regulatory actions and the scientific and public concern over the adverse health effects of BPA have led to its replacement with a suite of structurally similar but less known alternative chemicals. Bisphenol S (BPS) is the main substitute for BPA that is increasingly being used in a wide array of consumer and industrial products. Although it was considered to be a safe BPA alternative, mounting evidence points to the deleterious effects of BPS on a wide range of neuroendocrine functions in animals. In addition to its reproductive toxicity, recent experimental efforts indicate that BPS has a considerable potential to induce neurotoxicity and behavioral dysfunction. This review analyzes the current state of knowledge regarding the neurobehavioral effects of BPS and discusses its potential mode of actions on several aspects of the neuroendocrine system. We summarize the role of certain hormones and their signaling pathways in the regulation of brain and behavior and discuss how BPS induces neurotoxicity through interactions with these pathways. Finally, we review potential links between BPS exposure and aberrant neurobehavioral functions in animals and identify key knowledge gaps and hypotheses for future research.

The number of studies regarding the effects of cyanotoxins on agricultural plants has increased in recent years, and it has been suggested that the presence of microcystin-LR and cylindrospermopsin in irrigation water may cause toxic effects in edible plants. The uptake of these cyanotoxins by agricultural plants has been shown to induce morphological and physiological changes that lead to a potential loss of productivity. There is also evidence that edible terrestrial plants can bioaccumulate cyanotoxins in their tissues in a concentration dependent-manner. Moreover, the number of consecutive cycles of watering and planting in addition to the potential persistence of microcystin-LR and cylindrospermopsin in the environment are likely to result in groundwater contamination. The use of cyanotoxin-contaminated water for agricultural purposes may therefore represent a threat to both food security and food safety. However, the deleterious effects of cyanotoxins on agricultural plants and public health seem to be dependent on the concentrations studied, which in most cases are non-environmentally relevant. Interestingly, at ecologically relevant concentrations, the productivity and nutritional quality of some agricultural plants seem not to be impaired and may even be enhanced. However, studies assessing if the potential tolerance of agricultural plants to these concentrations can result in cyanotoxin and allergen accumulation in the edible tissues are lacking. This review combines the most current information available regarding this topic with a realistic assessment of the impact of cyanobacterial toxins on agricultural plants, groundwater quality and public health.

AB  - Metabolomics is the analysis of endogenous and exogenous low molecular mass metabolites within a cell, tissue, or biofluid of an organism in response to an external stressor. The sub-discipline of environmental metabolomics is the application of metabolomic techniques to analyze the interactions of organisms with their environment. There has been a rapid growth in environmental metabolomics over the past decade. This growth can be attributed to the comprehensive and rapid nature of nontargeted metabolomics and the ability to generate hypotheses involving complex environmental stressors, especially when the mode of action is unknown. Using a wide variety of model organisms, metabolomic studies have detected stress from abiotic factors such as xenobiotic exposure and temperature shifts as well as biotic stressors such as herbivory and competition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics has been the dominant analytical platform used for environmental metabolomics studies, owing to its nonselectivity and ease of sample preparation. However, the number of mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic studies is also increasing rapidly, owing to its high sensitivity for the detection of trace levels of metabolites. In this review, we provide an overview of the general experimental design, extraction methods, analytical instrumentation, and statistical methods used in environmental metabolomics. We then highlight some of the recent studies that have used metabolomics to elucidate hitherto unknown biochemical modes of actions of various environmental stressors to both terrestrial and aquatic organisms, as well as identify potential metabolite shifts as early bioindicators of these stressors. Through this, we emphasize the immense potential and versatility of environmental metabolomics as a routine tool for characterizing the responses of organisms to numerous types of environmental stressors.

AB  - Environmental contamination with arsenic (As) is a global environmental, agricultural and health issue due to the highly toxic and carcinogenic nature of As. Exposure of plants to As, even at very low concentration, can cause many morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes. The recent research on As in the soil-plant system indicates that As toxicity to plants varies with its speciation in plants (e.g., arsenite, As(III); arsenate, As(V)), with the type of plant species, and with other soil factors controlling As accumulation in plants. Various plant species have different mechanisms of As(III) or As(V) uptake, toxicity, and detoxification. This review briefly describes the sources and global extent of As contamination and As speciation in soil. We discuss different mechanisms responsible for As(III) and As(V) uptake, toxicity, and detoxification in plants, at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels. This review highlights the importance of the As-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as their damaging impacts on plants at biochemical, genetic, and molecular levels. The role of different enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and ascorbate peroxidase) and non-enzymatic (salicylic acid, proline, phytochelatins, glutathione, nitric oxide, and phosphorous) substances under As(III/V) stress have been delineated via conceptual models showing As translocation and toxicity pathways in plant species. Significantly, this review addresses the current, albeit partially understood, emerging aspects on (i) As-induced physiological, biochemical, and genotoxic mechanisms and responses in plants and (ii) the roles of different molecules in modulation of As-induced toxicities in plants. We also provide insight on some important research gaps that need to be filled to advance our scientific understanding in this area of research on As in soil-plant systems.

AB  - Because of the complex, multifaceted nature of spinal cord injury (SCI), it is widely believed that a combination of approaches will be superior to individual treatments. Therefore, we employed a rat model of cervical SCI to evaluate the combination of four noninvasive treatments that individually have been reported to be effective for acute SCI during clinically relevant therapeutic time windows. These treatments included ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and ketogenic diet (KD). These were selected not only because of their previously reported efficacy in SCI models but also for their potentially different mechanisms of action. The administration of ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and KD several hours to days postinjury was based on previous observations by others that each treatment had profound effects on the pathophysiology and functional outcome following SCI. Here we showed that, with the exception of a modest improvement in performance on the Montoya staircase test at 8-10 weeks postinjury, the combinatorial treatment with ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and KD did not result in any significant improvements in the rearing test, grooming test, or horizontal ladder. Histologic analysis of the spinal cords did not reveal any significant differences in tissue sparing between treatment and control groups. Although single approaches of ghrelin, ibuprofen, C16, and KD have been reported to be beneficial after SCI, our results show that the combination of the four interventions did not confer significant functional or histological improvements in a cervical model of SCI. Possible interactions among the treatments may have negated their beneficial effects, emphasizing the challenges that have to be addressed when considering combinatorial drug therapies for SCI.

KW  - NATURAL KINDS
AB  - Background: Historical accounts of psychiatric classifications have hitherto been written in terms of a 'received view'. This contains two assumptions, that: (i) the activity of classifying is inherent to the human mind; and (ii) psychiatric 'phenomena' are stable natural objects.
   Objectives: The aim of this article is to provide an outline of the evolution of psychiatric classifications from the perspective of conceptual history. This is defined as a theoretical and empirical inquiry into the principles, sortal techniques and contexts in which alienists carried out their task. It assumes that all psychiatric classifications are cultural products, and endeavours to answer the question of whether classificatory models imported from the natural sciences can be applied to man-made constructs (such as mental illness) definitionally based on 'personalised semantics'.
   Methods: Exemplars of classificatory activity are first mapped and contextualised. Then, it is suggested that in each historical period crafting classifications has been like playing a game of chess with each move being governed by rules. This is illustrated by offering an analysis of the 1860-1861 French debate on classification.
   Results and Conclusions: (1) Medicine is not a contemplative but a modificatory activity and hence classifications are only valuable if they can release new information about the object classified. (2) It should not be inferred from the fact that psychiatric classifications are not working well (i.e. that they only behave as actuarial devices) that they must be given up. Conceptual work needs to continue to identify 'invariants' (i.e. stable elements that anchor classifications to 'nature'. (3) Because mental disorders are more than unstable behavioural epiphenomena wrapped around stable molecular changes, 'neurobiological' invariants may not do. Stability depends upon time frames. Furthermore, it is unlikely that gene-based classifications will ever be considered as classifications of mental disorders. For once, they would have low predictive power because of their lack of information about the defining codes of mental illness. 'Social' and 'psychological' invariants have problems of their own.

AB  - Life history theory argues that exposure to early life adversity (ELA) accelerates development, although existing evidence for this varies. We present a meta-analysis and systematic review testing the hypothesis that ELA involving threat (e.g., violence exposure) will be associated with accelerated biological aging across multiple metrics, whereas exposure to deprivation (e.g.. neglect, institutional rearing) and low-socioeconomic status (SES) will not. We meta-analyze 54 studies (n = 116,010) examining associations of ELA with pubertal timing and cellular aging (telomere length and DNA methylation age), systematically review 25 studies (a = 3,253) examining ELA and neural markers of accelerated development (cortical thickness and amygdala-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity) and evaluate whether associations of ELA with biological aging vary according to the nature of adversity experienced. ELA overall was associated with accelerated pubertal timing (d = -0.10) and cellular aging (d = -0.21), but these associations varied by adversity type. Moderator analysis revealed that ELA characterized by threat was associated with accelerated pubertal development (d = -0.26) and accelerated cellular aging (d = -0.43), but deprivation and SES were unrelated to accelerated development. Systematic review revealed associations between ELA and accelerated cortical thinning. with threatrelated ELA consistently associated with thinning in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and deprivation and SES associated with thinning in frontoparietal, default, and visual networks. There was no consistent association of ELA with amygdala-PFC connectivity. These findings suggest specificity in the types of early environmental experiences associated with accelerated biological aging and highlight the importance of evaluating how accelerated aging contributes to health disparities and whether this process can be mitigated through early intervention.

AB  - Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS) has come to prominence as a potential therapeutic intervention for the treatment of brain injury/disease, and as an experimental method with which to investigate Hebbian principles of neural plasticity in humans. Prototypically, a single electrical stimulus is directed to a peripheral nerve in advance of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered to the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1). Repeated pairing of the stimuli (i.e., association) over an extended period may in crease or decrease the excitability of corticospinal projections from M1, in manner that depends on the interstimulus interval (ISI). It has been suggested that these effects represent a form of associative long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) that bears resemblance to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) as it has been elaborated in animal models. With a large body of empirical evidence having emerged since the cardinal features of PAS were first described, and in light of the variations from the original protocols that have been implemented, it is opportune to consider whether the phenomenology of PAS remains consistent with the characteristic features that were initially disclosed. This assessment necessarily has bearing upon interpretation of the effects of PAS in relation to the specific cellular pathways that are putatively engaged, including those that adhere to the rules of STDP. The balance of evidence suggests that the mechanisms that contribute to the LTP and LTD-type responses to PAS differ depending on the precise nature of the induction protocol that is used. In addition to emphasizing the requirement for additional explanatory models, in the present analysis we highlight the key features of the PAS phenomenology that require interpretation.

AB  - Perinatal insults such as hypoxia-ischemia induces secondary brain injury. In order to develop the next generation of neuroprotective therapies, we urgently need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to cell death. The cell death mechanisms have been shown to be quite different in the developing brain compared to that in the adult. The aim of this review is update on what cell death mechanisms that are operating particularly in the setting of the developing CNS. In response to mild stress stimuli a number of compensatory mechanisms will be activated, most often leading to cell survival. Moderate-to-severe insults trigger regulated cell death. Depending on several factors such as the metabolic situation, cell type, nature of the stress stimulus, and which intracellular organelle(s) are affected, the cell undergoes apoptosis (caspase activation) triggered by BAX dependent mitochondrial permeabilzation, necroptosis (mixed lineage kinase domain-like activation), necrosis (via opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore), autophagic cell death (autophagy/Na+, K+-ATPase), or parthanatos (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, apoptosis-inducing factor). Severe insults cause accidental cell death that cannot be modulated genetically or by pharmacologic means. However, accidental cell death leads to the release of factors (damage-associated molecular patterns) that initiate systemic effects, as well as inflammation and (regulated) secondary brain injury in neighboring tissue. Furthermore, if one mode of cell death is inhibited, another route may step in at least in a scenario when upstream damaging factors predominate over protective responses. The provision of alternative routes through which the cell undergoes death has to be taken into account in the hunt for novel brain protective strategies.

AB  - Claims of changes in the validity coefficients associated with general mental ability (GMA) tests due to the passage of time (i.e., temporal validity degradation) have been the focus of an on-going debate in applied psychology. To evaluate whether and, if so, under what conditions this degradation may occur, we integrate evidence from multiple sub-disciplines of psychology. The temporal stability of construct validity is considered in light of the evidence regarding the differential stability of g and the invariance of measurement properties of GMA tests over the adult life-span. The temporal stability of criterion-related validity is considered in light of evidence from long-term predictive validity studies in educational and occupational realms. The evidence gained from this broad-ranging review suggests that temporal degradation of the construct- and criterion-related validity of ability test scores may not be as ubiquitous as some have previously concluded. Rather, it appears that both construct and criterion-related validity coefficients are reasonably robust over time and that any apparent degradation of criterion-related validity coefficients has more to do with changes in the determinants of task performance and changes in the nature of the criterion domain rather temporal degradation per se (i.e., the age of the test scores). A key exception to the conclusion that temporal validity degradation is more myth than reality concerns decision validity. Although the evidence is sparse, it is likely that the utility of a given GMA test score for making diagnostic decisions about an individual deteriorates over time. Importantly, we also note several areas in need of additional and more rigorous research before strong conclusions can be supported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bereavements that occur under external traumatic circumstances increase the risk for dysfunction, trauma symptomatology, as well as disordered and prolonged grief. While the majority of individuals who have experienced traumatic bereavements do not meet formal criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), or prolonged grief disorder (PGD), the degree of distress and dysfunction for these bereaved can be quite significant. The assessment and intervention paradigms in use with traumatic bereavements often prioritize the trauma and bypass the centrality of the interpersonal loss. By using a bifocal approach in conceptualizing bereavement, the Two-Track Model of Bereavement (TTMB) rebalances the approach to the class of traumatic bereavements. Track I examines biopsychosocial functioning and symptoms of trauma, and track II focuses on the nature of the ongoing relationship with the deceased and the death story that may also have elements of traumatic response. The model and its application serve to identify both adaptive and maladaptive responses to loss along both axes to optimally focus interventions where needed. The story of the death, the psychological relationship with the deceased, and the presence of biopsychosocial difficulties each have a part to play in assessment and intervention. A case study of assessment and intervention following traumatic bereavement due to suicide illustrates how attention to each of these factors in the TTMB can facilitate change. Ultimately, the relational bond with the deceased is a major vector in grief and mourning. Assessment and intervention with traumatic bereavements require attention to dysfunction and symptoms of trauma as well as to the death story and the state of the relationship to the deceased.

AB  - The rapidly changing world does not provide a man with a sense of stability; he intensifies confusion in fundamental matters related to everyday life. Evolving in directions that are difficult to predict, this is not conducive to the process of maturing into a responsible experience of humanity. Various "religious" organizations and societies take advantage of this situation, putting confusion in order (usually in an apparent way), thereby obtaining new adherents for their vision of a better world. Being under the influence of charismatic leaders, the members of new religious movements change their behavior diametrically, as well as their way of thinking about themselves and the world. Any former model of life is replaced by a new, i.e., collective, model of thinking, estimating and behaving. Important things lose their value. The hitherto prevailing existence, perceived as "bad", "unenlightened", "materialistic" or "not soulful", is left for a new and "better" life, for purposes that are attainable only thanks to contact with the new group. The acquisition of self-identity and identification with the group requires considerable effort. Going over from one world to another brings with it numerous consequences of a psychological and social nature. Hence an immense complexity of factors forming the identity of a religious man appear. On the one hand, this is influenced by personality factors, the level of inner integration, psychical and emotional maturity, and on the other hand - a number of social conditions, i.e., the specificity of the cult group, its structure, doctrine, history and social relations. All the above makes it impossible to create a universal model of the follower's identity within cult groups. It is only possible to indicate the conditions for the creation of the new individual, self leading to a manifestation of their participation within a definite cultic group.

AB  - Resveratrol is a naturally occurring phytoalexin(alexin), synthesized by some higher plants in response to injury, fungal infection or stress conditions. These are chemical substances produced by plants as a defense measure against infection by pathogenic micro-organisms like fungi. Resveratrol is synthesized in the skin but not in the fleshy part of the berries of Vitis vinifera and Vitis labrusca grapes. It is found in grapevines, roots, seeds and stalks, but its higher concentration is found in the grape skins. Peanuts and some other berries also have some resveratrol content. Black grape is nature's best source of resveratrol. Accumulation of resveratrol in grapevine leaves and berries occurs in response to attacks by pathogens such as Plasmospora viticola or Botrytis cinerea the causal agents of downy mildew and gray mold, respectively. Its essential structural skeleton comprises two aromatic rings joined by a methylene bridge. Resveratrol concentration increases during fermentation on the skins but the amount extracted depends on the variety and enological conditions. Both cis- and trans-isomers of resveratrol have been analyzed in skin, seeds and must of grape berries of Gama, starting from must to skin separation and in wine after malolactic fermentation. Trans-resveratrol concentration in red wines ranges from 1.33 mg/l to 7.17 mg/l. The white wine shows extremely low levels of resveratrol. Grapes exposed to UV light when processed into wine had higher resveratrol levels than wine without exposure. The addition of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) significantly lowers the resveratrol content. Resveratrol can reduce serum lipid levels and can prevent or inhibit cellular events associated with tumor initiation, promotion and progression, thus may help prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer.

AB  - Cellular and whole organ defence against pathogenic or chemical challenge is manifest as an adaptive response. Where appropriate, this may lead to induction of a cellular defence programme, thereby enhancing cell survival. When the challenge is overwhelming, the defence is breached and a switch is made to yield cell death, either by apoptosis or necrosis. Thus, a cell will defend itself where possible, but in extremis, it may recognise the futility of its resistance and allow itself to die. Transcription factor activation and access to the DNA regulatory elements that control a particular pattern of expression of defence genes is a major issue that may ultimately decide the fate of a cell in a changed environment. It is possible to visualise the access to the nucleus and to the genome, of paradigm gene loci or transcription factors, using a number of molecular techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation, in vivo footprinting and live/whole cell imaging. These methods are informative as to the array of transcription factors that may regulate a given gene, as well as the transitory nature of the transcriptional activation. The initial triggering of active transcription factor complexes typically occurs within the cytoplasm of the cell. Protein - protein interactions and signal transduction pathways, elucidated using a classical molecular genetics approach, have long been recognised as pivotal to the initial control of the levels and activity of transcription factors. We can now visualise modifications in critical residues of transcription factors and regulators during cellular response to chemical stress. These modifications may yield enhanced or repressed activity of transcription factors, they may be non-covalent or covalent, and they may occur in response to a variety of classes of chemicals. Such promiscuous signalling can provide plasticity in the cellular response to a wide array of chemical agents.

AB  - Background: The development of Bronfenbrenner's bio-social-ecological systems model of human development parallels advances made to the theory of resilience that progressively moved from a more individual (micro) focus on traits to a multisystemic understanding of personenvironment reciprocal processes. Methods: This review uses Bronfenbrenner's model and Ungar's social-ecological interpretation of four decades of research on resilience to discuss the results of a purposeful selection of studies of resilience that have been done in different contexts and cultures. Results: An ecological model of resilience can, and indeed has been shown to help researchers of resilience to conceptualize the child's social and physical ecologies, from caregivers to neighbourhoods, that account for both proximal and distal factors that predict successful development under adversity. Three principles emerged from this review that inform a bio-social-ecological interpretation of resilience: equifinality (there are many proximal processes that can lead to many different, but equally viable, expressions of human development associated with well-being); differential impact (the nature of the risks children face, their perceptions of the resources available to mitigate those risks and the quality of the resources that are accessible make proximal processes more or less influential to children's development); and contextual and cultural moderation (different contexts and cultures provide access to different processes associated with resilience as it is defined locally). Conclusion: As this review shows, using this multisystemic social-ecological theory of resilience can inform a deeper understanding of the processes that contribute to positive development under stress. It can also offer practitioners and policy makers a broader perspective on principles for the design and implementation of effective interventions.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can arise from rare highly penetrant mutations and genomic imbalances. The rare nature of these variants, and the often differing orbits of clinical and research geneticists, can make it difficult to fully appreciate the extent to which we have made progress in understanding the genetic etiology of autism. In fact, there is a persistent view in the autism research community that there are only a modest number of autism loci known. We carried out an exhaustive review of the clinical genetics and research genetics literature in an attempt to collate all genes and recurrent genomic imbalances that have been implicated in the etiology of ASD. We provide data on 103 disease genes and 44 genomic loci reported in subjects with ASD or autistic behavior. These genes and loci have all been causally implicated in intellectual disability, indicating that these two neurodevelopmental disorders share common genetic bases. A genetic overlap between ASD and epilepsy is also apparent in many cases. Taken together, these findings clearly show that autism is not a single clinical entity but a behavioral manifestation of tens or perhaps hundreds of genetic and genomic disorders. Increased recognition of the etiological heterogeneity of ASD will greatly expand the number of target genes for neurobiological investigations and thereby provide additional avenues for the development of pathway-based pharmacotherapy. Finally, the data provide strong support for high-resolution DNA microarrays as well as whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing as critical approaches for identifying the genetic causes of ASDs.

AB  - The endogenous pain control system has long been considered as engaged in pain depression through the commitment of multiple descending actions that reduce the response capacity of spinal dorsal horn nociceptive neurones. Such a pure inhibitory antinociceptive nature was lately questioned by the observation of pronociceptive effects from areas classically regarded as anti nociceptive. The thereby raised hypothesis of a more versatile functional arrangement that dynamically adjusts the pain modulatory effect to multiple conditions by balancing several excitatory and inhibitory actions found strong support on the recent discovery of a medullary area particularly dedicated to pain facilitation.
   Lesioning the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus (DRt) depresses nociceptive responses to acute and inflammatory pain, whereas stimulation produces the inverse effect. The decrease in formalin-induced pain behaviour following DRt lesioning is accompanied by a decrease of spinal noxious-evoked c-fos neuronal activation. DRt blocking by lidocaine results in a decrease of the nociceptive activity of spinal dorsal horn neurones, whereas stimulation by glutamate has the opposite effect. A reciprocal disynaptic putative excitatory circuit that links the DRt and the spinal dorsal horn and conveys nociceptive input through the ascending branch was described, indicating that the DRt pain facilitating action is mediated by a reverberating spino-DRt circuit that promotes the enhancement of the response capacity of spinal neurones to noxious stimulation.
   The demonstration of a primary pronociceptive centre in the endogenous pain control system brings new important data to the emerging concept of pain modulation as a dynamic and flexible process that integrates nociceptive processing by balancing multiple excitatory and inhibitory actions as the way of adapting to the various unsteady pain determinants.

AB  - Treatment non-response, drop-out, and relapse have led researchers to examine if issues related to the "self" contribute to obsessive-compulsive disorder. The present systematic review investigated whether self-beliefs relate to obsessive-compulsive symptoms and related phenomena, and if these beliefs contribute to the concealment of personal and symptom-relevant information. Ninety-nine papers (103 studies; cumulative N = 21,701) met inclusion criteria. Self was broadly conceptualized, including self-esteem (n = 18 studies), selfconcept (n = 5), self-perception (n = 2), negative self-statements (n = 2), self-ambivalence and self-concept clarity (n = 8), feared self (n = 13), self in autogenous and reactive obsessions (n = 4), self-worth (n = 8), sensitivity of self (n = 2), moral self-perceptions (n = 4), early maladaptive schemas (n = 5), egodystonicity and egosyntonicity (n = 10), self-concealment (n = 1), self-disclosure (n = 1), and symptom concealment (n = 20). Overall, while the more general experience of low self-esteem does not appear to differentiate OCD from other psychiatric conditions, self-beliefs encompassing particular egodystonic themes tend to accompany related obsessional concerns or compulsive behaviors. There is consistent evidence that a perceived morally deficient, fractured or feared self plays a role in these phenomena. Owing to methodological constraints of the included studies, the specific function of concealment behaviors in OCD is less clear. The present findings add to growing evidence suggesting the importance of understanding the idiosyncratic nature of self-beliefs in clinical presentations. Future studies should aim to clarify the conceptual overlap across the self-themes examined in this review, and the importance of self-themes for psychological treatments.

AB  - For decades, scientists and engineers have been investigating and describing storage and transport mechanisms in geological porous media such as reservoir rocks. This effort has resulted in the development of concepts such as single-phase and multi-phase flow, which describe the storage and transport of fluids in conventional reservoir rock types such as sandstones and carbonates. However, many of these concepts are not directly applicable to unconventional reservoirs. For example, shale gas reservoirs consist of organic-rich lithotypes, which have high compressibility, very small pore throats, low porosities and extremely low and anisotropic permeabilities, and relatively low gas storage capacities. The models developed to describe conventional reservoirs do not accurately describe the hydrocarbon transport processes involved in these rocks.
   In this part A of the review paper, we aim to provide a concise and complete review on characterizing the fluid transport processes in unconventional reservoirs. We will examine processes occurring at various spatial scales, ranging from fracture flow on the centimeter scale down to slip-flow on the nanometer scale. Due to the softer nature of tight shales, many processes, such as slip-flow and the pore-throat compressibility, will have to be considered as coupled. We also develop a detailed description of the coupling between slip-flow, which is a fluid dynamic effect, and the pore-throat compressibility, which is a poroelastic effect, in unconventional reservoirs, and interpret experimental observations in light of this description.
   Furthermore, we discuss in detail how these transport properties depend on organic content, clay content and type, amount of pre-adsorbed water and pore compressibility. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Emotional peer support systems have benefits for student-student relationships and allow for children and adolescents' participation in schools. For students with specific educational needs and disabilities (SEND), positive relationships seem to be more difficult to attain and these students are more vulnerable to suffer negative peer experiences such as bullying and social exclusion. Systems in which peers can show helpful behavior are beneficial for schools in order to create a positive, supportive climate. Emotional peer support entails social interaction through emotional or practical help based on what these peers have in common and many times with benefits for both. This systematic review identified interventions of emotional peer support in schools for students with SEND. Twenty-three studies were identified that involved four types of befriending: circle of friends, peer buddying, peer networks, and social lunch clubs. Studies reported mainly positive outcomes for both focus students and peer supporters in terms of increased social interaction and social acceptance, as well as enhanced self-esteem and empathy on the individual level. Further bonding of the students by friendship was also perceived, but more precise data is required to draw further conclusions. Support by the school as an institution, the specific role of the teacher, and family participation are important factors related to the impact of peer support systems. Information on these aspects was scarce, and it is recommended to include variables of this nature in future research. Intervention descriptions revealed students' active participation through suggestions for activities, however their involvement in organizing the systems was limited. More research is needed to learn about the opportunities of emotional peer support to improve student-student relationships including the active involvement of the peers themselves in this support.

AB  - Exposure to training-related cues is known to reactivate associated memory and improves subsequent retention performance under various circumstances. The present studies investigated the neural basis of retrieval cue effects, by studying in two separate experiments, the involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex and of the dorsal striatum. Rats with lesions to the prelimbic-infralimbic cortex (PL-IL), to the anterior dorsal cingulate (ACd), and to the lateral and medial parts of the dorsal striatum (IDS and mDS) were first trained in a brightness discrimination avoidance task. One day later, rats were tested after being placed in the cueing box with either no training-related cue or with additional exposures to the light discriminative stimulus. None of the lesions affected the acquisition performance. During the retention test, control rats cued with the light in the box exhibited significantly better retention performance than those simply placed in the box, confirming our previous results. While mDS lesions did not modify effects of the retrieval cue, IDS as well as both PL-IL and ACd lesions blocked the facilitative effects of the discriminative stimulus. The present data indicate that ACd, PL-IL and IDS are involved in processes promoted by exposure to training cues, the nature of which are reviewed and discussed. This study in conjunction with previous ones suggests that retrieval cues activate several subcircuits mainly based on an amygdalo-prefrontal-striatum network. Activation of this network results in an improvement of the expression of the associated conditioned response, and may thus be viewed as increasing the efficacy of the retrieval processes.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals have become contaminants of emerging concern due to their toxicity towards aquatic life and pseudo persistent nature in the environment. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is one such technology that has the potential to act as a barrier against the release of pharmaceuticals into the environment. Fouling is the deposition of the constituents of the mixed liquor on the membrane surface and it limit the world-wide applicability of MBRs. To remove foulant layer, aggressive chemicals and extra cost consideration in terms of energy are required. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and soluble microbial products (SMP) are recognized as principal foulants. Presence of pharmaceuticals has been found to increase the fouling in MBRs. Fouling aggravates in proportion to the concentration of pharmaceuticals. Phar-maceuticals exert chemical stress in microbes, hence forcing them to secrete more EPS/SMP. Pharmaceuticals alter the composition of the foulants and affect microbial metabolism, thereby inflicting direct/indirect effects on fouling. Phar-maceuticals have been found to increase or decrease the size of sludge flocs, however the exact mechanism that govern the floc size change is yet to be understood. Different techniques such as coupling advanced oxidation processes with MBR, adding activated carbon, bioaugmenting MBR with quorum quenching strains have shown to reduce fouling in MBRs treating pharmaceutical wastewater. These fouling mitigation techniques work on reducing the EPS/SMP con-centration, thereby alleviating fouling. The present review provides a comprehensive understanding of the effects in-duced by pharmaceuticals in the activated sludge characteristics and identifying the fouling mechanism. Furthermore, significant knowledge gaps and recent advances in fouling mitigation strategies are discussed. This review has also made an effort to highlight the positive aspect of the foulant layer in retaining pharmaceuticals and antibiotic resis-tance genes, thereby suggesting a possible delicate trade-off between the flux decline and enhanced removal of pharmaceuticals.

AB  - The number of people living with dementia and Alzheimer's disease is growing rapidly, making dementia one of the biggest challenges for this century. Many studies have indicated that depression plays an important role in development of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease; depression, especially, during the late life may either increase the risk of dementia or even being its prodromal stage. Despite a notably large number of carried observational studies and/or clinical trials, the association between the late life depression and dementia remains, due to the complexity of their relationship, still unclear. Moreover, during past two decades multiple other (non-)modifiable risk and possibly protective factors such as the hypertension, social engagement, obesity, level of education or physical (in)activity have been identified and their relationship with the risk for development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease has been extensively studied. It has been proposed that to understand mechanisms of dementia and Alzheimer's disease pathogeneses require their multifactorial nature represented by these multiple factors to be considered. In this review, we first summarize the recent literature findings on roles of the late life depression and the other known (non-)modifiable risk and possibly protective factors in development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Then, we provide evidences supporting hypotheses that (i) depressive syndromes in late life may indicate the prodromal stage of dementia (Alzheimer's disease) and, (ii) the interplay among the multiple (non-)modifiable risk and protective factors should be considered to gain a better understanding of dementia and Alzheimer's disease pathogeneses. We also discuss the evidences of recently established interventions considered to prevent or delay the prodromes of dementia and provide the prospective future directions in prevention and treatment of dementia and Alzheimer's disease using both the single-domain and multidomain interventions.

AB  - Significant volumes of research over the past four decades has sought to elucidate the social, infra structural, economic, and human health effects of climate change induced surface flooding. To date, epidemiological and public health studies of flooding events have focused on mental health effects, vector-borne diseases, and infectious enteric disease due to floodwater contact (i.e. typically low consumption rates). The inherent nature of groundwater (i.e. out of sight, out of mind) and the widely held belief that aquifers represent a pristine source of drinking water due to natural attenuation may represent the "perfect storm" causing direct consumption of relatively large volumes of surface flood contaminated groundwater. Accordingly, the current study sought to systematically identify and synthesize all available peer-reviewed literature pertaining to the nexus between surface flooding, groundwater contamination and human gastroenteric outcomes. Just 14 relevant studies were found to have been published during the period 1980-2017, thus highlighting the fact that this potentially significant source of climate-related exposure to environmental infection has remained understudied to date. Studies differed significantly in terms of type and data reporting procedures, making it difficult to discern clear trends and patterns. Approximately 945 confirmed cases of flood-related enteric disease were examined across studies; these concurred with almost 10,000 suspected cases, equating to approximately 20 suspected cases per confirmed case. As such, no regional, national or global estimates are available for the human gastrointestinal health burden of flood-related groundwater contamination. In light of the demonstrable public health significance of the concurrent impacts of groundwater susceptibility and climate change exacerbation, strategies to increase awareness about potential sources of contamination and motivate precautionary behaviour (e.g. drinking water testing and treatment, supply interruptions) are necessary. Mainstreaming climate adaptation concerns into planning policies will also be necessary to reduce human exposure to waterborne sources of enteric infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and advanced form of primary malignant tumor occurring in the adult central nervous system, and it is frequently associated with epilepsy, a debilitating comorbidity. Seizures are observed both pre- and post-surgical resection, indicating that several pathophysiological mechanisms are shared but also prompting questions about how the process of epileptogenesis evolves throughout GBM progression. Molecular mutations commonly seen in primary GBM, i.e., in PTEN and p53, and their associated downstream effects are known to influence seizure likelihood. Similarly, various intratumoral mechanisms, such as GBM-induced blood-brain barrier breakdown and glioma-immune cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment are also cited as contributing to network hyperexcitability. Substantial alterations to peri-tumoral glutamate and chloride transporter expressions, as well as widespread dysregulation of GABAergic signaling are known to confer increased epileptogenicity and excitotoxicity. The abnormal characteristics of GBM alter neuronal network function to result in metabolically vulnerable and hyperexcitable peri-tumoral tissue, properties the tumor then exploits to favor its own growth even post-resection. It is evident that there is a complex, dynamic interplay between GBM and epilepsy that promotes the progression of both pathologies. This interaction is only more complicated by the concomitant presence of spreading depolarization (SD). The spontaneous, high-frequency nature of GBM-associated epileptiform activity and SD-associated direct current (DC) shifts require technologies capable of recording brain signals over a wide bandwidth, presenting major challenges for comprehensive electrophysiological investigations. This review will initially provide a detailed examination of the underlying mechanisms that promote network hyperexcitability in GBM. We will then discuss how an investigation of these pathologies from a network level, and utilization of novel electrophysiological tools, will yield a more-effective, clinically-relevant understanding of GBM-related epileptogenesis. Further to this, we will evaluate the clinical relevance of current preclinical research and consider how future therapeutic advancements may impact the bidirectional relationship between GBM, SDs, and seizures.

AB  - In comparison to other mammals, humans are not especially strong, swift or supple. Nevertheless, despite these apparent physical limitations, we are among Natures most superbly well-adapted endurance runners. Paradoxically, however, notwithstanding this evolutionary-bestowed proficiency, running-related injuries, and Overuse syndromes in particular, are widely pervasive. The term 'coordination' is similarly ubiquitous within contemporary coaching, conditioning, and rehabilitation cultures. Various theoretical models of coordination exist within the academic literature. However, the specific neural and biological underpinnings of 'running coordination,' and the nature of their integration, remain poorly elaborated. Conventionally running is considered a mundane, readily mastered coordination skill. This illusion of coordinative simplicity, however, is founded upon a platform of immense neural and biological complexities. This extensive complexity presents extreme organizational difficulties yet, simultaneously, provides a multiplicity of viable pathways through which the computational and mechanical burden of running can be proficiently dispersed amongst expanded networks of conditioned neural and peripheral tissue collaborators. Learning to adequately harness this available complexity, however, is a painstakingly slowly emerging, practice-driven process, greatly facilitated by innate evolutionary organizing principles serving to constrain otherwise overwhelming complexity to manageable proportions. As we accumulate running experiences persistent plastic remodeling customizes networked neural connectivity and biological tissue properties to best fit our unique neural and architectural idiosyncrasies, and personal histories: thus neural and peripheral tissue plasticity embeds coordination habits. When, however, coordinative processes are compromised-under the integrated influence of fatigue and/or accumulative cycles of injury, overuse, misuse, and disuse-this spectrum of available 'choice' dysfunctionally contracts, and our capacity to safely disperse the mechanical 'stress' of running progressively diminishes. Now the running work burden falls increasingly on reduced populations of collaborating components. Accordingly our capacity to effectively manage, dissipate and accommodate running-imposed stress diminishes, and vulnerability to Overuse syndromes escalates. Awareness of the deep underpinnings of running coordination enhances conceptual clarity, thereby informing training and rehabilitation insights designed to offset the legacy of excessive or progressively accumulating exposure to running-imposed mechanical stress.

AB  - The ability to form, retain, and later retrieve memories of both mundane, everyday events and unique experiences is something that most intact adults take for granted. Whereas we might at times marvel at the apparently random chains of events that bring to mind memories presumed long since forgotten, we do not take particular note of the fact that such experiences occur. In contrast, for most of the last century, researchers and theoreticians subscribed, either explicitly or implicitly, to the view that infants and very young children do not share this feature of mental life. Quite the contrary-it was widely assumed that the young of our species did not, and, furthermore, could not, recall previous experiences. The past 2 decades have seen challenges to this assumption. Current theory ascribes to infants and young children explicit representational ability (e.g., Mandler, 1998); there is mounting empirical evidence that by the second half of the Ist year of life, children are able to recall specific events (e.g., Barr, Dowden, & Hayne, 1996; Carver gc Bauer, 1999; Meltzoff, 1988b). What remains uncharted are the parameters of remembering and forgetting during the period of transition from infancy to early childhood, the age range during which recall abilities consolidate and become reliable. In this Monograph, we report the results of a large-scale investigation of mnemonic performance by children aged 13 to 20 months at the time of experience of events and 14 to 32 months at the time of recall of them. In it we examined effects of (a) age at the time of experience of events, (b) the length of the delay interval over which recall was tested, (c) the nature of to-be-remembered events, (d) the mode of experience of events, and (e) the availability of reminders of events, on long-term recall.

AB  - Self-control is considered broadly important for many domains of life. One of its unfortunate features, however, is that it tends to wane over time, with little agreement about why this is the case. Recently, there has been a push to address this problem by looking to the literature in exercise physiology, specifically the work on the central governor model of physical fatigue. Trying to explain how and why mental performance wanes over time, the central governor model suggests that exertion is throttled by some central nervous system mechanism that receives information about energetic bodily needs and motivational drives to regulate exertion and, ultimately, to prevent homeostatic breakdown, chiefly energy depletion. While we admire the spirit of integration and the attempt to shed light on an important topic in psychology, our concern is that the central governor model is very controversial in exercise physiology, with increasing calls to abandon it altogether, making it a poor fit for psychology. Our concerns are threefold. First, while we agree that preservation of bodily homeostasis makes for an elegant ultimate account, the fact that such important homeostatic concerns can be regularly overturned with even slight incentives (e.g., a smile) renders the ultimate account impotent and points to other ultimate functions for fatigue. Second, despite the central governor being thought to take as input information about the metabolic needs of the body, there is no credible evidence that mental effort actually consumes inordinate amounts of energy that are not already circulating in the brain. Third, recent modifications of the model make the central governor appear like an all knowing homunculus and unfalsifiable in principle, thus contributing very little to our understanding of why people tend to disengage from effortful tasks over time. We note that the latest models in exercise physiology have actually borrowed concepts and models from psychology to understand physical performance.

AB  - A broad array of infant studies are reviewed that appear to be consistent with the idea that belief understanding specifically, and mental attribution generally, emerge much earlier than previously acknowledged. We first examine existing false-belief research, which, while confirming that children under 4 years perform poorly on standard tests, suggests nevertheless that they have more implicit understanding of beliefs than they can express. After surveying theories that both favor and reject early development of theory of mind (TOM), we address two recent bodies of visual fixation research that provide support for the possibility of knowledge and belief attribution in infancy. The first indicates that infants of 13-15 months are sensitive to others' false beliefs (and therefore have a representational TOM), the second, that by 12 months or younger infants have two antecedently related psychological understandings: (a) that when agents look they "see" and (b) that seeing plays a presumptive role in producing knowledge. This raises the broader question of whether "mentalism" might be part of core knowledge, which takes us to the earliest manifestation of psychological attribution, the construal of agentive behavior as intentional. Contrary to previous assumptions, recent studies indicate that infants of 3-9 months do not accord intentionality exclusively to humans or to self-propelled objects but rather to any entity that: (1) chooses flexibly among means and ends, (2) responds non-randomly to social overtures, and (3) reacts rationally to changing circumstances (i.e., that is not a mere automaton but is selectively and adaptively responsive to the environment). Other evidence is then examined which suggests that infants begin to construe these and other behaviors in mentalist rather than teleological terms much earlier than expected. Finally, the implications of this empirical record for domain-specific and domain-general theories of TOM are considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial dimensions of many social, economic and environmental challenges facing 21st century societies can be addressed through the idea of landscape. The European Landscape Convention - ELC (Council of Europe, 2000 - Article 1a) views landscape as representing not simply the environment, but the world "as perceived by people". As a concept, landscape is increasingly understood as uniting the physical, mental, natural and cultural dimensions of human existence; good quality landscapes are thus integral to our well-being. The problems and challenges facing our landscapes require greater understanding of how they function and change, as well as their meanings and values. Scholars working in the area of landscape research have increasingly advocated the need to enhance integrative approaches between the natural, human and applied sciences. However, drawing together the collective insights from across the sciences presents a range of conceptual and methodological issues. The question of scale as it pertains to different scientific realms is a key example of this kind of challenge to integrative approaches. The multi-scale nature of the social, environmental and economic challenges embedded in the landscape demands that scholars address these key issues of scale in their research. The aim of this paper is to review how the concept of scale has been interpreted and applied within the arena of landscape research, focussing specifically on three of the principal disciplinary contributors - ecology/landscape ecology, geography and spatial planning. The objective of this discussion is to synthesise scalar issues that feature within and across these perspectives, to better understand how they impact on the way landscape is conceptualised and thus produced through academic and related policy discourses. It seeks out points of tension as well as convergence when dealing with scale. It reflects on academic, policy and practice-related concerns that would form part of longer-term holistic strategies for landscape protection, planning and management in line with those being advocated by the ELC.

AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children worldwide, and also the recognition of its persistence into adulthood is increasing. While ADHD in childhood is highly heritable and mostly driven by familial factors, during adulthood it appears to show a lower heritability, even if there is not total agreement on this yet. This disorder often co-occurs with many other conditions, which also vary across the different stages of development, and several studies have used the twin design to investigate these comorbidities, giving valuable insights into the origins of the observed co-occurrence. This review aims to summarize the main results of twin research, according to the following domains: individual traits, cognitive impairment, behavioral manifestations, clinical conditions and psychosocial risk factors. Individual features seem to play a role in this symptomatology and include personality traits such as negative emotionality, personality disorders and temperamental dimensions with a predominance of novelty seeking. At a lower level, ADHD is associated with both functional and anatomic brain characteristics. ADHD is also associated with some forms of cognitive impairment, such as sluggish cognitive tempo, and learning disabilities, with a specific predisposition to reading disability. In addition, ADHD is strongly associated with externalizing disorders such as conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, and some behavioral outcomes, particularly substance use and abuse both in adolescence and adulthood. Moreover, ADHD symptoms often overlap with other psychological disorders, namely affective and internalizing disorders, as well as autism spectrum disorder and autisticlike traits in a wider sense. Notably, a genetic overlap has been found between asthma and ADHD, particularly with respect to hyperactivity/impulsivity dimensions. ADHD also appears to represent a risk factor for disordered eating, and, more specifically, for binge eating and bulimia nervosa, Finally, among psychosocial factors, an association has been proposed between childhood maltreatment and ADHD symptoms.

AB  - Pain is a diverse sensory and emotional experience that likely involves activation of numerous regions of the brain. Yet, many of these areas are also implicated in the processing of nonpainful somatosensory information. In order to better characterize the processing of pain within the human brain, activation produced by noxious stimuli was compared with that produced by robust innocuous stimuli. Painful heat (47-48 degrees C), nonpainful vibratory (110 Hz), and neutral control (34 degrees C) stimuli were applied to the left forearm of right-handed male subjects. Activation of regions within the diencephalon and telencephalon was evaluated by measuring regional cerebral blood flow using positron emission tomography (O-15-water-bolus method).
   Painful stimulation produced contralateral activation in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII), anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, the supplemental motor area of the frontal cortex, and thalamus. Vibrotactile stimulation produced activation in contralateral SI, and bilaterally in SII and posterior insular cortices. A direct comparison of pain and vibrotactile stimulation revealed that both stimuli produced activation In similar regions of SI and SII, regions long thought to be involved activating the anterior insula, a region heavily linked with both somatosensory and limbic systems. Such connections may provide one route through which nociceptive input may be integrated with memory in order to allow a full appreciation of the meaning and dangers of painful stimuli.
   These data reveal that pain-related activation, although predominantly contralateral in distribution, is more widely dispersed across both cortical and thalamic regions than that produced during innocuous vibrotactile stimulation. This distributed cerebral activation reflects the complex nature of pain, involving discriminative, affective, autonomic, and motoric components. Furthermore, the high degree of interconnectivity among activated regions may account for the difficulty of eliminating pathological pain with discrete CNS lesions.

TI  - Reports of peak- and other experiences during a neurotechnology-based training program, part 2
KW  - SPIRITUALITY
KW  - HEALTH
AB  - This study examined the nature of self-reported peak- and other powerful experiences during a 6-day residential, neurotechnology-based training program. Neurotechnologies are methods and devices that purportedly enhance mental functioning by entraining brain-wave patterns, often producing a psychophysiological state of hemispheric synchronization. A partial review of the literature on these subjects was presented in Part 1 in the preceding issue of this Journal. A 2-part peak-experience questionnaire was developed. Part 1 collected retrospective self-reports of participants' experiences; Part 2 gathered information on their impact and the processes of integration. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator measured participants' personality characteristics; the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument measured cognitive styles. Of 160 participants (81 males, 79 females), 121 reported 75 types of peak-and other experiences. These were grouped by phenomenological content under 4 categories: "intensified sensory and perceptual," "cognitive," "psychodynamic," and "transpersonal." Types, intensity, and richness of patterns of experience reported were strikingly similar to those reported by psychedelic (LSD) researchers. Short-term aftereffects occurred in 4 areas: ontological, spiritual, psychological, and bioenergetical. Longer-term aftereffects resembled changes associated with the sustained practice of meditation. Most experiences had a moderate to "life-changing" impact. Peak-experiences, narrowly defined, had the greatest reported impact overall. Chi-square analyses yielded nonsignificant differences between peak-experiencers (n = 16) and non-experiencers (n = 20) on personality type, cognitive style, religious affiliation, educational level, age, and gender. However, differences approached significance on religious orientation (chi (2) = 2.043, p = .15288), which may indicate a trend worthy of further investigation with a larger sample. Mental engagement with experiences was important in integrating and being changed by them. This was evidenced by the positive relationship between amount of time spent thinking about one's experiences and their degree of impact (r(S) =.4849, p < .001). The most preferred method of integration involved discussing one's experiences, followed by reading about similar experiences, keeping one's experiences to oneself, and writing about one's experiences. Factors hindering the integrative process are discussed. Results contribute to understanding the varieties of exceptional human experience.

AB  - Serpentinitic ultramafic geological environments (SUGEs) contain toxic geogenic contaminants (TGCs). Yet comprehensive reviews on the medical geology of SUGEs are still lacking. The current paper posits that TGCs occur widely in SUGEs, and pose human health risks. The objectives of the review are to: (1) highlight the nature, occurrence and behaviour of TGCs associated with SUGEs; (2) discuss the human intake pathways and health risks of TGCs; (4) identify the key risk factors predisposing human health to TGCs particularly in Africa; and (5) highlight key knowledge gaps and future research directions. TGCs of human health concern in SUGEs include chrysotile asbestos, toxic metals (Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn, Zn, Co), and rare earth elements. Human intake of TGCs occur via inhalation, and ingestion of contaminated drinking water, wild foods, medicinal plants, animal foods, and geophagic earths. Occupational exposure may occur in the mining, milling, sculpturing, engraving, and carving industries. African populations are particularly at high risk due to: (1) widespread consumption of wild foods, medicinal plants, untreated drinking water, and geophagic earths; (2) weak and poorly enforced environmental, occupational, and public health regulations; and (3) lack of human health surveillance systems. Human health risks of chrysotile include asbestosis, cancers, and mesothelioma. Toxic metals are redox active, thus generate reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress. Dietary intake of iron and geophagy may increase the iron overload among native Africans who are genetically predisposed to such health risks. Synergistic interactions among TGCs particularly chrysotile and toxic metals may have adverse human health effects. The occurrence of SUGEs, coupled with the several risk factors in Africa, provides a unique and ideal setting for investigating the relationships between TGCs and human health risks. A conceptual framework for human health risk assessment and mitigation, and future research direction are highlighted. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The security circuit: A proposed construct for the central nervous system
AB  - The theory of the Security Circuit offers a new conceptual Framework for the numerous brain functions pertaining to survival. Many such activities are related to the coordination of the conventional physiological systems in the maintenance of homeostasis and the defense of the internal environment. This work, however, focuses on that aspect of brain function that makes possible man's interaction with external environment, thereby facilitating individual and group adaptation and survival.
   In our schema we greatly enlarge the conceptualization of the autonomic nervous system. We postulate the existence of a central mechanism pertaining to the security and survival function. In its action the complex physiological ANS substrate designated the Security Circuit, is likened to a whiripool bath, in which balance is maintained with respect to electrically-charged particles rather than water. The use of the Jacuzzi (or whirlpool bath) format makes it possible to tie together the components of the triune brain (MacLean), which consists of R-complex, limbic system, and neocortex.
   The forebrain, in part, is viewed as the depository of biological symbolism for a huge number of elements, which vary with the individual. Among these are security and support figures, and others that make up meaningful relationships. These are seen as represented on posts, consisting of either individual, or else groupings, of neurons which are linked to the limbic system to trigger oft predictable patterns of behavior and/or emotional expression.
   The limbic system serves as the energizer in arousal-defense. It also serves to trigger instinctive and other psychomotor patterns in the pursuit of goals which have survival value, while simultaneously producing the chemistry behind emotions useful to man.
   Some of these psychomotor patterns (i.e., behavior) facilitate the provision of nutrients and warmth for the individual. and so ensure internal homeostasis. while others effectuate group action towards this end.
   The apparent neuroendocrinal sequence of events in many common environmental situations is discussed. Responses to a perceived threat are examined, noting both the reflex behavior patterns resulting from somatic and ANS discharge, and the associated emotional expression. The chemoelectrical workings of the limbic system keep the central mechanism in a state of balance, while neocortical centers of cognition translate the minute changes in the chemical mix into subjective emotional experience which contribute to the phenomenon of consciousness. The R-complex is seen as the physiological component of the unconscious brain regulating the internal vital functions. The task of the higher centers is not merely to inhibit impulsive (primitive) responses. but also has the following functions: (i) determine the more sophisticated, effective manner of dealing with perceived threats, and (ii) initiate and facilitate the pursuit of goals promoting survival and well-being for self and group.
   The human thrust to self-expression or self-actualization is seen as an outgrowth of this process. The theory suggests that intellectual and creative activity within a group is an extension in evolution of primal, survival functions. This thrust has resulted in the growth of culture and development of civilization. While the related neurophysiological activities enhance security and environmental adaptation for self and group, they simultaneously resolve heightened microelectrical tension within the underlying mechanism within the individual's neuroendocrinal complex. The brain, and autonomic and endocrine systems are seen as parts of the same physiological system which pertains to security, survival, and well-being. The concept is presented that the thrust to maintain microelectrical balance within the Security Circuit ia substrate of thr CNS) has been the ever-present, ongoing driving force behind the evolution of the "higher," neocortical centers of consciousness during the psychosocial phase. These centers have responded in a highly specialized way over the millennia to the numerous stress factors posed by an often hostile environment.
   Supportive data favoring the existence of the Security Circuit taken from ethology, cultural anthropology, psychology and psychoanalysis. Soviet psychophysiology, clinical medicine and psychiatry, psychopharmacology, psychosurgery, the sociology of religion, and sociobiology are presented. Pertinent gleanings from history, seen as a study and record of past human ethology, further substantiate the theory.
   If one accepts modern evolutionary theory, and the validity of applying the biologic principle of homeostasis to neurophysiology. one is led to the inescapable conclusion that the unique nature and cultural development of man is the result of the function of a central neuroendocrinal mechanism. A startling implication of the theory is the sure existence of a heretofore indistinctly delineated physiological system whose functions relate to man's well-being, security and survival, either for self or group.

AB  - Thyroid hormones (THs) play an obligatory role in many fundamental processes underlying brain development and maturation. The developing embryo/fetus is dependent on maternal supply of TH. The fetal thyroid gland does not commence TH synthesis until mid gestation, and the adverse consequences of severe maternal TH deficiency on offspring neurodevelopment are well established. Recent evidence suggests that even more moderate forms of maternal thyroid dysfunction, particularly during early gestation, may have a long-lasting influence on child cognitive development and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, these observed alterations appear to be largely irreversible after birth. It is, therefore, important to gain a better understanding of the role of maternal thyroid dysfunction on offspring neurodevelopment in terms of the nature, magnitude, time specificity, and context-specificity of its effects. With respect to the issue of context specificity, it is possible that maternal stress and stress-related biological processes during pregnancy may modulate maternal thyroid function. The possibility of an interaction between the thyroid and stress systems in the context of fetal brain development has, however, not been addressed to date.
   We begin this review with a brief overview of TH biology during pregnancy and a summary of the literature on its effect on the developing brain. Next, we consider and discuss whether and how processes related to maternal stress and stress biology may interact with and modify the effects of maternal thyroid function on offspring brain development. We synthesize several research areas and identify important knowledge gaps that may warrant further study. The scientific and public health relevance of this review relates to achieving a better understanding of the timing, mechanisms and contexts of thyroid programing of brain development, with implications for early identification of risk, primary prevention and intervention.

AB  - In traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, elevation of the brain extracellular lactate concentration and the lactate/pyruvate ratio are well-recognized, and are associated statistically with unfavorable clinical outcome. Brain extracellular lactate was conventionally regarded as a waste product of glucose, when glucose is metabolized via glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway) to pyruvate, followed by conversion to lactate by the action of lactate dehydrogenase, and export of lactate into the extracellular fluid. In TBI, glycolytic lactate is ascribed to hypoxia or mitochondrial dysfunction, although the precise nature of the latter is incompletely understood. Seemingly in contrast to lactate's association with unfavorable outcome is a growing body of evidence that lactate can be beneficial. The idea that the brain can utilize lactate by feeding into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of neurons, first published two decades ago, has become known as the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis. Direct evidence of brain utilization of lactate was first obtained 5 years ago in a cerebral microdialysis study in TBI patients, where administration of C-13-labeled lactate via the microdialysis catheter and simultaneous collection of the emerging microdialysates, with C-13 NMR analysis, revealed C-13 labeling in glutamine consistent with lactate utilization via the TCA cycle. This suggests that where neurons are too damaged to utilize the lactate produced from glucose by astrocytes, i.e., uncoupling of neuronal and glial metabolism, high extracellular levels of lactate would accumulate, explaining the association between high lactate and poor outcome. Recently, an intravenous exogenous lactate supplementation study in TBI patients revealed evidence for a beneficial effect judged by surrogate endpoints. Here we review the current state of knowledge about glycolysis and lactate in TBI, how it can be measured in patients, and whether it can be modulated to achieve better clinical outcome.

AB  - Background: The year 2009 is the 200th anniversary of the publication of Jean-Bapteste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique and the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Lamarck believed that evolution is driven primarily by non-randomly acquired, beneficial phenotypic changes, in particular, those directly affected by the use of organs, which Lamarck believed to be inheritable. In contrast, Darwin assigned a greater importance to random, undirected change that provided material for natural selection.
   The concept: The classic Lamarckian scheme appears untenable owing to the non-existence of mechanisms for direct reverse engineering of adaptive phenotypic characters acquired by an individual during its life span into the genome. However, various evolutionary phenomena that came to fore in the last few years, seem to fit a more broadly interpreted (quasi) Lamarckian paradigm. The prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas system of defense against mobile elements seems to function via a bona fide Lamarckian mechanism, namely, by integrating small segments of viral or plasmid DNA into specific loci in the host prokaryote genome and then utilizing the respective transcripts to destroy the cognate mobile element DNA (or RNA). A similar principle seems to be employed in the piRNA branch of RNA interference which is involved in defense against transposable elements in the animal germ line. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), a dominant evolutionary process, at least, in prokaryotes, appears to be a form of (quasi) Lamarckian inheritance. The rate of HGT and the nature of acquired genes depend on the environment of the recipient organism and, in some cases, the transferred genes confer a selective advantage for growth in that environment, meeting the Lamarckian criteria. Various forms of stress-induced mutagenesis are tightly regulated and comprise a universal adaptive response to environmental stress in cellular life forms. Stress-induced mutagenesis can be construed as a quasi-Lamarckian phenomenon because the induced genomic changes, although random, are triggered by environmental factors and are beneficial to the organism.
   Conclusion: Both Darwinian and Lamarckian modalities of evolution appear to be important, and reflect different aspects of the interaction between populations and the environment.

AB  - In the midst of concerns for potential neurodevelopmental effects after surgical anesthesia, there is a growing awareness that children who require sedation during critical illness are susceptible to neurologic dysfunctions collectively termed pediatric post-intensive care syndrome, or PICS-p. In contrast to healthy children undergoing elective surgery, critically ill children are subject to inordinate neurologic stress or injury and need to be considered separately. Despite recognition of PICS-p, inconsistency in techniques and timing of post-discharge assessments continues to be a significant barrier to understanding the specific role of sedation in later cognitive dysfunction. Nonetheless, available pediatric studies that account for analgesia and sedation consistently identify sedative and opioid analgesic exposures as risk factors for both in-hospital delirium and post-discharge neurologic sequelae. Clinical observations are supported by animal models showing neuroinflammation, increased neuronal death, dysmyelination, and altered synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. Additionally, intensive care sedation also contributes to sleep disruption, an important and overlooked variable during acute illness and post-discharge recovery. Because analgesia and sedation are potentially modifiable, understanding the underlying mechanisms could transform sedation strategies to improve outcomes. To move the needle on this, prospective clinical studies would benefit from cohesion with regard to datasets and core outcome assessments, including sleep quality. Analyses should also account for the wide range of diagnoses, heterogeneity of this population, and the dynamic nature of neurodevelopment in age cohorts. Much of the related preclinical evidence has been studied in comparatively brief anesthetic exposures in healthy animals during infancy and is not generalizable to critically ill children. Thus, complementary animal models that more accurately "reverse translate " critical illness paradigms and the effect of analgesia and sedation on neuropathology and functional outcomes are needed. This review explores the interactive role of sedatives and the neurologic vulnerability of critically ill children as it pertains to survivorship and functional outcomes, which is the next frontier in pediatric intensive care.

AB  - Developmental stressors are increasingly recognised for their pervasive influence on the ecology and evolution of animals. In particular, many studies have focused on how developmental stress can give rise to variation in adult behaviour, physiology, and performance. However, there remains a poor understanding of whether general patterns exist in the effects and magnitude of phenotypic responses across taxonomic groups. Furthermore, given the extensive phenotypic variation that arises from developmental stressors, it remains important to ascertain how multiple processes may explain these responses. We compiled data from 111 studies to examine and quantify the effect of developmental stress on animal phenotype and performance from juveniles to adulthood, including studies from birds, reptiles, fish, mammals, insects, arachnids, and amphibians. Using meta-analytic approaches, we show that across all studies there is, on average, a moderate to large negative effect of developmental stress exposure (posterior mean effect: |d| = -0.51) on animal phenotype or performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that interactive effects of timing of stressor onset and the duration of exposure to stressors best explained variation in developmental stress responses. Animals exposed to stressors earlier in development had more-positive responses than those with later onset, whereas longer duration of exposure to a stressor caused responses to be stronger in magnitude. However, the high amount of heterogeneity in our results, and the low degree of variance explained by fixed effects in both the meta-analysis (R-2 = 0.034) and top-ranked meta-regression model (R-2 = 0.02), indicate that phenotypic responses to developmental stressors are likely highly idiosyncratic in nature and difficult to predict. Despite this, our analyses address a critical knowledge gap in understanding what effect developmental stress has on phenotypic variation in animals. Additionally, our results highlight important environmental and proximate factors that may influence phenotypic responses to developmental stressors.

AB  - Background: Cancer diagnosis and treatment represent a real upheaval both for the patient and for his or her life partner. Adjustment to cancer has been widely studied at the individual level, however, there is little in the literature about the experiences of the couple as an entity. This is especially true with regard to a population facing advanced cancer. This systematic review aimed to make an inventory of 1) the current knowledge relating to the experience of the patient-partner dyad when confronted with advanced cancer, and 2) the psychosocial interventions specifically centered on this dyad. Method: This review was conducted using the Cochrane methodology. The eligibility criteria for the literature review were: one of the members of the dyad being treated for advanced cancer, dyad composed of the patient and his/her life partner. Databases from PubMed, PsycArticle, PsycInfo, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection and Scopus were investigated. A thematic content analysis on the basis of admitted articles made it possible to respond to each of our research objectives. Results: Three hundred eighty-nine citations were found. Twenty were admitted to the systematic review of the literature. It highlighted the following experiences of the advanced cancer patient-life partner dyad: uncertainty about the future, disjointed time, intrusion into the couple's intimacy, attachment style and caregiving within the couple, couple's adjustment to cancer symptomatology, the couple's supportive care needs, role changes, nature of communication within the couple, anticipation of the coming death, and the meanings and beliefs around death. This review also describes the range of couple therapies used in the context of advanced cancer: emotionally focused-couple therapy, existential therapy, art therapy, support therapy and couple communication and intimacy promotion. These therapies seem to have individual beneficial effects for both the patient and his or her life partner as well as improving marital functioning. Conclusions: These results clearly highlight that consideration of the couple and communication within the couple during care are fundamental to dyadic adjustment to advanced cancer. Further studies (qualitative and quantitative) are needed to better understand the couple's experience in order to adapt the management of the couple facing advanced cancer.

So far, there is no mechanism to explain the origin or cause of telomere shortening in this syndrome; however, oxidative stress is a constant factor. Therefore, we reviewed scientific evidence that supported the association between oxidative stress and telomere length dynamics, also examining how each of the metabolic syndrome components individually affects the length. In this regard, there is strong scientific evidence that an increase in the number of metabolic syndrome components is associated with a shorter telomere length, oxidative damage at the lipid and DNA level, and inflammation, as well as its other components, such as obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, while for dyslipidemia, there is a little more discrepancy. The difficulty for the correct treatment of metabolic syndrome lies in its multifactorial nature. Hence, there is a need to carry out more studies on healthy lifestyles during aging to prevent and reduce oxidative damage and telomere wear during aging, and consequently the progression of chronic degenerative diseases, thus improving the living conditions of older people.
   A great amount of scientific evidence supports that Oxidative Stress (OxS) can contribute to telomeric attrition and also plays an important role in the development of certain age-related diseases, among them the metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is characterised by clinical and biochemical alterations such as obesity, dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension, hyperglycaemia, and insulin resistance, all of which are considered as risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases, which are associated in turn with an increase of OxS. In this sense, we review scientific evidence that supports the association between OxS with telomere length (TL) dynamics and the relationship with MetS components in aging. It was analysed whether each MetS component affects the telomere length separately or if they all affect it together. Likewise, this review provides a summary of the structure and function of telomeres and telomerase, the mechanisms of telomeric DNA repair, how telomere length may influence the fate of cells or be linked to inflammation and the development of age-related diseases, and finally, how the lifestyles can affect telomere length.

AB  - Background Social relationships are crucial for well-being and health, and considerable research has established social stressors as a risk for well-being and health. However, researchers have used many different constructs, and it is unclear if these are actually different or reflect a single overarching construct. Distinct patterns of associations with health/well-being would indicate separate constructs, similar patterns would indicate a common core construct, and remaining differences could be attributed to situational characteristics such as frequency or intensity. The current meta-analysis therefore investigated to what extent different social stressors show distinct (versus similar) patterns of associations with well-being and health. Methods We meta-analysed 557 studies and investigated correlations between social stressors and outcomes in terms of health and well-being (e.g. burnout), attitudes (e.g. job satisfaction), and behaviour (e.g. counterproductive work behaviour). Moderator analyses were performed to determine if there were differences in associations depending on the nature of the stressor, the outcome, or both. To be included, studies had to be published in peer-reviewed journals in English or German; participants had to be employed at least 50% of a full-time equivalent (FTE). Results The overall relation between social stressors and health/well-being was of medium size (r = -.30, p < .001). Type of social stressor and outcome category acted as moderators, with moderating effects being larger for outcomes than for stressors. The strongest effects emerged for job satisfaction, burnout, commitment, and counterproductive work behaviour. Type of stressor yielded a significant moderation, but differences in effect sizes for different stressors were rather small overall. Rather small effects were obtained for physical violence and sexual mistreatment, which is likely due to a restricted range because of rare occurrence and/or underreporting of such intense stressors. Conclusions We propose integrating diverse social stressor constructs under the term "relational devaluation" and considering situational factors such as intensity or frequency to account for the remaining variance. Practical implications underscore the importance for supervisors to recognize relational devaluation in its many different forms and to avoid or minimize it as far as possible in order to prevent negative health-related outcomes for employees.

AB  - This article attempts an overview of the mechanism of NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and its role in hippocampal networks. Efforts are made to integrate information, often in speculative ways, and to identify unresolved issues about the induction, expression and molecular storage processes. The pre/post debate about LTP expression has been particularly difficult to resolve. The following hypothesis attempts to reconcile the available physiological evidence as well as anatomical evidence that LTP increases synapse size. It is proposed that synapses are composed of a variable number of trans-synaptic modules, each having presynaptic release sites and a postsynaptic structure that can be AMPAfied by the addition of a hyperslot assembly that anchors 10-20 AMPA channels. According to a newly developed view of transmission, the quantal response is generated by AMPA channels near the site of vesicle release and so will depend on whether the module where release occurs has been AMPAfied. LTP expression may involve two structurally mediated processes: (i) the AMPAfication of existing modules by addition of hyperslot assemblies: this is a purely postsynaptic process and produces an increase in the probability of an AMPA response, with no change in the NMDA component; and (ii) the addition of new modules: this is a structurally coordinated pre/post process that leads to LTP-induced synapse enlargement and potentiation of the NMDA component owing to an increase in the number of release sites (the number of NMDA channels is assumed to be fixed). The protocol used for LTP induction appears to affect the proportion of these two processes; pairing protocols that involve low-frequency presynaptic stimulation induce only AMPAfication, making LTP purely postsynaptic, whereas high-frequency stimulation evokes both processes, giving rise to a presynaptic component. This model is capable of reconciling much of the seemingly contradictory evidence in the pre/post debate. The structural nature of the postulated changes is relevant to a second debate: whether a CaMKII switch or protein-dependent structural change is the molecular memory mechanism. A possible reconciliation is that a reversible CaMKII switch controls the construction of modules and hyperslot assemblies from newly synthesized proteins.

AB  - Rockstrom et al. (2009a, 2009b) have warned that humanity must reduce anthropogenic impacts defined by nine planetary boundaries if "unacceptable global change" is to be avoided. Chemical pollution was identified as one of those boundaries for which continued impacts could erode the resilience of ecosystems and humanity. The central concept of the planetary boundary (or boundaries) for chemical pollution (PBCP or PBCPs) is that the Earth has a finite assimilative capacity for chemical pollution, which includes persistent as well as readily degradable chemicals released at local to regional scales, which in aggregate threaten ecosystem and human viability. The PBCP allows humanity to explicitly address the increasingly global aspects of chemical pollution throughout a chemical's life cycle and the need for a global response of internationally coordinated control measures. We submit that sufficient evidence shows stresses on ecosystem and human health at local to global scales, suggesting that conditions are transgressing the safe operating space delimited by a PBCP. As such, current local to global pollution control measures are insufficient. However, while the PBCP is an important conceptual step forward, at this point single or multiple PBCPs are challenging to operationalize due to the extremely large number of commercial chemicals or mixtures of chemicals that cause myriad adverse effects to innumerable species and ecosystems, and the complex linkages between emissions, environmental concentrations, exposures and adverse effects. As well, the normative nature of a PBCP presents challenges of negotiating pollution limits amongst societal groups with differing viewpoints. Thus, a combination of approaches is recommended as follows: develop indicators of chemical pollution, for both control and response variables, that will aid in quantifying a PBCP(s) and gauging progress towards reducing chemical pollution; develop new technologies and technical and social approaches to mitigate global chemical pollution that emphasize a preventative approach; coordinate pollution control and sustainability efforts; and facilitate implementation of multiple (and potentially decentralized) control efforts involving scientists, civil society, government, non-governmental organizations and international bodies.

KW  - SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM

KW  - MARKETS
AB  - Hedge funds have become critical players in both corporate governance and corporate control. In this Article, Professors Kahan and Rock document and examine the nature of hedge fund activism, how and why it differs from activism by traditional institutional investors, and its implications for corporate governance and regulatory reform. The authors argue that hedge fund activism differs from activism by traditional institutions in several ways: it is directed at significant changes in individual companies (rather than small, systemic changes), it entails higher costs, and it is strategic and ex ante (rather than incidental and ex post). The reasons for these differences may lie in the incentive structures of hedge fund managers as well as in the fact that traditional institutions face regulatory barriers, political constraints, or conflicts of interest that make activism less profitable than it is for hedge funds. But the differences may also be due to the fact that traditional institutions pursue a diversification strategy that is difficult to combine with strategic activism.
   Although hedge funds hold great promise as active shareholders, their intense involvement in corporate governance and control raises two potential problems: the interests of hedge funds sometimes diverge from those of their fellow shareholders, and the intensity of hedge fund activism imposes substantial stress that the regulatory system may not be able to withstand. The resulting concerns, however, are relatively isolated and narrow, do not undermine the value of hedge fund activism as a whole, and do not warrant major additional regulatory interventions.
   The sharpest accusation leveled against activist funds is that activism is designed to achieve a short-term payoff at the expense of long-term profitability. Although the authors consider this a potentially serious problem that arguably pervades hedge fund activism, they conclude that a sufficient case for legal intervention has not been made. This conclusion results from the uncertainties about whether short-termism is, in fact, a real problem and how much hedge fund activism is driven by excessive short-termism. But most importantly, it stems from the authors' view that, market forces and adaptive devices adopted by companies individually are better designed than regulation to deal with the potential negative effects of hedge fund short-termism, while preserving the positive effects of hedge fund activism.

AB  - Background: Within the past decade, health care service and research priorities have shifted from evidence-based medicine to personalized medicine. In mental health care, a similar shift to personalized intervention may boost the effectiveness and clinical utility of empirically supported therapies (ESTs). The emerging science of personalized intervention will need to encompass evidence-based methods for determining which problems to target and in which order, selecting treatments and deciding whether and how to combine them, and informing ongoing clinical decision-making through monitoring of treatment response throughout episodes of care. We review efforts to develop these methods, drawing primarily from psychotherapy research with youths. Then we propose strategies for building a science of personalized intervention in youth mental health. Findings: The growing evidence base for personalizing interventions includes research on therapies adapted for specific subgroups; treatments targeting youths' environments; modular therapies; sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trials; measurement feedback systems; meta-analyses comparing treatments for specific patient characteristics; data-mining decision trees; and individualized metrics. Conclusion: The science of personalized intervention presents questions that can be addressed in several ways. First, to evaluate and organize personalized interventions, we propose modifying the system used to evaluate and organize ESTs. Second, to help personalizing research keep pace with practice needs, we propose exploiting existing randomized trial data to inform personalizing approaches, prioritizing the personalizing approaches likely to have the greatest impact, conducting more idiographic research, and studying tailoring strategies in usual care. Third, to encourage clinicians' use of personalized intervention research to inform their practice, we propose expanding outlets for research summaries and case studies, developing heuristic frameworks that incorporate personalizing approaches into practice, and integrating personalizing approaches into service delivery systems. Finally, to build a richer understanding of how and why treatments work for particular individuals, we propose accelerating research to identify mediators within and across RCTs, to isolate mechanisms of change, and to inform the shift from diagnoses to psychopathological processes. This ambitious agenda for personalized intervention science, although challenging, could markedly alter the nature of mental health care and the benefit provided to youths and families.

AB  - Arctic-breeding geese are at record high population levels and are causing significant changes to some of their breeding and staging habitats. These changes could influence sympatric wildlife, but the nature and strength of these effects are unknown. Here, we review the interactions between geese and sympatric species and propose future research that could help to fill important knowledge gaps. We suggest that geese may be indirectly affecting other species through changes to nesting habitat, prey availability, and predator-prey interactions. Many ground-nesting Arctic birds prefer vegetated wet tundra habitats that offer concealed nest sites; areas also heavily used by breeding and staging geese. Where goose foraging exceeds the capacity of the plants to regenerate, habitats have shorter graminoids and more exposed substrate, potentially reducing the availability of concealed nest sites for other birds. Studies have documented local reductions in the abundance of these concealed-nesting species, such as shorebirds. Despite the nutrient enrichment contributed by goose feces, habitats heavily altered by geese have also been shown to host a reduced diversity and abundance of some invertebrate groups. In contrast, generalist predators show positive functional and numerical responses to the presence of breeding geese. Therefore, the risk of predation for alternative or incidental prey (e.g., lemmings or small bird nests) is likely elevated within or near breeding colonies. Studies have demonstrated a reduced abundance of small mammals in areas heavily used by geese, but it is unknown whether this is related to shared predators or habitat alteration. Sympatric wildlife could be further affected through higher stress-levels, altered body condition, or other physiological effects, but there is currently no evidence to demonstrate such impacts. Few studies have explored the potential effects of geese at larger spatial scales, but we suggest that hyperabundant geese could result in regional declines in the abundance and diversity of shorebirds and passerines. We recommend coordinated studies across multiple regions to quantify nesting habitat, arthropod communities, and predator-prey interactions in response to nearby goose colonies. To align with current multispecies approaches to conservation, adequate knowledge of the potential effects of hyperabundant goose populations on other wildlife should be a priority.

AB  - At the core of anthropomorphism lies a false positive cognitive bias to over-attribute the pattern of the human body and/or mind. Anthropomorphism is independently discussed in various disciplines, is presumed to have deep biological roots, but its cognitive bases are rarely explored in an integrative way. Conversely, I present an inclusive, multifaceted interdisciplinary approach to refine the psychological bases of mental anthropomorphism. I have integrated 13 conceptual dissections of folk finalistic reasoning into four psychological inference systems (physical, design, basic-goal, and belief stances); the latter three are truly teleological and thus prone to anthropomorphisms. I then have integrated the genetic, neural, cognitive, psychiatric, developmental, comparative and evolutionary/adaptive empirical evidence that converges to support the nature of the distinct stances. The over-reactive calibration of the three teleological systems prone to anthropomorphisms is framed as an evolved design feature to avoid harmful ancestral contexts. Nowadays, these stances easily engage with scientific reasoning about bio-evolutionary matters with both negative and positive consequences. Design, basic-goal, and belief stances benefit biology by providing cognitive foundations, expressing a high-powered explanatory system, promoting functional generalization, fostering new research questions and discoveries, enabling metaphorical/analogical thinking and explaining didactically with brevity. Hence, it is neither feasible nor advantageous to completely eliminate teleology from biology. Instead, we should engage with the eight classes of problems in bio-philosophy and bio-education that relate to the three stances: types of anthropomorphism, variety of misunderstandings, misleading appeal, legitimacy controversy, gateway to mysticism, total prohibition and its backfire effect. Recognizing the distinction among design, basic-goal, and belief stances helps to elucidate much of the logic underlying these issues, so that it enables a much more detailed taxonomy of anthropomorphisms, and organizes the various misunderstandings about evolution by natural selection. It also offers a solid psychological grounding for anchoring definitions and terminology. This tripartite framework also shed some light on how to better deal with the over-reactive stances in bio-education, by organizing previous pedagogical strategies and by suggesting new possibilities to be tested. Therefore, this framework constitutes a promising approach to advance the debate regarding the psychological underpinnings of anthropomorphisms and to further support regulating and clarifying teleology and anthropomorphism in biology.

AB  - Understanding how species respond to climate change is key to informing vulnerability assessments and designing effective conservation strategies, yet research efforts on wildlife responses to climate change fail to deliver a representative overview due to inherent biases. Bats are a species-rich, globally distributed group of organisms that are thought to be particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change because of their high surface-to-volume ratios and low reproductive rates. We systematically reviewed the literature on bat responses to climate change to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps and biases and highlight future research needs. We found that studies are geographically biased towards Europe, North America and Australia, and temperate and Mediterranean biomes, thus missing a substantial proportion of bat diversity and thermal responses. Less than half of the published studies provide concrete evidence for bat responses to climate change. For over a third of studied bat species, response evidence is only based on predictive species distribution models. Consequently, the most frequently reported responses involve range shifts (57% of species) and changes in patterns of species diversity (26%). Bats showed a variety of responses, including both positive (e.g. range expansion and population increase) and negative responses (range contraction and population decrease), although responses to extreme events were always negative or neutral. Spatial responses varied in their outcome and across families, with almost all taxonomic groups featuring both range expansions and contractions, while demographic responses were strongly biased towards negative outcomes, particularly among Pteropodidae and Molossidae. The commonly used correlative modelling approaches can be applied to many species, but do not provide mechanistic insight into behavioural, physiological, phenological or genetic responses. There was a paucity of experimental studies (26%), and only a small proportion of the 396 bat species covered in the examined studies were studied using long-term and/or experimental approaches (11%), even though they are more informative about the effects of climate change. We emphasise the need for more empirical studies to unravel the multifaceted nature of bats' responses to climate change and the need for standardised study designs that will enable synthesis and meta-analysis of the literature. Finally, we stress the importance of overcoming geographic and taxonomic disparities through strengthening research capacity in the Global South to provide a more comprehensive view of terrestrial biodiversity responses to climate change.

AB  - Voice hearing (VH) can occur in trauma spectrum disorders (TSD) such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative disorders. However, previous estimates of VH among individuals with TSD vary widely. In this study, we sought to better characterize the rate and phenomenology of VH in a sample of 70 women with TSD related to childhood abuse who were receiving care in a specialized trauma program. We compared the rate of VH within our sample using two different measures: 1) the auditory hallucination (AH) item in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID), and 2) the thirteen questions involving VH in the Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation (MID), a self-report questionnaire that comprehensively assesses pathological dissociation. We found that 45.7% of our sample met threshold for SCID AH, while 91.4% met criteria for MID VH. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses showed that while SCID AH and MID VH items have greater than chance agreement, the strength of agreement is only moderate, suggesting that SCID and MID VH items measure related but not identical constructs. Thirty-two patients met criteria for both SCID AH and at least one MID VH item ("unequivocal VH"), 32 for at least one MID VH item but not SCID AH ("ambiguous VH"), and 6 met criteria for neither ("unequivocal non-VH"). Relative to the ambiguous VH group, the unequivocal VH group had higher dissociation scores for child voices, and higher mean frequencies for child voices and Schneiderian voices. Our findings suggest that VH in women with TSD related to childhood abuse is common, but that the rate of VH depends on how the question is asked. We review prior studies examining AH and/or VH in TSD, focusing on the measures used to ascertain these experiences, and conclude that our two estimates are consistent with previous studies that used comparable instruments and patient samples. Our results add to growing evidence that VH-an experience typically considered psychotic or psychotic-like-is not equivalent to having a psychotic disorder. Instruments that assess VH apart from psychotic disorders and that capture their multidimensional nature may improve identification of VH, especially among patients with non-psychotic disorders.

AB  - Hierarchy theory recognises that ecological and evolutionary units occur in a nested and interconnected hierarchical system, with cascading effects occurring between hierarchical levels. Different biological disciplines have routinely come into conflict over the primacy of different forcing mechanisms behind evolutionary and ecological change. These disconnects arise partly from differences in perspective (with some researchers favouring ecological forcing mechanisms while others favour developmental/historical mechanisms), as well as differences in the temporal framework in which workers operate. In particular, long-term palaeontological data often show that large-scale (macro) patterns of evolution are predominantly dictated by shifts in the abiotic environment, while short-term (micro) modern biological studies stress the importance of biotic interactions. We propose that thinking about ecological and evolutionary interactions in a hierarchical framework is a fruitful way to resolve these conflicts. Hierarchy theory suggests that changes occurring at lower hierarchical levels can have unexpected, complex effects at higher scales due to emergent interactions between simple systems. In this way, patterns occurring on short- and long-term time scales are equally valid, as changes that are driven from lower levels will manifest in different forms at higher levels. We propose that the dual hierarchy framework fits well with our current understanding of evolutionary and ecological theory. Furthermore, we describe how this framework can be used to understand major extinction events better. Multi-generational attritional loss of reproductive fitness (MALF) has recently been proposed as the primary mechanism behind extinction events, whereby extinction is explainable solely through processes that result in extirpation of populations through a shutdown of reproduction. While not necessarily explicit, the push to explain extinction through solely population-level dynamics could be used to suggest that environmentally mediated patterns of extinction or slowed speciation across geological time are largely artefacts of poor preservation or a coarse temporal scale. We demonstrate how MALF fits into a hierarchical framework, showing that MALF can be a primary forcing mechanism at lower scales that still results in differential survivorship patterns at the species and clade level which vary depending upon the initial environmental forcing mechanism. Thus, even if MALF is the primary mechanism of extinction across all mass extinction events, the primary environmental cause of these events will still affect the system and result in differential responses. Therefore, patterns at both temporal scales are relevant.

AB  - Eastern Sierra Nevada populations of the willow beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis commonly experience stressfully high and low environmental temperatures that may influence survival and reproduction. Allele frequencies at the enzyme locus phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) vary across a climatic latitudinal gradient in these populations, with PGI allele 1 being most common in cooler regions and PGI allele 4 in warmer ones. PGI genotypes differ in heat and cold tolerance and in expression of a 70 kDa heat shock protein. Here we examine genetic, behavioral and environmental factors affecting a performance character, running speed, for willow beetles, and assess effects of consecutive cold and heat exposure on running speed and expression of Hsp70 in the laboratory. In nature, running speed depends on air temperature and is higher for males than females. Mating beetles ran faster than single beetles, and differences among PGI genotypes in male running speed depended on the presence of females. In the laboratory, exposure to cold reduced subsequent running speed, but the amount of this reduction depended on PGI genotype and previous thermal history. Effects of exposure to heat also depended on life history stage and PGI genotype. Adults possessing allele 1 ran fastest after a single exposure to stressful temperature, whereas those possessing allele 4 ran faster after repeated exposure. Larvae possessing allele 4 ran fastest after a single stressful exposure, but running speed generally declined after a second exposure to stressful temperature. The ranking of PGI genotypes after the second exposure depended on whether a larva had been exposed to cold or heat. Effects of temperature on Hsp70 expression also varied among PGI genotypes and depended on type of exposure, especially for adults (single heat exposure, two cold exposures: PGI 1-1 > 1-4 > 4-4; other multiple extreme exposures: 4-4 > 1-4 > 1-1). There was no consistent association between alleles at other polymorphic enzyme loci and running speed or Hsp70 expression. These data suggest that variation at PGI is associated with considerable plasticity in running speed. Differences in Hsp70 expression among PGI genotypes suggest that the heat-shock response may buffer differences in thermal tolerance and performance among genotypes and help maintain the PGI polymorphism in a thermally variable environment.

AB  - Background Khat use is a widely spreading public health problem affecting the most economically productive population areas in Ethiopia. Khat use among students has been linked with mental, physical, social, and psychological problems. Reliable prevalence has not been recognized because of varying published rates. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to synthesize evidence on the prevalence and potential risk factors of khat use in Ethiopia. Methods We found 284 studies of which 266 were removed due to duplication, irrelevant topics, and other reasons, respectively. All studies conducted in Ethiopia on khat chewing among students irrespective of time frame were included. Subsequently, 18 studies were used for synthesis of prevalence. Figures were extracted from published reports, and any lost information was requested from investigators. The quality of the included literature was evaluated by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Prevalence was pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. The presence of association was declared using P-values and an odds ratio with a corresponding 95% CI. Results The pooled prevalence of khat use among students was 16.7% (13.7-19.7%). In the subgroup analysis, the highest prevalence was observed in the Oromia region, at 21.1% (15.5%, 26.7%), and an almost equal prevalence of 14.8% (10.6, 18.9) and 14.3% (10.3, 18.3) was observed in Amhara and the Southern Nation, Nationalities, and People's Region of Ethiopia, respectively. Being male (OR: 2.43 (1.73, 3.13)), being a Muslim religion follower (OR: 2.22 (1.6, 2.8)), being an alcohol user (OR: 2.3 (1.5, 3.0)), khat use by a family member (OR: 1.8 (1.4, 2.2)), peer pressure (OR: 4.4 (3.1, 5.6)), and being a cigarette smoker (OR: 8.5 (5.3, 11.7)) were found to be risk factors for khat chewing. Conclusions Khat use is a common problem among students. Health promotion, awareness on effect of khat, set policy on khat and substance use on the male sex, Muslim religion, alcohol user, having a family-member khat user, peer pressure, and being a cigarette smoker as possible risk factors for khat use among students. Limitations Irrespective of time restriction, all studies conducted in Ethiopia are included and cross-sectional in nature. Protocol no. CRD-42017081886.

AB  - To investigate the neural substrate of information processing, the within group inter-individual behavioral differences were related to the fine variations in some components of the architecture of the intact hippocampus by multivariate analyses of variance and correlative analyses. For, the extent of the intra/infrapyramidal mossy fibers, covering the hippocampal CA3-regio inferior (IIP-MF, revealed by Timm-staining), and the individual high-affinity maximal glucocorticoid receptor binding (HCB, measured by in vitro cytosol preparations with [H-3]corticosterone as ligand), were assessed in adult male albino rats of the Naples High-Excitability (NHE) and Naples Low-Excitability (NLE) psychogenctically selected lines, and of a Sprague-Dawley random-bred stock (NRB) as unselected controls. The IIP-MF and the HCB were assumed as hippocampal hardware and software traits, respectively, and entered in a matrix with activity and defecation scores in a Lat-maze as behavioral covariates. Two dimensions were identified by discriminant function analyses tentatively labelled as ''spatial'' and ''non-spatial'' by the nature of the variables contributing with a high loading to the dimension. The IIP-MF and HCB contributed mostly to spatial processes and to a lower extent to emotional processes. The neuro-behavioral covariations of IIP-MF with arousal (A) and long-term habituation (LTH), computed by correlative analyses on the overall population (all rats combined), turned out to be of inverted-U type (quadratic function), i.e. positive in NLE, negative in NHE with no correlation in NRB. For HCB receptors, the covariations were quadratic with A, and of the S-type (cubic function), i.e. positive in NLE, negative in NRB and positive in NHE with LTH. Since these rat lines are located along a ''continuum'' with NLE < NRB < NHE, they are assumed to represent entirely this subpopulation. For, the non-linear neuro-behavioral relationships might reveal (i) constraints on the expression of arousal and habituation to novelty; and (ii) that the hippocampus appears to be one such device exerting a modulatory role in the processing of ''spatial'' and ''non-spatial'' behavioral components.

AB  - This narrative overview summarises the work on exercise addiction (EA) over the past 12 years and exposes critical conceptual and methodological issues. More than 1000 articles exist on EA, conceptualised as uncontrolled training harming the individual. Still, EA has no clinical diagnosis criteria at this time. Research is increasing continuously, but it is stale in advancing knowledge. Scalar measurement and lack of differentiation between addictive and instrumental exercise could be reasons for insufficient progress. Exercise addiction fits in the framework of behavioural addictions, but excessive exercise patterns also co-occur with other morbidities, including eating or body-image disorders. In these cases, exercise is instrumental; it functions to achieve a non-exercise-related goal. Therefore, it is essential to separate primary from secondary EA. Based on the interactional model, significant stress and capacity-exceeding ambitions fuel primary EA, while chief motives behind secondary EA embed body image dissatisfaction and eating disorders. Few reports exist on EA's brain mechanisms, which could delay its classification as a distinct psychiatric dysfunction. Treatment of EA involves cognitive-behavioural approaches, but we know little about their effectiveness. Conceptually focussed psychophysiological research and in-depth interviews, complementing scalar data, could answer several open questions in this widely studied but relatively stagnant scholastic field.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to quantitatively summarize evidence on the association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moreover, a register-based sibling study was conducted to simultaneously control for confounding factors. A systematic search identified four eligible observational studies (N = 5738,287). The meta-analysis showed that individuals with ADHD have a more than doubled risk of T2D when considering adjusted estimates (OR=2.29 [1.48-3.55], d=0.46). Results from the register-based Swedish data showed a significant association between ADHD and T2D (HR=2.35 [2.14-2.58]), with substance use disorder, depression, and anxiety being the main drivers of the association, and cardiovascular and familiar risk playing a smaller role. While results from the meta-analysis provide evidence for an increased risk of T2D in individuals with ADHD, the register-based analyses show that the association between ADHD and T2D is largely explained by psychiatric comorbidities. Pending further evidence of causal association, our findings suggest that early identification and treatment of ADHD comorbidities might greatly reduce the risk of developing T2D in individuals with ADHD.

AB  - Background. Armed conflicts continue to threaten a vast number of children across the world, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Evidence-based interventions are vital to adequately address the mental health needs in these groups.Objective. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive update of the most current developments in mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) interventions for children affected by armed conflict in LMICs, since 2016. Such an update may be useful in determining where the current focus of interventions lies and whether there are changes in types of interventions that are commonly implemented.Methods. The main medical, psychological and social sciences databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline) were searched to identify interventions aimed at improving or treating mental health problems in conflict-affected children in LMICs. For the period 2016-2022, a total of 1243 records were identified. Twenty-three articles met the inclusion criteria. A bio-ecological lens was used to organize the interventions and the presentation of findings.Results. Seventeen forms of MHPSS interventions with a wide range of treatment modalities were identified in this review. The reviewed articles focused mainly on family-based interventions. Very few studies empirically evaluated community-level interventions.Conclusion. Current focus of interventions is family-based; the addition of caregiver wellbeing and parenting skills components had the potential to enhance the effects of interventions designed to improve children's mental health. Future trials for MHPSS interventions need to give more attention to community-level interventions. Community-level supports such as person-to-person support, solidarity groups, and dialogue groups stand to reach large numbers of children and families.

AB  - The Emergency Recovery Plan for freshwater biodiversity recognizes that addressing nonnative species is one of six principal actions needed to bend the curve in freshwater biodiversity loss. This is because introduction rates of nonnative species continue to accelerate globally and where these species develop invasive populations, they can have severe impacts on freshwater biodiversity. The most effective management measure to protect freshwater biodiversity is to prevent introductions of nonnative species. Should a nonnative species be introduced, however, then its early detection and the implementation of rapid reaction measures can avoid it establishing and dispersing. If these measures are unsuccessful and the species becomes invasive, then control and containment measures can minimize its further spread and impact. Minimizing further spread and impact includes control methods to reduce invader abundance and containment methods such as screening of invaded sites and strict biosecurity to avoid the invader dispersing to neighbouring basins. These management actions have benefitted from developments in invasion risk assessment that can prioritize species according to their invasion risk and, for species already invasive, ensure that management actions are commensurate with assessed risk. The successful management of freshwater nonnative species still requires the overcoming of some implementation challenges, including nonnative species often being a symptom of degraded habitats rather than the main driver of ecological change, and eradication methods often being non species specific. Given the multiple anthropogenic stressors in freshwaters, nonnative species management must work with other restoration strategies if it is to deliver the Emergency Recovery Plan for freshwater biodiversity.

AB  - Objective: In this review, we examined if there is a deficit in facial recognition of emotion (FER) in children, adolescents, and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Background: Emotional regulation is impaired in ADHD. Although a facial emotion recognition deficit has been described in this condition, the underlying causal mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: The search was performed in six databases in September 2022. Studies assessing children, adolescents, or adults with isolated or comorbid ADHD that evaluated participants using a FER task were included. Results: Twelve studies out of 385 were selected, with participants ranging in age from 6 to 37.1 years. A deficit in FER specific to ADHD, or secondary to comorbid autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and oppositional symptoms, was found. Conclusions: There is a FER deficit in patients with ADHD. Adults showed improved recognition accuracy, reflecting partial compensation. ADHD symptoms and comorbidities appear to influence FER deficits.

AB  - IntroductionEating disorders (EDs) have long been considered conditions exclusively affecting women, and studies in the ED field regularly exclude men. Research efforts are needed to better understand the role of gender and sex in EDs. This review describes the role of gender and sex in the development of EDs from a biopsychosocial perspective. MethodsThe primary hypothesis of this narrative review is that gender and sex interact to influence ED risk. The literature review was conducted using the PubMed database. ResultsThis review first presents the general characteristics and prevalence of EDs according to gender and sex. Next, neurodevelopmental processes, neurobiology, gender roles, body image, and the minority stress model are addressed. Lastly, research perspectives to better include gender and sex in the field of EDs are discussed (e.g., representation of gender and sex diversities, development of appropriate assessment tools, and increasing awareness). ConclusionAlthough substantial knowledge gaps remain, there is a growing recognition of the importance of integrating gender and sex in ED research that holds promise for further development in the field.

DesignSystematic review of the literature. Data sourcesElectronic searches were performed in two databases, unrestricted by year, with previously set method and criteria. Search, inclusion and data extraction were performed by two blind authors. ResultsTwenty articles were included, amounting to 31 cases of SCs-ethanol co-consumption. The impairment of psychomotor functions varied widely between studies, ranging from no reported disabilities to severe unconsciousness. Overall, a dose-effect relationship could not be observed. ConclusionDespite the biases and limitations of the literature studies, it seems likely that the co-consumption poses an increased risk for driving. The drugs might exert a synergistic effect on the central nervous system depression, as well as on aggressiveness and mood alterations. However, more research is needed on the topic.

AB  - Objective The primary objective of this article was to systematically review the prevalence of somatic symptoms in patients, healthcare workers and general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objectives were to record the association between somatic symptoms and indices of mental distress and to record the qualitative characteristics of such somatic complaints. Methods Following the PRISMA methodology we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar for primary research reporting on somatic symptoms in association with mental distress. We specifically sought papers reporting on bodily distress disorder, somatic symptoms disorder or medically unexplained symptoms. Results 1569 papers were retrieved, which yielded 36 relevant studies after screening. 15 studies referred to healthcare workers, 13 to general population, 5 to COVID-19 patients, 2 compared medical with non-medical professionals and 1 was studying COVID-19 patients some of which were also healthcare workers. The reported prevalence of somatic symptoms ranged from 7.4% to 67.8%. Commonly seen symptoms were shortness of breath, dyspnea, palpitations and pain in arms, legs and joints. Conclusions Our systematic review suggests that somatic symptoms are very frequent during the pandemic and are often linked to mental distress. All three population groups are affected.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results when external physical forces impact the head with sufficient intensity to cause damage to the brain. TBI can be mild, moderate, or severe and may have long-term consequences including visual difficulties, cognitive deficits, headache, pain, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic epilepsy. Disruption of the normal functioning of the brain leads to a cascade of effects with molecular and anatomical changes, persistent neuronal hyperexcitation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. Destructive processes that occur at the cellular and molecular level lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, calcium dysregulation, and apoptosis. Vascular damage, ischemia and loss of blood brain barrier integrity contribute to destruction of brain tissue. This review focuses on the cellular damage incited during TBI and the frequently life-altering lasting effects of this destruction on vision, cognition, balance, and sleep. The wide range of visual complaints associated with TBI are addressed and repair processes where there is potential for intervention and neuronal preservation are highlighted.

AB  - Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has been a leading cause of stress and feelings of loss of control, both of which have been related to eating disorder (ED) pathology onset and deterioration. We aim to estimate the magnitude of changes in the prevalence rates of, and indicators for, ED psychopathology in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Pre-registered systematic review with frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses. Searches for eligible studies were performed in PubMed, Web of Science and pre-print servers until January 15 2023. Results Our searches yielded 46 eligible studies reporting on a total of 4,688,559 subjects. These data provide strong evidence indicating increased rates of diagnosed and self-reported ED's and a concordant increased need for care in the face of the pandemic. ED symptom severity scores in patients were not elevated during the pandemic, except for those related to anorexia nervosa. On average, people in the general population report relatively high levels of emotional and binge eating during the pandemic, although the evidential strength for these associations is only anecdotal to moderate. Moderators of between-study heterogeneity were not detected. Conclusions Altogether, our results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a wide spread negative effect on ED pathology in patient samples and the general population. The development of online prevention and intervention programs for EDs during stressful times like a pandemic is encouraged. A limitation is that the results reported here may be prone to biases, amongst others, self-report bias.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms such as re-experiencing of the psychotrauma and hyperarousal. Although current literature mainly discusses the emotionally related aspects of these symptoms, studies also highlight the relation between re-experiencing, hyperarousability, and attention deficits, which are associated with poorer daily function and reduced quality of life. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing research on attention deficits among adults with PTSD. A systematic search through five databases resulted in the inclusion of 48 peer-reviewed, English-language articles, describing 49 distinct studies. Using a total of 47 different attentional assessment tools, the majority of studies investigated sustained (n = 40), divided (n = 16), or selective (n = 14) attention. A total of 30 studies (61.2%) found significant correlations between PTSD symptoms and attention deficits, and 10 studies (20.4%) found that higher levels of attention deficits were predictive of worse PTSD symptoms. Moreover, neuroimaging results of six (f)MRI and three EEG studies identified various potential neurobiological pathways involved, including (pre)frontal attention networks. Together, the body of research shows that attention deficits in individuals with PTSD are common and occur in surroundings with emotionally neutral stimuli. Nonetheless, current treatment strategies do not target these attentional difficulties. We propose a novel perspective to PTSD diagnosis and treatment strategies based on attention deficits and their relation with top-down regulation of re-experiencing and subsequent other PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Background: The extraordinarily high prevalence of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), coupled with its high economic burden to both healthcare systems and society, underscore how critical it is that resources are managed optimally to address the significant challenge it presents.: Objective: To review the literature on economic evaluation in TRD systematically, with the aim of informing future studies by identifying key challenges specific to the area, and highlighting good practices.Methods: A systematic literature search across seven electronic databases was conducted to identify both within-trial and model-based economic evaluations in TRD. Quality of reporting and study design was assessed using the Consensus Health Economic Criteria (CHEC). A narrative synthesis was conducted.Results: We identified 31 evaluations, including 11 conducted alongside a clinical trial and 20 model-based evaluations. There was considerable heterogeneity in the definition of treatment-resistant depression, although with a trend for more recent studies to use a definition of inadequate response to two or more antidepressive treatments. A broad range of interventions were considered, including non-pharmacological neuromodulation, pharmacological, psychological, and service-level interventions. Study quality as assessed by CHEC was generally high. Frequently poorly reported items related to discussion of ethical and distributional issues, and model validation. Most evaluations considered comparable core clinical outcomes - encompassing remission, response, and relapse. There was good agreement on the definitions and thresholds for these outcomes, and a relatively small pool of outcome measures were used. Resource criteria used to inform the estimation of direct costs, were reasonably uniform. Predominantly, however, there was a high level of heterogeneity in terms of evaluation design and sophistication, quality of evidence used (particularly health state utility data), time horizon, population considered, and cost perspective.Conclusion: Economic evidence for interventions in TRD is underdeveloped, particularly so for service-level interventions. Where evidence does exist, it is hampered by inconsistency in study design, methodological quality, and availability of high quality long-term outcomes evidence. This review identifies a number of key considerations and challenges for the design of future economic evaluations. Recommendations for research and suggestions for good practice are made.

AB  - ObjectivePrevious studies have demonstrated an association between anxiety and metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the association is still controversial. This updated meta-analysis aimed to reanalyze the association between anxiety and MetS. MethodsWe comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for all related studies published before January 23, 2023. Observational studies that informed effect size with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between anxiety and MetS were included. According to heterogeneity between studies, fixed or random effects models were applied to calculate the pooled effect size. Publication bias was examined by funnel plots. ResultsThe research included 24 cross-sectional studies: 20 studies used MetS as the dependent variable with a pooled OR of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.01-1.13) and four studies used anxiety as the dependent variable with a pooled OR of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.07-1.23). Three cohort studies were found: two studies detected the association of baseline anxiety with the risk of MetS, one of the studies demonstrated a significant association, but a similar result was not found in another study; one study showed no significant association between baseline MetS and the risk of anxiety. ConclusionCross-sectional studies indicated an association between anxiety and MetS. The results from cohort studies are still inconsistent and limited. More large-scale prospective studies are needed to further reveal the causal relationship of anxiety with MetS.

AB  - Autistic people often have an atypical profile of abilities: while excelling in some structured paradigms, many report difficulties with making real-life decisions. To test whether decision-making in autism is different from in typically developing controls, we reviewed 104 studies that compared decision-making performance between autistic and comparison participants (N = 2712 autistic and N = 3189 comparison participants) between 1998 and 2022. Our searches revealed four main decision-making paradigms that are widely used in the field of decision neuroscience: perceptual discrimination, reward learning, metacognition and value-based decision-making paradigm. Our synthesis highlights that perceptual processing and reward learning were similar between autistic and comparison participants, whereas value-based decision-making and metacognitive accuracy were often different between groups. Furthermore, decision-making differences were most pronounced when the autistic participant was explicitly probed to report on an internal belief, while implicit markers of the same decision (e.g. error-related response times) were usually not different. Our findings provide evidence in favour of a metacognitive explanation of decision-making atypicalities in autism. Lay summary Many autistic people report difficulties with real-life decision-making. However, when doing decision-making tests in laboratory experiments, autistic people often perform as well or better than non-autistic people. We review previously published studies on autistic people's decision-making, across different types of tests, to understand what type of decision-making is more challenging. To do this, we searched four databases of research papers. We found 104 studies that tested, in total, 2712 autistic and 3189 comparison participants on different decision-making tasks. We found that there were four categories of decision-making tests that were used in these experiments: perceptual (e.g. deciding which image has the most dots); reward learning (e.g. learning which deck of cards gives the best reward); metacognition (e.g. knowing how well you perform or what you want); and value-based (e.g. making a decision based on a choice between two outcomes that differ in value to you). Overall, these studies suggest that autistic and comparison participants tend to perform similarly well at perceptual and reward-learning decisions. However, autistic participants tended to decide differently from comparison participants on metacognition and value-based paradigms. This suggests that autistic people might differ from typically developing controls in how they evaluate their own performance and in how they make decisions based on weighing up the subjective value of two different options. We suggest these reflect more general differences in metacognition, thinking about thinking, in autism.

AB  - Since the mid-20th century, Western societies have considered productivity and economic outcomes are more important than focusing on people's health and wellbeing. This focus has created lifestyles with high stress levels, associated with overconsumption of unhealthy foods and little exercise, which negatively affect people's lives, and subsequently lead to the development of pathologies, including neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Prioritizing a healthy lifestyle to maintain wellbeing may slow the onset or reduce the severity of pathologies. It is a win-win for everyone; for societies and for individuals. A balanced lifestyle is increasingly being adopted globally, with many doctors encouraging meditation and prescribing non-pharmaceutical interventions to treat depression. In psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, the inflammatory response system of the brain (neuroinflammation) is activated. Many risks factors are now known to be linked to neuroinflammation such as stress, pollution, and a high saturated and trans fat diet. On the other hand, many studies have linked healthy habits and anti-inflammatory products with lower levels of neuroinflammation and a reduced risk of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Sharing risk and protective factors is critical so that individuals can make informed choices that promote positive aging throughout their lifespan. Most strategies to manage neurodegenerative diseases are palliative because neurodegeneration has been progressing silently for decades before symptoms appear. Here, we focus on preventing neurodegenerative diseases by adopting an integrated "healthy" lifestyle approach. This review summarizes the role of neuroinflammation on risk and protective factors of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Objectives:To summarize reports describing implementation and evaluation of Web-based psychosocial interventions for disaster-related distress with suggestions for future intervention and research, and to determine whether a systematic literature review on the topic is warranted. Methods:Systematic searches of Embase, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE were conducted. Duplicate entries were removed. Two rounds of inclusion/exclusion were conducted (abstract and full-text review). Relevant data were systematically charted by 2 reviewers. Results:The initial search identified 112 reports. Six reports, describing and evaluating 5 interventions, were included in a data analysis. Four of the 5 interventions were asynchronous and self-guided modular programs, with interactive components. The fifth was a short-term, online supportive group intervention. Studies utilized a variety of evaluation methods, and only 1 of 14 outcome measures used across the studies was utilized in more than 1 project. Conclusions:Several Web-based psychosocial interventions have been developed to target disaster-related distress, but few programs have been formally evaluated. A systematic review of the topic would not be recommended at this time due to heterogeneity in reported studies. Further research on factors impacting participation, generalizability, and methods of program delivery with consistent outcome measures is needed.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study uses a systematic review with bibliometric analysis methods to investigate the characteristics of the most cited research papers in the field of nursing fatigue and pregnancy.MethodsIn the Web of Science (WoS) database. We used the keywords "fatigue" and "pregnancy" to search for articles published from 2000 to 2020, limited to SSCI and Science Citation Index (SCI) journal-type articles. This study identifies the most cited studies in the WoS database based on PRISMA guidelines (Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses). These studies form the research data, then visualized and analyzed using a retrospective bibliometric analysis and VOSviewer.ResultsThe studies in the dataset were analyzed in 319 different journals in 51 countries between 2000 and 2020. The study was found that the United States (US) was the country with the highest yield. The most frequent keywords were postpartum, depression, sleep, and postpartum depression.ConclusionThe research results further laid the foundation of bibliometrics for scholars and identified researchers, scientific journals, countries, and hot topics for fatigue-related pregnancy literature. Journals with high impact factors contain the most cited research and open new horizons for research in the nursing field of pregnancy-related fatigue, thus providing research inspiration for investigators in this field.

AB  - Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing may increase the probability of remission and response in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) undergoing pharmacotherapy. Given the potential implications of these outcomes and recent proliferation of PGx studies, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of PGx testing on clinical outcomes in patients with MDD as compared to treatment as usual (TAU). MEDLINE, Embase, Psy-cInfo, and CENTRAL were searched for English-language articles from 2000 to 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PGx-guided treatment vs. TAU in patients with MDD. Meta-analyses were conducted in R. Ten RCTs were included: eight reported remission and seven reported response. The best available evidence suggests that PGx-guided care for moderate-to-severe adult depression is more likely to result in remission and response than TAU (both risk ratios significant). However, there are limitations in the evidence base, including high risk of bias and inconsistency between trials. Despite the consequent very low certainty in the magnitude of effect, there is confidence in the direction. Though modest, the beneficial effects of PGx for adults with moderate-severe MDD could - as a result of the scope and scale of the condition and its impacts - have important rami-fications for patients and the health system.

AB  - Suicide is defined as the action of harming oneself with the intention of dying. It is estimated that worldwide, one person dies by suicide every 40 s, making it a major health problem. Studies in families have suggested that suicide has a genetic component, so the search for genetic variants associated with suicidal behavior could be useful as potential biomarkers to identify people at risk of suicide. In Mexico, some studies of gene variants related to neurotransmission and other important pathways have been carried out and potential association of variants located in the following genes has been suggested: SLC6A4, SAT-1, TPH-2, ANKK1, GSHR, SCARA50, RGS10, STK33, COMT, and FKBP5. This systematic review shows the genetic studies conducted on the Mexican population. This article contributes by compiling the existing information on genetic variants and genes associated with suicidal behavior, in the future could be used as potential biomarkers to identify people at risk of suicide.

AB  - Cognitive performance is usually impaired in those with serious mental illness (SMI). Exercise may improve cognitive functioning, but studies examining the effects of exercise in SMI indicate heterogenous findings. To estimate the effects of exercise on cognitive outcomes in people with SMI. Randomized controlled trials evalu-ating the acute or chronic effects of exercise on cognitive functioning in SMI were searched from inception to December 26th, 2022 on major electronic databases. Random effect meta-analyses were conducted to assess the effects of exercise on over the cognitive domains and Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as the effect size measure. Funnel plots and Egger's test of effect size and the Trim and Fill procedure applied if evidence of publication bias was noted. Methodological quality was assessed using RoB 2. A total of 15 chronic (1 acute), 936 participants (46.7% women). Exercise showed large effects on reasoning and problem solving; small effects on executive functioning. Per diagnosis, exercise showed moderate positive effects on executive functioning and large effects on processing speed in people with depression; large effects on reasoning and problem solving in people with schizophrenia. The present study indicates a large beneficial effect of chronic physical exercise on reasoning and problem solving and small effects on executive functioning in people with SMI.

AB  - PurposeTo examine the effectiveness of ACT on weight (body mass index and body mass), eating behaviours (binge eating, emotional eating, external eating and restraint eating), and psychological outcomes (quality of life [QoL], depression, psychological flexibility, and weight stigma) among adults with overweight and obesity.MethodsSeven electronic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycInfo Scopus, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched from inception through 17 June 2022. 13 studies and 48 unique effect sizes were analyzed using random-effects models. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using weighted mean differences (WMD) and standardized mean differences expressed in Hedges' g (g). Heterogeneity was assessed using Q-statistics and interpreted using I-2.ResultsACT was found to be effective in improving weight loss in terms of BMI (k = 6, WMD = - .50, 95% CI = - .90; - .11, t = - 3.25, p = .20, I-2 = .0%), psychological flexibility and weight-related stigma. However, non-significant changes were found for body mass (k = 4, WMD = - 0.33 95% CI = - 1.53; 0.87, t = - .88, p = .44, I-2 = .0%), binge eating (k = 4, g = - .34, 95% CI = - 1.31; 0.62, t = - 1.13, p = .34, I-2 = 71.1%), emotional eating (k = 6, g = - .20, 95% CI = - 0.54; 0.15, t = - 1.47, p = .20, I-2 = 45.0%), external eating (k = 5, g = - .40, 95% CI = 0.96; 0.16, t = - 1.99, p = .12, I-2 = 81.8%), restraint eating (k = 3, g = .22 95% CI = - 0.57; 1.01, t = 1.19, p = .36, I-2 = 69.1%), QoL (k = 3, g = .01, 95% CI = - 1.51; 1.52, t = .02, p = .99, I-2 = 90.2%) and depression (k = 3, g = - .55, 95% CI = - 1.78; 0.67, t = - 1.94, p = .19, I-2 = 79.9%).ConclusionACT could be effective in improving weight loss but more studies are needed to ascertain its effectiveness and the underlying mechanism by which the various components influence weight-related outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Many psychiatric illnesses have been linked to the gut microbiome, with supplements such as probiotics showing some efficacy in alleviating the symptoms of some psychiatric illnesses. The aim of this review is to evaluate the current literature investigating the effects of adjuvant probiotic or synbiotic administration in combination with first-line treatments for psychiatric illnesses.Method: A systematic search of four databases was conducted using key terms related to treatments for psychiatric illnesses, the gut microbiome, and probiotics. All results were then evaluated based on specific eligibility criteria.Results: Eight studies met eligibility criteria and were analyzed for reported changes in outcome measures used to assess the symptoms of psychiatric illness and the tolerability of treatment. All Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (n = 5) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) (n = 1) studies found adjuvant probiotic or synbiotic treatment to be more efficacious in improving the symptoms of psychiatric illness than the first-line treatment alone or with placebo. The schizophrenia studies (n = 2) found adjuvant probiotic treatment to have no significant difference in clinical outcomes, but it was found to improve the tolerability of first-line antipsychotics.Discussion and conclusion: The findings of the studies included in this review suggest the use of adjuvant probiotic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for MDD and GAD to be superior to SSRI treatment alone. Probiotic adjuvant treatment with antipsychotics could be beneficial for improving the tolerability of the antipsychotics, but these findings do not suggest that adjuvant probiotic treatment would result in improved clinical outcomes for symptoms of schizophrenia.

AB  - Much of the research on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been conducted in high-income countries (HICs). However, PTSD and AUD commonly co-occur (PTSD + AUD) are both associated with high global burden of disease, and disproportionately impact those in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This narrative review attempts to synthesize the research on prevalence, impact, etiological models, and treatment of PTSD + AUD drawing from research conducted in HICs and discussing the research that has been conducted to date in LMICs. The review also discusses overall limitations in the field, including a lack of research on PTSD + AUD outside of HICs, issues with measurement of key constructs, and limitations in sampling strategies across comorbidity studies. Future directions are discussed, including a need for rigorous research studies conducted in LMICs that focus on both etiological mechanisms and on treatment approaches.

AB  - Computational psychiatry recently established itself as a new tool in the study of mental disorders and problems. Integration of different levels of analysis is creating computational phenotypes with clinical and research values, and constructing a way to arrive at precision psychiatry are part of this new branch. It conceptualizes the brain as a computational organ that receives from the environment parameters to respond to challenges through calculations and algorithms in continuous feedback and feedforward loops with a permanent degree of uncertainty. Through this conception, one can seize an understanding of the cerebral and mental processes in the form of theories or hypotheses based on data. Using these approximations, a better understanding of the disorder and its different determinant factors facilitates the diagnostics and treatment by having an individual, ecologic, and holistic approach. It is a tool that can be used to homologate and integrate multiple sources of information given by several theoretical models. In conclusion, it helps psychiatry achieve precision and reproducibility, which can help the mental health field achieve significant advancement. This article is a narrative review of the basis of the functioning of computational psychiatry with a critical analysis of its concepts.
